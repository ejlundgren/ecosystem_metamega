AB  - The herbicide "Roundup" is used extensively in agriculture to control weeds. However, by translocation, it can be deposited in plants, their proceeds, and the soil, thus provoking organ toxicities in exposed individuals. Neurotoxicity among others is one of the side effects of roundup which has led to an increasing global concern about the contamination of food by herbicides. Xylopia aethiopica is known to have medicinal properties due to its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, and it is hypothesized to neutralize roundup-induced neurotoxicity. Thirty-six (36) Wistar rats were used for this study. The animals were shared equally into six groups with six rats each. Glyphosate administration to three of the six groups was done orally and for 1 week. Either Xylopia aethiopica or vitamin C was co-administered to two of the three groups and also administered to two other groups and the final group served as the control. Our studies demonstrated that glyphosate administration led to a significant decrease in antioxidants such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase. We also observed a significant increase in inflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, and immunohistochemical expression of caspase-3, cox-2, and p53 proteins (p < 0.05). However, Xylopia aethiopica co-administration with glyphosate was able to ameliorate the aforementioned changes when compared to the control (p < 0.05). Degenerative changes were also observed in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex upon glyphosate administration. These changes were not observed in the groups treated with Xylopia aethiopica and vitamin C. Taken together, Xylopia aethiopica could possess anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties that could be used in combating glyphosate neurotoxicity.

AB  - Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurring, unprovoked seizures, asymmetrical electroencephalogram patterns, and other pathological abnormalities. The hippocampus plays a pivotal role in learning, memory consolidation, attentional control, and pattern separation. Impairment of hippocampal network circuitry can induce long-term cognitive and memory dysfunction. In this review, we discuss how aberrant adult neurogenesis and plasticity collectively alter the network balance for information processing within the hippocampal neural network. Subsequently, we explore the potential of human brain organoids integrated into microelectrode array technology as an electrophysiological tool. We also discuss the utilization of a closed-loop platform that connects the brain organoid to a mobile robot in a virtual environment. While in vivo models provide valuable insights into some aspects of epileptogenesis, such as the impact of adult neurogenesis on hippocampal function, brain organoids are indispensable for comprehensively studying epileptogenesis involving genetic mutations that underlie human epilepsy. More importantly, a combinational approach using brain organoids on MEA paves the way for studying impaired plasticity and abnormal information processing within epileptic neural networks. This innovative in vitro approach may provide a new pathway for investigating the behavioral outcomes of aberrant neural networks when integrated with a mobile robot, closing the loop between the neural network in brain organoids and the mobile robot. In this review, we aim to discuss the use of each model to study the behavioral changes in epilepsy and highlight the benefits of both in vivo and in vitro models for understanding the behavioral aspects of epilepsy.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe use of light-emitting diode (LED) lights in horticulture allows growers to adjust the light spectrum to optimize crop production and quality. However, changes in light quality can also influence plant-arthropod interactions, with possible consequences for pest management. The addition of far-red light has been shown to interfere with plant immunity, thereby increasing plant susceptibility to biotic stress and increasing pest performance. Far-red light also influences plant emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and might thus influence tritrophic interactions with biological control agents. We investigated how far-red light influences the VOC-mediated attraction of the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis to tomato plants infested with Tetranychus urticae, and its ability to control T. urticae populations. RESULTSFar-red light significantly influences herbivore-induced VOC emissions of tomato plants, characterized by a change in relative abundance of terpenoids, but this did not influence the attraction of P. persimilis to herbivore-induced plants. Supplemental far-red light led to an increased population growth of T. urticae and increased numbers of P. persimilis. This resulted in a stronger suppression of T. urticae populations under supplemental far-red light, to similar T. urticae numbers as in control conditions without supplemental far-red light. CONCLUSIONWe conclude that supplemental far-red light can change herbivore-induced VOC emissions but does not interfere with the attraction of the predator P. persimilis. Moreover, far-red light stimulates biological control of spider mites in glasshouse tomatoes due to increased population build-up of the biocontrol agent. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - In order to explore the similarities and differences of responses between Hippocampus kuda and Oryzias melastigma, this study analyzed and compared them from the aspects of growth, behavior, physiology, and gene expression. The results showed that H. kuda had a greater impact on its feeding behavior compared to O. melastigma at the same rates. And the continuous responses of enzymes indicated there was a more persistent stress in H. kuda, with stress-related genes like sod1 showing a slower response. Additionally, genes related to sugar and lipid metabolism were significantly different in H. kuda compared to O. melastigma. H. kuda exhibited sensitivity to nearly all treatments, while O. melastigma only responded to treatments of direct input. Furthermore, the responses of immune-related genes in H. kuda were also slower than those in O. melastigma. In summary, the osmotic pressure regulation ability of O. melastigma was more efficient than that of H. kuda in dealing with the stress caused by rapid changes in salinity.

AB  - Yak yogurt is mainly produced in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is a kind of naturally fermented dairy product. It contains abundant microorganisms. Lactobacillus fermentum (LF) HFY03 is a lactic acid bacteria derived from it. Our main research content is to study the influence of LF-HFY03 on the antifatigue and antioxidation ability of running exhausted mice. We gave different doses of LF-HFY03 to mice by gavage for 4 weeks. We selected vitamin C as the positive control group, mainly to study the relationship between antioxidant capacity and fatigue resistance and LF-HFY03 in mice with running exhaustion. The results showed that LF-HFY03 and vitamin C could significantly improve the running time of mice. And with the increase in LF-HFY03 concentration, the exhaustion time of mice was also extended. LF-HFY03 can reduce the content of urea nitrogen and lactic acid and also can increase the content of free fatty acids and liver glycogen. The levels of alanine aminotransferase, serum creatine kinase, and aspartate aminotransferase in mice decreased gradually as the antioxidant peptide level of walnut albumin increased. LF-HFY03 can reduce malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in a quantification-dependent manner and can also increase catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. LF-HFY03 can also increase the expressions of CAT mRNA, Cu/Zn-SOD, and Mn-SOD in the liver of mice. At the same time, LF-HFY03 can also increase the expression of protein of threonine transporter 1 (AST1)/alanine/cysteine/serine, mRNA, nNOS, and eNOS. At the same time, the solution could reduce the expression of TNF-alpha, syncytin-1, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The results showed that LF-HFY03 has a high development and application prospect as an antifatigue probiotic nutritional supplement.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of feeding cotton gin trash (CGT) to Mecheri ram lambs, as an alternate diet, on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. A growth performance trial was conducted with thirty-two weaned Mecheri ram lambs with an average body weight of 12.64 & PLUSMN; 0.74 kg, which were assigned to four groups (n = eight animals in each group). The diet's roughage part was replaced by CGT at percentages of 0% (T-1), 25% (T-2), 50% (T-3), and 75% (T-4). The growth trial lasted six months (180 days) from weaning lambs at 3-4 months until 9 months for marketing. All the animals were fed on a dry matter requirement basis at 4% of their body weight. The study revealed that the lambs fed with 50 (T-3) and 75 (T-4) % inclusion levels of CGT showed significantly (p < 0.01) higher total body weight gain than the T-1 and T-2 groups. The average daily gain of lambs in T-3 (99.24 g) and T-4 (105.51 g) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than T-1 (80.77 g) and T-2 (83.61 g) groups. Throughout the study period, there was no statistically significant (p > 0.05) difference in the average Dry Matter Intake (DMI) (g) between the groups; however, the lambs in T-4 demonstrated higher feed efficiency (7.4) than the T-1 (9.3) group. The slaughter studies revealed that the lambs in the T-4 followed by the T-3 groups registered significantly (p < 0.01) higher hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, and meat: bone ratio than T-2 and T-1 group animals. The T-3 and T-4 groups had significantly (p < 0.05) higher weights of the liver, spleen, head, stomach, and empty intestines when compared to T-1 and T-2 groups; however, there was no significant (p > 0.05) difference in the weights of edible and inedible offals. In addition, there were no significant variations (p > 0.05) in pH, WHC, shear force value, sensory characteristics, and proximate composition of meat among treatment groups. The SFA levels in the T-3, T-4, and T-2 groups were substantially (p < 0.01) greater than in the control group (T-1). In contrast, the proportion of MUFA in the T-1 group was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than in the T-3 and T-4 treatment groups. There was no significant difference in PUFA or the PUFA/SFA ratio between the treatment groups. In accordance with current research findings, the CGT can be added up to 75% of the roughage component in sheep feed as an effective unconventional supplementation, as it improves body weight, feed efficiency, and carcass characteristics in Mecheri ram lambs.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a pervasive developmental disorder with gender differences. Oxytocin (OXT) is currently an important candidate drug for autism, but the lack of data on female autism is a big issue. It has been reported that the effect of OXT is likely to be different between male and female ASD patients. In the study, we specifically explored the role of the OXT signaling pathway in a VPA-induced female rat's model of autism. The data showed that there was an increase of either oxytocin or its receptor expressions in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex of VPA-induced female offspring. To determine if the excess of OXT signaling contributed to autism symptoms in female rats, exogenous oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonists Atosiban were used in the experiment. It was found that exogenous oxytocin triggered autism-like behaviors in wild-type female rats by intranasal administration. More interestingly, several autism-like deficits including social interaction, anxiety, and repeat stereotypical sexual behavior in the VPA female offspring were significantly attenuated by oxytocin receptor antagonists Atosiban. Moreover, Atosiban also effectively improved the synaptic plasticity impairment induced by VPA in female offspring. Our results suggest that oxytocin receptor antagonists significantly improve autistic-like behaviors in a female rat model of valproic acid-induced autism.

AB  - The ability to learn associations between events is critical for everyday functioning (e.g., decision making, social interactions) and has been attributed to structural differences in white matter tracts connecting cortical regions to the hippocampus (e.g., fornix) and striatum (e.g., internal capsule) in younger-old adults (ages 65-85 years). However, evidence of associative learning has not been assessed within oldest-old adults (ages 90+ years), despite its relevance to other extensively characterized cognitive abilities in the oldest-old and the relatively large effect of advanced age on the microstructural composition of these white matter tracts. We acquired multicompartment diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 22 oldest-old adults without dementia (mean age = 92.91 +/- 1.44 years) who also completed an associative learning task. Behavioral results revealed significantly better associative learning performance during later task stages, as expected if participants incidentally learned the cue-cue-target associations for frequently occurring event triplets. Moreover, better learning performance was significantly predicted by better microstructure of cortico-striatal white matter (posterior limb of the internal capsule). Finding that associative learning abilities in the 10(th) decade of life are supported by better microstructure of white matter tracts connecting the cortex to the striatum underscores their importance to learning performance across the entire lifespan.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a daytime nap on the retention of implicitly learnt "first-order conditional " (FOC) and "second-order conditional " (SOC) motor sequences. The implicit learning and retention of a motor sequence has been linked to the neural processes undertaken by the basal ganglia and primary motor cortex (i.e., procedural memory system). There is evidence, however, suggesting that SOC learning may further rely on the hippocampus-supported declarative memory system. Sleep appears to benefit the retention of information processed by the declarative memory system, but not the procedural memory system. Thus, it was hypothesized that sleep would benefit the retention of a SOC motor sequence but not a FOC sequence. The implicit learning and retention of these sequences was examined using the Serial Reaction Time Task. In this study, healthy adults implicitly learnt either a FOC (n = 20) or a SOC sequence (n = 20). Retention of both sequences was assessed following a daytime nap and period of wakefulness. Sleep was not found to improve the retention of the SOC sequence. There were no significant differences in the retention of a FOC or a SOC sequence following a nap or period of wakefulness. The study questions whether the declarative memory system is involved in the retention of implicitly learnt SOC sequences.

AB  - Extracellular matrix proteins appear to be necessary for the synaptic plasticity that underlies addiction memory. In the brain, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), have been recently implicated in processes involving alcohol reward and memory. Here, we showed for the first time, the positive effects of MMP-9 on alcohol-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) behavior and hippocampal neuron plasticity in C57BL/6 mice. Using recombinant adeno-associated viruses to overexpress MMP-9 in the hippocampus, we investigated the NMDAR, PSD-95, and cellular cytoskeleton proteins F-actin/G-actin in the modulation of alcohol reward behavior in mice exposed to CPP. We found that hippocampal infusions of MMP-9 decreased alcohol-induced place preference suggesting a reduction in alcohol reward. Western blot analysis demonstrated that protein expression of NMDA receptors (GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B) in the hippocampus of alcohol-exposed mice were higher than that of the saline group. Further, the expression of these proteins was decreased in MMP-9 overexpressing mice. MMP-9 also regulated the ratio of F-actin/G-actin (dendritic spines cytoskeleton proteins), which might be the key mediator for behavioral changes in mice. Consequently, our results highlight new evidence that MMP-9 may play an important role in the molecular mechanism underlying alcohol reward and preference.

AB  - Organoids are in vitro 3D models that are generated using stem cells to study organ development and regeneration. Despite the extensive research on lung organoids, there is limited information on pig lung cell generation or development. Here, we identified five epithelial cell types along with their characteristic markers using scRNA-seq. Additionally, we found that NKX2.1 and FOXA2 acted as the crucial core transcription factors in porcine lung development. The presence of SOX9/SOX2 double-positive cells was identified as a key marker for lung progenitor cells. The Monocle algorithm was used to create a pseudo-temporal differentiation trajectory of epithelial cells, leading to the identification of signaling pathways related to porcine lung development. Moreover, we established the differentiation method from porcine pluripotent stem cells (pPSCs) to SOX17+FOXA2+ definitive endoderm (DE) and NKX2.1+FOXA2+CDX2- anterior foregut endoderm (AFE). The AFE is further differentiated into lung organoids while closely monitoring the differentiation process. We showed that NKX2.1 overexpression facilitated the induction of lung organoids and supported subsequent lung differentiation and maturation. This model offers valuable insights into studying the interaction patterns between cells and the signaling pathways during the development of the porcine lung.
   The core pathway of porcine lung cell composition and epithelial cell development was analyzed by scRNA-seq. The differentiation system of pEPSCs overexpressing NKX2.1 into definitive endoderm, anterior foregut endoderm, foregut endoderm spheroids, and porcine lung organoids was established, and the differentially expressed genes among them were identified by bulk RNA-seq.image

AB  - Contactin-associated protein-like 4 (Cntnap4) is critical for GABAergic transmission in the brain. Impaired Cntnap4 function is implicated in neurological disorders, such as autism; however, the role of Cntnap4 on memory processing is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that hippocampal Cntnap4 deficiency in female mice manifests as impaired cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. The underlying mechanisms may involve effects on the pro-inflammatory response resulting in dysfunctional GABAergic transmission and activated tryptophan metabolism. To efficiently and accurately inhibit the pro-inflammatory reaction, we established a biomimetic microglial nanoparticle strategy to deliver FDA-approved PLX3397 (termed MNPs@PLX). We show MNPs@PLX successfully penetrates the blood brain barrier and facilitates microglial-targeted delivery of PLX3397. Furthermore, MNPs@PLX attenuates cognitive decline, dysfunctional synaptic plasticity, and pro-inflammatory response in female heterozygous Cntnap4 knockout mice. Together, our findings show loss of Cntnap4 causes pro-inflammatory cognitive decline that is effectively prevented by supplementation with microglia-specific inhibitors; thus validating the targeting of microglial function as a therapeutic intervention in neurocognitive disorders.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with an increasing need for developing disease-modifying treatments as current therapies only provide marginal symptomatic relief. Recent evidence suggests the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system undergoes remodeling in AD, disrupting the excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance in the brain. Altered expression levels of K-Cl-2 (KCC2) and N-K-Cl-1 (NKCC1), which are cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs), have been implicated in disrupting GABAergic activity by regulating GABA(A) receptor signaling polarity in several neurological disorders, but these have not yet been explored in AD. NKCC1 and KCC2 regulate intracellular chloride [Cl-](i) by accumulating and extruding Cl-, respectively. Increased NKCC1 expression in mature neurons has been reported in these disease conditions, and bumetanide, an NKCC1 inhibitor, is suggested to show potential therapeutic benefits. This study used primary mouse hippocampal neurons to explore if KCC2 and NKCC1 expression levels are altered following beta-amyloid (A beta(1-42)) treatment and the potential neuroprotective effects of bumetanide. KCC2 and NKCC1 expression levels were also examined in 18-months-old male C57BL/6 mice following bilateral hippocampal A beta(1-42) stereotaxic injection. No change in KCC2 and NKCC1 expression levels were observed in mouse hippocampal neurons treated with 1 nM A beta(1-42), but NKCC1 expression increased 30-days post-A beta(1-42)-injection in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. Primary mouse hippocampal cultures were treated with 1 nM A beta(1-42) alone or with various concentrations of bumetanide (1 mu M, 10 mu M, 100 mu M, 1 mM) to investigate the effect of the drug on cell viability. A beta(1-42) produced 53.1 +/- 1.4% cell death after 5 days, and the addition of bumetanide did not reduce this. However, the drug at all concentrations significantly reduced cell viability, suggesting bumetanide is highly neurotoxic. In summary, these results suggest that chronic exposure to A beta(1-42) alters the balance of KCC2 and NKCC1 expression in a region-and layer-specific manner in mouse hippocampal tissue; therefore, this process most likely contributes to altered hippocampal E/I balance in this model. Furthermore, bumetanide induces hippocampal neurotoxicity, thus questioning its suitability for AD therapy. Further investigations are required to examine the effects of A beta(1-42) on KCC2 and NKCC1 expression and whether targeting CCCs might offer a therapeutic approach for AD.

AB  - The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a receptor used to perceive external noxious stimuli and participates in the regulation of various pathophysiological mechanisms in vivo by integrating multiple signals. The explosive growth in knowledge of TRPV1 stemmed from research on neuronal pain and heat sensation over the last decades and is being expanded tremendously in peripheral tissue research. The discovery that TRPV1 is functionally active in male animal and human reproductive tissues have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Indeed, many studies have indicated that TRPV1 is an endocannabinoid receptor that mediates Anandamide's regulation of sperm function. Other characteristics of the TRPV1 channel itself, such as calcium penetration and temperature sensitivity, have also been investigated, especially the possibility that TRPV1 could act as a mediator for sperm thermotaxis. In addition, some reproductive diseases appear to be related to the protective effects of TRPV1 on oxidative stress and heat stress. A better understanding of TRPV1 in these areas should provide strategies for tackling male infertility. This paper is the first to review the expression and mechanism of TRPV1 in the male reproductive system from molecular and cellular perspectives. A focus is given on sperm function, including calcium homeostasis, crosstalk with endocannabinoid system, participation in cholesterol-related sperm maturation, and thermotaxis, hoping to capture the current situation of this rapidly developing field.

AB  - Satellite cells take an indispensable place in skeletal muscle regeneration, maintenance, and growth. However, only limited works have investigated effects of dietary compounds on the proliferation of porcine satellite cells (PSCs) and related mechanisms. Sulforaphane (SFN) at multiple levels was applied to PSCs. The PSCs' viability and HDAC activity were measured with a WST-1 cell proliferation kit and Color-de-Lys (R) HDAC colorimetric activity assay kit. Gene expression and epigenetics modification were tested with qRT-PCR, Western blot, bisulfite sequencing, and ChIP-qPCR. This study found that SFN enhanced PSC proliferation and altered mRNA expression levels of myogenic regulatory factors. In addition, SFN inhibited histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, disturbed mRNA levels of HDAC family members, and elevated acetylated histone H3 and H4 abundance in PSCs. Furthermore, both mRNA and protein levels of the Smad family member 7 (SMAD7) in PSCs were upregulated after SFN treatment. Finally, it was found that SFN increased the acetylation level of histone H4 in the SMAD7 promoter, decreased the expression of microRNAs, including ssc-miR-15a, ssc-miR-15b, ssc-miR-92a, ssc-miR-17-5p, ssc-miR-20a-5p, and ssc-miR-106a, targeting SMAD7, but did not impact on the SMAD7 promoter's methylation status in PSCs. In summary, SFN was found to boost PSC proliferation and epigenetically increase porcine SMAD7 expression, which indicates a potential application of SFN in modulation of skeletal muscle growth.

AB  - Objective Despite the clinical significance of cancer-associated cognitive decline (CACD), no longitudinal study has evaluated CACD in gastric cancer patients. This preliminary study explored structural and functional neural changes of CACD in gastric cancer patients focusing on the effects of chemotherapy. Methods 13 gastric cancer patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (CTx+ group), 9 gastric cancer patients who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy (CTx- group), and 10 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. We performed self-report questionnaires, neurocognitive tests, voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) analyses before and 3 months after chemotherapy. Results Compared to the CTx- group, the CTx+ group exhibited statistically significant decrease in attention and executive function over time and dysfunction in delayed recognition performance. The results of the rsfMRI analysis showed a significant group-by-time interaction in the left hippocampus-anterior thalamus. However, no significant structural change was observed in the VBM analysis. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal neuroimaging study on CACD in gastric cancer patients. Based on the results of our preliminary study, we suggest that the neuropathological processes and clinical presentation of CACD in gastric cancer patients is similar to those of patients associated with age-related neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) plays a key role in the growth and ovulation of animal follicles, but its impact on follicular recruitment in ewes remains uncertain. In this study, a total of sixteen healthy ewes (Hu sheep, aged 2-3 years, with continuous reproduction and housed separately), matched for parity and weight (52.98 +/- 0.96 kg), were randomly assigned to two groups: a control group (C) and a treatment group (T, PRL inhibition). Ovaries were collected in vivo after anesthesia during the estrus stage, and tissue morphology was observed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. By using RNA sequencing on the ovaries of C and T groups and conducting bioinformatics analysis, the essential genes and pathways involved in the regulation of PRL inhibition were pinpointed. Subcellular localization of key genes in ovarian tissue was determined using a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay and immunohistochemistry. The function of key genes was validated using knockout and overexpression techniques. During the estrus phase, we noted a marked rise in the count of large follicles within ovarian tissue following the inhibition of prolactin. In total, 328 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, with 162 upregulated and 166 downregulated. The results indicated that inhibiting PRL primarily influences follicle recruitment by acting on the target gene PIKfyve. Following the inhibition of PRL during the estrus phase, there was an increase in the expression of PIKfyve. PIKfyve was primarily localized in the ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) and cumulus cells (CCs) in the ovarian tissue of ewes. The overexpression of PIKfyve decreased cell apoptosis and enhanced steroid hormone release, whereas knockout of PIKfyve had the reverse effect. In conclusion, PRL inhibition promoted follicle recruitment in ewes by upregulating PIKfyve during the estrus stage.

AB  - The oral mucosa exhibits superior healing and minimal scarring. Although mouse models are widely used to study wound healing and various diseases, their translational relevance remains unclear. Here, we performed a comparative single-cell transcriptomic analysis of human and mouse oral mucosa to identify both shared and species-specific mechanisms. A total of 34,969 cells from human and mouse datasets were integrated using Harmony for batch effect correction, allowing us to establish a unified oral mucosa transcriptome atlas. Fibroblasts emerged as the prominent cell population in both species, displaying conserved gene expression profiles and cell communication networks, underscoring their central role in tissue homeostasis. Key pathways involved in extracellular matrix remodelling and wound healing were highly conserved, supporting the utility of mouse models for studying fibroblast-mediated tissue regeneration. These findings suggest that mouse models can effectively replicate human fibroblast biology, offering valuable insights for developing translational therapies that target fibroblast activity and regulatory gene networks to enhance wound healing and tissue regeneration. Additionally, we identified species-specific cell populations, including human-specific capillary endothelial cells and melanocytes, as well as mouse-specific salivary gland epithelial cells. Their distinct cellular composition and functional differences suggest that these subpopulations may not be directly translatable from mouse models to human contexts. Overall, our study highlights the evolutionary conservation of fibroblasts while identifying species-specific differences that warrant consideration in translational research. These findings provide a valuable resource for researchers using mouse models to study oral mucosa-related diseases, facilitating the translation of preclinical discoveries into clinical applications.

AB  - Hesperidin treatments reduce depressive symptoms in mouse models of depression, but the mechanism that mediates its antidepressant effects is unclear. This study shows that hesperidin exerts its antidepressant effects by activating alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor to promote synaptic and neuronal function in the hippocampus. The optimal dose of hesperidin (10 mg/kg) for the antidepressant potential was determined after 7 consecutive days of treatments, demonstrating decreased latency to eat and increased food consumption in novelty suppressed feeding, and decreased immobility time in tail suspension test (TST). Moreover, the optimal dose also reversed the depressive phenotypes of Institute of Cancer Research mice exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS), including reduced immobility time in the TST and increased sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test. In addition, hesperidin increased the expression of AMPA receptor protein (Glur1) and synaptic proteins (BDNF, PSD95, synapsin1) in the hippocampus of CUMS-exposed mice. Furthermore, inhibition of AMPA receptor activity by NBQX blocked the effect of hesperidin in reversing the depressive phenotypes, upregulated the expression of synaptic proteins (BDNF, PSD95, synapsin1) and cFOS-positive cells in the hippocampus, and increased the number of Ki67-positive cells in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of CUMS-exposed mice. These results help to further understand the antidepressant mechanism of hesperidin and provide new ideas for the future development of antidepressant drugs.

AB  - Simple Summary Urea, due to its fungicidal effect, when used as a chemical additive in sorghum ensilage improves the aerobic stability of the silage, minimising material losses after opening and exposure to oxygen. Thus, sorghum silage, as a source of roughage, when treated with up to 2% urea based on natural matter, can be used in the feeding of beef sheep in the growth phase, without harming the productive performance of the animals. We also hypothesised that sorghum silages treated with urea, given the potential of this additive, present greater aerobic stability compared to sorghum silages that were not subjected to chemical treatment during ensiling. In this way, it is possible to maintain them for a longer period exposed to oxygen, so that there is little impairment of ingestion, performance and nutritional value of this silage until consumption. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of ensiling sorghum silage with urea and amending the aerobic exposure nutrients intake and apparent digestibility, ingestive behaviour and blood serum metabolites of feedlot lambs. Forty uncastrated crossbred Dorper x Santa Ines lambs, aged 150 & PLUSMN; 15 days and with an initial body weight of 21.73 & PLUSMN; 2.40 kg, were used. Animals were assigned in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement. Thus, six silage diets were produced with various urea addition levels (UA: 0 and 5 g/kg on a natural matter basis) and periods of aerobic exposure of silages (PAE: 0, 24 and 48 h). An effect was observed for nutrient intakes of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fibre corrected for ash and protein (NDFap) and total digestive nutrients TDN (g/day) and for the total apparent digestibility of DM, OM and CP. There was an interaction effect between urea levels and aerobic exposure for ether extract (EE) and NDFap intakes (g/kg) and nonfibrous carbohydrate (NFC) digestibility (g/kg) (p = 0.012). The addition of 5 g/kg of urea to sorghum ensilage improved the digestibility parameters without changing dry matter intake and ingestive behaviour. The addition or not of urea does not change the blood parameters of the animals.

AB  - Inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which increases anandamide levels, has been suggested as a potential treatment for stress-related conditions. We examined whether the stress-preventing effects of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 on behavior are mediated via beta-catenin in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Male rats were exposed to the shock and reminders model of PTSD and then treated with URB597 (0.4 mg/kg; i.p.). They were tested for anxiety- (freezing, startle response), depression-like behaviors (despair, social preference, anhedonia), and memory function (T-maze, social recognition). We also tested the involvement of the CB1 receptor (CB1r), beta-catenin, and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) proteins. URB597 prevented the shock- and reminders-induced increase in anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors, as well as the impaired memory via the CB1r-dependent mechanism. In the NAc, viral-mediated beta-catenin overexpression restored the behavior of rats exposed to stress and normalized the alterations in protein levels in the NAc and the prefrontal cortex. Importantly, when NAc beta-catenin levels were downregulated by viral-mediated gene transfer, the therapeutic-like effects of URB597 were blocked. We suggest a potentially novel mechanism for the therapeutic-like effects of FAAH inhibition that is dependent on beta-catenin activation in the NAc in a PTSD rat model.

AB  - Social networks research using non-human animals has grown over the past decade, utilizing a wide range of species to answer an array of pure and applied questions. Network approaches have relevance to conservation, evaluating social influences on fecundity, health, fitness and longevity. While the application of network approaches to in situ populations with conservation concern appears in published literature, the degree to which ex situ and zoo-housed populations are the focus of "social networks for conservation research" is limited. Captive environments provide scientists with an ability to understand the social behavior of species that may be hard to observe consistently in the wild. This paper evaluates the scope of network research involving ex situ populations, analyzing output from 2010 to 2019 to determine trends in questions and subjects using ex situ populations. We show that only 8.2% of ex situ social network analysis (SNA) implications are of conservation-focus, apparent in papers relating to birds, carnivores, bats, primates, reptiles, and ungulates. Husbandry and welfare questions predominate in ex situ network research, but over half of these papers have nonpractical application (basic science). The chance of a citation for a basic science paper was 95.4% more than for a conservation-based paper. For taxonomic groups, primate-focused papers had the most citations. The focus of ex situ conservation-based networks research may be driven by the needs of conservation programs (e.g., population recovery outcomes) or by a need to evaluate the efficacy of ex situ conservation goals. We evaluate our findings considering the IUCN's One Plan Approach to conservation to show how in situ and ex situ network research is applicable to global conservation efforts. We have identified that there is a lack of application and evaluation of SNA to wildlife conservation. We highlight future areas of research in zoos and hope to stimulate discussion and collaboration between relevant parties.

Feed intake and feed conversion ratio were lower in the YCWP-fed birds compared to the control. Colistin and YCWP fed birds had higher Lactobacillus and lower coliform bacteria counts than control birds (p < .05). Total and IgM antibody against sheep red blood cells was linearly increased by adding the YCWP to the diet (p < .05). Adding the YCWP to the diet linearly increased the caecal concentration of propionate (p < .05). Orthogonal and polynomial contrasts showed that the YCWP significantly improved the villus height, crypt depth, villus height: crypt depth, villus width, and villus surface area (p < .05). The lower concentrations of the YCWP (0.15 and 0.30 g/kg) increased the PPAR gamma transcription (p < .05), while its upper concentration (0.45 and 0.6 g/kg of diet) did not change the PPAR gamma gene expression. PGC-1 alpha transcription was increased with 0.15 g/kg of the YCWP supplementation (p < .05). Dietary inclusion of the YCWP decreased the TLR4 gene expression (p < .05) and increased the downstream IL-10 cytokine (p < .05). In conclusion, YCWP improved the broiler's performance by modifying the gut microflora. Also, YCWP supplementation had an immune regulatory effect via local and systemic responses involving TLR4, IL-10, and PPAR gamma.

AB  - We aimed to determine, using in vivo magnetic resonance, whether maternal depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in the pre-gestational period in female rats would be evidenced by structural or neurometabolic changes in the hippocampal region of the brain. At the same time, appropriate behavioral tests were also administered after a relatively long two-month period of a stress paradigm. The objective of the study was not only to study an animal model of CUS using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) focused on the hippocampus, but also to use this technique to verify the effectiveness of mirtazapine antidepressant treatment. In the group with CUS, we found a significant decrease in the relative concentration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA/tCr) and glutamate+glutamine (Glx/tCr) compared to the control group, while we did not observe any statistically significant change in hippocampal volumes. Moreover, the forced swim test revealed an increase in depression-like behavior. The most important finding was the return of GABA/tCr and Glx/tCr levels to control levels during mirtazapine treatment; however, behavioral tests did not demonstrate any effects from mirtazapine treatment. In vivo 1H MRS confirmed mirtazapine mod-ulation of CUS in an animal model more robustly than behavioral tests.

AB  - Simple Summary Previous research has discovered that various weaning and mixing modes reduce weaning stress in piglets. However, there are not as many existing reports on whether relieving weaning stress with different weaning and mixing modes can promote the intestinal health of piglets. The results of this study showed that two weaning modes, 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde spray, and weaning after mixing, can increase the daily weight gain of piglets, lower their intestinal pH, boost the activity of their digestive enzymes, and improve intestinal morphology, compared with conventional weaning modes. These discoveries indicate that these two weaning modes can reduce weaning stress to a certain extent. The present study investigated the effects of weaning modes on the intestinal pH, digestive enzyme activities, and intestinal morphology of piglets. A total of 27 litters of "Duroc boars x Landrace x Large White" piglets were selected and randomly divided into three groups. Those groups were the conventional weaning group (C), the odorant spray group (S), and the weaning-after-mixing group (M), with three repeats in each group and three litters in each repeat. The experiment began seven days before weaning, and ended seven days after weaning. The piglets were euthanized on the eighth day after weaning, and the jejunum and ileum tissues and contents were sampled. The pH and enzyme activities of the intestinal contents were determined, and the intestinal morphologies were revealed using H&E staining. It was concluded that a 2% glutaraldehyde spray on the body surfaces of piglets after weaning could increase average weight after nursery, lower intestinal pH, increase the activities of digestive enzymes, improve intestinal morphology, and relieve weaning stress. It was also found that weaning after mixing could increase the average weight after nursery, lower intestinal pH, improve intestinal morphology, and reduce weaning stress.

AB  - Progranulin (PGRN) is a neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory factor with protective effects in animal models of ischemic stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Administration of recombinant (r) PGRN prevents exaggerated brain pathology after TBI in Grn-deficient mice, suggesting that local injection of recombinant progranulin (rPGRN) provides therapeutic benefit in the acute phase of TBI. To test this hypothesis, we subjected adult male C57Bl/6N mice to the controlled cortical impact model of TBI, administered a single dose of rPGRN intracerebroventricularly (ICV) shortly before the injury, and examined behavioral and biological effects up to 5 days post injury (dpi). The anti-inflammatory bioactivity of rPGRN was confirmed by its capability to inhibit the inflammation-induced hypertrophy of murine primary microglia and astrocytes in vitro. In C57Bl/6N mice, however, ICV administration of rPGRN failed to attenuate behavioral deficits over the 5-day observation period. (Immuno)histological gene and protein expression analyses at 5 dpi did not reveal a therapeutic benefit in terms of brain injury size, brain inflammation, glia activation, cell numbers in neurogenic niches, and neuronal damage. Instead, we observed a failure of TBI-induced mRNA upregulation of the tight junction protein occludin and increased extravasation of serum immunoglobulin G into the brain parenchyma at 5 dpi. In conclusion, single ICV administration of rPGRN had not the expected protective effects in the acute phase of murine TBI, but appeared to cause an aggravation of blood-brain barrier disruption. The data raise questions about putative PGRN-boosting approaches in other types of brain injuries and disease.

AB  - The effects of severe burn injuries on the cardiovascular system, specifically the atria and auricles of the heart, were investigated. The potential benefits of using lyophilized xenodermotransplants as a treatment option were also evaluated. The experiments were conducted on adult guinea pigs divided into three groups: intact animals, animals with burns, and animals with burns who underwent early necrectomy followed by wound closure with lyophilized xenodermotransplants. Third-degree burns caused significant ultrastructural changes in atrial cardiomyocytes, leading to long-term destructive changes in the structural components of the atria. However, the use of lyophilized xenodermotransplants had a positive effect on the atrial ultrastructure over time. This study highlights the complex and varied effects of burn injuries on the body and the potential benefits of lyophilized xenodermotransplants in treating severe burn injuries. By preventing destructive changes in the heart and activating regenerative processes, lyophilized xenodermotransplants can improve the condition of the heart after thermal injury. Further research and development in this area are necessary for understanding the potential of lyophilized xenodermotransplants in tissue repair and regeneration.

AB  - This work focuses on formulating liposomes to be used in isolated kidney dynamic machine perfusion in hypothermic conditions as drug delivery systems to improve preservation of transplantable organs. The need mainly arises from use of kidneys from marginal donors for transplantation that are more exposed to ischemic/reperfusion injury compared to those from standard donors. Two liposome preparation techniques, thin film hydration and microfluidic techniques, are explored for formulating liposomes loaded with two model proteins, myoglobin and bovine serum albumin. The protein-loaded liposomes are characterized for their size by DLS and morphology by TEM. Protein releases from the liposomes are tested in PERF-GEN perfusion fluid, 4 degrees C, and compared to the in vitro protein release in PBS, 37 degrees C. Fluorescent liposome uptake is analyzed by fluorescent microscope in vitro on epithelial tubular renal cell cultures and ex vivo on isolated pig kidney in hypothermic perfusion conditions. The results show that microfluidics are a superior technique for obtaining reproducible spherical liposomes with suitable size below 200 nm. Protein encapsulation efficiency is affected by its molecular weight and isoelectric point. Lowering incubation temperature slows down the proteins release; the perfusion fluid significantly affects the release of proteins sensitive to ionic media (such as BSA). Liposomes are taken up by epithelial tubular renal cells in two hours' incubation time.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumour that poses a serious threat to human health and places a heavy burden on individuals and society. However, the role of GPC1 in the malignant progression of HCC is unknown. In this study, we analysed the expression of GPC1 in HCC, and its association with poor patient prognosis. The effects of GPC1 on the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC were analysed through cellular functional experiments in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, DNA methylation of GPC1 was analysed by DNA extraction, methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite Sanger sequencing (BSP), and the target genes TET1 and miRNA regulating DNA methylation of GPC1 were found through the bioinformatics database. The results revealed that GPC1 was highly expressed in HCC, and its high expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. Inhibiting the expression of GPC1 can inhibit the proliferation, invasion and migration of HCC cells. GPC1 was hypomethylated in HCC, and its methylation level was regulated by TET1. miR-143-3p can significantly regulated the expression of TET1 and affect the methylation level and protein expression of GPC1. Furthermore, GPC1 also affects the malignant biological behaviour of HCC by regulating the expression of Hippo signalling pathway. In summary, miR-143-3p regulates the expression of TET1, affects the expression of GPC1 through DNA methylation and regulates the malignant progression of HCC via Hippo signalling pathway.

AB  - Background: One of the reasons for tolerance to morphine is increased oxidative stress and dysfunction of cell mitochondria in the hippocampus. Venlafaxine and calcium channel blockers can protect mitochondrial function. The investigation of the role of mitochondrial damage and oxidative stress in the simultaneous use of venlafaxine and calcium channel blockers on the acute analgesic effects of morphine and the induction of tolerance to its effects in mice was assessed. Method: In this experimental study, to induce tolerance to morphine, NMRI mice were treated with 50 mg/kg morphine for three consecutive days and 5 mg/kg morphine on the fourth day. Venlafaxine (20 mg/kg) alone or in combination with calcium channel blockers, nimodipine (10 mg/kg), and diltiazem (40 mg/kg) was administered 30 min before morphine, and the hot plate test was used. Then, hippocampal mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation method, and the levels of mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial ROS production rate, as well as the content of glutathione and malondialdehyde in hippocampal mitochondria, were measured. Results: The administration of venlafaxine-nimodipine and venlafaxine-diltiazem increased morphine's acute analgesic effects (P < 0.05) and reduced the induction and expression of tolerance to the analgesic effects of morphine (P < 0.05). Morphine significantly decreased MTT and GSH and increased MDA, mitochondrial membrane damage, and ROS compared to the control group (P < 0.01). Injection of venlafaxine-nimodipine and also venlafaxine-diltiazem 30 min before morphine can improve these alterations (P < 0.05). Discussion and conclusion: Our data showed that the simultaneous use of venlafaxine with calcium channel blockers could increase the acute analgesic effects of morphine and reduce the induction and expression of tolerance to it. Also, the preventive and protective roles of simultaneous administration of venlafaxine and calcium channel blockers on morphine-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress and damage during the tolerance test were achieved.

AB  - The world, at present, is witnessing a serious scarcity of fresh water resource whereas, sub-optimum utilization and mismanagement of water resources are equally contributing towards worsening of the problem. Currently, access to fresh water resources has become a daunting challenge for meeting the increased demand of water. The criticality level has intensified by several-folds due to flawed industrial demand and uncontrolled population growth, which is not only contributed to the pollution of much needed water resource but also, equally, threatened human health. Therefore, the deliberation of water managers, policy makers, and academicians were shifted from the supply management to demand management after 2000's United Nations ministerial declaration. In the present study, an attempt has been made to fill research gap regarding accounting of water footprint (WFP) at district level in Purvanchal, Uttar Pradesh (U. P.). It offers a comprehensive understanding of WFP including blue, green and grey components. The paper also contributes to extension of calculating sub-components of grey WFP, which has not been reported anywhere in the literature so far. Purvanchal, one of the political regions of U. P. state, was considered for spatial assessment of WFPs in wheat cultivation at field of its 17 districts. The data for this study was collected from statistical abstract-U. P., state agricultural directorate, national bureau of soil survey and land use planning (NBSS & LUP), published reports and the field survey. The WFP for each component was estimated by a set of frameworks proposed by Chapagain and Hoekstra et al. 2003 and, further elaborated by Aldaya and Llamas et al. 2008. The results show that the blue WFP has highest share, which contributes about 92% to WFP, i.e., it presents an average of 1332 cubic meter per ton in wheat cultivation. In contrast, the average grey and green WFPs have been estimated at 26 and 97 cubic meters per ton, respectively, of WFP. However, spatial variability was also been reported from the selected districts. Therefore, a rational approach is being recommended to ensure sustainability and efficiency in wheat cultivation.

AB  - Monocarboxylate transporter 2 (MCT2) is the predominant monocarboxylate transporter expressed by neurons. MCT2 plays an important role in brain energy metabolism. Stroke survivors are at high risk of cognitive impairment. We reported previously that stroke-induced cognitive impairment was related to impaired energy metabolism. In the present study, we report that cognitive function was impaired after stroke in rats. We found that MCT2 expression, but not that of MCT1 or MCT4, was markedly decreased in the rat hippocampus at 7 and 28 days after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Moreover, MCT2 overexpression promoted recovery of cognitive function after stroke. The molecular mechanism underlying these effects may be related to an increase in adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis induced by overexpression of MCT2. Our findings suggest that MCT2 activation ameliorates cognitive impairment after stroke.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests that hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) may affect the activity of adult neural stem cells (NSCs). Since the role of NSCs in recovery from brain injury is still unclear, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of sensorimotor cortex ablation (SCA) and HBO treatment (HBOT) on the processes of neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus (DG), a region of the hippocampus that is the site of adult neurogenesis. Ten-week-old Wistar rats were divided into groups: Control (C, intact animals), Sham control (S, animals that underwent the surgical procedure without opening the skull), SCA (animals in whom the right sensorimotor cortex was removed via suction ablation), and SCA + HBO (operated animals that passed HBOT). HBOT protocol: pressure applied at 2.5 absolute atmospheres for 60 min, once daily for 10 days. Using immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence labeling, we show that SCA causes significant loss of neurons in the DG. Newborn neurons in the subgranular zone (SGZ), inner-third, and partially mid-third of the granule cell layer are predominantly affected by SCA. HBOT decreases the SCA-caused loss of immature neurons, prevents reduction of dendritic arborization, and increases proliferation of progenitor cells. Our results suggest a protective effect of HBO by reducing the vulnerability of immature neurons in the adult DG to SCA injury.

AB  - Embryonic transfer of bovine blastocysts produced by in vitro fertilization is widely utilized-despite a compromised conception rate. It has been suggested that a set of four evaluation criteria for judging the quality of embryos, based on the timing of early cleavages and proper morphologies of embryos, can effectively predict pregnancy success. These blastocysts are hereafter referred to as four-criteria-compliant blastocysts. The same criteria should be used to modify the culture media to improve embryo quality. For example, culture media is often supplemented with nonessential amino acids (NEAA) at a uniform concentration despite the major variation in their concentration in the oviductal fluid. In the present study, the effects of the embryo culture medium, namely CR1, supplemented with all seven MEM NEAA or six of them, excluding one at a time, were examined. All media, except for the medium that did not contain proline and serine, tended to improve the efficiency of producing four-criteriacompliant blastocysts, and excluding alanine was particularly effective. The absence of alanine resulted in the rapid occurrence of the first cleavage and pronuclear formation of fertilized oocytes in the alanine-free medium compared to that in the medium containing alanine. These results suggested that alanine hinders certain events involved in the progression of early embryogenesis, which is necessary to achieve the four criteria that provide a benchmark for pregnancy. Therefore, a significantly higher percentage of embryos satisfied the recommended criteria and developed into four-criteria-compliant blastocysts when developed in alanine-free medium than in alanine-containing medium.

AB  - The aim of this work was to determine whether chronic exposure to nonylphenol (NP) at environmental concentration would have toxic effects on thyroid function and thyroid hyperplasia disease and whether zinc-selenium green tea has a protective effect on thyroid damage induced by NP in male rats. B-ultrasound revealed that there were thyroid nodules in both the zinc-selenium green tea group and the NP group. The group exposed to NP showed irregular follicle shapes, an increased number of small follicles, and increased follicular epithelial thickness. The epithelial thickness of the tea groups was significantly lower than that of the NP group (H = 38.85, P <= 0.001). Exposure to NP could induce the increased protein levels of ER alpha, ER(3, TR alpha, and TR(3 in thyroid tissues. The expression of ER alpha (F = 20.75, P <= 0.001), ER(3 (F = 32.32, P <= 0.001), TR alpha (F = 13.81, P <= 0.001), and TR(3 (F = 13.92, P <= 0.001) proteins in the zinc-selenium green tea group was decreased compared with that in the NP group. Chronic NP exposure could cause pathological damage to the thyroid tissue. Zinc selenium tea could provide protective effects for the thyroid damage caused by NP.

AB  - Diabetic cognitive dysfunction (DCD) is a complication of diabetes that seriously affects quality of life. Glucocorticoid-induced transcript 1 (GLCCI1) has been found to be involved in inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy in various diseases. However, the distribution of GLCCI1 in the brain and its role in DCD have not yet been revealed. In addition, the potential therapeutics effects of salidroside (SAL), a phenyl propyl glycoside compound known for its neuroprotective effects in treating DCD are unknow. In the present study, we found that GLCCI1 was localized in hippocampal neurons. C57BL/6 J mice with DCD presented downregulation of GLCCI1 and Bcl-2 and upregulation of p-STAT3/STAT3, Bax, Cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3. Overexpression of GLCCI1 or SAL administration relieved DCD, reversed the changes in the expression of these cytokines, and alleviated morphological alterations in hippocampal neurons. Interestingly, SAL alleviated DCD and attenuated the expression of GLCCI1 and p-STAT3, showing similar effects as GLCCI1 overexpression. These findings suggest that the GLCCI1/STAT3 axis plays a crucial role in DCD and is involved in SAL-mediated attenuation of DCD.

AB  - Contextual fear conditioning, where the prevailing situational cues become associated with an aversive unconditional stimulus such as electric shock, is sexually dimorphic. Males typically show higher levels of fear than females. There are two components to contextual fear conditioning. First the multiple cues that encompass the context must be integrated into a coherent representation, a process that requires the hippocampus. The second is that representation must be communicated to the basolateral amygdala where it can be associated with shock. If there is inadequate time for forming the representation prior to shock poor conditioning results and this is called the immediate shock deficit. One can isolate the contextual processing component, as well as alleviate the deficit, by providing an opportunity to explore the context without shock prior to the conditioning session. The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent to which cholinergic processes within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus during contextual processing contribute to the sexual dimorphism. Clozapine-n-oxide (CNO) is a putatively inactive compound that acts only upon synthetic genetically engineered receptors. However, we found that CNO infused into the dentate gyrus prior to exploration eliminated the sexual dimorphism by selectively decreasing freezing in males to the level of females. Biological activity of CNO is usually attributed to metabolism of CNO to clozapine and we found that clozapine, and the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, scopolamine, produced results similar to CNO, preferentially affecting males. On the other hand, the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine selectively impaired conditioning in females. Overall, the current experiments reveal significant off-target effects of CNO and implicate muscarinic cholinergic receptors in the dentate gyrus as a significant mediator of the sexual dimorphism in contextual fear conditioning.

AB  - Regarding air quality, odours have been repeatedly ranked as the number one reason for public complaints to authorities. The most widely used method for assessing odour impacts is dispersion modelling. However, the entire impact assessment chain is permeated with uncertainty, and the role of different sources of uncertainty is not well understood. A critical component of this chain is the emission, the focus of this work. Here we develop modelling analyses for examining the influence of variable emissions against constant emissions on the outcomes of impact assessments. The analyses are built upon six hourly-resolved emission scenarios and one time-invariant scenario applied for the fattening phase of pig production systems. All seven scenarios are configured to treat total emissions due to a mechanically ventilated shed as coming from an elevated point source with an unobstructed vertical release. A total of 378 impact maps from three sites in two countries (Austria and the U.S.) over relatively flat terrain are scrutinised. The influence and relevance of accounting for variability in odour emissions over time depend strongly on the nature of the emissions (e.g., temporal pattern, presence of stochastic and deterministic components) as well as other factors such as building downwash, odour impact criterion and stack height. Altogether, the results suggest that using hourly odour emission rates can improve the confidence in impact assessments compared with the simulations driven by constant emissions. For odour impact criteria based on high-end percentiles, the assumption of constant emissions can be more easily compromised. In contrast, lower percentiles are found to be more robust in offsetting the source emission variability. Results also indicate that the variability in odour emissions might become less of an issue for releases under the influence of downwash than those without obstacle effects. This systematic work is the largest investigation to date on the consequences of incorporating variable emissions when modelling odour impacts. Our findings demonstrate that the emission scenario used as input to dispersion models can play a central role in dictating the conclusions of odour impact assessments.

AB  - Simple Summary The porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus, can cause enormous economic losses in the swine industry. There is no effective commercial vaccine against PEDV infection. In this study, we found that an aqueous leaf extract of M. oleifera (MOE) exhibited antiviral activity in response to PEDV infection at the stage of PEDV replication instead of attachment or internalization. Mechanistically, MOE suppressed the oxidative stress and the expression of inflammatory cytokines induced by PEDV infection and upregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, which further led to less cell apoptosis. This study is the first report showing that MOE has antiviral potential as a new prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against PEDV infection. Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), one of the serious enteric diseases caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), is responsible for enormous economic losses in the global swine industry. However, available commercial vaccines fail to protect pigs from PEDV infection due to the appearance of PEDV variants. Hence, it is necessary to find an effective and cost-efficient natural product to protect pigs from PEDV infection. In this study, we first found that an aqueous leaf extract of M. oleifera (MOE) exhibited antiviral activity in response to PEDV infection. Furthermore, time-of-addition experiments revealed that MOE inhibited PEDV replication rather than attachment and internalization. Mechanistically, MOE significantly suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by PEDV infection, and restored glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity. Importantly, the addition of MOE alleviated oxidative stress and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and resulted in fewer apoptotic cells during PEDV infection. These results indicated that MOE might be an effective anti-PEDV drug used to control PED disease and may be helpful in developing a new prophylactic and therapeutic strategy against PEDV.

AB  - Red blood cell (RBC) substitutes tested in latephase clinical trials contained low-molecular-weight hemoglobin species (<500 kDa), resulting in vasoconstriction, hypertension, and oxidative tissue injury; therefore, contributing to poor clinical outcomes. This work aims to improve the safety profile of the RBC substitute, polymerized human hemoglobin (PolyhHb), via in vitro and in vivo screening of PolyhHb fractionated into four molecular weight brackets (50-300 kDa [PolyhHb-B1]; 100-500 kDa [PolyhHb-B2]; 500-750 kDa [PolyhHb-B3]; and 750 kDa to 0.2 mu m [PolyhHb-B4]) using a two-stage tangential flow filtration purification process. Analysis showed that PolyhHb's oxygen affinity, and haptoglobin binding kinetics decreased with increasing bracket size. A 25% blood-for-PolyhHb exchange transfusion guinea pig model suggests that hypertension and tissue extravasation decreased with increasing bracket size. PolyhHb-B3 demonstrated extended circulatory pharmacokinetics, no renal tissue distribution, no aberrant blood pressure, or cardiac conduction effects, and may therefore be appropriate material for further evaluation.

AB  - Objectives: to investigate the effects of hyperosmolar state (HS) on immune response and inflammation via the NFAT5 pathway and examine whether immune-mediated conditions trigger autism-like behavior in offspring.
   Methods: a pregnant rat model was performed by administering hyperosmotic solutions. Pregnant rats were divided into 2 main groups; control (group I) and hyperosmolar groups (group II). Control group rats were given % 0.25 NaCI (tap water) (n = 6), the Hyperosmolar (HO) group was further subdivided into 3 groups as; Group II a rats which were given % 3 hypertonic NaCl (n = 6), Group II b rats were given mineral water (% 3 NaH-CO3+magnesium+calcium content) (n = 6), and Group II c rats were given Ayran (% 0.8 NaCl content) (n = 6). Their offspring were examined for behaviors, biochemical and histological abnormality.
   Results: in offspring, TNF-alpha, IL-17, NFAT-5, and NGF levels in the brain were significantly higher in hyperosmotic solution groups than in control rats. Exposure of pregnant rats to hyperosmotic solution resulted in autism-like behaviors in their offspring. Through immunohistochemical methods, we found that CA1 and CA2 of the hippocampus indicated decreased number of neurons in hyperosmotic solution groups compared with the control group.
   Conclusions: our findings once again emphasized that the immune-mediated conditions involved in the pathophysiology of autism. NFAT5 pathway may be a key factor in the development of neuroinflammation by hyperosmotic solutions.

AB  - Polymer films based on traditional synthetic polymers are widely used throughout the world. However, the impossibility of biodegradation of synthetic polymers in the environment and, as a result, the accumulation of polymeric waste stimulates using biodegradable bio-based polymers instead of traditional ones. One of them is gelatin. Gelatin is biodegradable, it has good mechanical and barrier properties, high film forming ability and widely distributed.Presented research includes results of a investigation of gelatin films based on aqueous extracts from the leaves of sea buckthorn leaves, plantain leaves, pine needles (film based on distilled water used as a control). The qualitative and quantitative composition of polyphenolic compounds (the sum of polyphenols, flavonoids and tannins) that make up the extracts was determined using physico-chemical methods of analysis. The antioxidant activity of plant extracts has been established. The highest amount of antioxidants (64 mg/100 cm3) was found in extracts from sea buckthorn leaves. Using plant extracts in the composition of gelatin films did not cause significant changes in their thermal stability; it was confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. Significant changes in properties compared to the control were noted for samples containing sea buckthorn leaf extract. Thus, the value of the stress at break was 11.6 MPa, and the elongation at break was 100% (11.4 MPa and 65% for control, respectively). For all the studied samples, there was a lower water absorption (200-223% after 60 minutes) compared to the control (254% after 60 minutes) and vapor permeability values comparable to the control. Such combination of film properties, with a high content of antioxidants in plant extracts, allows us to consider these materials as promising for the creation of biodegradable packaging films with antibacterial activity.

AB  - Background Diving marine predators forage in a three-dimensional environment, adjusting their horizontal and vertical movement behaviour in response to environmental conditions and the spatial distribution of prey. Expectations regarding horizontal-vertical movements are derived from optimal foraging theories, however, inconsistent empirical findings across a range of taxa suggests these behavioural assumptions are not universally applicable. Methods Here, we examined how changes in horizontal movement trajectories corresponded with diving behaviour and marine environmental conditions for a ubiquitous Southern Ocean predator, the Adelie penguin. Integrating extensive telemetry-based movement and environmental datasets for chick-rearing Adelie penguins at Bechervaise Island, we tested the relationships between horizontal move persistence (continuous scale indicating low ['resident'] to high ['directed'] movement autocorrelation), vertical dive effort and environmental variables. Results Penguins dived continuously over the course of their foraging trips and lower horizontal move persistence corresponded with less intense foraging activity, likely indicative of resting behaviour. This challenges the traditional interpretation of horizontal-vertical movement relationships based on optimal foraging models, which assumes increased residency within an area translates to increased foraging activity. Movement was also influenced by different environmental conditions during the two stages of chick-rearing: guard and creche. These differences highlight the strong seasonality of foraging habitat for chick-rearing Adelie penguins at Bechervaise Island. Conclusions Our findings advance our understanding of the foraging behaviour for this marine predator and demonstrates the importance of integrating spatial location and behavioural data before inferring habitat use.

AB  - The three-spot seahorse (Hippocampus trimaculatus) is an economically important marine species in the northern South China Sea (NSCS). However, due to overfishing and marine environmental changes, its wild populations have been gradually depleted. To investigate the transport and settlement mechanisms of H. trimaculatus larvae in the NSCS, a physical-biological coupled model was developed based on the ocean model CROCO and the biological model Ichthyop for the period 2016-2018. The results indicate that the transport and settlement processes of larvae are primarily regulated by the combined influence of the South China Sea Warm Current, coastal upwelling, and Kuroshio intrusion. The larvae predominantly undergo short distance (0-300 km) and mid-short distance (300-600 km) transport, exhibiting significant spatial aggregation along coastal waters, particularly in the Gulf of Tonkin, the Pearl River Estuary, Shantou, Xiamen, and the western coast of Taiwan. Furthermore, extreme weather events, such as typhoons, significantly enhance larval settlement success rates. Notably, Typhoon Hato in August 2017 increased settlement success by 12.2%. This study elucidates the transport and settlement mechanisms of H. trimaculatus larvae, providing a scientific foundation for the conservation and management of its populations in the NSCS.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and proline amino acid alone or together on the quality and fertility of frozen/thawed honey bee spermatozoa. The experiments were designed to compare a single ascorbic acid, a single proline amino acid, and different combinations of ascorbic acid with proline amino acid on the cryopreservation of honey bee semen based on sperm motility, viability, intact membrane (hypo-osmotic swelling test), and fertility rates. Eight cryopreserved study groups comprised Control II with no supplement, along with groups with ascorbic acid (2 mg), proline 25 mM, proline 50 mM, proline 100 mM, and combination groups of both ascorbic acid (2 mg) and proline 25 mM, proline 50 mM, and lastly proline 100 mM groups, respectively. Using 50 mM proline in the tested groups had the greatest impact on sperm motility, viability, the percentage of spermatozoa with intact membrane, and fertility. The cryopreservation process caused a gradual decrease in motility, viability, intact membrane (p < 0.05), and fertility rates (p < 0.01) in all the tested research groups as against the fresh semen control group. Successful honey bee sperm cryopreservation and fertility are achievable when using an appropriate sperm freezing protocol and antioxidant. Proline amino acid as an antioxidant in semen extender had a more beneficial influence on sperm quality parameters and fertility. The success of cryopreservation with antioxidants is related to the chosen antioxidant in a dose-dependent manner.

AB  - The paper deals with the issue of responsible and sustainable tourism starting from a series of Italian (and only partially French) cases of ecomuseums of pastoralism and transhumance as potential drivers for development and territorial regeneration, as well as for the promotion of experiential tourism with low environmental impact, capable of triggering participatory processes of inclusion and social innovation. Through the analysis of two Italian regions (Piedmont and Molise) and three cases (Ecomuseum of Pastoralism in Pontebernardo, Cuneo; Ecomuseum Itinerari Frentani, Larino; and the ongoing program of the Institutional Contract of Development in Campodipietra, Molise) the authors propose an interpretative model based on three main issues: the awareness, agenda, and action of a responsustainable tourism concept and on the three different subjects of local actors, tourists and policy-makers, obtaining as the main result the pre-eminence of intangible actions for development over environmental recovery and conservation activities.

AB  - The existing building stock is recognised as a major contributor to total energy consumption and related carbon emissions around the globe. There is increased attention on the retrofit of existing building stock, especially residential buildings, as a way of curbing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Within this context, human nature connectedness (HNC) has the potential of further amplifying the benefits of sustainable buildings both from an energy conservation practice and tangible improvements to users' satisfaction, health, and wellbeing. This study attempts to show a case study of the potential of using HNC through the adoption of biophilic design principles to improve a residential building performance. A terrace house located in Sydney, NSW, was used as a case study and proposed retrofit scenarios were simulated with DesignBuilder(R) and Rhinoceros/Grasshopper with a view of improved daylighting, thermal comfort, and energy consumption. The building performance is improved in terms of daylighting, thermal comfort, and reduced energy consumption, additionally enhancing HNC.

AB  - Intermittent hypoxia (IH) is the primary pathological manifestation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the main cause of OSA-induced cognitive impairment. Hippocampal neurons are considered to be critical cells affected by IH. Transforming growth factor-ss 3 (TGF-ss 3) is a cytokine with a neuroprotective effect, which plays a crucial role in resisting hypoxic brain injury, while its role in IH- induced neuronal injury is still unclear. Here, we aimed to clarify the mechanism of TGF-ss 3 protecting IH-exposed neurons by regulating oxidative stress and secondary apoptosis. Morris water maze results revealed that IH exposure was unable to affect the vision and motor ability of rats, but significantly affected their spatial cognition. Second-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and subsequent experiments supported that IH decreased TGF-ss 3 expression and stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat hippocampus. In vitro, IH exposure significantly activated oxidative stress within HT-22 cells. Exogenous administration of Recombinant Human Transforming Growth Factor-ss 3 (rhTGF-ss 3) prevented ROS surge and secondary apoptosis in HT-22 cells caused by IH, while TGF-ss type receptor I (TGF-ss RI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked the neuroprotective effect of rhTGF-ss 3. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) is a transcription factor preserving intracellular redox homeostasis. rhTGF-ss 3 improved the nuclear translocation of Nrf-2 and activated downstream pathway. However, Nrf-2 inhibitor ML385 suppressed the activation of the Nrf-2 mechanism by rhTGF-3 and restored the effects of oxidative stress damage. These results indicate that TGF-ss 3 binding to TGF-ss RI activates the intracellular Nrf-2/KEAP1/HO-1 pathway, reduces ROS creation, and attenuates oxidative stress and apoptosis in IH-exposed HT-22 cells.

AB  - Geological carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in deep formations involves displacing resident fluids from porous media, and is considered an unstable process due to the unfavorable mobility ratio between the resident and displacing fluid. Although various chemicals have been added to improve the CO2 sweep efficiency, this often results in pollution to the environment and the formation. Here, a novel green foam was prepared to enhance CO2 sequestration. The stabilization mechanisms and rheological properties of the CO2 foam with cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and camellia oleifera saponin (COS) were explored. Furthermore, the pore-scale behaviors of the CO2 foams were investigated using a micromodel. The results demonstrated that the abundant hydrogen bonds between CNFs and COS molecules led to the formation of tight bubble film which could stably encapsulate CO2 and inhibit its diffusion. The interlacement and entanglement of CNFs endowed liquid phase with high viscosity, which restrained liquid drainage and improved the interfacial viscoelasticity. The pore-scale behaviors showed that the higher viscoelasticity and stability caused large numbers of small bubbles to group together, providing greater flow resistance to control the mobility of the foam. The CNF/COS foam significantly improved the CO2 saturation in aquifers and oil reservoirs.

AB  - Organic nitrates are widely used, but their chronic efficacy is blunted due to the development of tolerance. The properties of new tolerance free organic nitrates were studied. Their lipophilicity profile and passive diffusion across polydimethylsiloxane membrane and pig ear-skin, and their efficacy in tissue regeneration using HaCaT keratinocytes were evaluated. The permeation results show that these nitrates have a suitable profile for NO topical administration on the skin. Furthermore, the derivatives with higher NO release exerted a pro-healing effect on HaCaT cells. This new class of organic nitrates might be a promising strategy for the chronic treatment of skin pathologies.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Rosa webbiana (Family: Rosaceae) is used by South Asian herbalists to treat gastrointestinal and respiratory disorders. Aim of the study: This research aimed at multiple targets to verify R. webbiana for treating diarrhea and asthma. In vitro, in vivo, and in silico experiments were planned to demonstrate the antispasmodic and bronchodilator potential of R. webbiana. Materials and methods: The bioactive compounds of R. webbiana were identified and quantified through LC ESIMS/MS and HPLC. These compounds were predicted for muti-mechanisms of bronchodilator and antispasmodic potential in network pharmacology and molecular docking. In vitro methods (isolated rabbit trachea, bladder, and jejunum tissues) confirmed these multi-mechanisms for antispasmodic and bronchodilator effects. Antiperistalsis, antidiarrheal, and antisecretory experiments were conducted in in-vivo experiments. Results: The phytochemical analysis indicates the presence of rutin (742.91 & mu;g/g), kaempferol (726.32 & mu;g/g), and quercitrin (688.20 & mu;g/g) in Rw. EtOH. These bioactive compounds in network pharmacology interfere with the pathogenic genes of diarrhea and asthma, which are the members of calcium-mediated signaling pathways and showed the stronger binding affinity towards voltage-gated L-type calcium channels, myosin light chain-kinase, Calcium calmodulin-dependent-kinase, Phosphodiesterase-4, and phosphoinositide phospholipase-C in molecular docking. Rw. EtOH elicited a spasmolytic response in isolated jejunum, trachea, and urine preparations by relaxing K+ (80 mM) and CCh (1 & mu;M) spastic contractions. Additionally, it suppressed calcium concentrationresponse curves to the right, like verapamil. Like dicyclomine, it caused a rightward parallel shift of the CCh curves, followed by a non-parallel shift at higher concentrations with suppression of the maximal response. Like papaverine, it also caused isoprenaline-induced inhibitory CRCs to shift to the left. Verapamil did not potentiate isoprenaline-induced inhibitory CRCs, although it was more efficacious against K+ (80 mM) than CCh (1 & mu;M)induced contractions. R. webbiana EtOH extract exhibited complete antiperistalsis (21.55%), antidiarrheal (80.33%), and antisecretory (82.59 & PLUSMN;0.60) activities in vivo experiments at the dose of 300 mg/kg. Conclusion: Thus, Rw. EtOH modulated multiple pathways, produced calcium antagonistic, anticholinergic, and phosphodiesterase inhibitory actions, and had antidiarrheal and bronchodilator effects.

AB  - Simple Summary Improving the management of the conventional pig production system is crucial to increase herd productivity. Nowadays, the reproductive efficiency of gilts and sows during their life is not as efficient as expected. Gilts' development is related to their production efficiency. Thus, any improvement in management strategies should aim to optimize gilt development before the first insemination. Knowledge concerning the physiology of gilts, such as adequate body condition development under intensive systems, is necessary for developing proper management practices identifying gilts with the highest potential for lifetime performance. Our study showed differences in the reproductive performance of gilts grouped retrospectively according to body weight at first service. Therefore, body weight at first service could be used as a practical tool on commercial farms to track and optimize productive efficiency. In this retrospective study, we aimed to assess the effect of body weight (BW) at first service on body status development and sow performance during first parity and lifetime efficiency. A total of 360 DanBred gilts were used, which we categorized into three groups according to their BW: (1) Small sows (<135 kg BW; n = 108); (2) Medium sows (135-150 kg BW; n = 155); (3) Large sows (>150 kg BW; n = 63). We studied the gilts from first insemination to first weaning, and then monitored until culling. Sow body status, litter size and weight, farrowing rate, weaning-to-conception interval, lifetime performance, and hormones linked to metabolism were recorded. Sows in the Small group had the lowest body weight, backfat thickness, and loin depth during gestation. Moreover, they had the smallest number of total piglets born and longest weaning-to-conception interval at first parity. The Small sows also had, on average, one less piglet born during their productive life, and they tended to have a higher culling rate over three parities. For immunoglobulins, insulin, cortisol, and IGF-I levels, no differences were found. In conclusion, achieving optimal body weight at first service is essential for maximizing the sow's lifetime performance.

AB  - The extant colobine monkeys are a large primate radiation represented by two geographical subtribes, the African Colobina Blyth, 1863 and the Asian Presbytina Gray, 1825. The phylogenetic relationships of the colobinans are well resolved, but uncertainty persists among presbytinans. This study combines a large molecular dataset with a new morphological matrix to reassess relationships of the presbytinans using a total-evidence phylogenetic approach and to revisit colobine comparative morphology in the context of an updated phylogenetic hypothesis. Previously supported relationships of colobinans are replicated here. Among presbytinans, Presbytis Eschscholtz, 1821 is the sister to the other presbytinans, Semnopithecus Desmarest, 1822 and Trachypithecus Reichenbach, 1862 form a clade, and Rhinopithecus Milne-Edwards, 1872 is sister to the other odd-nosed colobines (Pygathrix E. Geoffroy, 1812, Simias Miller, 1903, and Nasalis E. Geoffroy, 1812). Several features diagnostic of the subtribes and clades within each subtribe are identified. The skeletal diversity of the presbytinans and the presence of few features that unite the subtribe might be attributable to the recent and rapid nature of their diversification and to substantial historical introgression among lineages. Finally, this work provides a foundation for future studies including the fossil colobines, whose relationships remain largely unresolved.

AB  - The dilution method and ratio were tested to assess their effects on the Hu ram semen after cryopreservation. Experiment I aimed to explore the effect of various dilution ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4) of diluent I (Tris-based and egg yolk) under the condition of 1:1 dilution of diluent II (diluent I and glycerol) on the Hu ram semen preserved in liquid nitrogen regarding spermatozoa motility and kinetic parameters. Experiment II aimed to investigate the effect of various dilution ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4) of diluent I under the condition of 1:2 dilution of diluent II to the Hu ram semen for cryopreservation on spermatozoa motility and kinetic parameters. The purpose of experiment III is to assess the effect of various dilution methods and ratios on the cryopreservation of Hu ram semen by detecting spermatozoa motility, kinetic parameters, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Experiment III includes four groups: one-step dilution method and two-step dilution method. The two-step dilution method includes two groups: 1:2, 1:1 and 1:3, 1:2, and the one-step dilution method includes two groups: 1:5 and 1:11. The results indicated that the post-thawed spermatozoa total motility (TM), progressive motility (PM) and average motion degree (MAD) were highest in the 1:2 group and significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the 1:1 and 1:4 groups under the condition of 1:1 dilution of diluent II. The post-thawed spermatozoa TM and PM of the 1:3 group were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the other groups under the condition of 1:2 dilution of diluent II. The post-thawed spermatozoa TM, PM, plasma membrane integrity and acrosome integrity of the two-step group (1:3, 1:2) were the highest and significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those in the other groups. Additionally, the post-thawed spermatozoa ROS level of the two-step group (1:3, 1:2) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that in the one-step groups (1:5 and 1:11). Therefore, a two-step dilution (1:3, 1:2) was found to be the most suitable method and ratio for diluting the Hu ram semen after cryopreservation.

AB  - Chewing is critical for herbivores to obtain nutrients. Measuring digesta particle size as the outcome of chewing can improve our understanding of the relationship between food and digestion. Previous studies of feeds of domestic animals have shown that smaller digesta particle size leads to more efficient digestion. Increased digesta particle size-either due to animal factors (e.g., a senile dentition) or to feed factors (e.g., fracture resistance) could be a sign of an animal experiencing compromised nutritional intake. However, for some primates that are dietary generalists, digesta particle size has been shown to increase when consuming preferred foods, which raises doubts about the role of chewing in digesting such foods. This uncertainty makes it difficult to understand the connection between diet, chewing, and digestion through digesta particle size in dietary generalists. In this study, using five typical food items from the Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata) diet, we conducted in vitro digestibility and fermentation assays to explore the effects of particle size on enzymatic and microbial digestion. For the fermentation assays, we used feces from captive Japanese macaques as inoculum. Among the five food items, we found that particle size has a stronger influence on the digestibility of seeds and mature leaves compared to young leaves and pulp. The influence of particle size on the fermentation rate was stronger in pulp and seeds compared to that in leaves. The differences in physical structure, texture, digestion barriers, and soluble components may play important roles in such differences. These results support the hypothesis that reducing food particle size is less important for consuming fruits than for consuming leaves. The limited effects of particle size on digesting fruits suggest that the two fruits examined in this study are cost-effective concerning food processing and chewing.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Lipids are an important component of human nutrition. Conventional milk is obtained from animals, and dairy milk is consumed by many people worldwide. Recently, milk consumers have been increasingly shifting towards plant-based milk options. The aim of the study was the qualitative identification of lipid metabolites in animal- and plant-based milk, the identification and comparison of the fatty acids (FAs) of milk, and the qualitative identification of the lipid groups among the milk varieties. Methods: Milk samples were obtained from local grocery stores. Lipids were extracted using a modified Folch method and analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics. Gas and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods (GC-MS and LC-MS) were used to identify the FAs and lipid groups. Lipid weights were compared and the NMR profiles of the lipids analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis. Principal component analysis was performed for the milk lipids obtained from the animal, and plant milk varieties. Results: Clustering of NMR data showed two main clusters: cow/almond/cashew and goat/soy/coconut. GC-MS analysis of the methylated fatty acids (FAs) showed the presence of 12:0, 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 17:0, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, 20:1, and 20:2 in all milk types, while FAs 19:0 and 20:4 were observed only in the dairy milk. LC-MS data showed common masses that may indicate the presence of mono- and diacyl glycerols and several lysophospholipids among the different types of milk. Conclusions: This study shows the advantage of using NMR, GC-MS, and LC-MS to differentiate the lipids among different milk types and compare them on one platform.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), caused by the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), primarily affects the jejunum and ileum of pigs. Interferons, glycoproteins with high species specificity and potent antiviral activity, are crucial in defending against viral infections. Unlike other interferons, interferon-lambda (IFN-lambda) mainly acts on mucosal epithelial cells and exhibits robust antiviral activity at mucosal surfaces. However, the high cost limits the use of naturally extracted interferons in farming. In this study, we expressed recombinant porcine interferon-lambda 1 (rpIFN-lambda 1) in eukaryotic cells, demonstrating effective antiviral activity against PEDV in Vero E6 and IPI-FX cells. In vivo, rpIFN-lambda 1 alleviated clinical symptoms and intestinal damage, enhanced antioxidant capacity, reduced inflammation, and significantly improved the survival rate of piglets following PEDV infection. Both in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed that rpIFN-lambda 1 upregulated interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the JAK-STAT pathway, thereby exerting antiviral effects. In conclusion, rpIFN-lambda 1 significantly inhibited PEDV replication and alleviated clinical symptoms. The selectivity of rpIFN-lambda 1 for intestinal cells and its ability to reduce viral shedding suggest that this agent is a promising antiviral for enteric viruses such as PEDV. Our findings highlight rpIFN-lambda 1 as a cost-effective, efficient, and novel strategy for antiviral treatment of PEDV.

AB  - Although the life history of the invasive terrestrial slug Arion vulgaris Moquin-Tandon, 1855 has been well studied, there are no long-term studies on the variation in its abundance. In 2003-2022, we used plasticine baits to monitor annual fluctuations in the abundance of a local Arion vulgaris population in Central Europe and studied the factors that influence these fluctuations. The consumption of plasticine, which is a reliable proxy of the abundance of slugs, varied between different years by a factor of 43. The maximum intensity of consumption occurred in July. The variability in slug abundance, as estimated from plasticine bait consumption, was irregular across years. Oviposition took place from September-November. The number of eggs laid did not limit the abundance of the filial generation. Slugs spent the winter period in the egg stage (similar to 25% of the population) or as juveniles, whose winter mortality varied from 18-100% among years. Winter temperatures were not a significant predictor of slug abundance in the following season, whereas the weather in spring and early summer determined the abundance. Amount of precipitation in April and May had a positive effect (P = 0.01). In contrast, the number of days from April-July in which minimum temperature at a depth of 2 cm below the surface exceeded 18 degrees C (i.e., the optimum temperature for slug development) had a negative effect (P = 0.045). These two factors combined explained 55% of the interannual variability in slug abundance (r = 0.74). The robustness of these resultswas backed up by the data from a spatially isolated nearby population, showing similar patterns of annual changes in abundance.

AB  - Abnormal cytokine expression has been implicated as a potential contributor to neurodegeneration. This study aimed to investigate the plasma cytokine profiles in patients with early-onset schizophrenia (SCZ) and to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of the key cytokine CCL11 in contributing to cognitive impairment. Plasma concentrations of 44 cytokines were quantified in individuals with SCZ. The effects of CCL11 on mitochondrial function were examined in vitro using primary hippocampal neurons. An in vivo model was subsequently developed by administering CCL11 into the lateral ventricle. The impact of the CCL11-CCR3 signaling pathway on mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and cognitive function within the hippocampus was assessed using a combination of behavioral testing, molecular biology experiments, transcriptomic analysis, and non-targeted metabolomics. In individuals with SCZ, CCL11 and IL-13 levels were notably higher than in controls. In vitro, CCL11 exposure caused mitochondrial dysfunction and increased reactive oxygen species in hippocampal neurons. In vivo, CCL11-treated mice showed cognitive deficits, mitochondrial fission, and neuroinflammation in the hippocampus. Comprehensive integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data revealed that CCL11 significantly disrupted the Glucokinase/Glucose-6-phosphate metabolism pathway, coinciding with elevated metabolites indicative of oxidative damage. Finally, downregulation of the CCR3 receptor in the hippocampus mitigated CCL11-induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. CCL11 causes cytotoxicity in neurons by increasing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. In a mouse model, knockout of the CCR3 receptor alleviates CCL11-induced cognitive impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress.

AB  - This study presents a novel high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method for simultaneous determination of oxyclozanide (OXY) and levamisole hydrochloride (LEV) residues in ovine tissues, addressing the critical gap in cross-class antiparasitic drug monitoring. Leveraging dual solid-phase extraction strategies-MAX anion-exchange for lipophilic OXY and MCX cation-exchange for hydrophilic LEV-we achieved efficient purification of these pharmacokinetically divergent compounds from complex matrices (muscle, liver, kidney, and perirenal adipose). The method demonstrated superior sensitivity with limits of detection (1.5 mu g/kg) and quantification (2.5 mu g/kg) below international maximum residue limits (MRLs), validated through Codex Alimentarius guidelines (CAC/GL 71-2009). Linear responses (2.5-1000 mu g/kg, R-2 > 0.9900) and robust precision (intra-day RSD: 1.44-12.51%; inter-day RSD: 0.29-17.70%) were maintained across spiked concentrations (LOQ, 0.5x, 1x, and 2 x MRLs), with recoveries of 80.94-115.36% confirming matrix-agnostic accuracy. Stability assessments under diverse storage conditions further validated method reliability. Applied to pharmacokinetic profiling in medicated sheep, this protocol established a 28-day withdrawal period for edible tissues, reconciling regulatory compliance with food safety requirements. As the first reported simultaneous quantification platform for OXY and LEV antiparasitics, our methodology advances veterinary residue analytics by enabling efficient multi-class surveillance and evidence-based withdrawal period optimization.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of hCG administration during different times after mating on the reproductive parameters of Torki-Ghashghaei sheep. In the first experiment, 75 Torki-Ghashghaei ewes and 56 ewe lambs were synchronised for 14 days. One day before withdrawing the sponges, 400 and 350 IU of eCG were injected into ewes and ewe lambs, respectively. Then the ewes and ewe lambs were divided into five and four groups, respectively, based on not receiving (control) or receiving hCG in ewes on 1.5, 2, 4 and 6 days and in ewe lambs on 1.5, 2 and 6 days after mating. The results of the first experiment showed that the rate of multiple twinning, the number of lambs born, fecundity, prolificacy and progesterone concentration in ewes and ewe lambs receiving hCG on days 1.5 and two were significantly higher than those in the other groups (p < 0.05). In the second experiment, 316 ewes and 304 ewe lambs were synchronised and received 400 and 300 IU of hCG, respectively, and were divided into two groups based on receiving hCG one day and a half (hCG-1.5) and two days (hCG-2) after mating. The results showed that multiple births in ewes were significantly higher in the hCG-1.5 group compared to the hCG-2 group. The results of this study generally showed that the use of hCG on all different days after mating increased the concentration of serum progesterone. Ewes and ewe lambs receiving hCG on days 1.5 and two had the best reproductive performance compared to the other groups. In conclusion, the application of hCG on 1.5 days after mating in Torki-Ghashghaei ewes and ewe lambs during the out-breeding season could be recommended for improving twinning rate, the number of lambs born and prolificacy rate.

AB  - One of the most promising aspects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in foodstuffs with probiotic characteristics is cholesterol-lowering action. This study aimed to examine the bile salt hydrolase (BSH) positive strains; out of 50 LAB isolates, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lpb01 and Lpb02 were selected. Both Lpb01 and Lpb02 were more biletolerant strains, surviving in 1% bile for 3 h at up to 7.27 and 7.14 log CFU/mL, respectively. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lpb01 and Lpb02 deconjugated considerably more sodium glycocholate, releasing 5.50 +/- 0.12 mM and 5.23 +/- 0.41 mM cholic acid, respectively, compared with 4.32 +/- 0.17 mM cholic acid released by ATCC 8014. In addition, Lpb. plantarum Lpb01 and Lpb02 deconjugated a considerably higher quantity of sodium glycocholate than ATCC 8014. Compared to ATCC 8014, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lpb01 and Lpb02 demonstrated a higher level of BSH activity. The tested strains Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lpb01 and Lpb02 resulted in a 63-68% reduction in the cholesterol level in broth media, whereas the commercial strain Lpb. plantarum ATCC 8014 showed a 51% reduction. In the case of survivability during in vitro gastrointestinal (GI) digestion, they did not lyse in the presence of lysozyme, and they survived more than 96% of the time when exposed to pepsin and low acidity (pH 3) for 1.5 h. Finally, the LAB strains were resistant to bile salts and pancreatin, with an overall viability rate of 94.0-99.4% after exposure to small intestinal conditions. This suggests that the isolates can survive severe environment in the GI tract. As a result, these strains with demonstrated in vitro capabilities are promising candidates for novel probiotic-containing formulations and could be incorporated into functional dairy foods.

AB  - Tumor physical microenvironment contributes greatly to the response of tumor cells. However, the mechanism of how extracellular substrate rigidity remodels colorectal cancer (CRC) cell fate and affects CRC progression remains elusive. Here, we show that F-actin regulator KIAA1211, also known as Capping protein inhibiting regulator of actin dynamics (CRAD), negatively correlates with CRC progression, stemness, and metastasis. Mechanistically, decreased CRAD in soft substrates induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) retention in the cytoplasm, restoring the repression effect on stemness markers NANOG and OCT4, thereby promoting CRC stemness and metastasis. Furthermore, CRAD deficiency promotes colorectal tumor cell softening and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) states, contributing to its metastasis potential. Clinically, CRAD expression is correlated with malignant degrees and metastasis in CRC patients. Our work uncovers a role of CRAD in anticancer and mechanical signal transduction of the extracellular matrix in CRC.

AB  - Background Gamma sensory stimulation may reduce AD-specific pathology. Yet, the efficacy of alternating electrical current stimulation in animal models of AD is unknown, and prior research has not addressed intensity-dependent effects.
   Methods The intensity-dependent effect of gamma electrical stimulation (GES) with a sinusoidal alternating current at 40 Hz on A beta clearance and microglia modulation were assessed in 5xFAD mouse hippocampus and cortex, as well as the behavioral performance of the animals with the Morris Water Maze.
   Results One hour of epidural GES delivered over a month significantly (1) reduced A beta load in the AD brain, (2) increased microglia cell counts, decreased cell body size, increased length of cellular processes of the Iba1 + cells, and (3) improved behavioral performance (learning & memory). All these effects were most pronounced when a higher stimulation current was applied.
   Conclusion The efficacy of GES on the reduction of AD pathology and the intensity-dependent feature provide guidance for the development of this promising therapeutic approach.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the Fmr1 gene and the lack of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that regulates the synthesis of synaptic proteins which are essential for proper brain function. Although circuit hyperexcitability is a hallmark of fragile X syndrome (FXS), the cell-autonomous effects of FMRP deficiency remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the functional consequences of the absence of FMRP on neuronal morphology and on ionotropic glutamate receptor surface distribution, using primary cultures of mice hippocampal neurons isolated from wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) pups. MAP2 staining of Fmr1 KO neurons showed a decrease in total dendritic length and complexity of the dendritic tree, accompanied by an increase in soma size compared to WT neurons. Moreover, immunolabelling of surface glutamate receptors performed under non-permeabilising conditions showed that Fmr1 KO neurons presented a higher content of synaptic surface GluN2A and a lower content of GluN2B subunits of NMDA receptors, while GluA1 and GluA2 distribution remained unchanged. Finally, multielectrode array data showed that Fmr1 KO neurons presented reduced spontaneous activity compared to control neurons. These data support the hypothesis that at the cellular level, Fmr1 KO hippocampal neurons are less excitable due to altered input processing, driven by structural defects and altered GluN2A expression in the synaptic plasma membrane.

AB  - The goal of this work is to evaluate the greenness of six spectrophotometric approaches that have been presented for determining the binary combination of levamisole (LVA) and triclabendazole (TCZ). To evaluate the suggested approaches, the analytical community has taken an interest in using green analytical chemistry practices. Two tools, called "Analytical GREEness" (AGREE) and "Green Analytical Procedure Index" (GAPI), were utilized to assess the degree of greenness. The zero spectrum of TCZ and LVA is compared, and it is seen that their spectra overlap. This means that the six spectrophotometric methods can be used to find them: zero order (D-0), first derivative (D-1), second derivative (D-2), the area under the curve (AUC), mean centering, and bivariate. Method I: The zero-order method (D-0) is used to measure TCZ directly at 306 nm because LVA has no absorption. Method II: the first derivative method (D-1) was used at wavelengths of 312 nm and 220 nm for TCZ and LVA respectively, and the linear range for TCZ and LVA was 2-18 mu g/mL and 2-14 mu g/mL, respectively. Method III: For the TCZ, the second derivative method (D-2) was used at a wavelength of 312 nm and a linear range of 1-18 mu g/mL. Method IV: The area under the curve (AUC) method was used with wavelengths of 202-207 nm and 218-226 nm, and concentrations of 2-14 mu g/mL for LVA and 1-9 mu g/mL for TCZ. Method V: we used a mean-centering method that involved dividing the mean-centered ratio spectrum by the spectrum of the 6 mu g/mL TCZ and finding the mean-centered ratio values at 241 nm for LVA. Method VI: The bivariate method is based on measuring two components at two chosen wavelengths using the Kaiser Method. The wavelengths 215 and 225 nm gave the best value of K, so they could be used to find the concentrations of LVA and TCZ. It ranged from 2 to 16 mu g/mL for TCZ and from 2 to 14 mu g/mL for LVA. These methods were developed for analyzing binary mixtures in pharmaceutical dosage form and bulk powders with high recoveries. Following ICH guidelines, the developed techniques underwent validation. The results show that there were no significant differences when all methods were compared statistically to the described method for TCZ and LVA.

AB  - Cuprizone causes consistent demyelination and oligodendrocyte damage in the mouse brain. Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) has neuroprotective potential against various neurological disorders, such as transient cerebral ischemia and traumatic brain injury. In this study, we investigated whether SOD1 has neuroprotective effects against cuprizone-induced demyelination and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in C57BL/6 mice, using the PEP-1-SOD1 fusion protein to facilitate the delivery of SOD1 protein into hippocampal neurons. Eight weeks feeding of cuprizone-supplemented (0.2%) diets caused a significant decrease in myelin basic protein (MBP) expression in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the CA1 region, the polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus, and the corpus callosum, while ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1)-immunoreactive microglia showed activated and phagocytic phenotypes. In addition, cuprizone treatment reduced proliferating cells and neuroblasts as shown using Ki67 and doublecortin immunostaining. Treatment with PEP-1-SOD1 to normal mice did not show any significant changes in MBP expression and Iba-1-immunoreactive microglia. However, Ki67-positive proliferating cells and doublecortin-immunoreactive neuroblasts were significantly decreased. Simultaneous treatment with PEP-1-SOD1 and cuprizone-supplemented diets did not ameliorate the MBP reduction in these regions, but mitigated the increase of Iba-1 immunoreactivity in the corpus callosum and alleviated the reduction of MBP in corpus callosum and proliferating cells, not neuroblasts, in the dentate gyrus. In conclusion, PEP-1-SOD1 treatment only has partial effects to reduce cuprizone-induced demyelination and microglial activation in the hippocampus and corpus callosum and has minimal effects on proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus.

AB  - Anatomical connectivity and lesion-deficit studies have shown that the dorsal and ventral hippocampi contribute to cognitive and emotional processes, respectively. However, the role of the dorsal hippocampus (dHP) in emotional or stress-related behaviors remains unclear. Here, we showed that neuronal activity in the dHP affects stress-coping behaviors in mice via excitatory projections to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The antidepressant ketamine rapidly induced c-Fos expression in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampi. The suppression of GABAergic transmission in the dHP-induced molecular changes similar to those induced by ketamine administration, including eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) dephosphorylation, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) elevation, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. These synaptic and molecular changes in the dHP induced a reduction in the immobility time of the mice in the tail-suspension and forced swim tests without affecting anxiety-related behavior. Conversely, pharmacological and chemogenetic potentiation of inhibitory neurotransmission in the dHP CA1 region induced passive coping behaviors during the tests. Transneuronal tracing and electrophysiology revealed monosynaptic excitatory connections between dHP CA1 neurons and mPFC neurons. Optogenetic stimulation of dHP CA1 neurons in freely behaving mice produced c-Fos induction and spike firing in the mPFC neurons. Chemogenetic activation of the dHP-recipient mPFC neurons reversed the passive coping behaviors induced by suppression of dHP CA1 neuronal activity. Collectively, these results indicate that neuronal activity in the dHP modulates stress-coping strategies to inescapable stress and contributes to the antidepressant effects of ketamine via the dHP-mPFC circuit.
   Understanding our brain's handling of emotions and thought is vital. Recent research indicates that different sections of the hippocampus are responsible for either thought processing or emotional reactions. However, new research by Yoon et al. disputes this, demonstrating that both hippocampus sections can affect behavior via connections with the prefrontal cortex, a brain area involved in decision-making. This study, a mouse experiment, examined how a specific pathway between the dorsal hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex impacts behavior, especially in response to stress and depression-like symptoms. The researchers used various methods, including gene alteration and behavioral tests, to understand how changes in this pathway's activity affect behavior. This study paves the way for future research to explore how these brain areas interact in the context of emotional and thought processing, potentially leading to more effective depression treatments.This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.

AB  - Background: Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) is a woody edible oil crop of great economic importance. Because of the lack of modern biotechnology research, C. oleifera faces huge challenges in both breeding and basic research. The protoplast and transient transformation system plays an important role in biological breeding, plant regeneration and somatic cell fusion. The objective of this present study was to develop a highly efficient protocol for isolating and purifying mesophyll protoplasts and transient transformation of C. oleifera. Several critical factors for mesophyll protoplast isolation from C. oleifera, including starting material (leaf age), pretreatment, enzymatic treatment (type of enzyme, concentration and digestion time), osmotic pressure and purification were optimized. Then the factors affecting the transient transformation rate of mesophyll protoplasts such as PEG molecular weights, PEG4000 concentration, plasmid concentration and incubation time were explored.Results: The in vitro grown seedlings of C. oleifera 'Huashuo' were treated in the dark for 24 h, then the 1st to 2nd true leaves were picked and vacuumed at - 0.07 MPa for 20 min. The maximum yield (3.5 x 10(7)/g.W) and viability (90.9%) of protoplast were reached when the 1st to 2nd true leaves were digested in the enzymatic solution containing1.5% (w/v) Cellulase R-10, 0.5% (w/v) Macerozyme R-10 and 0.25% (w/v) Snailase and 0.4 M mannitol for 10 h. Moreover, the protoplast isolation method was also applicable to the other two cultivars, the protoplast yield for 'TXP14' and 'DP47' was 1.1 x 10(7)/g.FW and 2.6 x 10(7)/g. FW, the protoplast viability for 'TXP14' and 'DP47' was 90.0% and 88.2%. The purification effect was the best when using W buffer as a cleaning agent by centrifugal precipitation. The maximum transfection efficiency (70.6%) was obtained with the incubation of the protoplasts with 15 mu g plasmid and 40% PEG4000 for 20 min.Conclusion: In summary, a simple and efficient system for isolation and transient transformation of C. oleifera mesophyll protoplast is proposed, which is of great significance in various aspects of C. oleifera research, including the study of somatic cell fusion, genome editing, protein function, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and multi-omics analyses.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are a debilitating and persistent threat to the global elderly population, carrying grim outcomes. Their genesis is often multifactorial, with a history of prior exposure to xenobiotics such as pesticides, heavy metals, enviornmental pollutants, ionizing radiation etc,. A holistic molecular insight into their mechanistic induction upon single or combinatorial exposure to different toxicants is still unclear. In the present study, one-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were administered orally with malathion (50 mg/kg body wt. for 14 days) and single whole-body radiation (0.5 Gy) on the 8th day. Post-treatment, behavioural assays for exploratory behaviour, memory, and learning were performed. After sacrifice, brains were collected for histology, biochemical assays, and transcriptomic analysis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed several altered processes like synaptic transmission and plasticity, neuronal survival, proliferation, and death. Signalling pathways like MAPK, PI3K-Akt, Apelin, NF-kappa B, cAMP, Notch etc., and pathways related to neurodegenerative diseases were altered. Increased astrogliosis was observed in the radiation and coexposure groups, with significant neuronal cell death and a reduction in the expression of NeuN. Sholl analysis, dendritic arborization and spine density studies revealed decreased total apical neuronal path length and dendritic spine density. Reduced levels of the antioxidants GST and GSH and acetylcholinesterase enzyme activity were also detected. However, no changes were seen in exploratory behaviour or learning and memory post-treatment. Thus, explicating the molecular mechanisms behind malathion and radiation can provide novel insights into external factor-driven neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative pathogenesis.

AB  - Introduction 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE) is a bioactive lipid derived from linoleic acid, it plays prominent roles in cellular processes such as lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Follicular atresia is a complex physiological process involving multiple forms of cell death. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of programmed cell death, has been less studied in the context of follicular atresia.Methods To investigate the association between ovine follicular atresia and ferroptosis, we performed transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of healthy and atretic sheep follicles. Notably, sheep follicular granulosa cells were treated with different doses of 13(S)-HODE. Cell viability, lipid peroxidation levels, ferroptosis-related markers, and ferroptosis-related genes were measured.Results The metabolomic analysis identified 87 and 48 differentially expressed metabolites in healthy and atretic follicles, respectively. Functional enrichment of atretic follicle fluid highlighted pathways related to linoleic acid and purine metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 250 highly expressed genes in ovarian granulosa cells of atretic follicles. Enrichment analysis indicated that these differentially expressed genes were associated with fatty acid metabolism and ferroptosis. Integration of multi-omics data demonstrated the occurrence of ferroptosis in atretic follicles, where 13(S)-HODE drives granulosa cell ferroptosis via the linoleic acid metabolism pathway; this effect was not dose-dependent. Mechanistic studies showed that low-dose 13(S)-HODE counteracts ferroptosis by promoting glutathione peroxidase 4-mediated lipid peroxidation reduction and increasing glutathione levels.Discussion In contrast, high-dose 13(S)-HODE induces labile iron accumulation through activation of transferrin receptor and ferritin heavy chain 1, enhancing ferroptosis sensitivity in granulosa cells. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating follicle development and offer potential therapeutic targets for enhanced follicular development and improved reproductive outcomes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the daily dietary nicotinamide riboside (NR) dose required to maximize the delay of subjective muscle fatigue onset. Barrows (N = 100) were assigned to one of five treatments: a conventional swine finishing diet containing 0 (CON), 15 (15NR), 30 (30NR), 45 (45NR) mg<middle dot>kg body weight(-1)<middle dot>d(-1) NR, or CON supplemented with 45 mg<middle dot>kg body weight(-1)<middle dot>d(-1) NR by drench or cookie dough (DRE). All treatments were administered for the final 11 days of feeding. On supplementation d 10, barrows individually experienced a performance test at 1.09 m/s until they were subjectively exhausted. Wireless electromyography (EMG) sensors were affixed to the biceps femoris (BF), tensor fascia latae (TFL), and semitendinosus (ST) to measure real-time muscle activity. There were no treatment effects for barrow speed (p = 0.57), a tendency for a treatment effect (p = 0.07) for distance, and a treatment effect (p = 0.04) on time to exhaustion. Barrows of the 15NR and DRE treatments had greater (p = 0.05) distances to exhaustion than CON barrows but did not differ from other NR barrows (p > 0.11). Barrows in the 45NR treatment did not differ (p = 0.11) in distance from 30NR barrows but tended to have a greater (p = 0.07) distance compared to CON barrows. All other treatment comparisons did not differ (p > 0.27). Barrows in the DRE treatment moved for longer (p < 0.01) than CON barrows, but all other treatments did not differ from each other (p > 0.15). There was no treatment x period interaction for all muscles' root mean square (RMS) values (p > 0.16), but there were Period effects for all muscles (p < 0.01) and a Treatment effect (p = 0.04) in the TFL. For all muscles, period 4 had greater RMS values than all other periods (p < 0.01), who did not differ from each other (p > 0.29). In the TFL, CON barrows had greater RMS values during the performance test compared to all NR treatments (p < 0.02), who did not differ from each other (p > 0.18). Overall, NR demonstrates potential in being a useful tool in fatigue prevention, but efficient administration of the compound needs further investigation.

AB  - Heat stress (HS) poses a significant threat to production and survival in the global swine industry. However, the molecular regulatory effects of heat stress on maternal endometrial cells are poorly understood in pigs during early embryo implantation. In this study, we systematically examined morphological changes in the endometrium and the corresponding regulation mechanism in response to HS by combining scanning electron microscopy (SEM), hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining, western blot, and RNA-seq analyses. Our results showed that HS led to porcine endometrium damage and endometrial thinness during embryo implantation. The expression levels of cell adhesion-related proteins, including N-cadherin and E-cadherin, in the uterus were significantly lower in the heat stress group (39 +/- 1 degrees C, n = 3) than in the control group (28 +/- 1 degrees C, n = 3). A total of 338 up-regulated genes and 378 down-regulated genes were identified in porcine endometrium under HS. The down-regulated genes were found to be mainly enriched in the pathways related to the microtubule complex, immune system process, and metalloendopeptidase activity, whereas the up-regulated genes were mainly involved in calcium ion binding, the extracellular region, and molecular function regulation. S100A9 was found to be one of the most significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the endometrium under HS, and this gene could promote proliferation of endometrial cells and inhibit their apoptosis. Meanwhile, HS caused endometrial epithelial cell (EEC) damage and inhibited its proliferation. Overall, our results demonstrated that HS induced uterine morphological change and tissue damage by regulating the expression of genes associated with calcium ions and amino acid transport. These findings may provide novel molecular insights into endometrial damage under HS during embryo implantation.

AB  - Dendritic outgrowth in immature neurons is enhanced by neuronal activity and is considered one of the mechanisms of neural circuit optimization. It is known that calcium signals affect transcriptional regulation and cytoskeletal remodeling necessary for dendritic outgrowth. Here, we demonstrate that activity-dependent calcium signaling also controls mitochondrial homeostasis via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in growing dendrites of differentiating mouse hippocampal neurons. We found that the inhibition of neuronal activity induced dendritic hypotrophy with abnormally elongated mitochondria. In growing dendrites, AMPK is activated by neuronal activity and dynamically oscillates in synchrony with calcium spikes, and this AMPK oscillation was inhibited by CaMKK2 knockdown. AMPK activation led to phosphorylation of MFF and ULK1, which initiate mitochondrial fission and mitophagy, respectively. Dendritic mitochondria in AMPK-depleted neurons exhibited impaired fission and mitophagy and displayed multiple signs of dysfunction. Genetic inhibition of fission led to dendritic hypoplasia that was reminiscent of AMPK-deficient neurons. Thus, AMPK activity is finely tuned by the calcium-CaMKK2 pathway and regulates mitochondrial homeostasis by facilitating removal of damaged components of mitochondria in growing neurons during normal brain development.

AB  - BACKGROUND The beneficial function of phytase and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (HyD) on the feed utilization rate has been widely investigated. However, studies concerning its influence on weaned piglets largely lag behind. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of phytase and HyD supplementation on the growth performance and bone development in weaned piglets under dietary Ca and P deficiency. RESULTS The results showed that dietary Ca and P deficiency decreased (P < 0.05) the content of serum P in 6-10 kg piglets, as well as reducing (P < 0.05) the contents of serum Ca and P, average daily gain (ADG), bone mineral density (BMD), breaking force (BF), bone ash and femur Ca in 10-20 kg piglets. Compared with the control group, the feed-to-gain ratio (F/G) of 6-10 kg piglets in the Phy group was decreased (P < 0.05), whereas the ADG, blood Ca and P, BMD, BF, bone ash, P apparent digestibility, Ca and P retention rate of 10-20 kg piglets were increased (P < 0.05). The contents of serum osteocalcin and HyD in 6-10 kg piglets and ADG were higher than in the control group (P < 0.05), as well as the contents of serum Ca and HyD in 10-20 kg piglets in the HyD treatment group. Supplementation with both Phy and HyD decreased the F/D (P < 0.05) and increased the contents of serum Ca, P and HyD in 6-10 kg piglets as well as enhancing the ADG, BMD, BF, bone ash, femur Ca and P, serum Ca and P, HyD, and the apparent digestibility and retention of Ca and P (P < 0.05) in 10-20 kg piglets. Supplementation with Phy and HyD in Ca- and P-deficient dietary decreased bone resorption, and improved tight arrangement of collagen fibers and oblique fibers in weaned piglets. CONCLUSION These data indicated that supplementation with both 1500 U kg(-1) Phy and 50 mu g kg(-1) HyD could enhance dietary Ca and P utilization and promote bone development in low Ca and P dietary, and supplementation with both Phy and HyD had a significant synergy effect compared to single supplement.

AB  - Seabirds are wide-ranging organisms often used to track marine pollution, yet the effect of migration on exposure over the annual cycle is often unclear. We used solar geolocation loggers and stable isotope analysis to study the effects of post breeding dispersal and diet on persistent organic pollutant (POP) and mercury (Hg) burdens in rhinoceros auklets, Cerorhinca monocerata, breeding on islands along the Pacific Coast of Canada. Hg and four classes of POPs were measured in auklet eggs: organochlorine insecticides (OCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and perfluoralkyl substances (PFASs). Stable isotope values of adult breast feathers grown during winter were used in conjunction with geolocation to elucidate adult wintering latitude. Wintering latitude was the most consistent and significant predictor of some POP and of Hg concentrations in eggs. The magnitude and pattern of exposure varied by contaminant, with PPCBs, PPBDEs and DDE decreasing with wintering latitude, and mirex, perfluoro-n-tridecanoic acid, and Hg increasing with latitude. We suggest that concentrations of these contaminants in rhinoceros auklet eggs are influenced by variation in uptake at adult wintering locations related to anthropogenic inputs and oceanic and atmospheric transport.

AB  - Nomograms are important clinical tools applied widely in both developing and aging populations. They are generally constructed as normative models identifying cases as outliers to a distribution of healthy controls. Currently used normative models do not account for genetic heterogeneity. Hippocampal volume (HV) is a key endophenotype for many brain disorders. Here, we examine the impact of genetic adjustment on HV nomograms and the translational ability to detect dementia patients. Using imaging data from 35,686 healthy subjects aged 44-82 from the UK Biobank (UKB), we built HV nomograms using Gaussian process regression (GPR), which - compared to a previous method - extended the application age by 20 years, including dementia critical age ranges. Using HV polygenic scores (HV-PGS), we built genetically adjusted nomograms from participants stratified into the top and bottom 30% of HV-PGS. This shifted the nomograms in the expected directions by similar to 100 mm(3) (2.3% of the average HV), which equates to 3 years of normal aging for a person aged similar to 65. Clinical impact of genetically adjusted nomograms was investigated by comparing 818 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database diagnosed as either cognitively normal (CN), having mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. While no significant change in the survival analysis was found for MCI-to-AD conversion, an average of 68% relative decrease was found in intra-diagnostic-group variance, highlighting the importance of genetic adjustment in untangling phenotypic heterogeneity.

AB  - Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) plays direct or redundant Ca2+ sensor roles in multiple forms of vesicle exocytosis in synapses. Here, we show that Syt7 is a redundant Ca2+ sensor with Syt1/Doc2 to drive spontaneous glutamate release, which functions uniquely to activate the postsynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs that significantly contribute to mental illness. In mouse hippocampal neurons lacking Syt1/Doc2, Syt7 inactivation largely diminishes spontaneous release. Using 2 approaches, including measuring Ca2+ dose response and substituting extracellular Ca2+ with Sr2+, we detect that Syt7 directly triggers spontaneous release via its Ca2+ binding motif to activate GluN2B-NMDARs. Furthermore, modifying the localization of Syt7 in the active zone still allows Syt7 to drive spontaneous release, but the GluN2B-NMDAR activity is abolished. Finally, Syt7 SNPs identified in bipolar disorder patients destroy the function of Syt7 in spontaneous release in patient iPSC-derived and mouse hippocampal neurons. Therefore, Syt7 could contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders through driving spontaneous glutamate release.

AB  - Mucormycosis is a highly aggressive angio-invasive disease of humans caused by fungi in the zygomycete order, Mucorales. Though a number of different species can cause mucormycosis, the principal agent of the disease worldwide is Rhizopus arrhizus, which accounts for the majority of rhinoorbital-cerebral, pulmonary, and disseminated infections in immunocompromised individuals. It is also the main cause of life-threatening infections in patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and in corticosteroid-treated patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, where it causes the newly described disease, COVID-19-associated mucormycosis (CAM). Diagnosis currently relies on non-specific CT, a lengthy and insensitive culture from invasive biopsy, and a time-consuming histopathology of tissue samples. At present, there are no rapid antigen tests for the disease that detect biomarkers of infection, and which allow point-of-care diagnosis. Here, we report the development of an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), KC9, which is specific to Rhizopus arrhizus var. arrhizus (syn. Rhizopus oryzae) and Rhizopus arrhizus var. delemar (Rhizopus delemar), and which binds to a 15 kDa extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) antigen secreted during hyphal growth of the pathogen. Using the mAb, we have developed a competitive lateral-flow device (LFD) that allows rapid (30 min) and sensitive (similar to 50 ng/mL running buffer) detection of the EPS biomarker, and which is compatible with human serum (limit of detection of similar to 500 ng/mL) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (limit of detection of similar to 100 ng/mL). The LFD, therefore, provides a potential novel opportunity for the non-invasive detection of mucormycosis caused by Rhizopus arrhizus.

AB  - Exposure to air pollution during prenatal or neonatal periods is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to epidemiology studies. Furthermore, prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) has also been found to be associated with an increased prevalence of ASD. To assess the association between simultaneous exposure to VPA and air pollutants, seven exposure groups of rats were included in current study (PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants exposed - high dose of VPA (PGE-high); PM2.5 and gaseous pollutants exposed - low dose of VPA (PGE-low); gaseous pollutants only exposed - high dose of VPA (GE-high); gaseous pollutants only exposed - low dose of VPA (GE-low); clean air exposed - high dose of VPA (CAE-high); clean air exposed - low dose of VPA (CAE-low) and clean air exposed (CAE)). The pollution-exposed rats were exposed to air pollutants from embryonic day (EO) to postnatal day 42 (PND42). In all the induced groups, decreased oxidative stress biomarkers, decreased oxytocin receptor (OXTR) levels, and increased the expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were found. The volumes of the cerebellum, hippocampus, striatum, and prefrontal decreased in all induced groups in comparison to CAE. Additionally, increased numerical density of glial cells and decreased of numerical density of neurons were found in all induced groups. Results show that simultaneous exposure to air pollution and VPA can cause ASD-related behavioral deficits and air pollution reinforced the mechanism of inducing ASD's in VPA-induced rat model of autism.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are fibroblast-like non-hematopoietic cells with self-renewal and differentiation capacity, and thereby great potential in regeneration and wound healing. MSC populations are heterogeneous not only inherently, but also among different model species. In particular, porcine MSC serve as a frequently used resource for translational research, due to pigs' distinctive closeness to human anatomy and physiology. However, information on gene expression profiles from porcine MSC and its dynamics during differentiation is sparse, especially with regard to cell surface and inner cell markers. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome of bone marrow-derived MSC and its differentiated cell types in a minipig breed for experimental research, known as Mini-LEWE, using bulk mRNA sequencing. Our data highlighted Rap1 signaling and downstream pathways PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling as potential players for the maintenance of stemness of BM-MSC. In addition, we were able to link the process of differentiation to changes in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton. A total of 18 "BM-MSC differentiation driver markers" were identified, potentially promoting the process of differentiation into adipocytes, chondrocytes as well as osteocytes. Our results offer a new perspective on the molecular phenotype of porcine BM-MSC and the transcriptional responses in new differentiated progeny.

AB  - Stress responses, which are mediated by the neurogenic system (NS) and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis help vertebrates maintain physiological homeostasis. Fight-or-flight responses are activated by the NS, which releases norepinephrine/noradrenaline and epinephrine/adrenaline in response to immediate stressors, whilst the HPA axis releases glucocorticoid hormones (e.g. cortisol and corticosterone) to help mitigate allostatic load. There have been many studies on stress responses of captive animals, but they are not truly reflective of typical ranges or the types of stressors encountered by free-ranging wildlife, such as responses and adaptation to environmental change, which are particularly important from a conservation perspective. As stress can influence the composition of age and sex classes of free-ranging populations both directly and indirectly, ecological research must be prioritised towards more vulnerable taxa. Generally, large predators tend to be particularly at risk of anthropogenically driven population declines because they exhibit reduced behavioural plasticity required to adapt to changing landscapes and exist in reduced geographic ranges, have small population sizes, low fecundity rates, large spatial requirements and occupy high trophic positions. As a keystone species with a long history of coexistence with humans in highly anthropogenic landscapes, there has been growing concern about how humans influence bear behaviour and physiology, via numerous short- and long-term stressors. In this review, we synthesise research on the stress response in free-ranging bear populations and evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of current methodology in measuring stress in bears to identify the most effective metrics for future research. Particularly, we integrate research that utilised haematological variables, cardiac monitors and Global Positioning System (GPS) collars, serum/plasma and faecal glucocorticoid concentrations, hair cortisol levels, and morphological metrics (primarily skulls) to investigate the stress response in ursids in both short- and long-term contexts. We found that in free-ranging bears, food availability and consumption have the greatest influence on individual stress, with mixed responses to anthropogenic influences. Effects of sex and age on stress are also mixed, likely attributable to inconsistent methods. We recommend that methodology across all stress indicators used in free-ranging bears should be standardised to improve interpretation of results and that a wider range of species should be incorporated in future studies.

AB  - In a cytopathic effect inhibition assay, a standardized Rhodiola rosea root and rhizome extract, also known as roseroot extract (SHR-5), exerted distinct anti-influenza A virus activity against HK/68 (H3N2) (IC (50) of 2.8 mu g/mL) without being cytotoxic. For fast and efficient isolation and identification of the extracts bioactive constituents, a high-performance countercurrent chromatographic separation method was developed. It resulted in a three-stage gradient elution program using a mobile phase solvent system composed of ethyl acetate/ n -butanol/water (1:4:5 -> 2:3:5 -> 3:2:5) in the reversed-phase mode. The elaborated high-performance countercurrent chromatographic method allowed for fractionation of the complex roseroot extract in a single chromatographic step in a way that only one additional orthogonal isolation/purification step per fraction yielded 12 isolated constituents. They cover a broad polarity range and belong to different structural classes, namely, the phenylethanoid tyrosol and its glucoside salidroside, the cinnamyl alcohol glycosides rosavin, rosarin, and rosin as well as gallic acid, the cyanogenic glucoside lotaustralin, the monoterpene glucosides rosiridin and kenposide A, and the flavonoids tricin, tricin-5- O - beta -D-glucopyranoside, and rhodiosin. The most promising anti-influenza activities were determined for rhodiosin, tricin, and tricin-5- O - beta -D-glucopyranoside with IC (50) values of 7.9, 13, and 15 mu M, respectively. The herein established high-performance countercurrent chromatographic protocol enables fast and scalable access to major as well as minor roseroot constituents. This is of particular relevance for extract standardization, quality control, and further in-depth pharmacological investigations of the metabolites of this popular traditional herbal remedy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how farm animal welfare (FAW) is internalised in consumers' purchasing decisions at the point of purchase. The study is based on means-end chain theory and the laddering interview technique to elicit respondents' mental representation of attributes, consequences and values of an animal food product. Respondents were approached and interviewed at the point of purchase in two supermarkets in Uppsala, Sweden. A summary representation of respondents' mental representation of attributes, consequences and values of an animal food product (pork fillet) was created. The findings indicate that FAW is the most salient means-end-chain element. FAW enters respondents' mental representation of pork fillet at the point of purchase as a consequence of other elements. FAW is considered to lead to values of hedonism and universalism type. This study contributes to the literature by detailing how animal welfare can be embedded in consumers' mental representation of cause and effect of animal food product attributes at the point of purchase.The findings are useful practically for policy-makers and for agri-business and other actors in the food value chain who would like to promote enhanced FAW. The findings also provide insight into how FAW can be promoted through market-based solutions.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheeppox is an emerging disease in different parts of the world with a huge impact on animal health and production. Emergency vaccination might be an effective strategy to overcome this disease. In this study we characterized in detail an outbreak of sheeppox in a susceptible naive sheep population in Egypt. The local and the systemic signs as well as postmortem and the histopathological findings of the disease were confirmed. We also compared the efficacies of two commercial sheeppox vaccines (Romanian strain and RM-65 vaccines). Our results confirmed the superiority of the RM-65 vaccine compared to the Romanian strain vaccine in protecting the animals. Furthermore, we highlighted the validity of emergency vaccination to control a sheeppox outbreak. This study aimed to investigate a sheeppox outbreak in a highly susceptible naive sheep population in Kharsit village, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt. Moreover, to compare commercial sheeppox vaccines, the Romanian strain and RM-65 vaccines, as emergency vaccination against sheeppox under field conditions. In December 2018, a sheeppox outbreak occurred in a flock of 65 sheep upon the purchase of an apparently healthy ewe from outside the village. This ewe showed a systemic disease with cutaneous lesions after a few days, thereafter more cases began to appear. Cutaneous lesions in other sheep in the flock in the form of macules, papules, and scabs were common in wool-less areas of the body, in addition to fever and respiratory disorders. Postmortem findings revealed the congestion of visceral organs with apparent gross pathology of the lung. Biopsies of cutaneous lesions and visceral organs were collected, and sheeppox was identified by histopathology and transmission electron microscopy, which showed the existence of sheeppox cells and intracytoplasmic brick-shape sheeppox virions. The Romanian strain and RM-65 vaccines were used for the emergency vaccination for two different groups of animals and the third group was left as a control group. Serum samples were collected before vaccination as well as 21 days post-vaccination, and serum protein fractionation analysis was performed for all groups. The outbreak ended after 2.5 months, the cumulative incidence was 66.2%, and the overall case fatality was 51.1%. There was significantly higher protection against sheeppox infection and mortalities among RM-65 vaccine immunized group compared to Romanian strain vaccine-immunized animals at p < 0.05. RM-65-vaccinated animals did not show sheeppox cases or mortalities, compared to Romanian strain-vaccinated animals, which had mild pox signs in 78% of animals and case fatality of 35.7%. The serum protein analysis also indicated the superior performance of the RM-65 vaccine; it increased the level of alpha 1-globulin and beta-globulin compared to the Romanian strain, which increased the level of beta-globulin only. The current study shows a better performance of the tested RM-65 than the Romanian strain vaccine for emergency vaccination against sheeppox under field conditions. These findings point to the validity of emergency vaccination against sheeppox and the importance of the comparative field evaluation of vaccines; however, wide-scale studies are required for further evaluation. Future investigation of whether the Romanian strain itself or vaccine-production-related issues are responsible for these findings is required.

AB  - Most of over 1400 extant bat species produce high-frequency pulses with their larynx for echolocation. However, the debate about the evolutionary origin of laryngeal echolocation in bats remains unresolved. The morphology of the larynx is known to reflect vocal adaptation and thus can potentially help in resolving this controversy. However, the morphological variations of the larynx are poorly known in bats, and a complete anatomical study remains to be conducted. Here, we compare the 3D laryngeal morphology of 23 extant bat species of 11 different families reconstructed by using iodine contrast-enhanced X-ray microtomography techniques. We find that, contrary to previously thought, laryngeal muscle hypertrophy is not a characteristic of all bats and presents differential development. The larynges of Pteropodidae are morphologically similar to those of non-bat mammals. Two morphotypes are described among laryngeal echolocating bats, illustrating morphological differences between Rhinolophoidea and Yangochiroptera, with the main variations being the cricothyroid muscle volume and the shape of the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. For the first time we detail functional specialization for constant frequency echolocation among Rhinolophoidea. Lastly, the nasal-emitting taxa representing a polyphyletic group do not share the same laryngeal form, which raises questions about the potential modular nature of the bat larynx.

AB  - Islamic literature has indicated that daily consumption of Ajwa dates heals a variety of chronic diseases and disorders. The current research investigates the neuroprotective effect of methanolic Ajwa seed extract (MASE) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive deficits using multiple approaches. For animal studies, MASE (200 and 400 mg/kg, p.o.) was administrated for thirty consecutive days, and four doses of LPS (250 mu g/kg, i.p.) were injected to induce neurotoxicity. Memory functions were evaluated using elevated plus-maze and novel object recognition tests. Acetylcholine (ACh) and neuroinflammatory markers (cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1) were estimated in brain tissues. Studies of molecular docking and dynamics were conducted to provide insight into the molecular-level mechanisms. MASE administration resulted in a significant reversal of LPS-induced memory impairment in both maze models. Both doses of MASE elevated the ACh levels in an LPS-treated rat brain. In addition, the extract lowered COX-2 and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-beta 1) in LPS-treated brain tissues. Molecular modeling results revealed that the compound's ellagic acid, epicatechin, catechin, kaempferol, quercetin, and apigenin have the potential to act as a dual inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and COX-2 and can be responsible for the improvement of both cholinergic and inflammatory conditions, while the cinnamic acid, hesperidin, hesperetin, narengin, and rutin compounds are responsible only for the improvement of cholinergic transmission. The above compounds acted by interacting with the key residues Trp84, Asp72, Gly118, Ser200, Tyr334, and His440, which are responsible for the hydrolysis of ACh in AChE, while the COX-2 is inhibited by interacting with the residues (Val349, Leu352, Tyr355, Tyr385, Ala527, Ser530, and Leu531) of the hydrophobic channel. By promoting cholinergic activity and protecting neuroinflammation in the rat brain, MASE provides neuroprotection against LPS-induced cognitive deficits. Our preliminary findings will help with further drug discovery processes related to neuroinflammation-related neurodegeneration.

AB  - Camellia quephongensis is an endemic Theaceae species from Central Vietnam. In the present study, phenolics in extracts from leaves of this plant species were quantified. Additionally, free radical scavenging activities, alpha-amylase and albumin denaturation inhibitory effects of the extracts were evaluated. Catechins were found at significantly higher concentrations in the methanolic and ethanolic extracts compared to the other extracts. The ethanolic extract showed the most potent radical scavenging activities determined by ABTS and DPPH assays, with IC50 values of 57.88 +/- 1.89 and 47.87 +/- 0.16 mu g/mL, respectively. Furthermore, the capacity of this extract to counteract ABTS radicals was comparable with that of ascorbic acid. The ethyl acetate extract exerted the strongest alpha-amylase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 985.79 +/- 16.37 mu g/mL). The aqueous methanolic extract with the lowest IC50 value (57.56 +/- 3.28 mu g/mL) exhibited the highest protective effect on albumin against denaturation, and this was even higher than that of diclofenac. The correlation analysis demonstrated that catechins and ferulic acid may play important roles in radical scavenging activities while gallic acid, chlorogenic acid, and rutin could contribute to albumin denaturation inhibitory effects of the extracts. The findings of the study improve our understanding of bioactive phenolics and potential health benefits associated with C. quephongensis leaves.

AB  - In briefOvine conceptuses highly express phospholipase inhibitory genes just before the conceptus attachment period. Phospholipase inhibitors could synergistically work with the interferon pathway on the endometrium.AbstractIn mammals, various molecules are involved in the biochemical interaction between the conceptus and endometrium for pregnancy recognition and establishment. In ruminants, interferon tau (IFNT) is the pregnancy recognition factor; however, IFNT alone does not explain corpus luteum maintenance. Although data on factors expressed during implantation have been accumulated, we hypothesized that the conceptus produces additional uncharacterized molecules during the period of conceptus attachment. This study aimed to identify new conceptus secretory proteins involved in the biochemical interaction between the conceptus and endometrium in sheep. We analyzed RNA-sequence data of ovine conceptuses from pregnant animals on days 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 and 21. To identify novel secretory proteins, we focused on highly expressed but uncharacterized genes and performed in silico protein function analysis, identifying genes encoding phospholipase inhibitory proteins expressed on days 14 and 15. Recombinant proteins from these genes were produced, and the effects on cultured bovine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) and stromal cells (STRs) were analyzed by RNA-sequence analysis. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis demonstrated that the recombinant protein treatment upregulated 31 genes and downregulated 4 genes in EECs; it also upregulated 398 genes and downregulated 66 genes in STRs, including implantation-related genes, such as ISG15, OAS1X, OAS1Y, PARP9, PARP14, MX1 and PTGS2. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs were enriched in several implantation-related pathways, including ISG15 antivirus mechanisms. These results suggest that, in addition to numerous characterized molecules, phospholipase inhibitory protein is a new candidate molecule in enabling biochemical communication between the conceptus and endometrium.

AB  - Ghrelin, the endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor, is released pre-prandially and during periods of negative energy balance, exhibiting anti-fertility properties. In this study, twenty ewes were divided into two groups: a ghrelin-treated group receiving 1.25 mu g/kg body weight (BW) of ghrelin per day via mini-pumps for 28 days and an untreated control group. Estrus was synchronized, superovulation was induced with FSH, and embryos and follicular fluid were collected six days post-estrus. Blood samples were taken to measure LH, progesterone, and anti-M & uuml;llerian hormone (AMH) concentrations. Results indicated that in treated animals, preovulatory LH surge was weaker, and progesterone levels were lower than in controls. Differences were observed in the superovulatory response and the number of collected embryos, both being higher in controls. While AMH levels did not differ between groups at the beginning of the experiment, they were lower in treated animals at the time of FSH administration. Treated ewes exhibited a reduced number of small follicles, and their follicular fluid contained lower AMH concentrations than the controls. These findings suggest that ghrelin plays a direct role in regulating LH secretion from the pituitary and in controlling ovarian follicle development, highlighting the strong interaction between nutrition and fertility.

AB  - Despite the fact that different biomaterials are widely used in many biomedical applications, they can still cause side effects. Therefore, our aim was to assess neutrophil activity during the inflammatory phase of the repair process and long-term interactions between circulating neutrophils and Titanium (Ti) implants. Additionally, neutrophil in vitro response after stimulation by the extract of antimicrobial peptides (AMP extract), pentoxifylline (PTX) and some platelet-rich (L-PRP and PURE PRP) and platelet-poor (PPP) concentrates were tested. The study was conducted on eight sheep after Ti implant insertion into the tibia and revealed that the Ti implant did not cause any side effects during the course of experiment. After addition of L-PRP into neutrophils, culture activity of these cells significantly increased (p < 0.01), whereas treatment with AMP extract, PURE PRP, PPP or PTX caused decrease in neutrophil enzymatic response (on the basis of elastase, myeloperoxidase and alkaline phosphatase release) and free radical generation. These effects were observed in neutrophils isolated during the inflammatory phase as well as 4 and 10 months after implantation. Obtained results will be useful in regulation of inflammatory response during implantation of biomaterial and create possibility to modulate the cells response towards pro- or anti-inflammatory to reduce host tissue damage.

AB  - The effect of 10% dietary flaxseed fed for 3 and 6 weeks on serum hormone levels of fattening gilts, the fatty acid (FA) follicular fluid (FF) composition of small and large antral follicles, and the steroidogenesis and IGF-I secretion by isolated small antral follicles and their response to regulatory hormones (LH, FSH, IGF-I) was studied using immunoassay and gas chromatography analyses. Both supplemental periods increased levels of P4 and IGF-I in blood serum. A shorter period inhibited steroidogenesis (P4, T, E2) and IGF-I secretion by small antral follicles, which was associated with decreased levels of monounsaturated FAs (MUFA) and preferred n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) metabolism. A longer period stimulated hormone secretion at elevated levels of saturated FAs (SFA) at the expense of MUFAs and PUFAs preferring the n-3 PUFA metabolism. Out of ovarian regulators, only LH and IGF-I were able to alter the secretion of steroids and IGF-I by small follicles of fattening pigs fed a basal diet. The effect of flaxseed on the secretion of follicular hormones after both supplemental periods was altered by all regulatory hormones in a dose-dependent manner. The level of SFAs and PUFAs in FF of large follicles increased with the length of flaxseed feeding, suggesting the suppression of ovulation.

AB  - Prenatal CNS disruptions can be associated with physically separate findings. Examples include cognitive issues in septo-optic dysplasia and sporadic and WNT1-related unilateral cerebellar hypoplasia, and physical findings such as thinning of the corpus callosum, ventriculomegaly, hippocampal abnormalities, olfactory tract and bulb hypoplasia, and distant cortical dysplasias with schizencephaly. Similar effects to toxicities with intraventricular hemorrhage in prematurity could occur earlier in development. CSF transportation of disruption by-products would provide access to vulnerable areas through inflammatory effects on blood-brain barrier permeability. Outcomes are influenced by location and volume of byproducts in the CSF, timing, transport, and inflammatory responses. A particular association of vermis disruption with cognitive issues may be related to CSF flow distortions that avoid toxin dilutions in the third ventricle. Symmetrical contralateral cortical dysplasia with schizencephaly may reflect immunovascular field-related vulnerabilities seen in situations such as vitiligo.

AB  - The effect of curcumin (Cur) on cognitive impairment and the possible role of brain tissue oxidative stress, nitric oxide (NO) levels, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated in juvenile hypothyroid rats. The juvenile rats (21 days old) were allocated into the following groups: (1) control; (2) hypothyroid (0.05% propylthiouracil (PTU) in drinking water); (3-5) hypothyroid-Cur 50, 100, and 150, which in these groups 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg, Cur was orally administered by gavage during 6 weeks. In the hypothyroid rats, the time elapsed and the traveled distance to locate the hidden platform in the learning trials of Morris water maze (MWM) increased, and on the probe day, the amount of time spent in the target quadrant and the distance traveled in there was decreased. Hypothyroidism also decreased the latency and increased the time spent in the darkroom of the passive avoidance (PA) test. Compared with the hypothyroid group, Cur enhanced the performance of the rats in both MWM and PA tests. In addition, Cur reduced malondialdehyde concentration and NO metabolites; however, it increased thiol content as well as the activity of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase enzymes in both the cortex and hippocampus. Cur also increased hippocampal synthesis of BDNF in hypothyroid rats. The beneficial effects of Cur cognitive function in juvenile hypothyroid rats might be attributed to its protective effect against oxidative stress and potentiation of BDNF production.

AB  - The incidence of myopia, particularly high myopia, is increasing annually. Myopia has gradually become one of the leading causes of global blindness and is a considerable public-health concern. However, the pathogenesis of myopia remains unclear, and exploring the mechanism underlying myopia has become an urgent scientific priority. Creating animal models of myopia is important for studying the pathogenesis of refractive errors. This approach allows researchers to study and analyze the pathogenesis of myopia from aspects such as changes in refractive development, pathological changes in eye tissue, and molecular pathways related to myopia. This review summarizes the examples of animal models, methods of inducing myopia experimentally, and molecular signaling pathways involved in developing myopia-induced animal models. This review provides solid literature for researchers in the field of myopia prevention and control. It offers guidance in selecting appropriate animal models and research methods to fit their research objectives. By providing new insights and a theoretical basis for studying mechanisms of myopia, we detail how elucidated molecular pathways can be exploited to translate into safe and effective measures for myopia prevention and control.

AB  - Cytosine base editors (CBEs) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR method both have the ability to introduce nucleotide substitution into genomes, which exhibit great potential for improving economically important traits in livestock species. The FecG(H) mutation (g. C1184T, p. S395F) of growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9) gene increases prolificacy in Cambridge sheep and Belclare sheep. In the present study, we aimed to compare the efficiency and precision of BE4-Gam and CRISPR/Cas9 systems on generating FecG(H) mutation in ovine genome. First, the microinjection of BE4-Gam mRNA had no adverse effects on development rate after cleavage, and the efficiencies of total mutants and targeted mutants were 8.9% and 7.1%, respectively. Then, the total mutation and targeted mutation rates were improved from 8.5% to 22.5% (p < .01), and 6.4% to 16.3%, respectively, by adjusting the injection time of BE4-Gam mRNA from 14 to 12 hr post-insemination (hpi). Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR method introduced the FecG(H) mutation at the efficiency of 16.1%, which was comparable to BE4-Gam system (16.3%). There was no bystander editing event happened in edited embryos caused by CRISPR/Cas9, but the bystander editing efficiency was as high as 15.0% in BE4-Gam-edited embryos. In summary, our findings demonstrated that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated HDR method was more accurate than BE4-Gam system in introducing FecG(H) into ovine genome, and highlight the potential of the former strategy to modify economically important trait-associated SNPs.

AB  - In North Africa, Tetranychus urticae Koch, 1836 represents one of the most destructive generalists among mite herbivores. Unfortunately, it is a source of important annual casualties in crop production. It is a phytophagous mite that can feed on hundreds of host plants and produces significant damage. The control of T. urticae in North Africa has been principally based on acaricide sprays. However, new alternative methods have shown effective results, such as artificial ultraviolet-B, natural enemies, and the introduction of new genetic methods. This review aims to present a synthesis of information surrounding control methods of T. urticae in North Africa. We highlight the principal findings of previous studies. Then, we discuss current control methods and propose new innovative research and sustainable approaches to controlling this pest. The control method can potentially extrapolate in North African regions due to its positive ecological results. Further, studies proved the use of natural enemies, myco-metabolites, bacteria metabolites, and the introduction of a genetic method in an integrated long-term sustainable program that can successfully defeat the populations of T. urticae. We also discuss high-priority research guidelines to investigate new sustainable management strategies. Setting up an integrated long-term ecological monitoring program in different Northwest African countries and incorporating new technologies into monitoring programs is an urgent need to fight this devastating pest.

AB  - Ferroptosis is a newly recognized type of programmed cell death that is implicated in the pathophysiological process of neurological disorders. Our previous studies have revealed that exposure to high concentrations of fluoride for long periods of time induces hippocampal neural injury and cognitive deficits. However, whether ferroptosis is involved in fluoride -induced neuronal death and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. In this study, the results indicated that exposure to high fluoride triggered ferroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells and in the hippocampus of mice. Fluoride exposure accelerated the lysosomal degradation of GPX4 and led to neuronal ferroptosis, while GPX4 overexpression protected SH-SY5Y cells against fluoride -induced neurotoxicity. Intriguingly, the enhanced chaperone -mediated autophagy (CMA) induced by fluoride stimulation was responsible for GPX4 degradation because the inhibition of CMA activity by LAMP2A knockdown effectively prevented fluoride -induced GPX4 loss. Furthermore, mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) accumulation caused by fluoride contributed to CMA activation -mediated GPX4 degradation and subsequent neuronal ferroptosis. Notably, the ferroptosis-specific inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) or the ROS scavenger N - acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) alleviated fluoride -evoked hippocampal neuronal death and synaptic injury as well as cognitive deficits in mice. The present studies indicates that ferroptosis is a novel mechanism of fluoride -induced neurotoxicity and that chronic fluoride exposure facilitates GPX4 degradation via mtROS chaperone -mediated autophagy, leading to neuronal ferroptosis and cognitive impairment.

AB  - Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) refers to a chronic impairing psychiatric disorder occurring after exposure to the severe traumatic event. Studies have demonstrated that medicinal cannabis oil plays an important role in neuroprotection, but the mechanism by which it exerts anti-PTSD effects remains unclear. Methods: The chronic complex stress (CCS) simulating the conditions of long voyage stress for 4 weeks was used to establish the PTSD mice model. After that, behavioral tests were used to evaluate PTSD-like behaviors in mice. Mouse brain tissue index was detected and hematoxylin-eosin staining was used to assess pathological changes in the hippocampus. The indicators of cell apoptosis and the BDNF/TRPC6 signaling activation in the mice hippocampus were detected by western blotting or real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR experiments. Results: We established the PTSD mice model induced by CCS, which exhibited significant PTSD-like phenotypes, including increased anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors. Medicinal cannabis oil treatment significantly ameliorated PTSD-like behaviors and improved brain histomorphological abnormalities in CCS mice. Mechanistically, medicinal cannabis oil reduced CCS-induced cell apoptosis and enhanced the activation of BDNF/ TRPC6 signaling pathway. Conclusions: We constructed a PTSD model with CCS and medicinal cannabis oil that significantly improved anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors in CCS mice, which may play an anti-PTSD role by stimulating the BDNF/TRPC6 signaling pathway.

AB  - Plants have evolved a series of zinc (Zn) homeostasis mechanisms to cope with the fluctuating Zn in the environment. How Zn is taken up, translocated and tolerate by tea plant remains unknown. In this study, on the basis of RNA-Sequencing, we isolated a plasma membrane-localized Metal Tolerance Protein (MTP) family member CsMTP4 from Zn-deficient tea plant roots and investigated its role in regulation of Zn homeostasis in tea plant. Heterologous expression of CsMTP4 specifically enhanced the tolerance of transgenic yeast to Zn excess. Moreover, overexpression of CsMTP4 in tea plant hairy roots stimulated Zn uptake under Zn deficiency. In addition, CsMTP4 promoted the growth of transgenic Arabidopsis plants by translocating Zn from roots to shoots under Zn deficiency and conferred the tolerance to Zn excess by enhancing the efflux of Zn from root cells. Transcriptome analysis of the CsMTP4 transgenic Arabidopsis found that the expression of Zn metabolism-related genes were differentially regulated compared with wild-type plants when exposed to Zn deficiency and excess conditions. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of Zn uptake and translocation in plants and a new strategy to improve phytoremediation efficiency.

AB  - Melatonin is a neurohormone synthesized by the pineal gland to regulate the circadian rhythms and has proven to be effective in treating drug addiction and dependence. However, the effects of melatonin to modulate the drug-seeking behavior of fentanyl and its underlying molecular mechanism is elusive. This study was designed to investigate the effects of melatonin on fentanyl - induced behavioral sensitization and circadian rhythm disorders in mice. The accompanying changes in the expression of Brain and Muscle Arnt-Like (BMAL1), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) in relevant brain regions including the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), nucleus accumbens (NAc), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and hippocampus (Hip) were investigated by western blot assays to dissect the mechanism by which melatonin modulates fentanyl - induced behavioral sensitization and circadian rhythm disorders. The present study suggest that fentanyl (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) could induce behavioral sensitization and melatonin (30.0 mg/kg) could attenuate the behavioral sensitization and circadian rhythm disorders in mice. Fentanyl treatment reduced the expression of BMAL1 and MAO-A and increased that of TH in relevant brain regions. Furthermore, melatonin treatment could reverse the expression levels of BMAL1, MAO-A, and TH. In conclusion, our study demonstrate for the first time that melatonin has therapeutic potential for fentanyl addiction.

AB  - Electroconvulsive shock (ECT) is the most effective treatment for depression but can impair learning and memory. ECT is increasingly being shown to activate astrocytes and induce neuroinflammation, resulting in cognitive decline. Activated astrocytes can differentiate into two subtypes, A1-type astrocytes and A2-type as-trocytes. Regarding cognitive function, neurotoxic A1 astrocytes and neuroprotective A2 astrocytes may exhibit opposite effects. Specifically, prokineticin 2 (PK2) functions as an essential mediator of inflammation and in-duces a selective A2-protective phenotype in astrocytes. This study aimed to clarify how PK2 promotes improved learning memory following electroconvulsive shock (ECS). As part of the study, rats were modeled using chronic unpredictable mild stress. Behavioral experiments were conducted to assess their cognitive abilities and depression-like behaviors. Western blot was used to determine the expression of PK2. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopy analyses of the hippocampal CA1 region were conducted to study the activation of astrocyte subtypes and synaptic ultrastructure, respectively. In this study, rats' spatial learning and memory impairment began to improve as activated A1-subtype astrocytes gradually decreased, and PK2 and A2 phenotype activation peaked on the third day after ECS. PKRA7 (PK2 antagonist) inhibits A2-type astrocyte activation partially and suppresses spatial learning and memory improvement. Collectively, our findings support that PK2 may induce a selective modulation of astrocytic polarization to a protective phenotype to promote learning and memory improvement after ECS

AB  - Placental development is modified in response to maternal nutrient restriction (NR), resulting in a spectrum of fetal growth rates. Pregnant sheep carrying singleton fetuses and fed either 100% (n = 8) or 50% (NR; n = 28) of their National Research Council (NRC) recommended intake from days 35-135 of pregnancy were used to elucidate placentome transcriptome alterations at both day 70 and day 135. NR fetuses were further designated into upper (NR NonSGA; n = 7) and lower quartiles (NR SGA; n = 7) based on day 135 fetal weight. At day 70 of pregnancy, there were 22 genes dysregulated between NR SGA and 100% NRC placentomes, 27 genes between NR NonSGA and 100% NRC placentomes, and 22 genes between NR SGA and NR NonSGA placentomes. These genes mediated molecular functions such as MHC class II protein binding, signaling receptor binding, and cytokine activity. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed significant overrepresentation of genes for natural-killer-cell-mediated cytotoxicity in NR SGA compared to 100% NRC placentomes, and alterations in nutrient utilization pathways between NR SGA and NR NonSGA placentomes at day 70. Results identify novel factors associated with impaired function in SGA placentomes and potential for placentomes from NR NonSGA pregnancies to adapt to nutritional hardship.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders have a pathophysiology that heavily involves neuroinflammation. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to create a model of cognitive impairment by inducing systemic and neuroinflammation in experimental animals. LPS was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg during the last seven days of the study. Adalimumab (ADA), a TNF-alpha inhibitor, was injected at a dose of 10 mg/kg a total of 3 times throughout the study. On the last two days of the experiment, 50 mg/kg of curcumin was administered orally as a positive control group. Open field (OF) and elevated plus maze tests (EPM) were used to measure anxiety-like behaviors. The tail suspension test (TST) was used to measure depression-like behaviors, while the novel object recognition test (NOR) was used to measure learning and memory activities. Blood and hippocampal TNF alpha and nitric oxide (NO) levels, hippocampal BDNF, CREB, and ACh levels, and AChE activity were measured by ELISA. LPS increased anxiety and depression-like behaviors while decreasing the activity of the learningmemory system. LPS exerted this effect by causing systemic and neuroinflammation, cholinergic dysfunction, and impaired BDNF release. ADA controlled LPS-induced behavioral changes and improved biochemical markers. ADA prevented cognitive impairment induced by LPS by inhibiting inflammation and regulating the release of BDNF and the cholinergic pathway.

AB  - IntroductionIn the current study, we investigate whether oral administration of agmatine (AGM) could effectively reduce motor and cognitive deficits induced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in an animal model of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) through neuroprotective mechanisms. MethodsThe Wistar rats were divided into four groups: sham, BDL, BDL+ 40 mg/kg AGM, and BDL+ 80 mg/kg AGM. The BDL rats were treated with AGM from 2 weeks after the surgery for 4 consecutive weeks. The open field, rotarod, and wire grip tests were used to assess motor function and muscle strength. The novel object recognition test (NOR) was performed to evaluate learning and memory. Finally, blood samples were collected for the analysis of the liver markers, the animals were sacrificed, and brain tissues were removed; the CA1 regions of the hippocampus and cerebellum were processed to identify apoptosis and neuronal damage rate using caspase-3 immunocytochemistry and Nissl staining. ResultsThe serological assay results showed that BDL severely impaired the function of the liver. Based on histochemical findings, BDL increased the neuronal damage in CA1 and Purkinje cells, whereas apoptosis was significantly observed only in the cerebellum. AGM treatment prevented the increase of serum liver enzymes, balance deficits, and neuronal damage in the brain areas. Apoptosis partially decreased by AGM, and there were no differences in the performance of animals in different groups in the NOR. ConclusionsThe study suggests AGM as a potential treatment candidate for HE because of its neuroprotective properties and/or its direct effects on liver function.

AB  - We present an engineering-scale model for the migration of porosity in a fuel pellet experiencing a temperature gradient. The system of coupled pore advection and heat diffusion equations governing the problem is solved by a fixed-point iteration technique. The coupling between porosity and temperature fields is considered via the dependency of pore advection velocity on the local temperature and temperature gradient, and via the dependency of fuel thermal conductivity and of the volumetric power source on the local porosity. We employ the finite element method to discretize the resulting equations. As pure advection solutions obtained by this method are well-known to present spurious spatial oscillations, we introduce stabilization techniques in the pore advection equation. The proposed model is first tested against a benchmark problem representative for the conditions of an uranium-plutonium oxide fuel pellet irradiated in a sodium fast reactor. The results are compared to the those obtained by a model implemented in the BISON fuel performance code. The analysis shows how the results of the newly developed model are in line with those obtained by the reference model, and underlines a superior stability of the solution. The model is then applied to analyze the contribution of as-fabricated and crack-induced porosities in determining the fuel restructuring and in particular the central hole formation. A comparison to experimental data shows the impact of considering crack-induced porosity to predict the extent of the central void. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Moderate physical training has been shown to hinder age-related memory decline. While the benefits of physical training on hippocampal memory function are well-documented, little is known about its impact on working memory, which is linked to the prelimbic cortex (PrL), one major subdivision of the prefrontal cortex. Here, we examined the effects of physical training on spatial working memory in a well-established animal model of physical training, starting at 16 months of age and continuing for 5 months (running wheel 1 h/day and 5 days/week). This training strategy improved spatial working memory in aged mice (22-month-old), which was accompanied by an increased spine density and a lower TAF15 expression in the PrL. Specifically, physical training affected both thin and mushroom-type spines on PrL pyramidal cells, and prevented age-related loss of spines on selective segments of apical dendritic branches. Correlation analysis revealed that increased TAF15-expression was detrimental to the dendritic spines. However, physical training downregulated TAF15 expression in the PrL, preserving the dendritic spines on PrL pyramidal cells and improving working memory in trained aged mice. When TAF15 was overexpressed in the PrL via a viral approach, the benefits of physical training on the dendritic spines and working memory were abolished. These data suggest that physical training at a moderate pace might downregulate TAF15 expression in the PrL, which favors the dendritic spines on PrL pyramidal cells, thereby improving spatial working memory.

AB  - The supramolecular striatin-interacting phosphatases and kinases (STRIPAK) complex is highly conserved in eukaryotes and controls diverse developmental processes in fungi. STRIPAK is genetically and physically linked to the Hippo-related septation initiation network (SIN), which signals through a chain of three kinases, including the terminal nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) family kinase DBF2. Here, we provide evidence for the function of DBF2 during sexual development and vegetative growth of the homothallic ascomycetous model fungus Sordaria macrospora. Using mutants with a deleted dbf2 gene and complemented strains carrying different variants of dbf2, we demonstrate that dbf2 is essential for fruiting body formation, as well as septum formation of vegetative hyphae. Furthermore, we constructed dbf2 mutants carrying phospho-mimetic and phospho-deficient codons for two conserved phosphorylation sites. Growth tests of the phosphorylation mutants showed that coordinated phosphorylation is crucial for controlling vegetative growth rates and maintaining proper septum distances. Finally, we investigated the function of DBF2 by overexpressing the dbf2 gene. The corresponding transformants showed disturbed cytokinesis during ascospore formation. Thus, regulated phosphorylation of DBF2 and precise expression of the dbf2 gene are essential for accurate septation in vegetative hyphae and coordinated cell division during septation and sexual spore formation.

AB  - Two fungal strains belonging to Ascomycota were discovered in Gyeonggi-do, Korea, during this investigation of soil microfungi and microbiota of insects. The strain KNUF-20-047 produced milky white on the back and a milky creamy center to white toward the margin on the front side of colonies. Conversely, the closest Xenoacremonium falcatus displayed a pale luteous to luteous center, white toward margins on the front side, and pale luteous or luteous pigment on the back side, whereas X. recifei produced white colonies. The conidiophores of KNUF-20-047 were slightly larger than those of X. falcatus, and the conidia were distinct from X. recifei. Strain KNUF-20-NI-005 produced light brown to subhyaline conidiophores up to 56.0 mu m tall, whereas Rhinocladiella anceps displayed golden to dark brown conidiophores up to 350 mu m. Strain KNUF-20-NI-005 also produced larger conidia than R. anceps but smaller than R. coryli and R. fasciculata. Moreover, the molecular phylogeny strongly supports the detailed description and illustration of each proposed species to be designated as Xenoacremonium minutisporum sp. nov. and Rhinocladiella terrigenum sp. nov. in Korea.

AB  - BackgroundThe Lung is the major focus of therapeutic approaches for the inherited disorder cystic fibrosis (CF) as without treatment lung disease is life-limiting. However, the initiating events that predispose the CF lung to cycles of infection, inflammation and resultant tissue damage are still unclear. Inflammation may occur in the CF lung prior to birth in human and several large animal models suggesting an in utero origin for the disease and encouraging further studies prior to birth.MethodsHere we used the sheep model of CF (CFTR-/-) and age-matched wild-type (WT) sheep of the same breed to investigate the single cell transcriptomes of proximal and distal lung tissue at 80 days and 120 days of gestation and at term (147 days). Single cell RNA-seq was performed on tissues from 4 to 7 animals of each genotype (WT and CFTR-/-) at each time point.ResultsAt term, FOXJ1-expressing ciliated cells are overrepresented in both lung regions from CFTR-/- lambs, while secretory epithelial and basal cells are underrepresented in proximal lung, as are T cells and monocytes in distal lung. The imbalance in ciliated and basal cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. At 120 days of gestation, lymphoid cells are slightly more abundant in proximal and distal lung from CFTR-/- animals compared to WT, consistent with the transient CF-associated inflammatory response in utero. At 80 days of gestation, T and B cells are underrepresented in both lung regions.ConclusionsThe differences in epithelial cell abundance observed in the CFTR-/- lambs at term may reflect sequelae from the loss of CFTR on lung development and differentiation in utero. These findings provide novel insights into the cellular mechanisms of pathology and may be relevant to the design of new therapeutic approaches for CF lung disease.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of spatially and/or temporally asynchronous transfer of in vivo embryos at different stages in ewes during the breeding season. Four experiments were carried out. In Experiment 1, 207 blastocysts that had been frozen and thawed were transferred into the oviducts of 43 day two recipients, the oviducts of 23 day six recipients, and the uteri of 141 day six recipients, respectively. In Experiment 2, 287 fresh blastocysts were transferred into the oviducts of 26 day six recipients and the uteri of 261 day six recipients, respectively. In Experiment 3, 104 2-cell stage embryos were transferred into the oviducts of 80 day two recipients and the uteri of 24 day two recipients, respectively. In Experiment 4, 175 8-cell stage embryos were transferred into the oviducts of 160 day three recipients and the uteri of 15 day three recipients, respectively. The results showed that spatially asynchronous but temporally synchronous uterine transfers of fresh cleavage-stage embryos or oviductal transfers of fresh blastocysts did not compromise pregnancy and lambing. Furthermore, the oviductal transfers of frozen blastocysts significantly increased the pregnancy rate compared with uterine transfers of frozen blastocysts. Additionally, it is worth noting that the oviduct may be the most suitable microenvironment for frozen embryos in ewes. More studies should be conducted to assess the effects of asynchronous embryo transfer in ewes in a large sample size.

AB  - The present study aims to evaluate season-and reproductive-stage dependent variation in culture characteristics and expression of pluripotency and adhesion markers in caprine-male germline stem cells (cmGSCs). For this, testes from pre-pubertal (4-6 months) and adult (similar to 2 years) bucks during non-breeding (July-August; n = 4 each) and breeding (October-November; n = 4 each) seasons were used to isolated testicular cells by two-step enzymatic digestion. After cmGSCs enrichment by multiple methods (differential platting, Percoll density gradient centrifugation, and MACS), cell viability of CD90(+) cells was assessed before co-cultured onto the Sertoli cell feeder layer up to 3rd-passage (P-3). The culture characteristics of cmGSCs were compared during primary culture (P-0) and P-3 with different assays [BrdU-assay (proliferation), MTT-assay (senescence), and Cluster-forming activity-assay] and transcript expression analyses by qRT-PCR. Moreover, the co-localization of UCHL-1, CD90, and DBA was examined by a double-immunofluorescence method. In adult bucks, significantly (p < 0.05) higher cell numbers with the ability to proliferate faster and form a greater number of cell clusters, besides up-regulation of pluripotency and adhesion markers expression were observed during the breeding season than the non-breeding season. In contrast, such season-dependent variation was lacking in pre-pubertal bucks. The expression of transcripts during non-breeding seasons was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in pre-pubertal cmGSCs than in adult cells (UCHL-1 = 2.38-folds; CD-90 = 6.66-folds; PLZF = 20.87-folds; ID-4 = 4.75-folds; E-cadherin = 3.89-folds and beta 1-integrin = 5.70-folds). Overall, the reproductive stage and season affect the population, culture characteristics, and expression of pluripotency and adhesion specific markers in buck testis. These results provide an insight to develop an efficient system for successful cell culture processes targeting cmGSCs.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this study was to explore the regulatory effects of miR-10a-5b on the proliferation and differentiation of porcine preadipocytes. Our results showed that miR-10a-5b targets KLF11, suppresses proliferation, and promotes differentiation in preadipocytes. Therefore, we concluded that miR-10a-5b plays a significant role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of preadipocytes.Abstract In the swine industry, meat quality, color, and texture are influenced by the excessive differentiation of fat cells. miRNAs have emerged as integral regulators of adipose development. This study delves into the influence of miR-10a-5b on the proliferation and differentiation of pig preadipocytes. Our findings reveal that miR-10a-5b is prevalent across various tissues. It hinders preadipocyte proliferation, amplifies the expression of adipogenic genes, promotes lipid accumulation, and, as a result, advances preadipocyte differentiation. We predict that KLF11 is the target gene of miRNA. A dual-fluorescence reporter assay was conducted to validate the binding sites of miR-10a-5b on the 3 ' UTR of the KLF11 mRNA. Results showed that miR-10a-5b targeted KLF11 3 ' UTR and reduced the fluorescence activity of the dual-fluorescent reporter vector. Our research also indicates that miR-10a-5b targets and downregulates the expression of both mRNA and the protein levels of KLF11. During the differentiation of the preadipocytes, KLF11 inhibited adipose differentiation and was able to suppress the promotion of adipose differentiation by miR-10a-5b. This underscores miR-10a-5b's potential as a significant regulator of preadipocyte behavior by modulating KLF11 expression, offering insights into the role of functional miRNAs in fat deposition.

AB  - Centrally situated in France, hosting famous chateaus and vineyards yet oddly secluded, the extensive, diamond-shaped region known as Sologne is a geological elephant in the room. Nationally one of the last regions to be fully surveyed, this deceptively uniform yellow patch on small-scale geological maps is presented here and portrayed for the first time as a fluvial megafan. Its attributes are compiled and reviewed from a collection of reports, maps, handbooks and articles. Evidence shows that this similar to 100-m-thick Neogene accumulation of quartz-rich sand and clay was primarily generated by the Loire River and remained intermittently functional until early Quaternary time, whereupon dissection by the Loire River itself and by its fan-fed tributary streams prevailed. The similar to 120-km-long megafan was fed from the south by the rising volcanic swell of the Massif Central in a succession of pulses, relatively well-dated by different generations of accessory volcanic minerals. Sediment aggradation conforms to a pattern for which modern analogues may only exist in Africa, a continent hosting many dozens of swells of a similar nature to the Massif Central, with adjacent basins populated by very large megafans fed by swell-flank rivers. As such, the Loire megafan is a unique occurrence in Europe.

AB  - The present study examined the memory modulatory effect of epinephrine on latent learning of an inhibitory avoidance task. Male Sprague-Dawley rats on the first day were subjected to one of three conditions (no, short or long) in pre-exposure to the task apparatus. One day or several days later, they received the typical inhibitory avoidance training with a 0.5 mA/0.5 s foot shock. Memory of the inhibitory avoidance response was tested one day after the foot-shock training. The long pre-exposure group showed better memory than the no or short preexposure group, and this latent memory could last for 6 days: Retention scores of the long pre-exposure group were significantly better than those of the no pre-exposure group if the shock training was given 3 or 6 days, but not 12 or 21 days, after the pre-exposure. Epinephrine injected after the pre-exposure training modulated the latent memory in a dose- and time-dependent manner: 0.01 mg/kg given shortly after the short pre-exposure enhanced the memory, but 0.5 mg/kg given shortly after the long pre-exposure impaired it. Epinephrine injected 4 h after the pre-exposure had no effect, neither did that given to rats pre-exposed to a different context. Epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg) also made the latent memory lasting longer as the rats treated with it showed significant avoidance behavior when they had the shock training at 12 or 21 days after the pre-exposure. These findings suggest that epinephrine could modulate memory formed in the latent learning.

AB  - In vitro embryo production (IVP) is of great importance to the porcine industry, as well as for basic research and biomedical applications. Despite the large efforts made in laboratories worldwide to address suboptimal culture conditions, porcine IVP remains inefficient. Nobiletin (Nob, 5,6,7,8,3 ' ,4 ' hexamethoxyflavone) supplementation to in vitro culture (IVC) medium, enhances in vitro embryo development in various species. However, its impact on the quality and developmental capacity of in vitro-produced pig embryos is yet to be established. This study evaluated the effects of different concentrations (2.5 and 5 mu M) of Nob during the early culture of in vitro -pro- duced pig embryos on embryo developmental competence, mitochondrial activity, lipid content, intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Glutathione (GSH) content, Total Cell Number (TCN) per blastocyst, and expression of genes related to embryo development, quality and oxidative stress. Embryos cultured in medium without Nob supplementation and in medium supplemented with 0.01 % dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-vehicle for Nob) constituted the Control and DMSO groups, respectively. Embryo development rates were evaluated on Days 2, 6 and 7 of IVC. Additionally, a representative group of embryos was selected to assess mitochondrial activity, lipid, ROS and GSH content (on Days 2 and 6 of IVC), TCN assessment and gene expression analyses (on Day 6 of IVC). No significant differences were observed in any of the parameters evaluated on Day 2 of IVC. In contrast, embryos cultured under the presence of Nob 2.5 showed higher developmental rates on Days 6 and 7 of IVC. In addition, Day 6 embryos showed increased mitochondrial activity, with decreased levels of ROS and GSH in the Nob 2.5 group compared to the other groups. Both Nob 2.5 and Nob 5 embryos showed higher TCN compared to the Control and DMSO groups. Furthermore, Nob 2.5 and Nob 5 upregulated the expression of Superoxide dismutase type 1 (SOD1) and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PDH) genes, which could help to counteract oxidative stress during IVC. In conclusion, the addition of Nob during the first 48 h of IVC increased porcine embryo development rates and enhanced their quality, including the upregulation of relevant genes that potentially improved the overall efficiency of the IVP system.

AB  - Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) isolated ex vivo are essential original cells to produce cultured meat. Currently, one of the main obstacles for cultured meat production derives from the limited capacity of large-scale amplification of MuSCs, especially under high-density culture condition. Here, we show that at higher cell densities, proliferation and differentiation capacities of porcine MuSCs are impaired. We investigate the roles of Hippo-YAP signaling, which is important regulators in response to cell contact inhibition. Interestingly, abundant but not functional YAP proteins are accumulated in MuSCs seeded at high density. When treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the activator of YAP, porcine MuSCs exhibit increased proliferation and elevated differentiation potential compared with control cells. Moreover, constitutively active YAP with deactivated phosphorylation sites, but not intact YAP, promotes cell proliferation and stemness maintenance of MuSCs. Together, we reveal a potential molecular target that enables massive MuSCs expansion for large-scale cultured meat production under high-density condition.

AB  - Though patients with diabetes mellitus are reported to show deficits in social interaction, the mechanisms of these impairments are unclear. The present study investigated the role of AMPA and neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptors in the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in the social behavior of diabetic mice. In the three-chamber test, streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice showed impairment in social novelty preference, but not in sociability. Injection of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX into vHC or BLA each restored social novelty preference in STZ-induced diabetic mice. NPY content in amygdala, but not in vHC, of STZ-induced diabetic mice was increased relative to non-diabetic mice. In STZ-induced diabetic mice, injection of the NPY Y-2 receptor antagonist BIIE 0246 into BLA restored social novelty preference, whereas injection of BIIE 0246 into vHC was without effect. Finally, in non-diabetic mice social novelty preference was impaired by the NPY Y-2 receptor agonist NPY 13-36 injected into BLA and restored by co-injection of NBQX. These results indicate that in diabetic mice glutamatergic function is enhanced in both vHC and BLA, which impairs social novelty preference through AMPA receptors. In addition, they indicate that NPYergic function in BLA, but not vHC, is enhanced in diabetic mice, which impairs social novelty preference through NPY Y-2 receptors.

AB  - Under physiological and pathological conditions, melatonin (MEL) can regulate microRNA (miRNA) expression. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulatory effects of MEL on miRNAs in ovaries are not understood. Firstly, by using fluorescence in situ hybridisation, we found that in ovaries and follicular granulosa cells (FGCs), MT1 co-located with miR-21 and let-7b. Additionally, immunofluorescence revealed that MT1, STAT3, c-MYC and LIN28 proteins co-located. The mRNA and protein levels of STAT3, c-MYC and LIN28 increased under treatment with 10-7 M MEL. MEL induced an increase in miR-21 and a decrease in let-7b.The LIN28/let-7b and STAT3/miR-21 axes are related to cell differentiation, apoptosis and proliferation. We explored whether the STAT3/c-MYC/LIN28 pathway was involved in miRNA regulation by MEL to explore the putative mechanism of the above relationship. AG490, an inhibitor of the STAT3 pathway, was added before MEL treatment. AG490 inhibited the MEL-induced increases in STAT3, c-MYC, LIN28 and MT1 and changes in miRNA. Through live-cell detection, we discovered that MEL enhanced the proliferation of FGCs. However, the ki67 protein levels decreased when AG490 was added in advance. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay verified that STAT3, LIN28 and MT1 were target genes of let-7b. Furthermore, STAT3 and SMAD7 were target genes of miR-21. In addition, the protein levels of the STAT3, c-MYC, LIN28 and MEL receptors decreased when let-7b was overexpressed in FGCs. Overall, MEL might regulate miRNA expression through the STAT3 pathway. In addition, a negative feedback loop between the STAT3 and miR-21 formed; MEL and let-7b antagonized each other in FGCs. These findings may provide a theoretical basis for improving the reproductive performance of Tibetan sheep through MEL and miRNAs.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Exercise has significant health benefits and can enhance learning. A single bout of high-intensity resistance training may be sufficient to improve memory. This study aimed to assess memory enhancement by a single bout of high-intensity resistance training and to examine the neural underpinnings using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Sixty young adults (34 men and 26 women), divided into the training and control groups, participated. The first session included verbal memory recall tests (cued- and free-recall), resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and a single-bout high-intensity resistance training for the training group. Two days later, they underwent post-intervention memory tests and rs-fMRI. The study design was 2 groups x 2 sessions for memory tests, and within training group comparisons for rs-fMRI. Results Compared to the control group without resistance training, the training group showed higher cued-recall performance 2 days after the brief resistance training (training: +0.27, control: -0.13, interaction: p = .01), and their free-recall scores were associated with enhanced left posterior hippocampal connectivity (r = .64, p < .001). Conclusions These results suggest that brief high-intensity resistance exercise/strength training could enhance memory without repeated exercising. The quick effect of resistance training on memory and hippocampal connectivity could be revealed. A focused and one-shot exercise may be sufficient to enhance memory performance and neural plasticity in a few days.

AB  - Excessively released proinflammatory mediators from activated macrophages and lymphocytes may contribute to the etiology of depression. However, the relationship between lymphocytes and depression is not fully un-derstood. Although women have higher depression risk than men, sex/gender differences in psychoneur-oimmunological mechanisms are still unclear. To explore these two questions, chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was used to evaluate the changes in behaviors, inflammation and lymphocyte subtypes in adult male and female Wistar rats. Results show that CUMS increased anhedonia and anxiety-like behaviors, along with increased serum corticosterone, hippocampal pro-inflammatory factors, CD11b, IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IL-17, but decreased CD4, CD25, CD4/CD8 ratio, GFAP, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and NE concentrations, regardless of sex. There was no positive correlation between sucrose preference and blood CD4/CD8 ratio, but a positive correlation between sucrose preference and spleen CD25, sucrose preference and neurotransmitters (NE and 5 -HT), spleen CD25 and serum TGF-beta 1/IL-6 ratio were found, regardless of sex. Females presented higher basal locomotion, blood CD4, CD4/CD8 ratio, serum corticosteroid and IL-6 concentrations, but lower hippocampal norepinephrine (NE) than males. Although CUMS didn't induce significant sex differences, females presented more changes in CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes than male rats. CUMS caused abnormalities in corticosteroid, lymphocytes, cytokines and neurotransmitters, which might be the precursors for inducing depression-like be-haviors in both sexes.

AB  - The present study was conducted to ascertain whether the role of kisspeptin in promoting in vitro development of preantral follicles was through the regulation of P450 aromatase gene expression and steroidogenesis in sheep. Accordingly, the cumulus cells and oocytes were collected from different development stages of preantral follicles grown in vivo and cultured in vitro in TCM199B (Group I), TCM199B + KP (10 mu g/mL) (Group II) and Standard medium + KP (10 mu g/mL). To measure the steroid (Estradiol-17 beta; E-2 and Progesterone; P-4) synthesis through ELISA, spent culture medium was collected separately from the same in vitro groups. E-2 synthesis in the spent medium collected from all the three groups showed an increasing trend from PFs' exposed to respective culture media for 3 min to 2-day culture stage but decreased thereafter till 6-day culture stage. This is followed by a sharp increase in E-2 concentration in the spent medium collected after in vitro maturation. However, P-4 synthesis in group III followed increased pattern as the development progressed from PFs' exposed to culture medium for 3 min to in vitro maturation stage. The steroid production was observed at all stages of in vitro development in altered supplemented conditions. The steroid synthesis in the spent medium was highest in the 6 day cultured PFs' in Standard medium + KP matured in vitro for 24 h. Therefore, supplementation of kisspeptin along with other growth factors promoted steroid production in cultured preantral follicles far better than in other media.

AB  - At the interface between genes and environment, epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation and histone modification, regulate neurogenic processes such as differentiation, proliferation, and maturation of neural stem cells. However, these mechanisms are altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative condition that mainly affects older adults. Since epigenetic mechanisms are known to be reversible, a number of molecules from natural sources are being studied as epigenetic regulators in AD. Recently, in vitro and in silico studies have shown that C. subedentata and its alkaloids modulated neurotoxicity. However, studies exploring the epigenetic activity of these alkaloids are limited. We conducted a set of bioassays to evaluate neuronal differentiation and the sensitivity of undifferentiated SH-SY5 cells against a neurotoxic stimulus. In addition, we analyzed the methylation profiles in genes such as APP, PSI, and BACE1 due to their role in amyloid processing. Docking and molecular dynamic analysis were used to explore the effect exerted by C. subedentata alkaloids on the regulation of histone deacetylases (HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC7). The results demonstrated that C. subedentata and galantamine induce neuronal differentiation and protect the undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells against A beta(1-42)-induced neurotoxicity. The methylation profiles of the studied genes show no statistically significant differences between C. subedentata, galantamine. However, these findings should be interpreted with caution, since small changes in methylation promoters in the brain could not be easily detected. Results from in silico approaches describe for the first time the potential promissing epigenetic effects of galantamine by regulating HDAC3 and HDAC7 modification.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - Introduction: Chronic stress exposure is the main environmental factor leading to cognitive impairment, but the detailed molecular mechanism is still unclear. Adenosine Deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA1(ADAR1) is involved in the occurrence of chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment. In addition, dopamine and Adenosine 3 ' 5 '-monophosphate-regulated phospho-protein (DARPP-32) gene variation affects cognitive function. Therefore, we hypothesized that ADAR1 plays a key role in chronic stress-induced cognitive impairment by acting on DARPP-32.Methods: In this study, postnatal 21-day-old male BALB/c mice were exposed to chronic unpredictable stressors. After that, the mice were treated with ADAR1 inducer/inhibitor. The cognitive ability and cerebral DARPP-32 protein expression of BALB/c mice were evaluated. In order to explore the link between ADAR1 and DARPP-32, the effects of ADAR1 high/low expression on DARPP-32 protein expression in vitro were detected.Results: ADAR1 inducer alleviates cognitive impairment and recovers decreased DARPP-32 protein expression of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in BALB/c mice with chronic unpredictable stress exposure. In vivo and in vitro studies confirm the results predicted by bio-informatics; that is, ADAR1 affects DARPP-32 expression via miR-874-3p.Discussion: The results in this study demonstrate that ADAR1 affects the expression of DARPP-32 via miR-874-3p, which is involved in the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis in chronic unpredictable stress-induced cognitive impairment. The new findings of this study provide a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention and treatment of stress cognitive impairment from epigenetics.

AB  - Pre-stimulation of plants can change their resistance mechanisms, thereby enhancing their defense responses. Beauveria bassiana, a broad-spectrum entomogenous fungi, can also induce plant defenses, but it received little attention. Here, we show that B. bassiana can act as a stimulus to prime tomato defense responses, improving resistance in the plant to herbivore stress. The results illustrated that four defense genes (PIN2, PR2, PAL, and MPK3) were upregulated in all B. bassiana treatments, especially the phenylalanine deaminase (PAL) gene, which was highly expressed in tomato plants after B. bassiana inoculation. Feeding through Bemisia tabaci resulted in a weak upregulation of defense genes. However, in combined fungal inoculation and B. tabaci feeding, a total of nine defense genes were upregulated, among which five genes-PAL, PPO, PIN2, PR2, and PR1-were closely related to the phenol synthesis. The results of tomato plant metabolism showed that B. bassiana mainly activates tomato phenylpropane metabolic pathways, with this modulation being influenced by jasmonate. Further explorations revealed a significant enhancement in the antioxidant capacity of the plants, as evidenced by the determination of their antioxidant compounds and the coloration of leaf phenolic substances. Thus, entomopathogenic fungi can act as an exogenous substance to activate the defense responses of tomatoes without damaging the plant, indicating a good potential for developing applications using B. bassiana to promote resistance in tomatoes for pest management.

AB  - In an effort to mitigate piglet acute responses to surgical castration, the procedure can be preceded by injections of a local anaesthetic. Regardless of potential benefits at castration, the impact of local anaesthetics on piglet welfare following the procedure remains under-documented. The present paper is based on data collected in two separate castration studies investigating the impact of injection with procaine, using different injection methods, different volumes of injected drug and different timing of injection, on behavioural responses of 3-4 day old piglets, as measured by indicators of social motivation immediately after castration (Study 1 and 2), as well as behaviours recorded continuously for 10 min upon return to the home pen (Study 2 only). Study 1 involved 597 piglets, and 13 treatments: castration without anaesthesia (CC), local anaesthesia followed by castration involving all combinations of two methods of injection (intra-funicular and intra-testicular) and four intervals between injection and castration (2.5, 5, 10 and 30 min), and sham handling separated by the same four intervals (SH). Study 2 involved 290 piglets and 5 treatments: castration without anaesthesia (CC), castration after intratesticular injections of 0.5 or 0.3 mL of procaine per testis, and sham handling with either one (SH1) or two stays in a castration bench (SH2). Across both studies, piglets injected with procaine showed signs of reduced motivation to approach their siblings in the social motivation test compared to controls castrated without anaesthesia or sham handled. The indicators of social motivation did not differ from the controls in case of castration 30 min after drug injection. In addition, responses shown in the social motivation test were less impacted after injection of 0.3 compared to 0.5 mL of procaine per testis. In Study 2, piglets injected with 0.5 mL of procaine appeared to be less active at the udder, and displayed more huddled up postures, immediately upon return to the home pen, as compared to piglets injected with 0.3 mL of procaine or the controls castrated without anaesthesia or sham handled. Altogether, the results suggest that injections with a procaine-based local anaesthetic negatively impact the responses of piglets in a test of social motivation as well as the home-pen behaviour of piglets in the early post-operative period. The present results call for attention towards the post-surgical phase, but understanding the potential welfare impacts as well as the motivational changes underlying these findings require further study.

AB  - Durable host plant resistance (HPR) to insect pests is critical for sustainable agriculture. Natural variation exists for aphid HPR in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), but the genetic architecture and phenotype have not been clarified and characterized for most sources. In order to assess the current threat of a sorghum aphid (Melanaphis sorghi) biotype shift, we characterized the phenotype of Resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1 (RMES1) and additional HPR architecture in globally admixed populations selected under severe sorghum aphid infestation in Haiti. We found RMES1 reduces sorghum aphid fecundity but not bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) fecundity, suggesting a discriminant HPR response typical of gene-for-gene interaction. A second resistant gene, Resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 2 (RMES2), was more frequent than RMES1 resistant alleles in landraces and historic breeding lines. RMES2 contributes early and mid-season aphid resistance in a segregating F2 population; however, RMES1 was only significant with mid-season fitness. In a fixed population with high sorghum aphid resistance, RMES1 and RMES2 were selected for demonstrating a lack of severe antagonistic pleiotropy. Associations with resistance colocated with cyanogenic glucoside biosynthesis genes support additional HPR sources. Globally, therefore, an HPR source vulnerable to biotype shift via selection pressure (RMES1) is bolstered by a second common source of resistance in breeding programs (RMES2), which may be staving off a biotype shift and is critical for sustainable sorghum production. Global sorghum production is threatened by herbivorous insects and, recently, sorghum aphids. We tested hypotheses regarding global host plant resistance (HPR) and its risk of being overcome by emergent aphid populations. Sources of sorghum aphid HPR are limited and largely uncharacterized, with a few hypothesized mechanisms proposed. Using greenhouse and field aphid experiments combined with genetic data, we established the selection pressure of the globally used HPR source (Resistance to Melanaphis sorghi 1 [RMES1]) on aphid populations and the availability of additional HPR sources providing resistance in wild and breeding genotypes. Responding to injurious cereal aphid biotype shifts has historically been slow and economically costly. A proactive genotype-to-phenotype map of RMES1 and additional sources for HPR durability will inform cereal-aphid breeding efforts and address a major threat to global agricultural resilience.

AB  - The present work aimed to evaluate the influence of Stylosanthes spp. (Campo Grande (c) styles) and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu in the vertical migration of Haemonchus spp. infective larvae, in the region of Uberlandia, Minas Gerais. Seeds of Stylosanthes spp. and Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu were planted in 50 pots of five liters (20 cm diameter) evenly disposed in an area of the Capim Branco Experimental Farm, Federal University of Uberlandia. When both species reached the minimum height of 20 cm, the pots were experimentally contaminated with sheep feces coprocultures. Samplings were performed, with complete removal of the vegetal material contained in the pots, on days one, three, six, 10 and 14 after contamination. Nematoids were recovered from the plant samples by thermo and hydrotropism, counted under an optical microscope and identified. For statistical analysis, the data were analyzed in a completely randomized design (DIC) in a 2X5 factorial scheme (two fodder species X 5 collection dates). No effect of the forage species was observed on the number of L3 of Haemonchus sp. recovered in the feces (p = 0.7790), upper stratum (p = 0.1755) or lower stratum (p = 0.7883) of the forage, however, there was a significant decrease in the number of L3 found with the passing of the days. When comparing the mean L3 recovered in the upper (0.06 +/- 0.31 L3) and lower (2.94 +/- 0.39) strata, a higher number of larvae was observed in the lower stratum (p < 0.0001). Therefore, in both forage species studied, the upper stratum of the plants, preferably pastured by the animals, remained with less contamination of infective larvae and the contamination tended to decrease over the days.

AB  - Flexible composite prostheses provide favorable conditions for bone healing. Simulation of the human body is a complicated process, and accurate techniques are needed as physiological behavior is chaotic. We propose appending the mechanoregulation (MR) algorithm with callus volume changes, implant-dependent growth, and cell phenotype-specific activities for use with composite prostheses. The MR algorithm and simulation technique were validated, and simulation results were compared with developed models and in vivo sheep data. Healing of transverse diaphyseal tibial fractures with a fixed conventional stainless steel intramedullary nail and the flexible glass/polypropylene composite was compared. The flexible implants promoted better callus growth and volume and healthy cell phenotype.

AB  - Temozolomide is used commonly in the treatment of some types of cancers, but it may also result in cognitive impairments such as memory deficits. l-Dopa, a well known medicine for the central nervous system, has been shown to have positive effects on some cognitive disorders. Here we sought to investigate the effect of l-Dopa on temozolomide-induced cognitive impairments. BALB/c mice were subjected to 3-days temozolomide and 6-days concomitant l-Dopa/benserazide administration in six groups (control, l-Dopa 25 mg/kg, l-Dopa 75 mg/kg, temozolomide, temozolomide + l-Dopa 25 mg/kg, and temozolomide + l-Dopa 75 mg/kg). Open field test, object location recognition, novel object recognition test, and shuttle-box test were carried out to determine the locomotor, anxiety-like behavior, and memory function of subjects. TNF-a and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene expression in the hippocampus was measured by real-time PCR. Mice treated with temozolomide showed recognition memory impairment, along with hippocampal TNF-a and BDNF mRNA expression level raise, and detection of histological insults in hematoxylin and eosin hippocampal slides. Mice that received temozolomide + l-Dopa showed normal behavioral function and lower TNF-a and BDNF hippocampal mRNA expression levels, and histologically normal hippocampal CA1 region in comparison with mice in the temozolomide group. Our results provide evidence that l-Dopa prevents temozolomide-induced recognition memory deficit in mice at the acute phase probably via l-Dopa antineuroinflammatory effects.

AB  - Although physical models at present have made important achievements in the assessment of non-point source pollu-tion (NPSP), the requirement for large volumes of data and their accuracy limit their application. Therefore, construct-ing a scientific evaluation model of NPS nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) output is of great significance for the identification of N and P sources as well as pollution prevention and control in the basin. We considered runoff, leaching and landscape interception conditions, and constructed an input-migration-output (IMO) model based on the classic export coefficient model (ECM), and identified the main driving factors of NPSP using geographical detector (GD) in Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGRA). The results showed that, compared with the traditional export coefficient model, the prediction accuracy of the improved model for total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) increased by 15.46 % and 20.17 % respectively, and the error rates with the measured data were 9.43 % and 10.62 %. It was found that the total input volume of TN in the TGRA had declined from 58.16 x 104 t to 48.37 x 104 t, while the TP input volume increased from 2.76 x 104 t to 4.11 x 104 t, and then decreased to 4.01 x 104 t. In addition Pengxi River,Huangjin River and the northern part of Qi River were high value areas of NPSP input and output, but the range of high value areas of migration factors has narrowed. Pig breeding, rural population and dry land area were the main driving factors of N and P export. The IMO model can effectively improve prediction accuracy, and has significant implications for the prevention and control of NPSP.

AB  - Adequate animal manure disposal became a challenge in agriculture. Liquid swine waste (LSW), easily used in agriculture, presents disadvantages due to the high volume and low nutrient concentrations. Metabasalt powder, a residue of amethyst mining, was evaluated as an adsorbent agent of nutrients (Cu, Zn, P, and K) from LSW. Seven doses of metabasalt powder were tested in proportion with LSW (0, 4, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 kg m(-3)), and during four contact times (CT) (9, 21, 42, and 84 days) and ions were dosed in the liquid and solid fractions. Copper and phosphorus concentrations in the liquid fraction were lower at 21 days of contact. The lowest concentration of zinc in the liquid fraction was observed at the dose of 10 kg m(-3) of metabasalt powder, and at 9 days of CT. The K concentrations in the liquid fraction diminished linearly with the metabasalt doses, in which the major dose presented 51% of K compared to the control. The application of metabasalt as an adsorbent agent reduced the contaminant charge in the liquid fraction of LSW, suggesting safe water disposal while promoting ion accumulation in the solid fraction. The use of metabasalt powder became a useful strategy to make LSW pre-treatment on-farm.

AB  - Protein acetylation, which is dynamically maintained by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), might play essential roles in hippocampal exercise physiology. However, whether HATs/HDACs are imbalanced during the recovery phase following acute exercise has not been determined. Groups of exercised mice with different recovery periods after acute exercise (0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 4 h, 7 h, and 24 h) were constructed, and a group of sham-exercised mice was used as the control. The mRNA levels of HATs and HDACs were detected via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Lysine acetylation on the total proteins and some specific locations on histones were detected via western blotting, as were various acylation modifications on the total proteins. Except for four unaffected genes (Hdac4, Ncoa1, Ncoa2, and Sirt1), the mRNA expression trajectories of 21 other HATs or HDACs affected by exercise could be categorized into three clusters. The genes in Cluster 1 increased quickly following exercise, with a peak at 0.5 h and/or 1 h, and remained at high levels until 24 h. Cluster 2 genes presented a gradual increase with a delayed peak at 4 h or 7 h postexercise before returning to baseline. The expression of Cluster 3 genes decreased at 0.5 h and/or 1 h, with some returning to overexpression (Hdac1 and Sirt3). Although most HATs were upregulated and half of the affected HDACs were downregulated at 0.5 h postexercise, the global or residue-specific histone acetylation levels were unchanged. In contrast, the levels of several metabolism-related acylation products of total proteins, including acetylation, succinylation, 2-hydroxyisobutyryllysine, beta-hydroxybutyryllysine, and lactylation, decreased and mainly occurred on nonhistones immediately after exercise. During the 24-h recovery phase after acute exercise, the transcriptional trajectory of HATs or the same class of HDACs in the hippocampus exhibited heterogeneity. Although acute exercise did not affect the selected sites on histone lysine residues, it possibly incurred changes in acetylation and other acylation on nonhistone proteins.

AB  - Some species within the family Plasmodiidae (Haemosporida) have been extensively studied due to their implications for human health. However, for other haemosporidians that infect wild animals the knowledge is limited. Species within the genus Polychromophilus have thus far been documented exclusively as hemoparasites of bats. Records of Polychromophilus are primarily from Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia, with limited information available for the Americas. Here, we assessed the state of knowledge on Polychromophilus species infecting bats worldwide and searched for the presence of Polychromophilus in blood samples of neotropical bats from Colombia. We found a total of 65 records of Polychromophilus in 46 bat species belonging to the families Emballonuridae, Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Rhinolophidae, Rhinonycteridae, and Vespertilionidae worldwide, except for Antarctica. In the Americas, records of the genus Polychromophilus are exclusively from Vespertilionidae bats in Brazil, Colombia, the United States, and Panama. The morphological and molecular analyses of blood from 125 bats, belonging to 39 species and captured in seven localities within the departments of Arauca and Caldas (Colombia), confirmed the presence of Polychromophilus deanei in a silver-tipped myotis, Myotis albescens (Vespertilionidae). This finding represents the first morphological and molecular confirmation of P. deanei in the Americas. Additionally, it expands the knowledge on the diversity and distribution of Polychromophilus in Neotropical bats.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: The traditional Japanese herbal medicine Shin'iseihaito was reported to ameliorate the airway type 2 inflammatory response in clinical and experimental studies. Airway type 2 inflammatory diseases, including bronchial asthma and eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS), often coexist and interact with each other. However, it is still unclear how Shin'iseihaito exerts its pharmacological effects on cells involved in airway mucosa.
   Aim of the study: This study aims to examine the direct effect of baicalin, a representative bioactive compound of Shin'iseihaito, on type 2 immune responses in human airway epithelial cells and mast cells.
   Material and methods: We measured the plasma pharmacokinetics of flavonoids derived from Shin'iseihaito and investigated the effects of baicalin on type 2 immune responses in human airway epithelial cells and human mast cells.
   Results: Baicalin, wogonin, and wogonoside were detected in the plasma. The maximum plasma concentration of baicalin was highest at 1610 ng/ml (3.6 mu M). In the normal human bronchial epithelial cells treated with baicalin, with or without stimulation by IFN-gamma, the IL-33 expression was significantly downregulated. However, baicalin treatment did not affect the levels of thymic stromal lymphopoietin and IL-25. We noted that IL-33-dependent expression of tryptase mRNA in mast cells was significantly inhibited by baicalin. Also, the expression of IL-5 in mast cells enhanced by stimulation with TSLP plus IL-1 beta was significantly downregulated by baicalin treatment. Moreover, the enhancement of IL-13 expression in mast cells by IL-33 simulation was also significantly inhibited by baicalin.
   Conclusions: Our results prove that by breaking off the vicious circle of mast cells and airway epithelial cells, baicalin may be an effective alternative therapeutic option for the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases, such as ECRS and comorbid asthma.

AB  - Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with synaptic injury in the diabetic brain. However, the dysfunctional mitochondria by Drp1 deletion in the diabetic brain are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the effects of neuron-specific Drp1 deletion on synaptic damage and mitophagy in the hippocampus of a high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice exhibited metabolic disturbances and synaptic damages. Floxed Drp1 mice were crossed with Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII alpha)-Cre mice, to generate neuron-specific Drp1 knockout (Drp1cKO) mice, which showed marked mitochondrial swelling and dendritic spine loss in hippocampal neurons. In particular, diabetic Drp1cKO mice exhibited an increase in dendritic spine loss and higher levels of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation compared with diabetic wild-type (WT) mice. Diabetic WT mice generally displayed increased Drp1-induced small mitochondrial morphology in hippocampal neurons, but large mitochondria were prominently observed in diabetic Drp1cKO mice. The levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 proteins were significantly increased in the hippocampus of diabetic Drp1cKO mice compared with diabetic WT mice. The inhibition of Drp1 adversely promotes synaptic injury and neurodegeneration in the diabetic brain. The findings suggest that the exploratory mechanisms behind Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction could provide a possible therapeutic target for diabetic brain complications.

AB  - Rhus typhina, an invasive plant species, contains valuable compounds that can be utilized in various fields. The main aim of this paper was to find the optimal conditions for extracting high amounts of bioactive compounds from R. typhina fruits using ultrasound-assisted and bead-beating techniques under different parameters (solvent concentration, solvent/solid ratio, extraction time, bead size, and material). A Box-Behnken design was applied for ultrasound-assisted extraction. The following process parameters were found to be optimal: 20/1 solvent/solid ratio (v/w), 61.51% aqueous ethanol, 10 min extraction time, with a composite desirability of 0.7719. The HPLC profile indicates that p-coumaric acid was the most abundant phenolic compound found in the BBE extract. The BBE extract was subjected to in vitro biological tests. The results indicate a high antimicrobial activity on Streptococcus pyogenes (20 mm inhibition zone) and Salmonella enterica (12 mm inhibition zone). A hemolysis rate of 19.85% was found at an extract concentration of 1000 mu g/mL on sheep erythrocytes. We report for the first time the protective role of the extract on cell viability of human gingival fibroblasts, but also a weak antiproliferative effect on the HepG2 human liver cancer cell line. Overall, we conclude that R. typhina fruits are rich in bioactive compounds that can be recovered using proper extraction conditions. Further research is required to understand and valorize their biological potential.

AB  - Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by systemic inflammation and synovial hyperplasia. Pristimerin, a natural triterpenoid isolated from plants belonging to the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families, has been reported to exhibit anti-inflammation and anti-proliferation activities. Our study aims to reveal the antiarthritic effects of pristimerin and explore its potential mechanism using in vitro, in silico, and in vivo methods. In the present study, pristimerin treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and migration in TNF-alpha stimulated human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes MH7A. Moreover, UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-based cell metabolomics analysis demonstrated that phospholipid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, glutathione metabolism and amino acid metabolic pathways were involved in TNF-alpha induced MH7A cells after pristimerin treatment. In addition, the adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model was employed, and the results exhibited that pristimerin could effectively relieve arthritis symptoms and histopathological damage as well as reduce serum levels of TNF-alpha, NO and synovial expressions of p-Akt and p-Erk in AIA rats. Furthermore, network pharmacology analysis was performed to visualize crucial protein targets of pristimerin for RA treatment, which showed that the effects were mediated through the MAPK/Erk1/2, PI3K/Akt pathways and directing binding with TNF-alpha. Taken together, our study not only offered new insights into the biochemical mechanism of natural compounds for RA treatment, but also provided a strategy that integrated in vitro, in silico and in vivo studies to facilitate screening of new anti-RA drugs.

AB  - The aging global population is placing an increasing burden on healthcare systems, and the social impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is on the rise. However, the availability of safe and effective treatments for AD remains limited. Adoptive Treg therapy has been explored for treating neurodegenerative diseases, including AD. To facilitate the clinical application of Treg therapy, we developed a Treg preparation protocol and highlighted the therapeutic effects of Tregs in 5xFAD mice. CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs, isolated after A beta stimulation and expanded using a G-rex plate with a gas-permeable membrane, were adoptively transferred into 5xFAD mice. Behavioral analysis was conducted using Y-maze and passive avoidance tests. Additionally, we measured levels of A beta, phosphorylated tau (pTAU), and nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2) in the hippocampus. Real-time RT-PCR was employed to assess the mRNA levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. Our findings indicate that A beta-specific Tregs not only improved cognitive function but also reduced A beta and pTAU accumulation in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. They also inhibited microglial neuroinflammation. These effects were observed at doses as low as 1.5 x 10(3) cells/head. Collectively, our results demonstrate that A beta-specific Tregs can mitigate AD pathology in 5xFAD mice.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a known risk factor for cognitive decline. Using polygenic rat models selectively bred for high and low intrinsic exercise capacity and simultaneously modelling as low and high innate risk factor for MetS respectively, we have previously shown that adult animals with lower exercise capacity/higher MetS risk perform poorly in tasks requiring flexible cognition. However, it is not known whether these deficits in cognition are present already at young age. Also, it is unclear whether the high risk genome is related also to lower-level cognition, such as sensory gating measured as prepulse inhibition. In this study, young and adult (5-8 weeks and similar to 9 months) rats selectively bred for 36 generations as High-Capacity Runners (HCR) or Low-Capacity Runners (LCR) were tested for behavior in an open field task, modulation of startle reflex, and spatial learning in a T-maze. HCR rats were more active in the open field than LCR rats independent of age. Responses to the startle stimulus habituated to the same extent in LCR compared to HCR rats when young, but as adults, stronger habituation was seen in the HCR animals. The prepulse inhibition of startle response was equally strong in young HCR and LCR animals but the effect was shorter lasting in HCR animals. In T-maze, adult HCR animals unexpectedly showed attenuated learning, but we interpret this finding to stem from differences in motivation rather than learning ability. Overall, in the LCR rats with the risk genome for poor aerobic fitness and MetS, indications of compromised cognitive function are present already at a young age.

AB  - The tritylodontids are a group of highly specialised, herbivorous non-mammalian synapsids, which have been thought to be closely related to mammals. By using CT scanning technique and 3D reconstruction, a new tritylodontid, Bienotheroides xingshanensis sp. nov., is described herein from the Middle Jurassic Shaximiao Formation of western Hubei, China. The only and holotype specimen shows a part of skull, with well-preserved right dentition bearing two incisor and six cheek teeth. It is assigned to Bienotheroides based on its short and broad snout, obtusely rounded corners of upper cheek teeth and the cusp formula of 2-3-3. It differs from the known species of Bienotheroides in having short and wide upper cheek tooth outline, as well as two much more reduced anterior cusps of the median and lingual rows. Based on a new compilation of the known record of tritylodontids, the evolution of spatio-temporal distribution of this group is addressed. It is supposed that the apparent extinction of the Early Jurassic tritylodontids might be related with the Toarcian global warming and that the northward migration of tritylodontids during the Middle to Late Jurassic might have been influenced by aridification trend in East Asia.

AB  - Ischemic lesions stimulate adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, however, this is not associated with better cognitive function. Furthermore, increased neurogenesis is associated with the formation of aberrant neurons. In a previous study, we showed that a running task after a stroke not only increases neurogenesis but also the number of aberrant neurons without improving general performance. Here, we determined whether stimulation in an enriched environment after a lesion could increase neurogenesis and cognitive function without enhancing the number of aberrant neurons. After an ischemic stroke induced by MCAO, animals were transferred to an enriched environment containing a running wheel, tunnels and nest materials. A GFP-retroviral vector was delivered on day 3 post-stroke and a modified water maze test was performed 6 weeks after the lesion. We found that the enriched environment significantly increased the number of new neurons compared with the unstimulated stroke group but not the number of aberrant cells after a lesion. Increased neurogenesis after environmental enrichment was associated with improved cognitive function. Our study showed that early placement in an enriched environment after a stroke lesion markedly increased neurogenesis and flexible learning but not the formation of aberrant neurons, indicating that rehabilitative training, as a combination of running wheel training and enriched environment housing, improved functional and structural outcomes after a stroke.

AB  - Mycotoxins, secondary metabolites produced by fungi, frequently contaminate feed worldwide. Specifically, deoxynivalenol (DON), a type B trichothecene produced by the Fusarium species, is the most prevalent mycotoxin detected in feed. This study using piglets evaluated the biological antidotes to mitigating DON toxicity. Our results showed that the impact of synbiotic additives on growth characteristics, histological alterations, and microbiota composition was pronounced in the DON-contaminated piglet group. Piglets fed SYN supplementation exhibited growth improvement and histological recuperation, including fibrosis and apoptosis in specific organs. Moreover, the two independent variables such as Prevotella 1 and Romboutsia were statistically significant for predicting the final BW. Furthermore, this study builds on previous research and provides insights into the influence of microbiota composition on DON detoxification. Our findings suggest the control of risks associated with DON in feed, and this study significantly contributes to the existing literature. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common mycotoxin observed in cereal grains, and feed contamination poses health risks to pigs. Biological antidotes, such as synbiotics (SYNs), have garnered attention for mitigating DON toxicity. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of SYNs by comparing the blood biochemistry, histology, and gut microbiome of weaned piglets. A 4-week trial was conducted on 32 weaned piglets. After a week of diet and environmental adaptation, the pigs were divided into four groups: (1) control (CON, n = 8); (2) SYN (n = 8); (3) DON (n = 8); and (4) DON+SYN (n = 8). The SYN supplementation of weaned piglets increased the final body weight (21.71 +/- 0.93 vs. 20.73 +/- 0.84), average daily gain (0.38 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.34 +/- 0.02), and gain-to-feed ratio (0.49 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.43 +/- 0.02), and decreased the feed conversion ratio (2.14 +/- 0.14 vs. 2.39 +/- 0.13) compared to the DON group. A high dose of DON induced liver and colon fibrosis and liver and cecum apoptosis, which were alleviated by SYNs. Glucose in the DON group (84.9 +/- 3.7) was significantly lower than in the control (101.3 +/- 4.2). Additionally, both the DON and DON+SYN groups exhibited higher creatine (0.9 +/- 0.0 and 0.9 +/- 0.1) and lower cholesterol (88.3 +/- 3.2 and 90.0 +/- 4.8) levels (p < 0.05). In conclusion, SYNs alleviated DON toxicity, indicating its potential as an antidote for specific biomarkers.

AB  - Aspartame (ASP) is a common sweetener, but studies show it can harm the nervous system, causing learning and memory deficits. & beta;-caryophyllene (BCP), a natural compound found in foods, including bread, coffee, alcoholic beverages, and spices, has already described as a neuroprotector agent. Remarkably, ASP and BCP are commonly consumed, including in the same meal. Therefore, considering that (a) the BCP displays plenty of beneficial effects; (b) the ASP toxicity; and (c) that they can be consumed in the same meal, this study sought to investigate if the BCP would mitigate the memory impairment induced by ASP in rats and investigate the involvement of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/ tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrKB) signaling pathway and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Young male Wistar rats received ASP (75 mg/kg; i.g.) and/or BCP (100 mg/ kg; i.p.) once daily, for 14 days. At the end of the treatment, the animals were evaluated in the open field and object recognition tests. The cerebral cortex and hippocampus samples were collected for biochemical and molecular analyses. Results showed that the BCP effectively protected against the cognitive damage caused by ASP in short and long-term memories. In addition, BCP mitigated the increase in AChE activity caused by ASP. Molecular insights revealed augmented BDNF and TrKB levels in the hippocampus of rats treated with BCP, indicating greater activation of this pathway. In conclusion, BCP protected against ASP-induced memory impairment. AChE activity and the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway seem to be potential targets of BCP modulatory role in this study.

AB  - Long-term neuropsychiatric impairments have become a growing concern following blast-related traumatic brain injury (bTBI) in active military personnel and Veterans. Neuropsychiatric impairments such as anxiety and depression are common comorbidities that Veterans report months, even years following injury. To understand these chronic behavioral outcomes following blast injury, there is a need to study the link between anxiety, depression, and neuropathology. The hippocampus and motor cortex (MC) have been regions of interest when studying cognitive deficits following blast exposure, but clinical studies of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) report that these two regions also play a role in the manifestation of anxiety and depression. With anxiety and depression being common long-term outcomes following bTBI, it is imperative to study how chronic pathological changes within the hippocampus and/or MC due to blast contribute to the development of these psychiatric impairments. In this study, we exposed male rats to a repeated blast overpressure (~17 psi) and evaluated the chronic behavioral and pathological effects on the hippocampus and MC. Results demonstrated that the repeated blast exposure led to depression-like behaviors 36 weeks following injury, and anxiety-like behaviors 2-, and 52-weeks following injury. These behaviors were also correlated with astrocyte pathology (glial-fibrillary acid protein, GFAP) and dendritic alterations (Microtubule-Associated Proteins, MAP2) within the hippocampus and MC regions at 52 weeks. Overall, these findings support the premise that chronic glial pathological changes within the brain contribute to neuropsychiatric impairments following blast exposure.

AB  - Deficits in olfaction are associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer?s disease. A recent study reported that intranasal zinc sulfate (ZnSO4)-treated mice show olfaction and memory deficits. However, it remains unknown whether olfaction deficit-induced learning and memory impairment is associated with the cholinergic system in the brain. In this study, we evaluated olfactory function by the buried food find test, and learning and memory function by the Y-maze and passive avoidance tests in ZnSO4-treated mice. The expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) protein in the olfactory bulb (OB), prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala was assessed by western blotting. Moreover, we observed the effect of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine on ZnSO4-induced learning and memory deficits. We found that intranasal ZnSO4-treated mice exhibited olfactory dysfunction, while this change was recovered on day 14 after treatment. Both short-term and long-term learning and memory were impaired on days 4 and 7 after treatment with ZnSO4, whereas the former, but not the latter, was recovered on day 14 after treatment. A significant correlation was observed between olfactory function and short-term memory, but not long-term memory. Treatment with ZnSO4 decreased the ChAT level in the OB on day 4, and increased and decreased the ChAT levels in the OB and hippocampus on day 7, respectively. Physostigmine improved the ZnSO4-induced deficit in short-term, but not long-term, memory. Taken together, the present results suggest that short-term memory may be closely associated with olfactory function via the cholinergic system.

AB  - Microwave (MW) and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) are considered environmental pollutants, both of which can induce learning and memory impairments. However, the bioeffects of combined exposure to MW and EMP have never been explored. This paper aimed to investigate the effects of combined exposure to MW and EMP on the learning and memory of rats as well as its association with ferroptosis in the hippocampus. In this study, rats were exposed to EMP, MW, or EMP and MW combined radiation. After exposure, impairment of learning and memory, alterations in brain electrophysiological activity, and damage to hippocampal neurons were observed in rats. Moreover, we also found alterations in ferroptosis hallmarks, including increased levels of iron, lipid peroxidation, and prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) mRNA, as well as downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) protein in the rat hippocampus after exposure. Our results suggested that either single or combined exposure to MW and EMP radiation could impair learning and memory and damage hippocampal neurons in rats. Moreover, the adverse effects caused by the combined exposure were more severe than the single exposures, which might be due to cumulative effects rather than synergistic effects. Furthermore, ferroptosis in the hippocampus might be a common underlying mechanism of learning and memory impairment induced by both single and combined MW and EMP exposure.

AB  - Acyl-lipids are vital components for all life functions of plants. They are widely studied using often in vitro conditions to determine inter alia the impact of genetic modifications and the description of biochemical and physiological functions of enzymes responsible for acyl-lipid metabolism. What is currently lacking is knowledge of if these results also hold in real environments-in in vivo conditions. Our study focused on the comparative analysis of both in vitro and in vivo growth conditions and their impact on the acyl-lipid metabolism of Camelina sativa leaves. The results indicate that in vitro conditions significantly decreased the lipid contents and influenced their composition. In in vitro conditions, galactolipid and trienoic acid (16:3 and 18:3) contents significantly declined, indicating the impairment of the prokaryotic pathway. Discrepancies also exist in the case of acyl-CoA:lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs). Their activity increased about 2-7 times in in vitro conditions compared to in vivo. In vitro conditions also substantially changed LPLATs' preferences towards acyl-CoA. Additionally, the acyl editing process was three times more efficient in in vitro leaves. The provided evidence suggests that the results of acyl-lipid research from in vitro conditions may not completely reflect and be directly applicable in real growth environments.

AB  - Introduction: Amphetamine (AMPH) abuse results in neurobehavioral alterations related to the reward circuit. The hippocampus plays a role in cognition, reward, and drug addiction. There are no pharmacological approaches to prevent AMPH relapse. Physical exercise has been studied as a non-pharmacological promising influence to attenuate reward symptoms related to addictive drugs.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of non-weight-loaded and weight-loaded physical exercise on behavioral (relapse, memory and anxiety) and hippocampal molecular parameters associated with AMPH addiction in Wistar rats.
   Methods: Male rats were subjected to the AMPH-Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigm. After 8-conditioning days, they were subjected to swimming physical exercise protocol (without or with weight-load). Behavioral evaluations were performed to assess the influence of both exercise protocols in addiction parameters, including relapse after AMPH reconditioning, working memory, locomotor activity, and anxiety-like symptoms. Subsequently, protein levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and pro-BDNF ex-vivo assays were carried out in samples of the hippocampus of the animals.
   Results: AMPH relapse and anxiety-like behaviors were reduced only in rats subjected to non-weight-loaded exercise. Hippocampal BDNF and pro-BDNF immunoreactivity were increased in non-weight-loaded exercise rats. Behavioral and molecular analyses were not modified in rats subjected to weight-loaded exercise.
   Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that non-weight-loaded exercise was more effective against relapse and anxiety-like behavior induced by AMPH. Non-weight-loaded exercise upregulated the hippocampal immunocontent levels in rats.

AB  - Correct immunological dialogue between the maternal uterus and conceptus is essential during implantation, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) participate in maternal immune tolerance during pregnancy. This study aimed to analyze the effect of early pregnancy on Toll-like receptor pathways in the ovine endometrium. Ovine endometria were obtained on day 16 of the estrous cycle (N16) and days 13, 16, and 25 of pregnancy (P13, P16, and P25), and expression profiles of TLR members, including TLRs, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), were detected by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry analysis. The data of this study showed that the expression of TLR2 and TLR5 was gradually increased during early pregnancy compared to N16, and TLR3 expression was greater at P16 and P25 than at N16 and P13. However, the expression levels of TLR4 and TRAF6 were weaker at P13 and P16, and the expression of MyD88 was inhibited by early pregnancy. Furthermore, early pregnancy regulated IRAK1 expression. These findings corroborated that the TLR pathway was modulated in the ovine endometrium during early pregnancy, which may be involved in maternal immunoregulation.

AB  - Extant Malagasy members of the genus Macronycteris are broadly distributed across the island and vary in size with respect to sex, bioclimatic zone, and intraspecific clade affinity. An extinct Quaternary species, M. besaoka, was considered morphologically distinct from modern Macronycteris based on its robust mandibles and wider molars. Since its description, taxonomic and phylogenetic revisions have reshaped our understanding of Malagasy Macronycteris. This included the discovery of the cryptic species M. cryptovalorona and the recognition of two clades within M. commersoni. Recent augmentation of museum cranial collections of Malagasy members of the genus has permitted renewed investigation into morphological trends. Herein, we examine craniodental morphology of modern Malagasy Macronycteris spp., and investigate the validity of M. besaoka through nonparametric multivariate methods. The results of this study support M. besaoka as a valid species. Further, some specimens previously diagnosed as M. besaoka are best associated with modern M. commersoni from the dry bioclimatic zone. These results have implications for the history of the bat community at Anjohibe Cave, as well as the identification of other Macronycteris subfossils from dry western Madagascar.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of addition of gallic acid as the single antioxidant to the base medium for in vitro culture of sheep secondary follicles and if the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is involved in the action of gallic acid. Secondary follicles were isolated and cultured for 12 days in alpha-MEM supplemented with bovine serum albumin (BSA), insulin, glutamine, hypoxanthine, transferrin, selenium, and ascorbic acid (control medium: alpha-MEM+) or in alpha-MEM supplemented with BSA, insulin, glutamine, hypoxanthine and different concentrations of gallic acid (25, 50 or 100 mu M), thus replacing transferrin, selenium and ascorbic acid in the medium. Follicle morphology, glutathione (GSH), and mitochondrial activity, and meiotic resumption were evaluated. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K pathway was performed by pretreatment with LY294002. After 12 days of culture, the follicle survival in a medium containing 100 mu M gallic acid was similar (P > 0.05) to alpha-MEM+ and greater (P < 0.05) compared with other gallic acid concentrations. Antrum formation, follicle diameter, GSH, and mitochondrial activity, and meiotic resumption, however, were greater (P < 0.05) when 100 mu M gallic acid was included in the alpha-MEM+ culture medium compared with the control medium. Furthermore, LY294002 inhibited (P < 0.05) follicle survival, development, and meiotic resumption stimulated by 100 mu M gallic acid. In conclusion, concentration of 100 mu M of gallic acid can be a substitute for transferrin, selenium, and ascorbic acid in the base medium during in vitro culture of sheep secondary follicles, inducing follicle development likely through the PI3K pathway.

AB  - The establishment of epiblast-derived pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) from cattle, which are important domestic animals that provide humans with milk and meat while also serving as bioreactors for producing valuable proteins, poses a challenge due to the unclear molecular signaling required for embryonic epiblast development and maintenance of PSC self-renewal. Here, we selected six key stages of bovine embryo development (E5, E6, E7, E10, E12, and E14) to track changes in pluripotency and the dependence on signaling pathways via modified single-cell transcription sequencing technology. The remarkable similarity of the gene expression patterns between cattle and pigs during embryonic lineage development contributed to the successful establishment of bovine epiblast stem cells (bEpiSCs) using 3i/LAF (WNTi, GSK3 beta i, SRCi, LIF, Activin A, and FGF2) culture system. The generated bEpiSCs exhibited consistent expression patterns of formative epiblast pluripotency genes and maintained clonal morphology, normal karyotypes, and proliferative capacity for more than 112 passages. Moreover, these cells exhibited high-efficiency teratoma formation as well as the ability to differentiate into various cell lineages. The potential of bEpiSCs for myogenic differentiation, primordial germ cell like cells (PGCLCs) induction, and as donor cells for cell nuclear transfer was also assessed, indicating their promise in advancing cell-cultured meat production, gene editing, and animal breeding.

AB  - Probiotics and phytogenics have been evaluated as potential alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in poultry feeds in terms of their ability to improve growth performance in commercial poultry production through improving growth performance, feed conversion ratio and immune response efficiency. This study investigated the benefits of Lactobacillus culture (LC), green tea extracts (GTE) and Berberis vulgaris extracts (BVRE) have been investigated on the immune response, lymphoid organs, and antioxidant properties of broiler chickens. A total of 320 one-day-old Ross 308 chicks were randomly allotted to 8 treatment groups, each including 4 replicates of 10 chicks. A 2x2x2 factorial arrangement of 8 dietary treatments was used to appraise the effects of the mixture of five LC (none vs. 1-5 x 10(8) cfu/g), GTE (none vs. 2500 ppm) and BVRE (none vs. 2500 ppm). The relative weight of lymphoid organs (spleen, thymus and bursa of Fabricius), antioxidant parameters of malondialdehyde (MDA) content and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and immune response indices (white blood cells, antibody response to sheep red blood cell, respiratory burst and splenocytes proliferation) were assessed. According to the results of the current experiment, the relative weights of the spleen and bursa were significantly higher than the control group in broilers fed the LC diet (P < 0.01). The combination of LC and GTE significantly decreased MDA as compared to broilers fed the control diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, the GTE diet markedly increased the T-AOC compared to the control (P < 0.01). The LC and plant extract treatments significantly improved the humoral and cellular immune systems (P < 0.01). Based on obtained results, plant extracts in combination with Lactobacillus strains can improve the immune responses of broiler chickens.

AB  - Long-term exposure to physical and/or psychosocial stress during early life and/or adolescence increases the risk of psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying early stress-induced brain dysfunction are poorly understood. In the present study, mice at 4 weeks old were subjected to chronic mild unpredictable stress (CMUS) for 4 weeks, and subsequently to assays of emotion-related behaviors. Thereafter, they were sacrificed and their brains were collected for real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Mice with CMUS during adolescence showed despair behavior, anxiety-like behavior, social behavior deficits, and anhedonia in forced-swim, marble-burying, social interaction, and sucrose preference tests, respectively. Additionally, RT-qPCR revealed that the expression levels of sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a NAD+-dependent deacetylase that mediates stress responses, were down-regulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice with CMUS compared with control mice. Next, to investigate the pathophysiological role of decreased Sirt1 expression levels in stress-induced behavioral deficits, we assessed the effects of resveratrol, a pharmacological activator of SIRT1, in mice exposed to CMUS. Chronic treatment with resveratrol prevented CMUS-induced social behavior deficits and depression-like behaviors. These results suggest that CMUS during adolescence decreases Sirt1 expression in the brain, leading to deficits in emotional behavior. Accordingly, SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol, may be preventive agents against abnormalities in emotional behavior following stress during an immature period.

AB  - Simple Summary Syngnathids are teleost fish that include seahorses (Hippocampus ssp.), pipefishes (Syngnathus spp.), common seadragons (Phyllopteryx taeniolatus) and leafy seadragons (Phycodurus eques). Some species are currently threatened. Reproduction and maintenance in aquariaare complicated and highly contagious diseases, such as mycobacteriosis, can trigger numerous casualties. The most frequently common species observed in fish are Mycobacterium marinum, M. fortuitum and M. chelonae, which belong to the group of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. Stress factors, poor water quality, bad management and high population densities are associated with a higher prevalence of this disease. This study describes the clinical signs and granulomatous lesions associated with mycobacteriosis in syngnathids. M. fortuitum and Mycobacterium spp. were isolated in 4 and 14 syngnathids, respectively. Seven samples were positive against M. chelonae and M. marinum common primers. Considering the scarcity of pathological studies in syngnathids, these findings can help to improve the clinical management and survival of these animals in captivity. Mycobacteriosis is an important disease that affects captive and wild aquatic fish. Syngnathids are susceptible to infection by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The aim of this study was to describe clinical signs, and macroscopic and histological lesions in 25 syngnathids and the molecular characterization of the causative mycobacteria. Clinical presentation ranged from sudden death to non-specific signs, including anorexia, poor body condition, weight loss and marked dyspnea with increased respiratory effort and rate. Gross lesions were mostly ulcers on the tail and small white nodules in the liver, coelomic cavity and inside the eye. The most affected organs were gills, liver, intestine and coelomic mesentery. Microscopic lesions consisted of areas of multifocal to diffuse granulomatous inflammation and bacterial emboli with numerous intralesional acid-fast bacilli. Epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, lymphocytes and fibrous connective tissue, which are commonly observed in granulomatous inflammation, were not observed here. In the real-time PCR, M. fortuitum, M. chelonae and M. marinum common primers, Mycobacterium spp. were detected in 4, 7 and 14 individuals, respectively. In addition, this is the first description of mycobacteriosis found in Syngnathus acus.

AB  - Although the current COVID-19 incidence situation is not an emergency, more new strains of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continue to emerge worldwide, some of which are more virulent than the original virus. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) had a high risk of severe COVID-19, but the molecular and cellular mechanism of this predisposition is not fully elucidated. In this study, we developed a cellular model of the initial stage of COVID-19 on primary hippocampal culture of 5xFAD mice, a familial AD model, using a specific ACE2 receptor inhibitor, MLN-4760. This model is based on the experimentally proven decrease in ACE2 receptor activity observed in COVID-19 patients due to internalization of the receptor inside the cell after binding to coronavirus. Using immunochemical staining with specific antibodies to detect neurons (marker MAP2) and astroglia (marker GFAP), it was found that 24 h after the addition of MLN-4760 (0.2 nmol per 1 mL of medium) to the culture medium, there was a decrease in the density of astrocytes and neurons, a change in their morphology with a sharp reduction in the length and density of neurites, which led to death of the cell culture. The transgenic culture was more sensitive to the effect of the inhibitor compared the control hippocampal culture of native mice. In the second part of the study the possibilities of preventing the destructive effect of MLN-4760 on the hippocampal culture condition were studied. It was shown administration of YB-1, an endogenous polyfunctional stress protein, promoted restoration of cell culture structure and resulted in stimulation of neurite growth and astroglia activation. Introduction of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) after ACE2 blockade was also accompanied by improved culture survival, restoration of cell morphology, and increased density of astrocytes and neurons. The obtained results indicate that YB-1 and cell therapy using MMSCs are promising options for the development of new effective methods to prevent the pathological effect of the virus on brain tissue, which is an important link in the treatment infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus.

AB  - Insect cytochrome P450 plays major roles in detoxification of phytotoxin and insecticides. However, determination of P450 activity in aphids has variable success and there is no reliable method yet. In this study, we found that homogenizing the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, in the 96-well microplate resulted in significantly higher P450 activities than those in Eppendorf tube. Homogenizing aphids in Eppendorf tube released uncharacterized compounds that inhibited aphids and pig liver P450 activities, whereas aphids homogenized in the microplate may not be completely ground and thus released fewer such inhibitors. Then, the microplate homogenization method was optimized as follows: one or two aphids were placed in one well of the 96 wellmicroplate and ground in phosphate buffer using pipette tips for 20 cycles, followed by addition of 7-ethoxycoumarin, and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature, after which glycine buffer-ethanol mixture was added to stop the reaction. This method is also suitable for the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi. These results highlight the importance of considering inhibitory effects of endogenous compounds in insects on their P450 activities and provide one possible method to reduce these inhibitory effects.

AB  - Camellia oleifera produced many wastes after being squeezed oil and the wastes were made into tea seed cake that contains rich tea saponin. A green tea saponin foam agent was developed to improve the recovery of crude oil. In this study, ethanol method was used to extract and isolate tea saponins from tea seed cake. Response surface methodology was used to optimize the tea saponin extraction process and improve production. The effect of ethanol concentration, material-to-liquid ratio, extraction temperature, and extraction time were used as independent variables. The results showed that highest yield of tea saponin was 21.55% under optimal experimental conditions of ethanol concentration (76.21%), material-to-liquid ratio (1:12.91 g/mL), extraction temperature (75.92 degrees C), and extraction time (3.13 h). The foam properties showed that tea saponin foam had good foam stabilization and resistance to pH, temperatures, and salinity. About 0.1 wt% tea saponin foam indicated good foam performance at pH of 5-6.5, Na+ (10,000-20,000 mg/L), Ca2+ (400-800 mg/L) and Mg2+ (400-800 mg/L), long-term temperature (120 degrees C, 96 h) still has good foam performances. Subsequently, the experiments were tested the plugging ability by researching the differential pressure of the foam agents at different saponin concentrations. Experimental results illustrated great plugging effects when the pressure reached 1.54 MPa at 0.2 wt% saponin. Saponin foam could adapt to the formation environment and had good tolerance to temperature, salinity, and acidity. In addition, tea saponin had a good application prospect in the field of EOR.

AB  - Studies establish that the brain's Orexin system is involved in pain modulation. Orexin-1 and orexin-2 receptors (OX1 and OX2r, respectively) are essential in responsiveness to stressful stimuli. Some evidence indicates that the hippocampus's dentate gyrus (DG) potentially modulates pain and stress. The present study examined the involvement of OX1 and OX2 receptors within the DG in response to acute pain after exposure to forced swim stress (FSS). Five to seven days post-stereotaxic surgery, the baseline tail-flick latency (TFL) was taken from the animal, then rats unilaterally received through an implanted cannula either different doses of OX1r antagonist (SB334867; 1, 3, 10, and 30 nmol), OX2r antagonist (TCS OX2 29; 1, 3, 10 and 30 nmol), or vehicle (0.5 & mu;l solution of 12% DMSO). After 5 min, rats were exposed to the FSS for six minutes. Subsequently, the tail-flick test was conducted, and the TFLs were measured at the 60-min time set intervals. Results indicated that FSS produces antinociceptive responses in the tail-flick test. Two-way ANOVA analysis showed that Microinjection of OX1r and OX2r antagonists into the DG region of the brain reduced FSS-induced analgesia in the tail-flick test. The decrement effects of these two antagonists were almost the same. Additionally, results showed that the role of both receptors was the same in modulating stress-induced analgesia (SIA). These findings show that the orexin system in the hippocampal DG region might be partially involved in the SIA in acute pain.

AB  - Introduction: The neuropeptide Y (NPY) is broadly distributed in the central nervous system (CNS), and it has been related to neuroprotective functions. NPY seems to be an important component to counteract brain damage and cognitive impairment mediated by drugs of abuse and neurodegenerative diseases, and both NPY and its Y-2 receptor (Y2R) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, critical for learning and memory. We have recently demonstrated its influence on cognitive functions; however, the specific mechanism and involved brain regions where NPY modulates spatial memory by acting on Y2R remain unclear.
   Methods: Here, we examined the involvement of the hippocampal NPY Y2R in spatial memory and associated changes in brain metabolism by bilateral administration of the selective antagonist BIIE0246 into the rat dorsal hippocampus. To further evaluate the relationship between memory functions and neuronal activity, we analysed the regional expression of the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) as an index of oxidative metabolic capacity in limbic and non-limbic brain regions.
   Results: The acute blockade of NPY Y2R significantly improved spatial memory recall in rats trained in the Morris water maze that matched metabolic activity changes in spatial memory processing regions. Specifically, CCO activity changes were found in the dentate gyrus of the dorsal hippocampus and CA1 subfield of the ventral hippocampus, the infralimbic region of the PFC and the mammillary bodies.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that the NPY hippocampal system, through its Y2R receptor, influences spatial memory recall (retrieval) and exerts control over patterns of brain activation that are relevant for associative learning, probably mediated by Y2R modulation of long-term potentiation and long-term depression.

AB  - Extracellular senile plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles are two devastating brain proteinopathies that are indicative of Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent type of dementia. Currently, no effective medications are available to stop or reverse Alzheimer's disease. Ginkgo biloba extract, commonly referred to as EGb 761, is a natural product made from the leaves of the G. biloba tree. It has long been demonstrated to have therapeutic benefits in Alzheimer's disease. The current study assessed the beneficial effects of EGb 761 against Alzheimer's disease in comparison with memantine, a standard treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The scopolamine-heavy metals mixture rat Alzheimer's disease model is a newly created model to study the effects of EGb 761 oral therapy on cognitive performance and other Alzheimer's disease-like changes over a 28-day experimental period. This new Alzheimer's disease model provides better criteria for Alzheimer's disease hallmarks than the conventional scopolamine model. The EGb 761 reversed memory and learning deficits induced by the scopolamine-heavy metals mixture. These outcomes were linked to a more pronounced inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase, caspase-3, hippocampal amyloid-beta protein (A beta 1 - 42), phosphorylated tau protein counts, and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor- alpha and interleukin-1 beta ) compared to the memantine-treated group. Furthermore, EGb 761 treatment considerably reduced lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and improved reduced glutathione levels compared to memantine. Our results suggest EGb 761 ' s potential in treating central nervous system disorders. It's a promising candidate for future Alzheimer's disease therapeutic exploration. This study also highlights the need for future research to focus on the positive benefits of herbal medicines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SyntheChol (R) is a new synthetic, non-animal-derived cholesterol that is easily dissolved in ethanol, ready to use, and behaves in a similar way as natural cholesterol. Therefore, it could be used as a substitute of natural cholesterol in dog sperm freezing extender. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of supplementing an egg yolk-free (EY-free) extender with synthetic cholesterol (SyntheChol (R)) on cryopreserved dog sperm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Spermatozoa (1 x 10 8 sperm/mL) were suspended in EY-free extender supplemented with 0% (control), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 6% SyntheChol (R) (Extender 1), cooled at 4 degrees C for 1 h, and diluted (1:1, v/v) with Extender 1 containing 1 M glycerol. The spermatozoa were then cooled to 4 degrees C for 30 min. Sperm-containing straws were frozen using LN2 vapor. Sperm motility (computer-assisted sperm analysis, CASA), sperm membrane integrity (SYBR-14 and PI staining), and acrosome integrity (FITC-PSA) were evaluated after thawing. Thereafter, optimal concentrations were determined (0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2%) and used to evaluate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, apoptosis, and the gene expression of motility-related sperm mitochondria-associated cysteine-rich protein, apoptosis-related B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), and BCL2-associated X protein (BAX) in cryopreserved sperm. RESULTS: Sperm progressive motility, membrane integrity, and acrosome integrity were markedly greater in the SyntheChol (R)-supplemented groups (0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2%) than in the control group. Only BAX expression was significantly reduced in the SyntheChol (R) groups (0.25, 1, or 2%) compared with the control group. However, there were no significant effects on the ROS generation or apoptosis index. CONCLUSION: SyntheChol (R) (0.25, 1, or 2%) proved to be effective in reducing the BAX gene expression level and improving sperm progressive motility, and membrane and acrosome integrity.

AB  - Gut microbiota homeostasis in the organism and insomnia have been reported to influence each other. In the study, a method of 16S rRNA gene sequencing combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass/mass spectrometry was adopted to evaluate the effects of Lilium brownie (LB) on intestinal flora and metabolic profiles of serum, hypothalamus and hippocampus in insomnia rat induced by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). It was observed that the imbalance in the diversity and abundance of gut microbiota induced by PCPA was restored after LB intervention. Among these, the Porphyromonadaceae, Lactobacillus and Escherichia were significantly adjusted at the genus level by PCPA and LB, respectively. It was also found that the most of metabolic phenotypes in serum, hypothalamus and hippocampus perturbed by PCPA were regulated towards normal after LB intervention, especially 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan of the hypothalamus involving in 5-HT metabolism. Moreover, the arachidonic acid metabolism in serum, hypothalamus and hippocampus, and the serotonergic synapse in hypothalamus and hippocampus were the most fundamentally and significantly affected pathways after LB intervention. The results of correlation analysis showed that several floras including Pseudoruegeria have an outstanding contribution to the change of differential metabolites. In brief, the results confirm that gut microbiota is significantly returned to normal and may interact with the corresponding metabolites to relieve insomnia under LB intervention.

AB  - Memories of emotionally arousing events tend to endure longer than other memories. This review compiles findings from several decades of research investigating the role of the amygdala in modulating memories of emotional experiences. Episodic memory is a kind of declarative memory that depends upon the hippocampus, and studies suggest that the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) modulates episodic memory consoli-dation through interactions with the hippocampus. Although many studies in rodents and imaging studies in humans indicate that the amygdala modulates memory consolidation and plasticity processes in the hippo-campus, the anatomical pathways through which the amygdala affects hippocampal regions that are important for episodic memories were unresolved until recent optogenetic advances made it possible to visualize and manipulate specific BLA efferent pathways during memory consolidation. Findings indicate that the BLA in-fluences hippocampal-dependent memories, as well as synaptic plasticity, histone modifications, gene expres-sion, and translation of synaptic plasticity associated proteins in the hippocampus. More recent findings from optogenetic studies suggest that the BLA modulates spatial memory via projections to the medial entorhinal cortex, and that the frequency of activity in this pathway is a critical element of this modulation.

AB  - Obesity-related metabolic dysregulation causes mild cognitive impairment and increased risk for dementia. We used an LDLR-deficient C57BL/6J mouse model (LDLRKO) to investigate whether adropin, a neuropeptide linked to neurodegenerative diseases, improves cognitive function in situations of metabolic dysregulation. Adropin transgenic mice (AdrTG) were crossed with LDLRKO; male and female progeny were fed a high fat diet for 3months. Male chow-fed wild type (WT) mice were used as controls. Diet-induced obesity and LDLR-deficiency caused severe dyslipidemia, irrespective of sex. The AdrTG prevented reduced adropin protein levels in LDLRKO cortex. In males, metabolic dysregulation and AdrTG genotype significantly and bi-directionally affected performance in the novel object recognition (NOR) test, a declarative hippocampal memory task (discrimination index mean +/- SE for WT, 0.02 +/- 0.088; LDLRKO, -0.115 +/- 0.077; AdrTG;LDLRKO, 0.265 +/- 0.078; genotype effect, p = 0.009; LDLRKO vs. AdrTG;LDLRKO, P 0.05). A 2-way ANOVA (fixed variables: sex, AdrTG genotype) indicated a highly significant effect of AdrTG (P = 0.003). The impact of the diet-genotype interaction on the male mouse brain was investigated using RNA-seq. Gene-ontology analysis of transcripts showing fold-changes of 1.3 or <-1.3 (P < 0.05) indicated metabolic dysregulation affected gene networks involved in intercellular/neuronal signaling, immune processes, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization. The AdrTG selectively attenuated the impact of metabolic dysregulation on intercellular/neuronal signaling pathways. Intercellular/neuronal signaling pathways were also the predominant processes overrepresented when directly comparing AdrTG;LDLRKO with LDRKO. In summary, adropin overexpression improves cognitive function in severe metabolic dysregulation through pathways related to cell-cell communication and neuronal processes, and independently of preventing inflammatory responses.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a native woody oil plant in southern China and is infected with anthracnose wherever it is grown. We previously identified Colletotrichum fructicola as the major causal agent of anthracnose on C. oleifera and found that CfAtg8 regulates the pathogenicity and development of C. fructicola. Here, we revealed that CfAtg4 interacts with CfAtg8, contributing to the formation of autophagosomes. The CfAtg8(1-160) allele, which only contains(1-160) amino acids of the CfAtg8, partially recovered the autophagosome numbers and autophagy defects of the Delta Cfatg4 mutant. Consequently, these recoveries resulted in the restoration of the defects of the Delta Cfatg4 mutant in growth and responses to different external stresses, albeit to an extent. Importantly, we illustrated the critical roles of CfAtg8(1-160) in appressoria formation, and pathogenicity. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the importance of the interaction between CfAtg8 and CfAtg4 in the growth, autophagy and pathogenicity of the phytopathogenic fungi.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the incidence and the independent risk factors of SRS-related epilepsy in patients with supratentorial brain metastases (st-BMs), providing evidences for prevention or reduction secondary epilepsy after SRS. Methods: Patients with st-BMs from four gamma knife centers who developed secondary epilepsy after SRS were retrospectively studied between January 1, 2017 and June 31, 2023. The incidence and clinical characteristics of the patients with secondary epilepsy were analyzed. The predictive role of baseline clinical-demographic variables was evaluated according to univariate and multivariate logistic regression model. The impact of secondary epilepsy on patients' OS was evaluated as well by log-rank test. Results: 11.3 % (126/1120) of the patients with totally 158 st-BMs experienced secondary epilepsy after SRS in median 21 days. 61.9 % (78/126) of the patients experienced simple partial seizures. 91.3 % (115/126) patients achieved good seizure control after received 1-2 kinds of AEDs for median 90 days, while 7.1 % (9/126) of the patients suffered from refractory epilepsy. Patients had higher risk of secondary epilepsy if the tumor located in cortex and/or hippocampus, peri-tumor edema larger than 20.3 cm3 before SRS, had epilepsy history, and failed to receive bevacizumab prior to SRS. There was no difference in the OS of patients who experience secondary epilepsy or not after SRS. Conclusions: The incidence of SRS-related secondary epilepsy is 11.3 % in patients with st-BMs in this retrospective study. The risk of secondary epilepsy is higher in patients with st-BM located in cortex and/or hippocampus area, peri-tumor edema larger than 20.3 cm3 before SRS, and epilepsy history. Bevacizumab is suggested prior to SRS therapy, as it could be used for the control of peri-tumor edema and SRS-related damage, hence reduce the risk of secondary epilepsy. However, whether or not patients suffered from secondary epilepsy after SRS does not affect their OS.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, a woody plant that produces edible oil, is indigenous to China. The devastating disease of anthracnose inflicts significant financial losses on Ca. oleifera. The primary causative agent of anthracnose on Ca. oleifera is Colletotrichum fructicola. Chitin, a pivotal constituent of fungal cell walls, assumes a critical function in their proliferation and maturation. To study the biological functions of chitin synthase 1(Chs1) in C. fructicola, the CfCHS1 gene knockout mutants, increment Cfchs1-1 and increment Cfchs1-2, and their complementary strain, increment Cfchs1/CfCHS1, of C. fructicola were generated. Our results showed that the colony diameters of wild-type and complement-strain increment Cfchs1/CfCHS1, mutant increment Cfchs1-1 and increment Cfchs1-2 cultured on the CM and MM medium were 5.2, 5.0, 2.2 and 2.4 cm and 4.0, 4.0, 2.1 and 2.6 cm, respectively, which were significantly smaller for the mutant than for the wild type and complement strain; the inhibition rates on the CM medium supplemented with H2O2, DTT, SDS and CR were 87.0% and 88.5%, 29.6% and 27.1%, 88.0% and 89.4%, and 41.7% and 28.7%, respectively, for the mutant strains, increment Cfchs1-1 and increment Cfchs1-2, which were significantly higher than those for the other two strains; the rate of hyphal tips with CFW fluorescence in increment Cfchs1-1 and increment Cfchs1-2 was 13.3% and 15.0%, which was significantly lower than those for the other two strains; the mutant strains, increment Cfchs1-1 and increment Cfchs1-2, lost the ability to produce conidia; the mutant strains showed weaker pathogenicity on wounded and unwounded Ca. oleifera leaves than the wild type and complement strain. The findings of this study suggest that CfChs1 plays a crucial role in the growth and development, stress responses, and pathogenicity of C. fructicola. Thus, this gene could be a potential target for developing novel fungicide.

AB  - The study investigated the influence of a National Highway (NH) traversing tea estates (TEs) on heavy metal (HM) contamination in the top soils of Upper Assam, India. The dispersion and accumulation of six HMs, viz. cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn), within tea -growing soils were assessed using diverse indices: contamination factor (CF), degree of contamination (DC), enrichment factor (EF), geo-accumulation index (Igeo), modified degree of contamination (MDC), Nemerow pollution index (PINemerow), pollution load index (PLI), potential ecological risk factor (Eir), and potential ecological risk index (RI). The order of HM prevalence was Fe > Mn > Zn > Ni > Cu > Cd. Elevated Cd levels near the NH prompted immediate attention, while Cd and Zn showed moderate pollution in CF, EF, and RI. The remaining metals posed minimal individual risk (E-r(i)< 40), resulting in an overall contamination range of "nil to shallow," signifying slight contamination from the studied metals. From MDC values for investigated metals, it was found to be "zero to very low degree of contamination" at all locations except the vicinity of NH. Soil pollution, as determined by PLI, indicated unpolluted soils in both districts, yet PINemerow values indicated slight pollution. The statistical analysis revealed that there is a significant decrease in most of the indices of HM as the distance from NH increases. The application of multivariate statistical techniques namely Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis showed the presence of three distinct homogenous groups of distances based on different indices. This investigation underscores NH -associated anthropogenic effects on TE soil quality due to HM deposition, warranting proactive mitigation measures.

AB  - Simple Summary The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of three lipid supplements in ovine diets on milk healthy fatty acid composition. Rations provided a source of alpha-linolenic acid, either protected or unprotected from ruminal biohydrogenation (linseed oil and Ca-salts of linseed oil) or long-chain n-3 fatty acids (algae oil). Algae oil supplementation generated the highest levels of n-3 fatty acids in ewe's milk. However, dry matter intake, milk yield and fat content declined with the inclusion of algae oil in the diet. The fatty acid profiles of milk from both linseed oil supplemented rations did not significantly differ, and both were effective to diminish saturated fatty acids. Increasing the levels of n-3 fatty acids (FA) in dairy products is an important goal in terms of enhancing the nutritional value of these foods for the consumer. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of linseed and algae oil supplements in ovine isoenergetic diets on healthy milk fatty acid composition, mainly n-3. Seventy-two Churra dairy ewes were divided and randomly assigned to four experimental treatments for 6 weeks. The treatments consisted of a TMR (40:60 forage:concentrate ratio) that varied according to the inclusion of different types of fat (23 g/100 g TMR): hydrogenated palm oil (control), linseed oil (LO), calcium soap of linseed oil (CaS-LO) and marine algae oil (AO). The most effective lipid supplement to increase n-3 FA in milk was AO. 22:6 n-3 and total n-3 PUFA content increased from 0.02 and 0.60% (control) to 2.63 and 3.53% (AO), respectively. All diets supplemented with n-3 FA diminished the content of saturated FA in milk and its atherogenic index, while the levels of trans-11 18:1 and cis-9 trans-11 18:2 significantly increased. Overall, the enhancement of n-3 FA in ewe's milk would be advantageous for the manufacture of nutritionally improved cheeses.

AB  - Background: Epidemiologic evidence on whether iron accumulation in brain modified the association between artificial light at night (ALAN) and incident mental disorders is lacking. The authors aims to investigate modification of brain iron deposition on the associations of ALAN with multiple mental disorders in the middle-aged and older adults.Methods: This prospective study used data from the UK Biobank. ALAN was drawn from satellite datasets. Susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used to ascertain iron content of each brain region. T2* signal loss was used as indices of iron deposition. The main outcomes are impacts of ALAN exposure on onset of wide spectrum of physician-diagnosed mental disorders, which was estimated by time-varying Cox proportional hazard model. The authors further conducted stratified analyses by levels of iron brain deposition to examine the potential modifying effects.Results: Among 298,283 participants followed for a median of 10.91 years, higher ALAN exposure was associated with increased risk of mental disorders. An IQR (11.37 nW/cm2/sr) increase in annual levels of ALAN was associated with an HR of 1.050 (95 % CI: 1.034,1.066) for any mental disorder, 1.076 (95 % CI: 1.053,1.099) for substance use disorder, and 1.036 (95 % CI: 1.004,1.069) for depression disorder in fully adjusted models. The exposure-response curves showed steeper trends at lower ALAN levels and a plateau at higher exposures. The associations were stronger in participants with high iron deposition in left hippocampus, left accumbens and left pallidum.Conclusions: ALAN was associated with multiple mental disorders in the middle-aged and older adults, and the findings indicated stricter standards of ALAN is needed and targeted preventive measures are warranted, especially with high brain iron deposition.

In this study, we investigated the interactions between a history of chronic adolescent stress (CAS) and repeated endotoxin exposure on behavior, synaptic mitochondria, and microglia in adult male and female Wistar rats. Adult rats from chronic stress and control conditions were exposed to either repeated endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) or saline injections every 3 days for 9 weeks. In both sexes, repeated LPS, regardless of stress history, impaired working memory in the Y maze. Regarding spatial memory, LPS impaired function for females; whereas, CAS altered function in males. Although males had an increase in anxiety-like behavior shortly after CAS, there were no long-term effects on anxiety-like behavior or social interaction observed in males or females. Stress did not alter synaptic mitochondrial function in either sex. Repeated LPS altered synaptic mitochondrial function such that ATP production was increased in females only. There were no observed increases in IBA-1 positive cells within the hippocampus for either sex. However, LPS and CAS altered microglia morphology in females. Impact of repeated LPS was evident at the terminal endpoint with increased spleen weight in both sexes and decreased adrenal weight in males only. Circulating cytokines were not impacted by repeated LPS at the terminal endpoint, but evidence of CAS effects on cytokines in females were evident. These data suggest a long-term impact of chronic stress and an impact of repeated endotoxin challenge in adulthood; however, not all physiological and behavioral metrics examined were impacted by the paradigm employed in this study and the two environmental challenges rarely interacted.

AB  - Certain object properties may render an item as more memorable than others. One such property is manipulability, or the extent to which an object can be interacted with using our hands. This study sought to determine if the manipulability of an item modulates memory task performance on both a behavioural and neural level. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from a large sample of right-handed individuals (N = 53) during a visual item recognition memory task. The task contained stimuli of both high and low manipulability. Analysis focused on activity in the theta rhythm (3.5-7 Hz), which has been implicated in sensorimotor integration, and the mu rhythm (8-14 Hz), the primary oscillation associated with sensorimotor related behaviours. At both encoding and retrieval, theta oscillations were greater over the left motor region for high manipulability stimuli, suggesting that an item's sensorimotor properties are assessed immediately upon presentation. Manipulability did not affect activity in the mu rhythm. However, mu oscillations over the left motor region were lower during the retrieval of old versus new items and response time was faster for old items, aligning with the cortical reinstatement hypothesis. These results collectively reveal an association between motor oscillations and memory processes, highlight the involvement of sensorimotor processing at both encoding and retrieval.

AB  - Objective: Acetaminophen (APAP), an antipyretic and analgesic commonly used during pregnancy, has been recognized as a novel environmental contaminant. Preliminary evidence suggests that prenatal acetaminophen exposure (PAcE) could adversely affect offspring's gonadal and neurologic development, but there is no systematic investigation on the characteristics of APAP's fetal developmental toxicity. Methods: Pregnant mice were treated with 100 or 400 mg/kg center dot d APAP in the second-trimester, or 400 mg/kg center dot d APAP in the second- or third-trimester, or different courses (single or multiple) of APAP, based on clinical regimen. The effects of PAcE on pregnancy outcomes, maternal/fetal blood phenotypes, and multi-organ morphological and functional development of fetal mice were analyzed. Results: PAcE increased the incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes and altered blood phenotypes including aminotransferases, lipids, and sex hormones in dams and fetuses. The expression of key functional genes in fetal organs indicated that PAcE inhibited hippocampal synaptic development, sex hormone synthesis, and osteogenic and chondrogenic development, but enhanced hepatic lipid synthesis and uptake, renal inflammatory hyperplasia, and adrenal steroid hormone synthesis. PAcE also induced marked pathological alterations in the fetal hippocampus, bone, kidney, and cartilage. The sensitivity rankings of fetal organs to PAcE might be hippocampus/bone > kidney > cartilage > liver > gonad > adrenal gland. Notably, PAcE-induced multi-organ developmental toxicity was more considerable under high-dose, second-trimester, and multi-course exposure and in male fetuses. Conclusion: This study confirmed PAcE-induced alterations in multi-organ development and function in fetal mice and elucidated its characteristics, which deepens the comprehensive understanding of APAP's developmental toxicity.

AB  - Remarkable performance improvements occur at the end of the third postnatal week in rodents tested in various tasks that require navigation according to spatial context. While alterations in hippocampal function at least partially subserve this cognitive advancement, physiological explanations remain incomplete. Previously, we discovered that developmental modifications to hippocampal glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in juvenile rats was related to more mature spontaneous alternation behavior in a symmetrical Y-maze. Moreover, a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors enabled immature rats to alternate at rates seen in older animals, suggesting an excitatory synaptic limitation to hippocampal maturation. We then validated the Barnes maze for juvenile rats in order to test the effects of positive AMPA receptor modulation on a goal-directed spatial memory task. Here we report the effects of the AMPA receptor modulator, CX614, on spatial learning and memory in the Barnes maze. Similar to our prior report, animals just over 3 weeks of age display substantial improvements in learning and memory performance parameters compared to animals just under 3 weeks of age. A moderate dose of CX614 enabled immature animals to move more directly to the goal location, but only after 1 day of training. This performance improvement was observed on the second day of training with drug delivery or during a memory probe trial performed without drug delivery after the second day of training. Higher doses created more search errors, especially in more mature animals. Overall, CX614 provided modest performance benefits for immature rats in a goal-directed spatial memory task.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the patient demographics, risk factors, which include comorbidities, medications used to treat COVID-19, and presenting symptoms and signs, and the management outcome of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal sinusitis. A retrospective, propensity score-matched, comparative study was conducted at a tertiary care center, involving 124 patients with invasive fungal sinusitis admitted between April 2021 and September 2021, suffering from or having a history of COVID-19 infection. Among the 124 patients, 87 were male, and 37 were female. A total of 72.6% of patients received steroids, while 73.4% received antibiotics, and 55.6% received oxygen during COVID-19 management. The most common comorbidities were diabetes mellitus (83.9%) and hypertension (30.6%). A total of 92.2% had mucor, 16.9% had aspergillus, 12.9% had both, and one patient had hyalohyphomycosis on fungal smear and culture. The comparative study showed the significant role of serum ferritin, glycemic control, steroid use, and duration in COVID-19-associated invasive fungal disease (p < 0.001). Headache and facial pain (68, 54.8%) were the most common symptoms. The most involved sinonasal site was the maxillary sinus (90, 72.6%). The overall survival rate at the three-month follow-up was 79.9%. COVID-19-related aggressive inflammatory response, uncontrolled glycemic level, and rampant use of steroids are the most important predisposing factors in developing COVID-19-associated invasive fungal sinusitis.

AB  - Recent studies have reported that demyelination is associated with the development of depression. Olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rodents are a useful experimental animal model for depressive disorder. However, little is known about the change in myelination in the brain of OBX mice. To address this question, we observed depressive-like behavior of OBX mice in the tail-suspension test, and determined the quantity of myelin proteins in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum and hippocampus on day 14 or 21 after surgery. The number of nodes of Ranvier paired with the paranodal marker contactin-associated protein (Caspr), as well as the numbers of immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the PFC, were also measured on day 21 after surgery. We examined whether these behavioral and neurochemical changes observed in OBX mice were reversed by chronic administration of imipramine. OBX mice showed depressive-like behavior in the tail-suspension test together with a decrease in the levels of myelin proteins such as myelin basic protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein and cyclicnucleotide phosphodiesterase in the PFC on day 21 after surgery. The number of nodes of Ranvier and mature oligodendrocytes were also decreased in the PFC of OBX mice, while the number of immature oligodendrocytes was increased on day 21 after surgery. However, the number of immature oligodendrocytes in the PFC of OBX mice was decreased on day 35 after surgery. Administration of imipramine (20 mg/kg) for 2 weeks from day 21 after surgery improved OBX-induced depressive-like behavior and abnormal myelination in the PFC. The present findings suggest that the disturbance of myelin function in the PFC may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression, and further support the notion that it plays an important role in the psychological state.

AB  - Background: Proteins are susceptible to HP-treatment and there is a need to determine the applicability of HP-treatment in dairy production. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of HP-treatment at 200-500 MPa (t(const.) = 10 min; T-const. = 20 degrees C) and skimming of HP-treated milk on the content of nitrogen compounds and protein composition of caprine milk. Methods: The content of nitrogen (total, non-casein, non-protein) was determined using the Kjeldahl method. Casein fractions and whey proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Color parameters were measured in the CIELAB color space. Results: HP-treatment decreased (p < 0.05) the content of non-casein nitrogen and soluble whey proteins. Skimming decreased the content of nitrogen compounds, and the noted decrease was more pronounced in HP-treated milk. Pressure and skimming had no influence on the proportions of alpha-, beta-, kappa-casein, beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin. Total color difference (Delta E) increased with a rise in pressure, particularly in skim milk. Conclusion: HP-treatment led to a loss of protein solubility at pH 4.6 in caprine milk. In HP-treated milk, skimming did not induce changes in protein composition, despite a decrease in the content of nitrogen compounds after the separation of the cream layer. Higher values of Delta E in skim milk than in whole milk point to changes in colloidal phase components.

AB  - Manganese (Mn) is a common environmental pollutant. Mn exposure can lead to neurodegenerative diseases resembling Parkinson's disease, and has become a major public health concern. However, the mechanism of Mn-induced neurotoxicity in the brain is not clear. Fecal microbiome transplantation (FMT) may alleviate the neurotoxicity of Mn exposure by remodeling the gut microbiota. In this study, MnCl2 (manganese chloride) was administered to mice as in drinking water (Mn: 200 mg/L), and fecal matter from donor mice was administered by oral gavage every other day to the recipient mice. The Mn exposure model (Mn group) and FMT model (Mn+FMT group) were established and analyzed 5 weeks post-exposure. The Wipi1 gene exhibited the most significant increase associated with Mn exposure and Mn+FMT treatment groups based on transcriptome analysis. Combined analysis of transcriptomics and proteomics demonstrated that the apelin signaling pathway is the main pathway affected by FMT during Mn exposure. Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that the expression of key proteins (Beclin-1, LC-3B, and PINK1) associated with autophagy in the hippocampus was robustly activated in the Mn exposure group, but attenuation was observed in Mn+FMT mice, suggesting a critical role of autophagy in neurotoxicity induced by Mn exposure. Our research provides evidence for the neurotoxic effects of Mn exposure through autophagy activation and provides an underlying mechanism of FMT protection against Mn-induced neurotoxicity through regulation of the apelin signaling pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary Dietary fibre was once considered to be a negative factor for monogastric animals due to its potential adverse effects on digestibility and performance. Recently, certain types of fibre have been proposed as an effective nutritional approach to maintaining piglets' gastrointestinal health after weaning. However, the relationships between the complex fibre properties of different sources and their physiological effects remain unclear. This research had a dual purpose. Firstly, to evaluate the use of novel fibre sources in piglet feed, such as almond shell, olive kernel, and nutshell, which are very finely ground fibre sources typically unsuitable as dietary ingredients due to their hardness and particle size. Secondly, to assess the impact of their physicochemical properties, such as fermentability and hydration properties, on piglet performance compared with lignocellulose, the most commonly used fibre source. Overall, these results highlight the importance of the physicochemical characteristics of fibre sources, suggesting that a combination of insoluble fibre with a prebiotic fermentable fraction, having medium hydration properties, may improve performance in weaned piglets.Abstract The effect of including micronised fibre sources (FS) differing in fermentability and hydration capacity (HC) on growth performance, faecal digestibility, and caecal fermentation was investigated in piglets. There were four dietary treatments: a control diet (CON) and three treatments differing in the HC and fermentability of FS added at 1.5% to prestarter (28-42 d) and starter (42-61 d) diets. These were: LHC (low-HC by-product-based insoluble fibre (IF) with a prebiotic fraction (PF) from chicory root); MHC (medium-HC by-product-based IF with a PF); and HHC (high-HC non-fermentable wood-based IF with no PF). There were eight replicates per treatment. Over the entire period, LHC and MHC piglets showed a 10% increase in daily growth and feed intake (p <= 0.019) and tended to have a reduced feed conversion ratio (p = 0.087) compared to HHC piglets. At 42 d, faecal protein digestibility increased by 5% in the LHC and MHC groups compared with the HHC group (p = 0.035) and did not differ from the CON group. Both LHC and MHC fibres were more fermented in vitro with caecal inocula from 61 d old piglets than HHC fibre (p <= 0.003). These results suggest that balanced soluble and insoluble fibre concentrates can improve piglet performance.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have shown that prenatal triphenyl phosphate (TPhP) exposure is related to abnormal neurobehavior in children. However, the neurodevelopmental toxicity of TPhP in mammals is limited. To study the neurodevelopmental toxicity of TPhP in mammals and investigate the underlying mechanism, we used a mouse intrauterine TPhP exposure model. We measured the inflammatory factors (IL-6, TNF alpha) and NF kappa B levels, and tryptophan metabolism in placentae, detected the fetal brain transcriptome, hippocampal neuron develop-ment and neurobehavioral in the male offspring. The results showed that the protein level of IL-6, TNF alpha and NF kappa B in the placenta of the TPhP treatment group (1, 5 mg/kg) were significantly increased. Change of the protein level of these pro-inflammatory factors in maternal serum or fetal brain was not observed. Expression of genes along tryptophan-serotonin metabolism pathway were significantly decreased. While, the concentration of 5-HT levels in the placenta or fetal brain were significantly increased. Consistent with the increased 5-HT, the Nissl body was reduced in the hippocampus of treatment group. The expression of serotonergic neuron gene markers including Tph2, Htr1A, Htr2A, Pet1 and Lmx1b in the hippocampus of treatment group was significantly decreased. The neurobehavioral test showed that TPhP decreased center time that represent anxiety-like behavior, and reduced learning and memory in male offspring. Meanwhile, expression of genes along tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism pathway were significantly increased. The result of the transcriptome analysis of fetal brain showed that the differentially expressed genes are mainly involved in the transcription regulation of DNA as a template in the nucleus, and the enriched pathways are mainly signal pathways regulated by axon guidance and neurotrophic factors, dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses, suggest that not only serotonergic neuronal was affected. Overall, this study demonstrates that TPhP has the potential to induce placental inflammatory response in the placenta, disturb placental tryptophan metabolism, compromise the neuronal development and synaptic transmission, and cause abnormal neurobehavior in male offspring.

AB  - These experiments examined whether morphine and cocaine alter the balance between hippocampal and striatal memory systems measured long after drug exposure. Male rats received injections of morphine (5 mg/kg), cocaine (20 mg/kg), or saline for five consecutive days. One month later, rats were trained to find food on a hippocampus-sensitive place task or a striatum-sensitive response task. Relative to saline controls, morphine-treated rats exhibited impaired place learning but enhanced response learning; prior cocaine exposure did not significantly alter learning on either task. Another set of rats was trained on a dual-solution T-maze that can be solved with either place or response strategies. While a majority (67%) of control rats used place solutions, morphine treatment one month prior resulted in the exclusive use of response solutions (100%). Prior cocaine treatment did not significantly alter strategy selection. Molecular markers related to learning and drug abuse were measured in the hippocampus and striatum one month after drug exposure in behaviorally untested rats. Protein levels of glial-fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament specific to astrocytes, increased significantly in the hippocampus after morphine exposure, but not after cocaine exposure. Exposure to morphine or cocaine did not significantly change levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or a downstream target of BDNF signaling, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta), in the hippocampus or striatum. Thus, exposure to morphine resulted in a long-lasting shift from hippocampal toward striatal dominance during learning, an effect that may be associated with lasting alterations in hippocampal astrocytes. Cocaine produced changes in the same direction, suggesting that use of a higher dose or longer duration of exposure might produce effects comparable to those seen with morphine.

AB  - Immersive virtual reality (VR) allows its users to experience physical space in a non-physical world. It has developed into a powerful research tool to investigate the neural basis of human spatial navigation as an embodied experience. The task of wayfinding can be carried out by using a wide range of strategies, leading to the recruitment of various sensory modalities and brain areas in real-life scenarios. While traditional desktop-based VR setups primarily focus on vision-based navigation, immersive VR setups, especially mobile variants, can efficiently account for motor processes that constitute locomotion in the physical world, such as head turning and walking. When used in combination with mobile neuroimaging methods, immersive VR affords a natural mode of locomotion and high immersion in experimental settings, designing an embodied spatial experience. This in turn facilitates ecologically valid investigation of the neural underpinnings of spatial navigation.

AB  - The developing infant brain has a different response mechanism and repair potential for injury than the adult brain. There is an urgent need for new anticonvulsants to effectively control neonatal seizures while minimizing the drug's toxic damage to the developing brain. Leptin protects neuronal plasma membrane integrity, while it has clinical advantages in terms of anticonvulsant properties as well. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of immediate leptin treatment on the serum concentration of clusterin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), neuronal plasma membrane integrity-related proteins, and the neu-robehavioral phenotypes following neonatal seizures. Leptin was injected i.p at a dose of 4 mg/kg 1 hour after daily 30 minutes prolonged seizures for consecutive 10 days. The serum biomarkers (clusterin and VEGF), and brain protein expression of ATF-4/GRP78/autophagy axis were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blot in the acute phase (24 hours after the last seizures), respectively. Behavioral and histopathological phenotypes and seizure threshold were conducted from P23 to P34, respectively. There were rapid elevation of serum VEGF and clusterin as well as upregulated protein expression of ATF-4, GRP78, Beclin-1, and LC3 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus following a neona-tal seizure, which was restored by immediate treatment with leptin after seizures. In addition, leptin improved seizure-induced impaired neuropsychological, and cognitive functioning. Furthermore, leptin succeeded in ameliorating markers of neuronal excitability, including seizure threshold and hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting. In conclusion, this study verified that immediate treatment with leptin after neonatal seizures restored both rapid elevation of serum clusterin as well as upregulated protein expres-sion of ATF-4/GRP78/autophagy axis in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, which contributes to the recovery of neurological function.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The Pinjore Formation of the Upper Siwalik subgroup, north of Chandigarh, provides one of the most extensive and continuous sequences of Quaternary deposits in northern India. Since the early 19th century, scholars have been involved with extensive surveys and comprehensive fossil collections from the region. However, most fossils were collected as surface finds. New palaeontological surveys were initiated in 2020 to identify in-situ fossil scatters to understand palaeoecological and palaeodietary shifts in fauna within the Pinjore deposits (2.58-0.63 Ma). As a result, six new palaeontological localities were discovered in the region, with 981 fossil specimens (dental, post-cranial and fossil eggshells). The postcranial remains are fragmentary and undiagnosable, but dental remains can be identified to eight mammalian species of bovids, equids, proboscideans and rodents. More significantly, fossilised ratite eggshells were also discovered and collected from four separate scatters across the locality of Choti Badi Nangal and can be provisionally assigned to Struthio cf. S. camelus molybdophanes. This is also the first report of fossilised ratite eggshells from the Upper Siwalik Hills of India. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bone defect repair is a common medical concern. In spite of various existing treatments, its management still requires improvement. Here we show that YAP, a downstream signaling of Hippo pathway, might interplay with redox oxygen species (ROS) and modulate osteoimmunology, which refers to the interaction between immune and skeletal system during bone defect repair. We modulated the ROS level of RAW264.7 cells and found YAP level was reversely regulated. Meanwhile, we detected the feedback of YAP on oxidation level. The results demonstrated that the antioxidant enzyme expression was in proportion to the YAP level of RAW264.7 cells. Additionally, indirect coculture system was applied and it indicated that RAW264.7 cells under oxidative stress could impede proliferation and migration ability of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Consistently, in vivo experiment verified high oxidant level slowed down mice osteogenesis during bone defect repair, while antioxidant and upregulation of YAP accelerated this process. Additionally, we established a mouse model with YAP conditional knockout in macrophages. The results identified that deficiency of YAP in macrophages negatively affected bone defect repair in vivo. In summary, our study indicated that ROS and YAP could jointly modulate osteogenesis via their effect on osteoimmunology.

AB  - Camellia oleifera (C. oleifera) is one of the four major woody oil-bearing crops in the world and has relatively high ecological, economic, and medicinal value. Its seeds undergo a series of complex physiological and biochemical changes during ripening, which is mainly manifested as the accumulation and transformation of certain metabolites closely related to oil quality, especially flavonoids and fatty acids. To obtain new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms, a parallel analysis of the transcriptome and proteome profiles of C. oleifera seeds at different maturity levels was conducted using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) complemented with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data. A total of 16,530 transcripts and 1228 proteins were recognized with significant differential abundances in pairwise comparisons of samples at various developmental stages. Among these, 317 were coexpressed with a poor correlation, and most were involved in metabolic processes, including fatty acid metabolism, alpha -linolenic acid metabolism, and glutathione metabolism. In addition, the content of total flavonoids decreased gradually with seed maturity, and the levels of fatty acids generally peaked at the fat accumulation stage; these results basically agreed with the regulation patterns of genes or proteins in the corresponding pathways. The expression levels of proteins annotated as upstream candidates of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) as well as their cognate transcripts were positively correlated with the variation in the flavonoid content, while shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)-encoding genes had the opposite pattern. The increase in the abundance of proteins and mRNAs corresponding to alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was associated with a reduction in linoleic acid synthesis. Using weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), we further identified six unique modules related to flavonoid, oil, and fatty acid anabolism that contained hub genes or proteins similar to transcription factors (TFs), such as MADS intervening keratin-like and C-terminal (MIKC_MADS), type-B authentic response regulator (ARR-B), and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH). Finally, based on the known metabolic pathways and WGCNA combined with the correlation analysis, five coexpressed transcripts and proteins composed of cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs), caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT), flavonol synthase (FLS), and 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) were screened out. With this exploratory multiomics dataset, our results presented a dynamic picture regarding the maturation process of C. oleifera seeds on Hainan Island, not only revealing the temporal specific expression of key candidate genes and proteins but also providing a scientific basis for the genetic improvement of this tree species.

AB  - At the encounter with a novel environment, contextual memory formation is greatly enhanced, accompanied with increased arousal and active exploration. Although this phenomenon has been widely observed in animal and human daily life, how the novelty in the environment is detected and contributes to contextual memory formation has lately started to be unveiled. The hippocampus has been studied for many decades for its largely known roles in encoding spatial memory, and a growing body of evidence indicates a differential involvement of dorsal and ventral hippocampal divisions in novelty detection. In this brief review article, we discuss the recent findings of the role of mossy cells in the ventral hippocampal moiety in novelty detection and put them in perspective with other novelty-related pathways in the hippocampus. We propose a mechanism for noveltydriven memory acquisition in the dentate gyrus by the direct projection of ventral mossy cells to dorsal dentate granule cells. By this projection, the ventral hippocampus sends novelty signals to the dorsal hippocampus, opening a gate for memory encoding in dentate granule cells based on information coming from the entorhinal cortex. We conclude that, contrary to the presently accepted functional independence, the dorsal and ventral hippocampi cooperate to link the novelty and contextual information, and this dorso-ventral interaction is crucial for the novelty-dependent memory formation.

AB  - To determine effects of timed artificial insemination (TAI) hormonal treatments on reproductive performance of gilts/sows and explore molecular mechanisms, gilts (TAI: 90; Control:149; Total: 239) and sows (TAI: 370; Control: 492) were utilized. Results indicated the estrus/farrowing rate and number of piglets born alive and weaned in the TAI group were greater than in the control group for both gilts and sows. To explore the molecular mechanism for TAI hormonal effects, the small RNA of the gilt endometrium at 16 and 25 of gestation were sampled and sequenced to determine potential functions of microRNA (MiRNA); 358 known and 142 novel MiRNAs were detected. With comparison of TAI and control groups, there were 54 differentially abundant MiRNAs, and functional analysis results indicated "binding," "protein/ion binding," and "immune response" were mostly enriched. In addition, representative MiRNAs were selected based on criteria including being regulated on both day 16 and 25 of gestation (ssc-miR-10a-5p, ssc-miR-345-5p, ssc-miR-370) along with reproduction-related target genes (ssc-miR-424-5p, ssc-miR-142-5p). Furthermore, target genes of selected MiRNAs were screened, and functional enrichment of those genes also indicated that the "binding" and "immune response" were mainly enriched. Results from the present study confirmed TAI-hormonal treatments improved estrous/farrowing rate and number of piglets born alive/weaned of gilts/sows and that hormonal treatment regimens leading to behavioral estrus at timed artificial insemination in gilts results in microRNA patterns in the endometrium that are more supportive of pregnancy. Results contribute valuable information for future studies of effects of TAI hormonal treatments on pig reproductive performance.

AB  - In cattle, artificial insemination (AI) is a technique that allows breeding by depositing frozen-thawed and extended semen into the female reproductive tract. The semen contains sperm with various motility patterns including dead, progressive and hyperactivated. Sperm hyperactivation is high amplitude, asymmetrical beating of sperm tail which usually occurs in the oviduct as part of the capacitation process, but it can also be induced by cryopreservation. After insemination, sperm enter the uterine glands and trigger a pro-inflammatory response in the uterus. Hyperactivated sperm, stimulated by sperm-Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), penetrates the mucus and uterine glands more efficiently and enhances the immune response. This facilitates the clearance of excess and dead sperm from the uterus. Some sperm escape the immune response and reach the oviduct either before or after the immune response is initiated. In the oviduct, sperm bind to the epithelium and form a reservoir. This triggers an anti-inflammatory response and preserves the fertilization potential of sperm. Hyperactivation facilitates sperm detaching from the epithelium, swimming through the viscous mucus and cumulus cells, and penetrating the egg's zona pellucida. Sperm-TLR2 activation enhances Ca2+-influx and acrosome reaction, which enables sperm to penetrate and fertilize oocytes during in vitro fertilization. Altogether, post-AI in cattle, sperm and maternal immunity interact differentially depending upon the site of sperm hyperactivation - whether it occurs within the uterus or oviduct. Specifically, hyperactivated sperm that enter the uterus after AI or are triggered via sperm-TLR2 activation or other stimuli contribute to sperm-induced uterine inflammation. Such hyperactivated sperm may impede their capacity to ascend to the oviduct. Conversely, sperm that become hyperactivated within the oviduct modulate their interactions with the oviduct and oocytes, which is pivotal during fertilization process. Indeed, the location and timing of sperm hyperactivation partially via TLR2 activation are critical determinants of their different influence on fertility.

AB  - PurposeThe objective of this study is to examine the alterations in subcortical brain volume and cortical thickness among individuals diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) through the application of morphometry techniques and, additionally, to investigate the potential association between these modifications and insulin resistance (IR).Materials and methodsThe present cross-sectional study comprised a total of 121 participants (n = 48 with healthy controls [HCs] and n = 73 with T2DM) who were recruited and underwent a battery of cognitive testing and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). FreeSurfer was used to process the MRI data. Analysis of covariance compared discrepancies in cortical thickness and subcortical brain volume between T2DM and HCs, adjusting for the potential confounding effects of gender, age, education, and body mass index (BMI). Exploratory partial correlations investigated links between IR and brain structure in T2DM participants.ResultsCompared with HCs, individuals with T2DM demonstrated a cortical thickness decrease in the right caudal middle frontal gyrus, right pars opercularis, left precentral gyrus, and bilateral superior frontal gyrus. Furthermore, this study for T2DM found that the severity of IR was inversely related to the volume of the left putamen and left hippocampus, as well as the thickness of the left pars orbitalis, left pericalcarine, right entorhinal area, and right rostral anterior cingulate gyrus.ConclusionThe evidence for structural brain changes in T2DM was observed, and alterations in cortical thickness were concentrated in the frontal lobes. Correlations between IR and frontal cortical thinning may serve as a potential neuroimaging marker of T2DM and lead to various diabetes-related brain complications.

AB  - Background: Depression is the most common comorbidities associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to explore the mechanism of association between RA and depression. Methods: 120 subjects were enrolled and depression was diagnosed and assessed using DSM-5 and 24-item version of Hamilton Depression Scale. Pain intensity and joint function in patients with RA were assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ). Serum levels of interferongamma (IFN-gamma), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), kynurenine (KYN), tryptophan (TRP), and quinolinic acid (QUIN)were detected. In animal experiments, K/BxN mice with RA-like phenotype was used and depressive behavior was observed. The protein expression level of N-methyl -D- aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B) in the hippocampus was detected. Results: In this study, 36.67 % of patients with RA also had depression. The working status, month family income, tender joint count, the VAS and HAQ score were the main factors influencing the depression in RA patients. HAQ score was found to be an independent risk factor for depression in RA. Serum IDO, IFN-gamma, KYN were increased and TRP contents were decreased in RA group. K/BxN mice with RA-like phenotype showed depressive behavior. However, injection of IFN-gamma neutralizing antibody could inhibit kynurenine pathway and reverse the depressive behavior in mice. The levels of QUIN in the neurotoxic metabolic pathway were increased and N-methyl -Daspartate receptors (NMDAR) were activated, which may be the mechanism behind the onset of depression. Conclusions: From clinical and preclinical aspects, the occurrence of depression in RA was explored and the related mechanism was revealed.

AB  - Rett syndrome (RTT) is a rare neurological disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene and a major cause of intellectual disability in females. No cure exists for RTT. We previously reported that the behavioural phenotype and brain mitochondria dysfunction are widely rescued by a single intracerebroventricular injection of the bacterial toxin CNF1 in a RTT mouse model carrying a truncating mutation of the MeCP2 gene (MeCP2-308 mice). Given the heterogeneity of MECP2 mutations in RTT patients, we tested the CNF1 therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model carrying a null mutation (MeCP2-Bird mice). CNF1 selectively rescued cognitive defects, without improving other RTT-related behavioural alterations, and restored brain mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activity in MeCP2-Bird mice. To shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential CNF1 effects on the behavioural phenotype, we compared treatment effects on relevant signalling cascades in the brain of the two RTT models. CNF1 provided a significant boost of the mTOR activation in MeCP2-308 hippocampus, which was not observed in the MeCP2-Bird model, possibly explaining the differential effects of CNF1. These results demonstrate that CNF1 efficacy depends on the mutation beared by MeCP2-mutated mice, stressing the need of testing potential therapeutic approaches across RTT models.

AB  - The dramatic rise in allergic disease has occurred in tandem with recent environmental changes and increasing indoor lifestyle culture. While multifactorial, one consistent allergy risk factor has been reduced sunlight exposure. However, vitamin D supplementation studies have been disappointing in preventing allergy, raising possible independent effects of ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. The aim of this study was to examine whether UV light exposure influences the development of allergic disease in early childhood. Direct sunlight exposure (290-380 nm) in early infancy was measured via UV dosimeters. Outdoor exposure, sun protective behaviours, and allergy outcomes were assessed over the first 2.5 years of life with clinical assessment appointments at 3, 6, 12 and 30 months of age. Children with eczema had less (p = 0.038) direct UV light exposure between 0-3 months of age (median (IQR) 747 (473-1439) J/m(2)) than children without eczema (median (IQR) 1204 (1717-1843) J/m(2)); and less outdoor exposure time (7 min/day) between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. compared to children without eczema (20 min/day, p = 0.011). These associations were seen independent of vitamin D status, and after adjusting for other potential confounders. Whilst we could not find any associations between direct UV light exposure and other allergic disease outcomes, exposure to UV light appears to be beneficial in reducing the risk of eczema development in early childhood. Further research is required to determine optimal levels of UV light exposure while balancing the potential risks.

AB  - Sevoflurane (Sev), a widely used volatile anesthetic, can cause long-term neurotoxicity and learning and memory impairment. Dexmedetomidine (Dex) has been reported to exhibit neuroprotective effects in numerous neurological disorders. Our work aimed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of Dex in Sev-induced neurotoxicity. In this study, it was found that Dex mitigated Sev-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, Sev treatment upregulated the miR-330-3p expression in hippocampus tissues, while this effect was reversed by the Dex treatment. Additionally, microRNA-330-3p (miR-330-3p) inhibition was verified to inhibit cell apoptosis and facilitate mitophagy. ULK1 was confirmed as a downstream target of miR-330-3p and miR-330-3p could negatively regulate ULK1 expression. Finally, the effects of miR-330-3p inhibition on Sev-induced neurotoxicity could be offset by ULK1 knockdown or further intensified by Dex treatment. In summary, our study demonstrated that Dex regulated cell apoptosis and mitophagy in Sev-induced neurotoxicity through the miR-330-3p/ULK1 axis. These findings might provide novel insights into the treatment of Sev-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - Sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE) frequently encounters patients who are in intensive care units and -70% of patients with severe systemic infection. However, due to the unclear pathological mechanisms of SAE, the desease-modifying drug is still lack. Here, we aimed to explore whether the flavonoid components extracted from CCL (CCLF) seeds possess protective effects on SAE animals, and systematically evaluate the transcriptomic alteration (in the hippocampus) after CCLF treatment on SAE animals employing RNA sequencing. We observed that CCLF improved the brain's learning and memory abilities and the structural integrity of BBB using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced SAE animal models, evaluated by behavioral test and tissue examination of animals respectively. RNA sequencing results showed that CCLF treatment reverses SAE-induced transcriptomic alteration in the hippocampus. Moreover, CCLF also dramatically relieved inflammatory (such as TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6) and oxidative (MDA and SOD activity) stresses, and inhibited SAE-induced neuron apoptosis in brain tissues. More importantly, CCLF restored the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and then induced the Nrf2 nuclear translocation to drive HO-1 expression both in vitro and in vivo. LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K, obviously blocked CCLF's functions on anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, and anti-oxidation in vivo, demonstrating that CCLF achieves its bioactivities in a PI3K/AKT signaling dependent manner. Altogether, CCLF exhibits remarkable neuro-protective function and may be a promising candidate for further clinical trials for SAE treatment.

AB  - The seasonal quality of groundwater and its appropriateness for drinking and irrigation were assessed using a multiple indexing approach in this study. Physicochemical and ionic parameters were examined in groundwater samples near the industrial zone of Rupnagar, Punjab. To assess groundwater quality, water quality index (WQI) and pollution index were used. The Durov's, piper, wilcox and stiff diagrams were plotted to understand the hydro-chemistry. Similarly, the irrigation indices, i.e., salinity hazard, sodium adsorption ratio, soluble sodium percentage (Na%), magnesium adsorption ratio, residual sodium carbonate, permeability index and Kelley's ratio were applied to ascertain the water quality for agricultural purposes. As a result, total hardness, calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+) and fluoride (F-) were found above the standard permissible limits. WQI analysis showed 12% samples of pre-monsoon (PRE-M) and 28% samples of post-monsoon (POS-M) were of poor quality, which may pose health risks. Hydrochemistry revealed the predominance of Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+ and HCO3- ions in the groundwater attributed to natural and anthropogenic sources. Piper diagram revealed Ca2+-Mg2+-Cl-, Na+-Cl-, Ca2+-Na+- HCO3-, Ca2+- HCO3- and Ca2+-Cl, Ca2+-HCO3- water types exist in the study area. USSL diagram showed that the samples from both seasons come under the low salinity hazard. In addition, total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity showed a strong positive association, indicating the saline nature of groundwater. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering classified groundwater into three groups (I, II and III), revealing that groundwater quality varies due to natural and anthropogenic effects. Based on the findings, the groundwater was found marginally suitable for drinking and irrigation purposes. It is therefore recommended that the groundwater is examined on a regular basis in order to maintain its quality.

AB  - Management of overabundant free-roaming horse (Equus ferus caballus) populations has become a divisive and challenging effort for natural resource managers worldwide. Controlling these populations requires land managers to balance socio-political issues, multiple use management concepts, and endearing affection of horses to some stakeholders against negative ecological alterations created by excessive densities of these animals. One potential solution to this dilemma is controlling the fertility of female horses. During 2013-2020, research was conducted to develop and test a prototype dart configuration system to deliver an effective dose of GonaConEquine to free-roaming horses. This remote dart delivery system was demonstrated to be safe and reliable in free-ranging horses with a 90% (71/79) success rate for first attempts and provided the opportunity to design an experiment to determine the long-term effectiveness, reversibility, and physiological side effects of different reimmunization schedules. Five experimental groups of mares were established consisting of a control (n = 25), and a 4-yr reimmunization interval (n = 25) of mares from a previous experiment that were treated with this same vaccine by hand injection in 2013. Additional booster intervals of horses were (2-yr (n = 11), 1-yr (n = 15), and 0.5-yr (n = 14) and vaccinated by remote dart delivery during 2013-2016. Weekly ground observations were utilized to estimate foaling proportions, foal survival, body condition, and injection site reactions related to treatment groups. All GonaCon-Equine booster intervals reduced (P <= 0.001) foaling proportions between treated and control mares for all years of the experiment. Effective contraception was also achieved when GonaCon-Equine was applied by remote dart delivery at post-primary intervals shorter than 4 years. Reversibility of GonaCon-Equine immunization occurred in all treatment groups and averaged 0.40 (26/65). The only detectable adverse side effect of vaccination was intramuscular swelling observed in 89% (115/129) of mares and occasional draining abscesses at the site of vaccine injection. However, regardless of method of vaccine delivery (hand vs dart), none of these mares displayed any evidence of lameness, altered gait, or abnormal range of movement during the 6 years of this study. These results support previous findings that effective contraception of free-roaming horses will require a primary vaccination followed by reimmunization but that timing from 6 months to 4 years result in similar success and together can achieve greater reduction in population growth rates.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that the nucleus accumbens (NAc) plays an important role in modulation of nociception due to its extensive connections with different regions of the brain. In addition, this nucleus receives histaminergic projections from tuberomammillary nucleus. Considering the role of the central histaminergic system in nociception, the effect of histamine and its H-2 and H-3 receptors agonist and antagonist microinjections into the NAc on orofacial formalin nociception was investigated. In male Wistar rats, using stereotaxic surgery, two guide cannulas were bilaterally implanted into the right and left sides of the NAc. Diluted formalin solution (1.5%, 50 mu l) injection into the vibrissa pad led to orofacial nociception. Immediately after injection, face rubbing was observed at 3-min blocks for 45 min. Orofacial formalin nociception was characterized by a biphasic nociceptive response (first phase: 0-3 min and second phase: 15-33 min). Microinjections of histamine (0.5 and 1 mu g/site), dimaprit (1 mu g/site, H2 receptor agonist) and thioperamide (2 mu g/site, H-3 receptor antagonist) attenuated both phases of formalin orofacial nociception. Prior microinjection of famotidine (2 mu g/site) inhibited the antinociceptive effects of dimaprit (1 mu g/site). Furthermore, comicroinjection of thioperamide (2 mu g/site) and immepip (1 mu g/site) prevented thioperamide (2 mu g/site)-induced antinociception. Naloxone (2 mu g/site) also prevented histamine, dimaprit- and thioperamide-induced antinociception. The results of this study demonstrate that at the level of the NAc, histamine and its H-2 and H-3 receptors are probably involved in the modulation of orofacial nociception with an opioid system-dependent mechanism.

AB  - Memories related to ingroup members are remembered more accurately than those related to outgroup members. However, little is known about the age-dependent differences in neural mechanisms underlying the retrieval of memories shared with ingroup or outgroup members that are categorized by age-group membership. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated this issue. Healthy young and older adults participated in a 2-day experiment. On the first day outside fMRI, participants were presented with words by unfamiliar persons in movie clips and exchanged each word with persons belonging to the same age group (SAG) or different age group (DAG). On the second day during fMRI, participants were randomly presented with learned and new words one by one, and they judged whether each word had been encoded with either SAG or DAG members or neither. fMRI results demonstrated that an age-dependent decrease in successful retrieval activation of memories presented by DAG was identified in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and hippocampus, whereas with memories presented by SAG, an age-dependent decrease in activation was not found in any regions. In addition, an age-dependent decrease in functional connectivity was significant between the hippocampus/ATL and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) during the successful retrieval of memories encoded with the DAG people. The "other"-related mechanisms including the hippocampus, ATL, and pSTS with memories learned with the outgroup members could decrease in older adults, whereas with memories learned with the ingroup members, the "self"-related mechanisms could be relatively preserved in older adults.

AB  - Background: Patterns of humoral immune responses represent a major hurdle in terms of pig-to-human xenotransplantation approaches. The best-known xenogeneic glycan antigens present in pigs are the alpha Gal (Galili antigen) and the non-human sialic acid Neu5Gc. As there are further differences between porcine and human cellular surface glycosylation, a much broader range of glycan epitopes with xeno-reactive relevance can be anticipated. Therefore, we set out to chemically modify porcine cellular surface glycans in a global approach by applying sodium periodate (NaIO4) oxidation. Methods: Porcine endothelial cells were exposed to oxidation with 1 to 5 mM NaIO4 for different time periods at 37 degrees C or 4 degrees C and under static or dynamic conditions. The impact on cellular survival was determined by applying live/dead assays. Oxidation of alpha Gal-epitopes was assessed by fluorescence microscopy-based quantification of isolectin-B4 (IL-B4) staining. Overall immunogenicity of porcine cells was determined by human serum antibody binding. Results: Treatment of porcine endothelial cells and tissues with NaIO4 led to reduced binding of the alpha Gal-specific IL-B4 and/or human serum antibodies. NaIO4 was revealed to be cytotoxic when performed at elevated temperatures and for a prolonged time. However, by applying 2 mM NaIO4 for 60 min at 4 degrees C, a high extent of cellular viability and a relevant reduction in detectable alpha Gal epitope were observed. No differences were detected irrespectively on whether the cells were oxidized under static or flow conditions. Conclusions: Glycan epitopes on living cells can be oxidized with NaIO4 while maintaining their viability. Accordingly, this strategy holds promise to prevent immune reactions mediated by preformed anti-glycan antibodies.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of yeast culture (YC) on reproductive performance, gut microbiota, and milk composition in primiparous sows. A total of 60 primiparous sows were randomly assigned to the control group (CON) and YC group (0.5% YC during gestation and 0.8% YC during lactation) consisting of 30 replicates, with one sow in each. The results showed that dietary YC supplementation increased the piglet birth weight and backfat thickness at 28 d of lactation (p < 0.05). Dietary YC supplementation increased the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of gross energy and calcium during lactation, the content of acetic acid and propionic acid at 110 d of gestation, and the content of acetic acid and butyric acid at 28 d of lactation in feces (p < 0.05). Furthermore, dietary YC supplementation decreased the abundance of Firmicutes, Lachnospiraceae_XPB1014_group, and Terrisporobacter (p < 0.05), and increased the abundance of Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group (p < 0.05). Compared to the control group, dietary YC supplementation increased the fat and lactose content of the colostrum (p < 0.05). Metabolomics analysis showed that YC increased 26 different metabolites in the colostrum. Among them were mainly pantothenic acid, proline, isoleucine, phenylalanine, acylcarnitine, and other metabolites. In conclusion, these results suggested that dietary YC supplementation improves reproductive performance and gut health and increases the nutrient content in the colostrum of primiparous sows.

AB  - Central ghrelin signaling seems to play important role in addiction as well as memory processing. Antagonism of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1A) has been recently proposed as a promising tool for the unsatisfactory drug addiction therapy. However, molecular aspects of GHS-R1A involvement in specific brain regions remain unclear. The present study demonstrated for the first time that acute as well as subchronic (4 days) administration of the experimental GHS-R1A antagonist JMV2959 in usual intraperitoneal doses including 3 mg/kg, had no influence on memory functions tested in the Morris Water Maze in rats as well as no significant effects on the molecular markers linked with memory processing in selected brain areas in rats, specifically on the 8-actin, c-Fos, two forms of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII, p-CaMKII) and the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB, p-CREB), within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal striatum, and hippocampus (HIPP). Furthermore, following the methamphetamine intravenous self-administration in rats, the 3 mg/kg JMV2959 pretreatment significantly reduced or prevented the methamphetamine-induced significant decrease of hippocampal 8-actin and c-Fos as well as it prevented the significant decrease of CREB in the NAC and mPFC. These results imply, that the GHS-R1A antagonist/JMV2959 might reduce/prevent some of the memory-linked molecular changes elicited by methamphetamine addiction within brain structures associated with memory (HIPP), reward (NAc), and motivation (mPFC), which may contribute to the previously observed significant JMV2959-induced reduction of the methamphetamine selfadministration and drug-seeking behavior in the same animals. Further research is necessary to corroborate these results.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the medical education platform for students in the United States of America (USA). In that light, medical schools had to rapidly rearrange the dynamics of their educational curricula from the traditional platforms, to incorporate telemedicine. The telemedicine platform is supported in many specialties, allowing students various options to continue their education without interruption during the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond. Telemedicine platforms are projected to grow exponentially due to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing a segue for medical schools to modify their curricula by incorporating telemedicine programs. These distant-, e-learning (tele-education) programs align with the recommendations and guidelines for practicing social distancing. In this article, we surveyed fourth-year medical students to better understand their views on multiple aspects of e-learning, and its impact on their medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed the medical students' experiences, satisfaction, insight and knowledge with e-learning, tele-education, telehealth, and their related modalities during COVID-19. We provide an organized overview and analysis of the main factors that influence medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic, while bringing forth the main challenges, limitations, and emerging approaches in the field of telemedicine and its application as it relates to medical education and e-learning across medical specialties. We outline the main themes and ideas that the medical students voiced, as to how their medical education is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they will incorporate telemedicine and tele-education in their future career. A cross-sectional, mixed-method survey was developed and distributed via Google Surveys to 181 University at Buffalo, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, United States of America, 4th year medical students, in December 2020. Results were compiled and analyzed after a 6-day open period for responses to be submitted. The survey instrument consisted of questions that inquire about the students' perspectives as it relates to their rapid switch from their traditional method of learning to the on-line version of medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 65 students responded to the survey, of which 63 completed the survey. More than half of the students (n = 63, 57%) indicated that both their specialty of interest, and (n = 21, 33%) their sub-internships were impacted by the temporary lockdown, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students also indicated that the top three specialties that were affected included surgery, internal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. When the students were asked if they were satisfied with the use of aquifer for their health care e-learning, only 35% of the students were satisfied. The students expressed that the school's administration team did a good job in developing the new tele-education curriculum for those in clinical training. In addition, responses indicated that students were open to case-based video learning and readings, when combined with the abbreviated clinical exposure during the make-up "clinical immersions periods" allowed for adequate learning. Overall, the survey responses show that more than half, approximately 54% of the medical students utilized telemedicine platforms during their clerkships that were impacted by COVID-19.
   The 4th-year medical students did not find tele-education and e-learning to be as effective as traditional medical education that combines in-person didactic classroom instructions and in-person face-to-face in hospital clerkships. Students felt that the telemedicine program that was rapidly set up due to the COVID-19 'lockdown' was fragmented, since it was not a formal integration of a telemedicine E-learning program. Students would have preferred more 'real' cases to follow, instead of the ready-made, aquifer type of cases. Telemedicine has significant potential to address many of the challenges facing the medical education environment today. We believe now that people have become comfortable with this method of teaching, that even after the pandemic ends, we will continue to see tele-education used as a platform for medical education.

AB  - Several memory consolidation theories have proposed that following a learning situation the hippocampus gradually stabilizes labile recent memories into long-lasting remote memories. Most work in this field has focused on the dorsal hippocampus (DHip), giving little consideration to a possible contribution by the ventral hippocampus (VHip), particularly when spatial paradigms are used. However, in recent years a growing number of studies have suggested the existence of a functional continuum, related to spatial processing and navigation, along the dorsoventral hippocampal axis. For this reason, in the present study we compare the effect of DHip vs. VHip lesions on long-term spatial memory retention. Using a four-arm plus-shaped maze, rats with lesions in the DHip, VHip or sham-lesioned learned to criterion a place discrimination task based on allothetic cues. During two retraining phases (2 days and 24 days after learning) retention of the spatial information learned during the acquisition phase was evaluated. The main findings revealed no deficit 2 days after learning, but 24 days after learning both lesioned groups showed a profound impairment compared to control animals (expt. 1). In contrast, when rats learned a cue-guided navigation task in the acquisition phase, both lesioned groups performed the two retention tests, 2 days and 24 days after learning, at the same level as the control group (expt. 2). These results suggest not only that the DHip is vital, but also that normal VHip activity is critical during the post-learning period in order for a recent spatial memory to become a stable long-term memory.

AB  - The roles of ion channels, miRNAs and, neurotransmitters in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) are not yet fully elucidated. The current study aims to investigate ion channel gene expressions in the brain, the therapeutic efficacies of TRPC1, TRPM4, and CHRNA6 inhibitors, miRNAs specific to these ion channels and, neurotransmitter interactions in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) induced MDD rat model. 48 two-month-old male albino Wistar rats were divided into Control, CUMS, Sham, CUMS+Pico145 (TRPC1 inhibitor), CUMS+ 9-Phe (TRPM4 inhibitor), and CUMS+BPiDl (CHRNA6 inhibitor) groups. Seven-week CUMS was used to induce MDD. Inhibitors were administered subacutely on the final of CUMS. Rats were subjected to behavioral tests. Gene expression levels were analyzed using qRT-PCR and neurotransmitter levels using ELISA. CUMS lead to a significant upregulation in the expression of channels in the hippocampus, and channels in the prefrontal cortex. Behavioral experiments determined the antidepressant effects as follows: Pico145 > BPiDl > 9-Phe. Compared to the Control, serotonin and noradrenaline levels remained unchanged, whereas dopamine levels increased. Acetylcholine levels decreased in CUMS and CUMS+Pico145 groups. CUMS significantly altered the expression of 6 miRNAs in the brain. BPiD1 upregulated the expression of miR-6334 and Pico145 upregulated the expression of miR-135b-5p and miR-875 in the prefrontal cortex. The interactions of ion channels, miRNAs, and disruptions of neurotransmitter networks can play an important role in the pathophysiology of MDD. Moreover, as shown in this study, ion channel inhibitors have significant potential in the treatment of this disease.

AB  - Simple Summary: Weaning stress is a major problem in the pig industry, causing high rates of diarrhea and poor performance in piglets. Cardamonin is a bioactive plant extract that possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and anti-viral properties. In this experiment, we investigated the effect of Cardamonin on intestinal barrier damage and inflammatory response caused by immune stress in piglets by establishing a stress model of LPS. Compared with those of the LPS group, the intestinal mucosal morphology and expression of tight junction proteins in the cardamonin group were improved, along with the inflammation response. Furthermore, certain intestinal microbiota and inflammation-related metabolites showed a significant correlation. The results indicate that the administration of Cardamonin can effectively improve intestinal mucosal barrier damage and inflammatory response induced by LPS by regulating the composition and metabolism of intestinal microbiota, with a better effect observed at a dosage of 6 mg/kg. The primary factor leading to elevated rates of diarrhea and decreased performance in piglets is immunological stress. The regulation of immune stress through the intestinal flora is a crucial mechanism to consider. In total, 30 weaned piglets were randomly allocated to five groups: the basal diet group (Control), basal diet + lipopolysaccharides group (LPS), basal diet + 250 mu g/kg 6-Formylindolo [3,2-b] carbazole + LPS group (FICZ), basal diet + 3mg/kg Cardamonin + LPS group (LCDN), and basal diet + 6mg/kg Cardamonin + LPS group (HCDN/CDN). The results showed that compared with those of the LPS group, the expression of tight junction proteins (occludin; claudin-1) in the FICZ group was significantly increased, and the mRNA levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). HCDN treatment had a better effect on LPS-induced intestinal barrier damage in this group than it did in the LCDN group. HCDN treatment leads to a higher villus height (VH), a higher ratio of villi height to crypt depth (V/C), higher tight junction proteins (ZO-1; occludin), and higher short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). In addition, correlation analyses showed that Succinivibrio was positively correlated with several SCFAs and negatively correlated with prostaglandin-related derivatives in the FICZ group and CDN group (p < 0.05). In summary, Cardamonin alleviates intestinal mucosal barrier damage and inflammatory responses by regulating the intestinal microbiota and its metabolism.

AB  - Wnt proteins activate different signaling pathways, such as the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and non-canonical beta-catenin-independent signaling pathway and have been related to several functions in central nervous system, including learning and memory. However, whether these signaling pathways are required in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) for fear memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval remains unclear. To address this question, we submitted male rats to a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm, and administered canonical Wnt/beta-catenin and non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathways inhibitors, DKK1 and SFRP1, respectively, into the prelimbic (PrL) subdivision of the mPFC at different moments and evaluated short-term and long-term memory acquisition, consolidation and retrieval. We found that blocking canonical Wnt/beta-catenin and non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathways 15 min before or immediately after CFC training had no effect on STM and LTM of CFC, while their blockade 15 min before the retention test prevented the retrieval of STM and LTM of CFC. These results highlight the importance of the mPFC in fear memory retrieval demonstrating that both canonical Wnt/beta-catenin and non-canonical Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathways participate in this process. To understand how brain systems act on fear memories could provide a new target for the treatment of fear related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders.

AB  - Extensive studies in rodents show that place cells in the hippocampus have firing patterns that are highly correlated with the animal's location in the environment and are organized in layers of increasing field sizes or scales along its dorsoventral axis. In this study, we use a spatial cognition model to show that different field sizes could be exploited to adapt the place cell representation to different environments according to their size and complexity. Specifically, we provide an in-depth analysis of how to distribute place cell fields according to the obstacles in cluttered environments to optimize learning time and path optimality during goal-oriented spatial navigation tasks. The analysis uses a reinforcement learning (RL) model that assumes that place cells allow encoding the state. While previous studies have suggested exploiting different field sizes to represent areas requiring different spatial resolutions, our work analyzes specific distributions that adapt the representation to the environment, activating larger fields in open areas and smaller fields near goals and subgoals (e.g., obstacle corners). In addition to assessing how the multi-scale representation may be exploited in spatial navigation tasks, our analysis and results suggest place cell representations that can impact the robotics field by reducing the total number of cells for path planning without compromising the quality of the paths learned.

AB  - Simple Summary This experiment examined the impact of breeding heavier ewe lambs on lamb production and the ability of a ewe to produce a high number and heavier lambs (i.e., efficiency) over the first three breeding seasons. Two groups of ewe lambs were bred at seven months of age at an average live weight of either 47.9 +/- 0.36 kg (n = 135) or 44.9 +/- 0.49 kg (n = 135). Ewe live weight, number of lambs born and weaned, and lamb live weights were recorded, and ewe efficiency was calculated for each ewe. The weight and number of lambs at weaning over the three-year period did not differ between treatments, however, when data were pooled, heavier ewe lambs at breeding had a greater number and lamb weaning weight over the three-year period. Breeding heavier ewe lambs had no effect on ewe efficiency. There was a positive relationship between ewe lamb breeding live weight and their mature weight. These results suggest that breeding heavier ewe lambs increased the total lamb production over the three-year period, however, it had no effect on ewe efficiency. Before final recommendations can be made, ewe lifetime performance and longevity of heavier ewe lambs at breeding are required. This experiment examined the effect of breeding heavier ewe lambs on lamb production and their efficiency over their first three breeding seasons. Two groups of ewe lambs were bred at seven months of age at an average pre-breeding live weight of either 47.9 +/- 0.36 kg (heavy; n = 135) or 44.9 +/- 0.49 kg (control; n = 135). Ewe live weight, number of lambs born and weaned, and lamb live weight were recorded until 39 months of age, and efficiency was calculated for each ewe. Although the number and lamb weaning weight did not differ between treatments over three years, when data were pooled, heavier ewe lambs at breeding weaned a greater number of lambs over the three-year period. The total lamb weaning weight over the three-year period increased by 2% for each additional kilogram at ewe lamb breeding. Breeding heavier ewe lambs had no effect on efficiency. These results suggest that although breeding heavier ewe lambs had a positive effect on lamb production over the three-year period, it had no effect on efficiency. Before final recommendations can be made, lifetime performance and longevity to five years of age of heavier ewe lambs at breeding are required.

AB  - Stroke continues to be a major cause of mortality globally. Post-stroke treatment is complicated by the heterogenous nature of pathology and the emergence of secondary psychological symptoms are an additional challenge to the recovery process. Poststroke depression (PSD) is a common co-morbidity and is a major impediment to recovery. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have proven to be clinically efficacious in treating PSD, the pathogenic processes that underlie the manifestation of depressive mood post-stroke remains unclear. Furthermore, the use of SSRIs is associated with risks of intracerebral haemorrhage, so alternative treatment options need to be continuously explored. Exercise has been demonstrated to be beneficial for improving mood in humans and preclinical models of neurological conditions. Little is known of the mood related benefits of physical exercise post-stroke. Using the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mouse model of cerebral ischaemia, we investigated whether behavioural deficits emerge post-MCAO and could be rescued by voluntary wheel-running. We report that MCAO induced hypo-locomotion and anhedonia-related behaviours, with some improvements conferred by wheel-running. Serotonin transporter gene expression was increased in the MCAO hippocampus and frontal cortex, but this increase remained despite wheel-running. Wheel-running associated up-regulation of BDNF gene expression was unaffected in MCAO mice, reflecting conservation of key neuroplasticity molecular pathways. Taken together, our results highlight the need for further research into serotonergic modulation of the affective symptoms of stroke.

AB  - Simultaneously improving the charge transfer and suppressing the charge recombination at the interface is essentially important for high-performance perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). To achieve this goat in this work, we modify the anode interface of PVSCs with a ligand, bithiophenethylammonium iodide (2TEAI), which comprises both long-conjugation bithiophene and ammonium groups. With 2TEAI, high-performance FAPbI(3) (FA: HC(NH2)(2)) based PVSCs with significantly increased efficiency from 21.7% to 23.6% have been demonstrated for small area devices, as well as 21.3% for large-area (2.25 cm(2)) devices. Comprehensive analysis of the carrier dynamics and first-principles simulations unveils that the 2TEAI modification can (1) enhance the interfacial charge transfer due to energy level alignment between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the perovskite valence band, and (2) mitigate the charge recombination by passivating the trap states owing to its strong chemical interaction perovskite layer and reduction of Pb-0. Our work demonstrates a reliable strategy to optimize the interface and paves the way toward high-performance PVSCs for commercialization.

AB  - Increasing evidence implicates decreased energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunctions among the earliest pathogenic events of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying bioenergetic dysfunctions in AD remain, to date, largely unknown. In this work, we analyzed transcriptomic changes occurring in the hippocampus and retina of a Tg2576 AD mouse model and wild-type controls, evaluating their functional implications by gene set enrichment analysis. The results revealed that oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial-related pathways are significantly down-regulated in both tissues of Tg2576 mice, supporting the role of these processes in the pathogenesis of AD. In addition, we also analyzed transcriptomic changes occurring in Tg2576 mice treated with the 12A12 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes an AD-relevant tau-derived neurotoxic peptide in vivo. Our analysis showed that the mitochondrial alterations observed in AD mice were significantly reverted by treatment with 12A12mAb, supporting bioenergetic pathways as key mediators of its in vivo neuroprotective and anti-amyloidogenic effects. This study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive characterization of molecular events underlying the disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics in AD pathology, laying the foundation for the future development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), or Arabian camels, are mainly widespread in arid regions from the east of Asia to the north of Africa. Many species of parasites/arthropods affect camels, including ticks, able to transmit pathogens to animals and humans. Authors investigated the presence of blood parasites in n = 93 camels with acute clinical signs and in n = 72 ticks collected from these camels in Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi, United Arabian Emirates, through molecular techniques. All the 72 ticks collected were identified as Hyalomma dromedarii species and were found negative for pathogen DNA. DNA investigations on camel blood samples showed a positivity for tick-transmitted pathogens in 15 heads (16.1%): 15 Anaplasma phagocytophilum (11.8%), Coxiella burnetii (3.2%), and Babesia/Theileria spp. (2.1%). Coinfection of A. phagocytophiulm and C. burnetii was detected in a camel. C. burnetii sequences from our samples showed a high phylogenetic relatedness to strains from Europe, Africa, and Asia. The study represents the first molecular investigation on tick-borne pathogens in camels from United Arabian Emirates, and it highlights the possible risk of infection for humans working in close contact with camels.
   Camels represent an important resource for inhabitants of the most arid regions of the world and their survival is mainly related to environment conditions including the risk of parasitic diseases, which may represent a significant cause of losses in livestock production of these areas. Camels may be parasitized by several hematophagous arthropods, which can be vectors of several diseases including zoonosis. This study aimed to investigate in dromedary camels and their ticks the importance of tick-borne hemoparasites that might be responsible for a recent and obscure morbidity of camels in Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi, UAE. Blood samples and ticks from 93 naturally infected camels belonging to 36 herds, affected by variable acute clinical syndromes lasting from 3 to 5 days, were analyzed through molecular techniques for specific DNA presence of different blood pathogens: Anaplasma marginale/Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Coxiella burnetii, Babesia spp., and Theileria spp. DNA. All the 72 ticks collected belonged to the Hyalomma dromedarii species and were negative for blood pathogens. n = 15 camels (16.1%) were found positive to the following tick-borne hemoparasites: A. phagocytophilum 11 (11.8%), Coxiella burnetii 3 (3.2%), and Babesia/Theileria spp. 2 (2.1%). One singular camel showed coinfection of C. burnetii and A. phagocytophiulm. Genetic profile of C. burnetii showed a high phylogenetic relatedness to European, Asian and African C. burnetii strains. This is the first laboratory investigation on tick-borne pathogens in camels in UAE, and the first report of A. phagocytophilum and C. burnetii. Moreover, since the detected pathogens are recognized pathogens for humans, this study highlights the zoonotic risk for humans working in camel husbandry.

AB  - Pregnancy is marked by robust changes, including brain changes to volume, structure, connectivity and neuroplasticity. Although some brain changes are restricted to pregnancy and the postpartum, others are long-lasting. Few studies have examined possible mechanisms of these changes or the effects of multiple pregnancies. We characterized various cellular and molecular signatures of parity (nulliparous, primiparous, biparous) in the rat hippocampus. We investigated density of neural stems cells (Sox2), microglia (Iba-1) and levels of a synaptic protein (PSD-95), cell signalling pathways, neuroinflammation, and the tryptophan-kynurenine (TRP-KYN) pathway, one week after weaning their pups from the last pregnancy (age of dam: seven months) and in middle-age (age of dam: 13 months). Parity increased PSD-95 levels in both age groups and prevented the age-related decrease in neural stem cell density observed in nulliparous rats. Biparity increased cell signalling phosphoproteins (pp70S6K, S6RP) and number of microglia in the dentate gyrus, regardless of age. Parity resulted in transient changes to the TRP-KYN system. Thus, previous parity has lasting effects on synaptic plasticity with fewer lasting effects on inflammation and cell signalling phosphoproteins in the whole hippocampus.

AB  - As a regulatory protein that upregulates transcription in response to various stresses, cold-induced RNA-binding protein (CIRBP) is involved in a variety of physiological pathological processes in cells. However, little is known about the role of CIRBP in regulating autophagy and the synthesis and secretion of ovarian steroid hormones (estradiol E2 and progesterone P4). This study aimed to explore whether the synthetic secretion of ovarian steroid hormones is related to CIRBP-regulated autophagy. We detected the differential expression of CIRBP, LC3, E2 and P4 in YGCs cultured at mild low temperature (32 C-degrees) for 6 and 12 h. CIRBP, LC3, E2 and P4 expression was increased in response to low temperature in YGCs. In order to illustrate that the changes in secretion of E2/P4 and autophagy might be caused by CIRBP induced by low temperature, we overexpressed CIRBP in YGCs cultured in vitro to detect its effects on autophagy and steroid hormone synthesis and secretion. We found that overexpression of CIRBP can induce autophagy of YGCs and enhance the synthesis and secretion of E2 and P4, suggesting that mild hypothermia may activate autophagy by inducing the expression of CIRBP and enhance the synthesis and secretion of E2 and P4. To further explore the relationship between CIRBP regulated autophagy and steroid hormone synthesis and secretion, we verified it by regulating autophagy. The results showed that Inhibition of autophagy significantly reversed CIRBP overexpression-enhanced autophagy and synthetic secretion of E2, P4 in YGCs, while activated autophagy showed similar results to overexpression of CIRBP. In conclusion, our data suggest that autophagy is involved in the synthesis and secretion of YGCs E2 and P4 and is associated with overexpression of CIRBP.

AB  - Intramuscular fat, which is closely related to the traits of tenderness, juiciness, and flavor of pork, is regulated by numerous molecular regulatory mechanisms that have been regarded as an important agricultural research area. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging regulators involved in adipogenesis due to their functional diversity. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA related to porcine adipogenesis, named lncIMF1, based on previous RNA sequencing results. Our results suggested that lncIMF1 was most abundantly expressed in adipose tissue and located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus. Besides, lncIMF1 promoted the proliferation and differentiation, while inhibited apoptosis of intramuscular preadipocytes. Moreover, lncIMF1 could act as a molecular sponge for miR-187, inhibiting the binding of miR-187 and SMAD1, thereby promoting the expression of SMAD1 and enhancing the adipogenic differentiation of intramuscular preadipocytes. Additionally, we found that lncIMF1-miR187-SMAD1 axis could activate the p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Taken together, our study provided new insights into the role of lncRNAs in the regulation of pork quality.

AB  - Slight and hidden hearing loss in children have been linked to cognitive and social difficulties, and yet the neurobiological mechanisms behind these issues remain poorly understood. Most animal models focus on severe hearing loss, leaving the effects of hidden or slight hearing loss largely unexplored. To uncover the neural mechanisms connecting slight/hidden hearing loss to cognitive and social challenges, we induced hearing loss in young (4-week-old) Wistar rats through noise exposure. We then examined cognitive function (object recognition test) and social behavior (juvenile play behavior and social interaction). Changes in brain anatomy were assessed using cortical thickness and hippocampal size measurements, while (immuno)histochemical staining investigated neuronal circuitry maturation (myelin basic protein, parvalbumin, and perineuronal nets) and neurogenesis (doublecortin). Noise-exposed rats displayed slight high-frequency hearing loss (around 20 dB) and hidden hearing loss at other tested frequencies. This slight/hidden hearing loss was associated with impaired object recognition but did not alter social behavior. Slight/hidden hearing loss was associated with reduced myelin basic protein expression in the corpus callosum but no other alterations in cortical thickness, hippocampal size, or other markers of maturation and neurogenesis were found. These findings show that even slight/hidden hearing loss can lead to subtle brain alterations tied to cognitive deficits. This study emphasizes the need for further research to fully understand the brain changes associated with slight/hidden hearing loss and to pinpoint the mechanisms connecting these changes to behavioral deficits. This information is crucial to develop interventions to prevent the cognitive and social consequences of hearing loss.

AB  - Background and purpose Temporal lobe epilepsy secondary to hippocampal sclerosis is related to epileptogenic networks rather than a focal epileptogenic source. Graph-theoretical gray and white matter networks may help to identify alterations within these epileptogenic networks.
   Methods Twenty-seven patients with hippocampal sclerosis and 14 controls underwent magnetic resonance imaging, including 3D-T1, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion tensor imaging. Subject-specific structural gray and white matter network properties (normalized path length, clustering, and small-worldness) were reconstructed. Group differences and differences between those with higher and lower seizure burden (<4 vs. >= 4 average monthly seizures in the last year) in network parameters were evaluated. Additionally, correlations between network properties and disease-related variables were calculated.
   Results All patients with hippocampal sclerosis as one group did not have altered gray or white matter network properties (all p > .05). Patients with lower seizure burden had significantly lower gray matter small-worldness and normalized clustering compared to controls and those with higher seizure burden (all p < .04). A higher number of monthly seizures was significantly associated with increased gray and white matter small-worldness, indicating a more rigid network.
   Conclusion Overall, there were no differences in network properties in this group of patients with hippocampal sclerosis. However, patients with lower seizure burden had significantly lower gray matter network indices, indicating a more random organization. The correlation between higher monthly seizures and a more rigid network is driven by those with higher seizure burden, who presented a more rigid network compared to those with a lower seizure burden.

AB  - Paracetamol (PAR) has been employed worldwide for pain and fever treatment during pregnancy and lactation. Epidemiologic studies have shown that exposure to PAR can increase the risk for developmental disorders, such as attention-deficit hyperactive disorder and autism spectrum disorder. This study aimed to investigate if gestational and lactational exposure to human-relevant doses of PAR could alter behavioural and brain oxidative stress parameters in the rat`s offspring. Wistar dams were gavaged daily with water or PAR (35 mg/kg/ or 350 mg/kg) during gestational day 6 to weaning (postnatal day 21). Behavioural assessments occurred at post-natal days 10 (nest seeking test), 27 (behavioural stereotypy) and 28 (three chamber sociability test and open field). Concentration of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid hydroperoxides (LOOH) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were estimate in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum of 22-day-old rats. Compared to CON animals, males exposed to PAR during pregnancy and lactation augmented apomorphine-induced stereotyped behaviour (350 mg/kg) and ambulation in open-field test (35 mg/kg). Reduced exploratory behaviour in three chamber sociability test was observed in pups exposed to PAR at 350 mg/kg in both sexes. PAR treatment decreased hippocampal GSH level and striatal SOD activity in males exposed to 35 mg/kg, suggesting the vulnerability of these areas in PAR-induced developmental neurotoxicity. Findings suggest PAR use during pregnancy and lactation as a potential risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders with males being more susceptible.

AB  - The ca. 300 ka Paleolithic sites of Schoeuroningen in northern Germany yielded a number of localities with archeological and paleontological remains representing a rich paleoenvironmental record of the late Middle Pleistocene in northern Europe. An important line of research focused on the ichnology of two localities: Schoeuroningen 13 I-Fs2 and Schoeuroningen 13 II-2 Untere Berme. Here we present the first detailed study of these fossil footprints, which provides insights on Schoeuroningen's paleoenvironment and a snapshot of the mammals once living in the area. Herds of elephants and other species of herbivores congregated along the muddy shores of a paleolake during birch, pine and grass-rich woodland phases. In addition, three potential hominin footprints, probably belonging to a late Homo heidelbergensis, are recorded at Schoeuroningen 13 II-2 Untere Berme. This confirms the complementary potential of ichnology in reconstructing a reliable picture of prehistoric sites.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nanoplastics, arising from the fragmentation of plastics into environmental pollutants and specialized commercial applications, such as cosmetics, have elicited concerns due to their potential toxicity. Evidence suggests that the oral ingestion of nanoplastics smaller than 100 nm may penetrate the brain and induce neurotoxicity. However, comprehensive research in this area has been hampered by technical challenges associated with the detection and synthesis of nanoplastics. This study aimed to bridge this research gap by successfully synthesizing fluorescent polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs, 30-50 nm) through the incorporation of IR-813 and validating them using various analytical techniques. We administered PSNPs orally (10 and 20 mg/kg/day) to mice and observed that they reached brain tissues and induced cognitive dysfunction, as measured by spatial and fear memory tests, while locomotor and social behaviors remained unaffected. In vitro studies (200 mu g/mL) demonstrated a predominant uptake of PSNPs by microglia over astrocytes or neurons, leading to microglial activation, as evidenced by immunostaining of cellular markers and morphological analysis. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that PSNPs altered gene expression in microglia, highlighting neuroinflammatory responses that may contribute to cognitive deficits. To further explore the neurotoxic effects of PSNPs mediated by microglial activation, we measured endogenous neuronal activity using a multi-electrode array in cultured hippocampal neurons. The application of conditioned media from microglia exposed to PSNPs suppressed neuronal activity, which was reversed by inhibitors of microglial activation. Our findings offer detailed insights into the mechanisms by which nanoplastics damage the brain, particularly emphasizing the potential environmental risk factors that contribute to cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Shank3 monogenic mutations lead to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Shank3 is part of the glutamate receptosome that physically links ionotropic NMDA receptors to metabotropic mGlu5 receptors through interactions with scaffolding proteins PSD95-GKAP-Shank3-Homer. A main physiological function of the glutamate receptosome is to control NMDA synaptic function that is required for plasticity induction. Intact glutamate receptosome supports glutamate receptors activation and plasticity induction, while glutamate receptosome disruption blocks receptors activity, preventing the induction of subsequent plasticity. Despite possible impact on metaplasticity and cognitive behaviors, scaffold interaction dynamics and their consequences are poorly defined. Here, we used mGlu5-Homer interaction as a biosensor of glutamate receptosome integrity to report changes in synapse availability for plasticity induction. Combining BRET imaging and electrophysiology, we show that a transient neuronal depolarization inducing NMDA-dependent plasticity disrupts glutamate receptosome in a long-lasting manner at synapses and activates signaling pathways required for the expression of the initiated neuronal plasticity, such as ERK and mTOR pathways. Glutamate receptosome disruption also decreases the NMDA/AMPA ratio, freezing the sensitivity of the synapse to subsequent changes of neuronal activity. These data show the importance of a fine-tuning of protein-protein interactions within glutamate receptosome, driven by changes of neuronal activity, to control plasticity. In a mouse model of ASD, a truncated mutant form of Shank3 prevents the integrity of the glutamate receptosome. These mice display altered plasticity, anxiety-like, and stereotyped behaviors. Interestingly, repairing the integrity of glutamate receptosome and its sensitivity to the neuronal activity rescued synaptic transmission, plasticity, and some behavioral traits of Shank3 increment C mice. Altogether, our findings characterize mechanisms by which Shank3 mutations cause ASD and highlight scaffold dynamics as new therapeutic target.

AB  - While the concurrent use of alcohol and cocaine is common in patterns of polysubstance use, little is known about the combined effects of these substances on the brain. Proteomics approaches enable the identification of potential biomarkers and new pharmacological targets for the diagnosis and treatment of addiction and related psychiatric disorders. The main goal of this study was to explore how the combination of cocaine and alcohol affects brain peptide/protein signatures in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway. To this end, we used a chronic and simultaneous intravenous administration of these substances in a Wistar rat animal model. Peptide/protein profiles in five brain regions (ventral hippocampus, dorsal hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex) from individual animals were characterised by means of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS). Our results showed that, compared to exposure to cocaine or alcohol separately, the combination of cocaine and alcohol has a synergistic effect on the number of differentially expressed peptides/proteins (DEPs) detected in all regions, particularly the amygdala. ANOVA reveals 13 DEPs, corresponding to 12 peptides/proteins, that vary significantly between all groups. Gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that most of the DEPs found for the combined treatment are enriched in neuropeptide receptor binding, neuropeptide signalling and regulation of circadian sleep/wake process pathways. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of cocaine and alcohol significantly exacerbates the effects of each substance separately on the expression of peptides and proteins with multiple physiological functions, including the opioid- and GABA-ergic neurotransmission systems. This study therefore provides the basis for future research on biomarkers and substance recovery therapies. These insights underscore the importance of examining the interactions between cocaine and alcohol in terms of their effects on neurotransmitter systems in the context of polysubstance use, particularly when addressing issues related to cocaine and alcohol co-use.

AB  - After acoustic trauma, there can be loss of synaptic connections between inner hair cells and auditory neurons in the cochlea, which may lead to hearing abnormalities including speech-in-noise difficulties, tinnitus, and hyperacusis. We have previously studied mice with blast-induced cochlear synaptopathy and found that they also developed a build-up of endolymph, termed endolymphatic hydrops. In this study, we used optical coherence tomography to measure endolymph volume in live CBA/CaJ mice exposed to various noise intensities. We quantified the number of synaptic ribbons and postsynaptic densities under the inner hair cells 1 week after noise exposure to determine if they correlated with acute changes in endolymph volume measured in the hours after the noise exposure. After 2 h of noise at an intensity of 95 dB SPL or below, both endolymph volume and synaptic counts remained normal. After exposure to 2 h of 100 dB SPL noise, mice developed endolymphatic hydrops and had reduced synaptic counts in the basal and middle regions of the cochlea. Furthermore, round-window application of hypertonic saline reduced the degree of endolymphatic hydrops that developed after 100 dB SPL noise exposure and partially prevented the reduction in synaptic counts in the cochlear base. Taken together, these results indicate that endolymphatic hydrops correlates with noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy, suggesting that these two pathologic findings have a common mechanistic basis.

AB  - BackgroundPrenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA) may enhance the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children. This study investigated the effect of Prangos ferulacea (L.) on behavioral alterations, hippocampal oxidative stress markers, and apoptotic deficits in a rat model of autism induced by valproic acid. MethodsPregnant rats received VPA (600 mg/kg, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) or saline on gestational day 12.5 (E 12.5). Starting from the 30th postnatal day (PND 30), the pups were i.p. administered Prangos ferulacea (PF, 100 and 200 mg/kg), or the vehicle, daily until PND 58. On PND 30 and 58, various behavioral tasks were used to evaluate pups, including the open field, elevated plus-maze, hot-plate, and rotarod test. On PND 65, the animals were euthanized, and their brains were removed for histopathological and biochemical assay. ResultsPrenatal exposure to VPA caused significant behavioral changes in the offspring, reversed by administering an extract of Prangos ferulacea (L.). Additionally, prenatal VPA administration resulted in increased levels of malondialdehyde and deficits in antioxidant enzyme activities in the hippocampus, including catalase and glutathione, ameliorated by PF. Likewise, postnatal treatment with PF improved VPA-induced dysregulation of Bax and Blc2 in the hippocampus and reduced neuronal death in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus. ConclusionThe findings of this study suggest that postnatal administration of PF can prevent VPA-induced ASD-like behaviors by exhibiting antiapoptotic and antioxidant properties. Therefore, PF may have the potential as an adjunct in the management of ASD.

AB  - Prolonged febrile seizures (FS) are a risk factor for the development of hippocampal-associated temporal lobe epilepsy. The dentate gyrus is the major gateway to the hippocampal network and one of the sites in the brain where neurogenesis continues postnatally. Previously, we found that experimental FS increase the survival rate and structural integration of newborn dentate granule cells (DGCs). In addition, mature post-FS born DGCs express an altered receptor panel. Here, we aimed to study if these molecular and structural changes are accompanied by an altered cellular functioning. Experimental FS were induced by hyperthermia in 10-days-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Proliferating progenitor cells were labeled the next day by injecting green fluorescent protein expressing retroviral particles bilaterally in the dentate gyri. Eight weeks later, spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic events (sEPSCs and sIPSCs, respectively) were recorded from labeled DGCs using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Experimental FS resulted in a robust decrease of the inter event interval (p < .0001) and a small decrease of the amplitude of sEPSCs (p < .001). Collectively the spontaneous excitatory charge transfer increased (p < .01). Experimental FS also slightly increased the frequency of sIPSCs (p < .05), while the amplitude of these events decreased strongly (p < .0001). The net inhibitory charge transfer remained unchanged. Experimental, early-life FS have a long-term effect on post-FS born DGCs, as they display an increased spontaneous excitatory input when matured. It remains to be established if this presents a mechanism for FS-induced epileptogenesis.

AB  - Although the dorsal hippocampus (DHip) has been clearly implicated in spatial learning and memory, there is currently debate as to whether the ventral hippocampus (VHip) is also necessary in allocentric-based navigation tasks. To differentiate between these two subregions of the hippocampal dorsoventral axis, we examined the effect of neurotoxic lesions to the DHip and VHip in different learning situations, using a four-arm plus-shaped maze. In experiment 1 a spatial reference memory task was used, with results showing an acquisition deficit in DHip-lesioned rats but perfect learning in VHip-lesioned rats. However, in experiment 2 an acquisition deficit was found in VHip-lesioned rats using a doubly marked training protocol. In this case the position of the goal arm during training was marked simultaneously by the extramaze constellation of stimuli around the maze and an intramaze cue. The main results indicated that DHip and VHip groups presented significantly more allocentric errors in the probe test than the control rats. In experiments 3 and 4, animals with their brains still intact learned, respectively, a spatial reference memory task or a purely cue-guided navigation task, and DHip and VHip lesions were made 2-3 days after reaching learning criterion. Results indicated a profound retrograde deficit in both lesioned groups but only with regard to allocentric information. So, depending on the training protocol used, our results point to increased integration and cooperation throughout the hippocampal dorsoventral axis when allocentric learning and memory is involved. These data support the existence of a functional continuum from the dorsal to the ventral hippocampus.

AB  - The nucleus reuniens (RE) of the ventral midline thalamus is a critical node in the communication between the orbitomedial prefrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus (HF). While RE has been shown to directly participate in memory -associated functions through its connections with the medial prefrontal cortex and HF, less is known regarding the role of RE in executive functioning. Here, we examined the involvement of RE and its projections to the orbital cortex (ORB) in attention and behavioral flexibility in male rats using the attentional set shifting task (AST). Rats expressing the hM4Di DREADD receptor in RE were implanted with indwelling cannulas in either RE or the ventromedial ORB to pharmacologically inhibit RE or its projections to the ORB with intracranial infusions of clozapine-N-oxide hydrochloride (CNO). Chemogenetic-induced suppression of RE resulted in impairments in reversal learning and set -shifting. This supports a vital role for RE in behavioral flexibility - or the ability to adapt behavior to changing reward or rule contingencies. Interestingly, CNO suppression of RE projections to the ventromedial ORB produced impairments in rule abstraction - or dissociable effects elicited with direct RE suppression. In summary, the present findings indicate that RE, mediated in part by actions on the ORB, serves a critical role in the flexible use of rules to drive goal directed behavior. The cognitive deficits of various neurological disorders with impaired communication between the HF and OFC, may be partly attributed to alterations of RE - as an established intermediary between these cortical structures.

AB  - Terrestrial animals not only need to walk and run but also lie prone to rest and then stand up. Sit-to-stand (STS) and sit-to-walk (STW) transitions are vital behaviours little studied in species other than humans so far, but likely impose biomechanical constraints on limb design because they involve near-maximal excursions of limb joints that should require large length changes and force production from muscles. By integrating data from experiments into musculoskeletal simulations, we analysed joint motions, ground reaction forces, and muscle dynamics during STS and STW in a large terrestrial, bipedal and cursorial bird: the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae; body mass similar to 30 kg). Simulation results suggest that in both STS and STW, emus operate near the functional limits (similar to 50% of shortening/lengthening) of some of their hindlimb muscles, particularly in distal muscles with limited capacity for length change and leverage. Both movements involved high muscle activations (>50%) and force generation of the major joint extensor muscles early in the transition. STW required larger net joint moments and non-sagittal motions than STS, entailing greater demands for muscle capacity. Whilst our study involves multiple assumptions, our findings lay the groundwork for future studies to understand, for example, how tendon contributions may reduce excessive muscle demands, especially in the distal hindlimb. As the first investigation into how an avian species stands up, this study provides a foundational framework for future comparative studies investigating organismal morphofunctional specialisations and evolution, offering potential robotics and animal welfare applications.

AB  - Simple Summary Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial disease where numerous components, such as environment, lifestyle, comorbidities, and genetic predisposition, contribute to triggering the onset of the disease. Several neurobiological brain alterations have been reported during AD pathologies, including the endocannabinoid system (ECS) and associated lipid transmitter-based signaling systems. In this study, we have evaluated the expression levels of the cannabinoid receptors type 2 (CB2) and the novel cannabinoid/lysophospholipid G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) at different stages of AD. We deeply investigated CB2 and GPR55's close proximity with A & beta;-plaque deposits, as well as neuronal and glial cells, in the AD App(NL-G-F) knock-in mouse model. Additionally, we analyzed whether A & beta;42 directly affects CB2 and GPR55 protein expression in neuronal and glial primary cell cultures. Our study shows that the ECS, specifically the CB2 and GPR55 receptors, are altered during AD pathology. Monitoring these receptors may provide new biomarkers for AD diagnosis. CB2 and GPR55 could be potential pharmacological targets for selective compounds to treat AD inflammation. Background: The endocannabinoid system (ECS) and associated lipid transmitter-based signaling systems play an important role in modulating brain neuroinflammation. ECS is affected in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we have evaluated the non-psychotropic endocannabinoid receptor type 2 (CB2) and lysophosphatidylinositol G-protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) localization and expression during A & beta;-pathology progression. Methods: Hippocampal gene expression of CB2 and GPR55 was explored by qPCR analysis, and brain distribution was evaluated by immunofluorescence in the wild type (WT) and APP knock-in App(NL-G-F) AD mouse model. Furthermore, the effects of A & beta;42 on CB2 and GPR55 expression were assessed in primary cell cultures. Results: CB2 and GPR55 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in App(NL-G-F) mice at 6 and 12 months of age, compared to WT. CB2 was highly expressed in the microglia and astrocytes surrounding the A & beta; plaques. Differently, GPR55 staining was mainly detected in neurons and microglia but not in astrocytes. In vitro, A & beta;42 treatment enhanced CB2 receptor expression mainly in astrocytes and microglia cells, whereas GPR55 expression was enhanced primarily in neurons. Conclusions: These data show that A & beta; pathology progression, particularly A & beta;42, plays a crucial role in increasing the expression of CB2 and GPR55 receptors, supporting CB2 and GPR55 implications in AD.

AB  - Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) is a severe neurological condition characterized by recurrent seizures that often do not respond well to available anti-seizure medications. TLE has been associated with epileptogenesis, a process that starts during the latent period following a neurologic insult and is followed by chronic phase. Recent research has linked canonical Wnt signaling to the pathophysiology of epileptogenesis and TLE. Our previous study demonstrated differential regulation of canonical Wnt signaling during early and late stage post status epilepticus (SE) induction. Building on these findings, our current study utilized Wnt modulators: GSK-3 beta inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (6-Bio) and disheveled inhibitor niclosamide and investigated their impact on canonical Wnt signaling during the early (30 days) and later stages (60 days) following SE induction. We assessed several parameters, including seizure frequency, astrogliosis, synaptic density, and neuronal counts in hippocampal tissue. We used immunohistochemistry and Nissl staining to evaluate gliosis, synaptic density, and neuronal counts in micro-dissected hippocampi. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of proteins involved in canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, and real-time PCR was conducted to analyze their relative mRNA expression. Wnt modulators, 6-Bio and Niclosamide were found to reduce seizure frequency and various other parameters including behavioral parameters, hippocampal morphology, astrogliosis and synaptic density at different stages of TLE.

AB  - Breath-holding foraging implies different adaptations to limit oxygen (O2) depletion and maximize foraging time. Physiological adjustments can be mediated through O2 consumption, driven by muscle mitochondria, which can also produce reactive oxygen species during reoxygenation. Southern elephant seals spend months foraging at sea, diving for up to 1 h. Pups transition abruptly to aquatic life after a post-weaning period, during which they fast and progressively increase their activity, making this period critical for the development of an adaptive response to oxygen restriction and oxidative stress. We compared the functional capacity of a swimming muscle in 5 recently weaned and 6 adult female southern elephant seals. High-resolution respirometry was employed to examine muscle mitochondrial respiratory capacity and differences in protein and gene expression of the main regulatory pathways were determined using LC-MS/MS and RT-qPCR, respectively. Oxidative damage was measured in the plasma. We found that juveniles have higher mitochondrial coupling efficiency compared with adults, probably as a response to growth and significant physical activity reported during the post-weaning period. There were no differences in oxidative damage, but adults had a higher level of antioxidant defenses. Both hypoxia and oxidative response pathways appeared less activated in juveniles. This study highlights the differences in muscle metabolism and the likely adaptive response to hypoxia and oxidative stress between juvenile and adult south elephant seals. It also suggests that early constraints such as fasting, physical activity and short-term low O2 partial pressure exposure could contribute to immediate and long-term responses and help to acclimatize juveniles to aquatic life.

AB  - The ability of predators to adopt hunting tactics that minimise escape reactions from prey is crucial for efficient foraging, and depends on detection capabilities and locomotor performance of both predators and prey. Here, we investigated the efficiency of a small pinniped, the Antarctic fur seal ( Arctocephalus gazella ) at exploiting their small prey by describing for the first time their fine-scale predator-prey interactions. We compared these with those from another diving predator, the southern elephant seal ( Mirounga leonina ) that forage on the same prey type. We used data recorded by a newly developed sonar tag that combines active acoustics with ultrahigh-resolution movement sensors to study simultaneously the fine-scale behaviour of both Antarctic fur seals and prey during predator-prey interactions in more than 1200 prey capture events for eight female Antarctic fur seals. Our results showed that Antarctic fur seals and their prey detect each other at the same time, i.e. 1-2 s before the strike, forcing Antarctic fur seals to display reactive fast-moving chases to capture their prey. In contrast, southern elephant seals detect their prey up to 10 s before the strike, allowing them to approach their prey stealthily without triggering an escape reaction. The active hunting tactics used by Antarctic fur seals is probably very energy consuming compared with the stalking tactics used by southern elephant seals but might be compensated for by the consumption of faster-moving larger prey. We suggest that differences in manoeuvrability, locomotor performance and detection capacities and in pace of life between Antarctic fur seals and southern elephant seals might explain these differences in hunting styles.

AB  - In the present research, the mechanical behavior of pure Ti was analyzed at room temperature under low strain rates (LSRs, 0.001 s-1, 0.01 s-1 and 0.1 s-1) and high strain rates (HSRs, 1160 s-1, 1670 s-1 and 2310 s-1). The results demonstrated that as the strain rate increased from 0.001 s-1 to 2310 s-1, the elongation increased significantly by 27 %. The underlying mechanisms governing the strain rate dependence of plasticity were elucidated through microstructural analysis. The frequency of deformation twinning increased notably with strain rate. This effect was especially obvious during the transition from LSR to HSR. Deformation twinning inhibited dislocation motion and enhanced the work hardening capacity. Simultaneously, hard oriented grains (HOG) were found to play a significant role in the plastic deformation under HSR loading, enhancing the deformation coordination between grains and improving material deformation uniformity. This improvement in deformation uniformity mitigated premature localized strain and necking. Further, based on the plasticity-strengthening mechanism induced by HSR loading, an electro-hydraulic forming (EHF) method for the fabrication of pure titanium bipolar plates (Ti-BPPs) at room temperature. In comparison to the conventional LSR loading rubber pad forming (RPF) method, the EHF process significantly improved formability and addressed manufacturing challenges associated with pure Ti-BPPs. The proposed method successfully achieved the formation of complete flow channels with dimensional accuracy within a f 10 mu m tolerance. Additionally, the average thickness reduction in corner regions decreased from 34.2 % to 15.7 %. These findings provide theoretical insights that could guide the manufacturing of pure Ti-BPPs with thin walls and small structural sizes in industrial application.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common psychiatric disorder with limited effective treatments. Research suggests that depression involves apoptosis mechanisms. Quercetin (QUE) has been reported to have anti-apoptotic activities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of QUE in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression. Methods: After establishing mouse models of CUMS-induced depression, the mice were randomly assigned into four groups: control, CUMS, CUMS+QUE, and CUMS+Fluoxetine (FLX). The body weight of the mice was measured during the study. Then, depression-associated behaviors were evaluated using the sucrose preference test (SPT), novelty suppressed feeding test (NSFT), forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). Apoptosis in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex was determined using flow cytometry. Bcl-2 and Nrf2 protein expressions in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were also detected. Furthermore, Western blot was used to measure the protein levels of p-ERK, ERK, p-CREB, CREB, and Nrf2 in brain tissues. Results: QUE or FLX administration increased the body weight of the CUMS mice. Behavioral tests indicated that CUMS mice developed a state of depression, but QUE or FLX treatment improved their depression-associated behaviors. Meanwhile, QUE or FLX treatment decreased apoptosis in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, the decreased Nrf2 protein expression, ERK and CREB phosphorylation in CUMS group were enhanced by QUE or FLX administration. Conclusion: QUE could attenuate brain apoptosis in mice with CUMS-induced depression, and the mechanism may be related to the ERK/Nrf2 pathway, indicating that QUE could be a potential treatment for depression.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is neurodegenerative disease common in the elderly, whose pathological mechanism is the deposition of amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Pyroptosis isa programmed cell death mediated by Gasdermin protein. After the activation of inflammasomes, the cleaved caspase- 1/4/5/11 activates GSDMD, which promotes the release of inflammatory substances and eventually causes cell swelling and death. Pyroptosis caused by inflammasomes plays a role in AD. However, the specific regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in AD still needs more experimental studies. To further study the effects of NLRP1-induced pyroptosis on AD, miR-181c-5p, which could targeted bind to NLRP1, was knocked down or overexpression in HT22 cells to detect cell apoptosis with Tunel assay, the expression of inflammasome-related proteins with Western blot and the content of inflammatory factors with ELISA. miR-181c-5p was overexpressed in AD model mice to detect the learning and cognitive ability with morris water maze testing and the expression of inflammasoma-related proteins with Western blot. The results showed that miR-181c-5p mimic attenuated A beta 1-42-induced neuronal pyroptosis in HT22 cells, while up-regulation of NLRP1 aggravated neuronal pyroptosis in HT22 cells. In mice, miR-181c-5p agomir attenuated neuronal pyroptosis in both hippocampal and cortical tissues, and miR-181c-5p antagomir improved neuronal pyroptosis and cognitive impairment through NLRP1. Therefore, the study suggests that miR-181c-5p can alleviated AD process by targeted downregulation of NLRP1, which is expected to be a target site for AD treatment.

AB  - Perinatal alcohol exposure can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), usually first diagnosed in childhood, that are characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity and learning and memory disability, among others. To test the hypothesis that dopamine signaling is one of the main factors underlying these impairments, a new atypical dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitor, CE-123 (1, 3 or 10 mg/kg) was assessed for its potential to overcome the ethanol-induced behavioral effects in a rat model of FASD. In the present study, neonatal rats were exposed to alcohol intubations across the neonatal period (postnatal day (PND)4-9, the third trimester equivalent of human gestation) and, after weaning, the animals (male rats) were assigned randomly to three groups. The first group was tested at PND21 (hyperactivity test). A second group was tested at PND45 (anxiety test), at PND47 (locomotor activity test), at PND49 (spatial cognitive test in the Barnes maze) and PND50 (reversal learning in the Barnes maze). The third group was tested at PND50 (dopamine receptor mRNA expression). Our results support the hypothesis that dopamine signaling is associated with FASD because the dopamine (D1, D2 and D5) receptor mRNA expression was altered in the striatum, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in adult rats exposed to ethanol during neonatal period. CE-123 (3 and 10 mg/kg) inhibited the hyperactivity and ameliorated (10 mg/kg) the impairment of reversal learning in alcohol-exposed rats. Thus, these findings provide support that CE-123 may be a useful intervention for same of the deficits associated with neonatal ethanol exposure.

AB  - Pain monitoring and diagnosis are crucial in seeking to improve animal welfare. This pilot study aimed to investigate the impact of long hours observation on pain assessment and the intra-observer reliability in piglets using video recording. A total of ten piglets, five from the control group (sham castration; pain-free) and five from the pain group (surgical castration; pain-state), were video-recorded immediately post-castration. The videos were randomised and assessed by an experienced observer using the Unesp-Botucatu Pig Composite Acute Pain Scale (UPAPS). The same ten videos were watched at three different times (trial initiation, half-way point, trial termination) with a four-week interval between them. During the four-week interval periods, the observer watched an additional 360 videos from another study to simulate long observation periods. For the pain group, no differences were found in the post hoc test for the UPAPS total score, and most of the UPAPS items. In contrast, for the control group, the UPAPS total score was higher at the half-way time-point, and no differences were found between UPAPS items. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) inferred 'very good' intra-observer reliability for UPAPS total score in all time-points of assessment for both groups. Video-recorded pain assessment is a reliable method to assess pain in piglets given that observation duration for pain assessment had only minimal impact on the UPAPS total score, and no differences were found among most of the items. From an animal welfare standpoint, video-recorded pain assessment is a non-invasive method, that can be an additional asset for pain research.

AB  - Swine is biologically one of the most relevant large animal models for biomedical research. With its use as food animal that can be exploited as a free cell and tissue source for research and its high susceptibility to human diseases, swine additionally represent an excellent option for both the 3R principle and One Health research. One of the previously most limiting factors of the pig model was its arguably limited immunological toolbox. Yet, in the last decade, this toolbox has vastly improved including the ability to study porcine T-cells. This review summarizes the swine model for biomedical research with focus on T cells. It first contrasts the swine model to the more commonly used mouse and non-human primate model before describing the current capabilities to characterize and extend our knowledge on porcine T cells. Thereafter, it not only reflects on previous biomedical T-cell research but also extends into areas in which more in-depth T-cell analyses could strongly benefit biomedical research. While the former should inform on the successes of biomedical T-cell research in swine, the latter shall inspire swine T-cell researchers to find collaborations with researchers working in other areas - such as nutrition, allergy, cancer, transplantation, infectious diseases, or vaccine development.

AB  - Maternal hyperhomocysteinemia is one of the common complications of pregnancy that causes offspring cognitive deficits during postnatal development. In this study, we investigated the effect of prenatal hyperhomocysteinemia (PHHC) on inflammatory, glial activation, and neuronal cell death markers in the hippocampus of infant rats. Female Wistar rats received L-methionine (0.6 g/kg b.w.) by oral administration during pregnancy. On postnatal days 5 and 20, the offspring's hippocampus was removed to perform histological and biochemical studies. After PHHC, the offspring exhibited increased brain interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-6 levels and glial activation, as well as reduced anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 level in the hippocampus. Additionally, the activity of acetylcholinesterase was increased in the hippocampus of the pups. Exposure to PHHC also resulted in the reduced number of neurons and disrupted neuronal ultrastructure. At the same time, no changes in the content and activity of caspase-3 were found in the hippocampus of the pups. In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and glial activation could be involved in altering the hippocampus cellular composition following PHHC, and these alterations could be associated with cognitive disorders later in life.

AB  - BackgroundThe Hippo signaling pathway involves a kinase cascade that controls phosphorylation of the effector proteins YAP and TAZ, leading to regulation of cell growth, tissue homeostasis, and apoptosis. Morusin, a compound extracted from Morus alba, has shown potential in cancer therapy by targeting multiple signaling pathways, including the PI3K/Akt/mTOR, JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and apoptosis pathways. This study explores the effects of morusin on YAP activation and its implications for apoptosis resistance.ResultsOur investigation revealed that morusin induces transient YAP activation, characterized by the dephosphorylation of YAP at S127 and nuclear localization, followed by gradual rephosphorylation in multiple cancer cells. Notably, this activation occurs independently of the canonical Hippo pathway and involves the LATS1/2, MINK1, and MAPK pathways during the YAP inactivation stage. Furthermore, morusin-induced stress granule formation was significantly impaired in YAP/TAZ-depleted cells, suggesting a role in apoptosis resistance. Additionally, the expression of constitutively active MINK1 maintained YAP activation and reduced apoptosis, indicating that prolonged YAP activation can enhance resistance to cell death.ConclusionsThese findings suggest that YAP/TAZ are crucial in resistance to morusin-induced apoptosis, and targeting YAP/TAZ could enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of morusin. Our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of morusin, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies against cancer by disrupting apoptosis resistance.

AB  - From birth to adulthood, the mammalian heart grows primarily through increasing cardiomyocyte (CM) size, which is known as maturational hypertrophic growth. The Hippo-YAP signaling pathway is well known for regulating heart development and regeneration, but its roles in CM maturational hypertrophy have not been clearly addressed. Vestigial-like 4 (VGLL4) is a crucial component of the Hippo-YAP pathway, and it functions as a suppressor of YAP/TAZ, the terminal transcriptional effectors of this signaling pathway. To develop an in vitro model for studying CM maturational hypertrophy, we compared the biological effects of T3 (triiodothyronine), Dex (dexamethasone), and T3/Dex in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs). The T3/Dex combination treatment stimulated greater maturational hypertrophy than either the T3 or Dex single treatment. Using T3/Dex treatment of NRVMs as an in vitro model, we found that activation of VGLL4 suppressed CM maturational hypertrophy. In the postnatal heart, activation of VGLL4 suppressed heart growth, impaired heart function, and decreased CM size. On the molecular level, activation of VGLL4 inhibited the PI3K-AKT pathway, and disrupting VGLL4 and TEAD interaction abolished this inhibition. In conclusion, our data suggest that VGLL4 suppresses CM maturational hypertrophy by inhibiting the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex and its downstream activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway.

AB  - Among the proposed mechanisms for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is immune dysregulation. The proinflammatory cytokine Interleukine-17A (IL-17A) was shown to play a key role in mediating immune-related neurodevelopmental impairment of social behavior. Nevertheless, post-developmental administration of IL-17A was found to increase social behavior. In the present study, we explored the effect of post-developmental administration of IL-17A on ASD-like behaviors induced by developmental exposure to valproic acid (VPA) at postnatal day 4. At the age of seven weeks, VPA-exposed mice were intravenously injected twice with recombinant murine IL-17A (8 mu g), and a week later, they were assessed for ASD-like behavior. IL-17A administration increased social behavior and alleviated the ASD-like phenotype. Behavioral changes were associated with increased serum levels of IL-17 and Th17-related cytokines. Exogenous IL-17A also increased neuritogenesis in the dendritic tree of doublecortin-expressing newly formed neurons in the dentate gyrus. Interestingly, the effect of IL-17A on neuritogenesis was more noticeable in females than in males, suggesting a sex-dependent effect of IL-17A. In conclusion, our study suggests a complex role for IL-17A in ASD. While contributing to its pathology at the developmental stage, IL-17 may also promote the alleviation of behavioral deficits post-developmentally by promoting neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis in the dentate gyrus.

AB  - Simple Summary The koala population is declining in northern Australia, and a major reason for this is the infection of the immunosuppressive koala retrovirus (KoRV), which is endogenous in many animals. This endogenous virus and its exogenous forms may induce lymphomas and immunodeficiency associated with opportunistic infections, including chlamydia infections. To generate a vaccine, we produced the recombinant surface and transmembrane envelope proteins of the KoRV and immunized goats, rats and mice. In all cases, we obtained antibodies which were able to neutralize the KoRV and recognize defined epitopes in the envelope proteins. However, we and others observed that koalas carrying the endogenous KoRV are tolerant, e.g., are unable to induce an immune response to the virus. Nevertheless, we propose that KoRV-negative animals will produce an antiviral immune response and will be protected when immunized with such a vaccine. This immunization will also reduce the number and severity of opportunistic infections because there is no KoRV-induced immunosuppression. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) is spreading in the koala population from the north to the south of Australia and is also in the process of endogenization into the koala genome. Virus infection is associated with tumorigenesis and immunodeficiency and is contributing to the decline of the animal population. Antibody production is an excellent marker of retrovirus infection; however, animals carrying endogenous KoRV are tolerant. Therefore, the therapeutic immunization of animals carrying endogenous KoRV seems to be ineffective. Using the recombinant transmembrane (TM) envelope protein of the KoRV, we immunized goats, rats and mice, obtaining in all cases neutralizing antibodies which recognize epitopes in the fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR), and in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER). Immunizing several animal species with the corresponding TM envelope protein of the closely related porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), as well as the feline leukemia virus (FeLV), we also induced neutralizing antibodies with similar epitopes. Immunizing with the TM envelope protein in addition to the surface envelope proteins of all three viruses resulted in higher titers of neutralizing antibodies. Immunizing KoRV-negative koalas with our vaccine (which is composed of both envelope proteins) may protect these animals from infection, and these may be the starting points of a virus-free population.

AB  - Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common autoimmune disease. Progressive depletion of the brain and spinal cord tissue appears at the onset of the disease. Several studies have shown the increased size of the ventricles of the brain and decreases in the area of the corpus callosum and the width of the brain. Other important symptoms of this disease are cognitive, learning, and memory disorders. Aim The aim of this study was to compare morphometric, histological, and functional changes in the demyelination model in both sexes. Materials and methods In this experimental study, male and female Wistar rats were studied in four experimental groups. Demyelination was induced by the injection of ethidium bromide in the ventricular region. The chronic effect of demyelination on spatial memory, movement, and coordination was investigated using the Morris Water Maze (MWM), and clinical and balance beam tests, respectively. Myelin degradation, cell death and neurogenesis were estimated using Luxol Fast Blue staining and immunohistochemistry (Caspase-3 and Nestin markers). In addition, morphometric findings were recorded for the brain and hippocampus (weight, volume, length, width). Result Demyelination increased the time and distance index and decreased the residence time in the target quarter in the water maze test (p < .001). It also increases the neuromuscular and modified neurological severity score (p < .01). Demyelination increases caspase-3 (p < .05) expression and decreases Nestin expression (p < .001), which are directly related to the extent of damage. Conclusion This study showed an interaction between hippocampal structural and functional networks in explaining spatial learning and memory in the early stages of MS.

AB  - Objective Sevoflurane is a common anesthetic and is widely used in pediatric clinical surgery to induce and maintain anesthesia through inhalation. Increasing studies have revealed that sevoflurane has neurotoxic effects on neurons, apoptosis, and memory impairment. miR-384 is involved in the process of neurological diseases. However, the role of miRNA-384-3p in sevoflurane-induced nerve injury is not clear. This study focused on exploring the roles and mechanisms of miRNA-384-3p in sevoflurane-induced nerve injury. Methods Seven-day-old rats were exposed to 2.3% sevoflurane to induce nerve injury. The morphological changes in neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were detected by HE staining and Nissl staining. Neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL and Western blot assays. Spatial memory and learning ability were detected by the Morris water maze assay. The target gene of miRNA-384-3p was verified through a luciferase reporter assay. A rescue experiment was used to confirm the miRNA-384-3p pathway in sevoflurane-induced nerve injury. Results Sevoflurane reduced miRNA-384-3p expression in the rat hippocampus. miRNA-384-3p alleviated sevoflurane-induced morphological changes in hippocampal neurons and apoptosis of neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. Meanwhile, miRNA-384-3p attenuated the decline in spatial memory and learning ability induced by sevoflurane. miRNA-384-3p alleviated sevoflurane-induced nerve injury by inhibiting the expression of adaptor-associated kinase 1 (Aak1). Conclusion Our findings revealed the role and mechanism of miRNA-384-3p in sevoflurane-induced nerve injury, suggesting that miRNA-384-3p could be a novel and promising strategy for reducing sevoflurane-induced neurotoxicity.

AB  - The poultry industry plays a vital role in providing food worldwide and contributes significantly to the economy. It is projected that poultry meat will be the most popular meat choice in the next 10 to 20 years. In the past few years, the implementation of genomic methods in chicken breeding programs has emerged as a successful strategy for driving progress in the poultry breeding sector. In recent decades, the use of animal breeding and selection methods has experienced a substantial increase. The examination and utilization of animal breeding and selection has considerably expanded, leading to a heightened comprehension of the economically valuable quantitative characteristics in chickens. Economic traits in chickens, such as growth rate and feed conversion, are not determined by a single gene but rather are influenced by multiple physiological factors. Thus, it presents a challenge to determine potential genes that are linked to particular characteristics. A variety of chicken phenotypic traits have been investigated through the analysis of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). To address this issue, a meta-analysis of QTL can be used to analyze a large number of independent experiments and identify the number and location of QTLs. The effectiveness of marker-assisted breeding efforts can be greatly improved by incorporating high-certainty candidate genes (CGs) and prioritizing markers as MQTLs. In this study, we will investigate the use of various molecular methods and QTL meta-analysis to study different traits in chicken.

AB  - Natural enemies such as parasitoids and parasites depend on sensitive olfactory to search for their specific hosts. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are vital components in providing host information for many natural enemies of herbivores. However, the olfactory-related proteins involved in the recognition of HIPVs are rarely reported. In this study, we established an exhaustive tissue and developmental expression profile of odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) from Dastarcus helophoroides, an essential natural enemy in the forestry ecosystem. Twenty DhelOBPs displayed various expression patterns in different organs and adult physiological states, suggesting a potential involvement in olfactory perception. In silico AlphaFold2-based modeling and molecular docking showed similar binding energies between six DhelOBPs (DhelOBP4, 5, 6, 14, 18, and 20) and HIPVs from Pinus massoniana. While in vitro fluorescence competitive binding assays showed only recombinant DhelOBP4, the most highly expressed in the antennae of emerging adults could bind to HIPVs with high binding affinities. RNAi-mediated behavioral assays indicated that DhelOBP4 was an essential functional protein for D. helophoroides adults recognizing two behaviorally attractive substances: p-cymene and gamma-terpinene. Further binding conformation analyses revealed that Phe 54, Val 56, and Phe 71 might be the key binding sites for DhelOBP4 interacting with HIPVs. In conclusion, our results provide an essential molecular basis for the olfactory perception of D. helophoroides and reliable evidence for recognizing the HIPVs of natural enemies from insect OBPs' perspective.

AB  - Understanding how large terrestrial animals manage the energetic demands of locomotion remains a major question in biomechanics. Although smaller animals have been well studied, data on species exceeding 1 ton are scarce, making it difficult to evaluate whether principles derived from small and medium-sized species hold at the upper limits of body size. In this study, we examined the mechanical work of locomotion in 27 Asian elephants (872-4000 kg) across a large range of speed of progression. We quantified the internal work required to move the limbs relative to the whole-body centre of mass (COM) and combined it with external work to estimate total mechanical cost. Our results show that elephants devote a surprisingly large proportion of total mechanical work-up to 75% at higher speeds-to move the limbs. This highlights the importance of internal limb dynamics in shaping the energetic profile of large quadrupeds. Using published metabolic cost values for elephants, we estimate that their muscular efficiency during locomotion ranges between 30% and 45%, values that fall within the range reported for other large mammals such as horses and humans. Together, these findings offer the first detailed breakdown of internal and external mechanical work in elephant locomotion and provide novel insights into how extreme body size influences the partitioning of mechanical work. This study contributes new data essential for understanding locomotor energetics at the upper limits of terrestrial animal mass.

AB  - Bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) typically feed on prey that are high in lipid and protein content and nearly devoid of carbohydrate, a dietary feature shared with other marine mammals. However, unlike fasted-adapted marine mammals that predictably incorporate fasting into their life history, dolphins feed intermittently throughout the day and are not believed to be fasting-adapted. To assess whether the physiological response to fasting in the dolphin shares features with or distinguishes them from those of fasting-adapted marine mammals, the plasma metabolomes of eight bottlenose dolphins were compared between post-absorptive and 24-h fasted states. Increases in most identified free fatty acids and lipid metabolites and reductions in most amino acids and their metabolites were consistent with the upregulation of lipolysis and lipid oxidation and the downregulation of protein catabolism and synthesis. Consistent with a previously hypothesized diabetic-like fasting state, fasting was associated with elevated glucose and patterns of certain metabolites (e.g. citrate, cis-aconitate, myristoleic acid) indicative of lipid synthesis and glucose cycling to protect endogenous glucose from oxidative disposal. Pathway analysis predicted an upregulation of cytokines, decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis including apoptosis of insulin-secreting beta-cells. Metabolomic conditional mutual information networks were estimated for the post-absorptive and fasted states and 'topological modules' were estimated for each using the eigenvector approach to modularity network division. A dynamic network marker indicative of a physiological shift toward a negative energy state was subsequently identified that has the potential conservation application of assessing energy state balance in at-risk wild dolphins.

AB  - Small bipedal hoppers, including kangaroo rats, are not thought to benefit from substantial elastic energy storage and return during hopping. However, recent species-specific material properties research suggests that, despite relative thickness, the ankle extensor tendons of these small hoppers are considerably more compliant than had been assumed. With faster locomotor speeds demanding higher forces, a lower tendon stiffness suggests greater tendon deformation and thus a greater potential for elastic energy storage and return with increasing speed. Using the elastic modulus values specific to kangaroo rat tendons, we sought to determine how much elastic energy is stored and returned during hopping across a range of speeds. In vivo techniques were used to record tendon force in the ankle extensors during steady-speed hopping. Our data support the hypothesis that the ankle extensor tendons of kangaroo rats store and return elastic energy in relation to hopping speed, storing more at faster speeds. Despite storing comparatively less elastic energy than larger hoppers, this relationship between speed and energy storage offers novel evidence of a functionally similar energy storage mechanism, operating irrespective of body size or tendon thickness, across the distal muscle-tendon units of both small and large bipedal hoppers.

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is a well-known environmental contaminant, particularly harmful to the developing brain. The main human dietary exposure to MeHg occurs through seafood consumption. However, seafood also contains several nutrients, including selenium, which has been shown to interact with MeHg and potentially ameliorate its toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the combined effects of selenium (as selenomethionine; SeMet) and MeHg on mercury accumulation in tissues and the effects concomitant dietary exposure of these compounds exert on the hippocampal proteome and transcriptome in mice. Adolescent male BALB/c mice were exposed to SeMet and two different doses of MeHg through their diet for 11 weeks. Organs, including the brain, were sampled for mercury analyses. Hippocampi were collected and analyzed using proteomics and transcriptomics followed by multi-omics bioinformatics data analysis. The dietary presence of SeMet reduced the amount of mercury in several organs, including the brain. Proteomic and RNA-seq analyses showed that both protein and RNA expression patterns were inversely regulated in mice receiving SeMet together with MeHg compared to MeHg alone. Several pathways, proteins and RNA transcripts involved in conditions such as immune responses and inflammation, oxidative stress, cell plasticity and Alzheimer's disease were affected inversely by SeMet and MeHg, indicating that SeMet can ameliorate several toxic effects of MeHg in mice.

AB  - This study evaluates the growth, proximate, and fatty acid composition of black mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis fed four marine microalgae (Pavlova lutheri, Nannochloropsis oculata, Diacronema vlkianum and Rhinomonas reticulata) diets for 21 days. Black mussel is a common bivalve species that has been recognized as important for marine aquaculture with increasing production in the last two decades. The mussel group fed N. oculata showed a significantly lower survival rate than the other groups (p < 0.05). Shell height, length, and width of mussels were measured. The height and length of the mussel group fed N. oculata were statistically higher than other experimental groups (p < 0.05). Shell width did not show any significant differences among groups (p > 0.05). The microalgae N. oculata showed the highest protein content whereas P. lutheri had the highest crude lipid content among dietary treatments. The group fed P. lutheri showed significantly higher protein, lipid, and ash contents among experimental groups (p < 0.05). The D. vlkianum diet enhanced the highest docosahexaenoic acid level in black mussels. Black mussel fed P. lutheri showed the highest eicosapentaenoic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid levels. Arachidonic acid was found to be similar among experimental groups. In our study, P. lutheri and D. vlkianum had outstanding results on survival, growth, and essential fatty acid accumulation in mussel culture.

AB  - Control of pod borer Helicoverpa armigera, a notorious polyphagous pest requires paramount attention with focus on environment-friendly management approaches. Overproduction of catechins (epigallocatechin-EGC and epicatechin-3-gallate-EC3G) in the pod borer-resistant pigeonpea wild relative, Cajanus platycarpus during continued herbivory prodded us to assess their underlying molecular effect on H. armigera. Significant reduction in larval and pupal growth parameters was observed when reared on artificial diet incorporated with 100 ppm EC3G vis a vis 100 ppm EGC and EGC + EC3G. Comparative RNAseq analyses of larvae that fed on normal and EC3G-incorporated diet revealed 62 differentially expressed genes dominated by detoxification and lipid metabolism. While lipase and fatty acid-binding protein 2-like were up-regulated, delta9-FADS-like involved in fatty acid synthesis was downregulated, indicating effect of EC3G on fat metabolism. Validation of RNAseq data by qPCR; midgut glutathione-S-transferase and esterase assays depicted increased lipolysis and reduced lipo-genesis in EC3G-fed larvae. Additionally, differential accumulation of stearic acid and oleic acid in EC3G-fed and control larvae/adults ascertained perturbation in lipogenesis. Supported by modelling, molecular docking and simulations, we demonstrate the possible involvement of the insect adipokinetic hormone receptor (AKHR) in the EC3G-mediated response. The study demonstrates plant specialized metabolite EC3G as a potential candidate for H. armigera control.

AB  - The insufficiency of current Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea (PED) vaccines against highly pathogenic strains highlights the critical importance of enhancing mucosal immunity in the prevention and control of porcine enteric viral diseases. Due to limited research platforms, the understanding of the porcine mucosal immune system and its response mechanisms remains incomplete. This study employed prokaryotic expression and purification methods to obtain eight essential cytokines involved in mucosal immune responses (CD40L, IL-2, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL13, IL-17 alpha, TGF-beta, APRIL). By utilizing various cell models including porcine intestinal organoids, IPEC-J2, VeroE6, porcine peripheral blood lymphocytes, and porcine Peyer's patch lymphocytes, the functions of these eight cytokines were identified through flow cytometry, immunoblotting, relative quantitative PCR, and CFSE proliferation assays. The results demonstrate that all eight purified proteins exhibit both protein activity and function. The purification of these molecules lays the groundwork for further exploration of the mucosal barrier of pigs and mucosal immune-related studies, as well as providing research tools for the prevention and control of enteric viral diseases in pigs.

AB  - Perimenopause is a critical period, with severe cycle irregularity and lower estrogen secretion altering redox state biomarkers, leading to behavioral changes. The estrogen hormonal therapy (EHT) being commonly used to alleviate climacteric effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze anxiolytic profile, recognition memory (short and long term), ambulation, redox status, cell synaptic activity in locus coeruleus and hippocampus of Wistar rats in the periestropause after EHT. Forty rats participated in the study; 20 were treated with corn oil (group 21Mo/Veh; corn oil/0.2 mL/sc; 2x/week) and 20 were submitted to EHT (group 21Mo/E2; 178estradiol/15 mu g/Kg/sc; 2x/week) for 120 days. Open field, elevated plus maze, object recognition (RO), and footprint tests were performed immediately before and at the end of the treatment period. From the decapitated brains, isolated hippocampus were destined for biochemical analysis, in turn, perfused brains were destined for histological analysis. The 21Mo/E2 group had a significantly greater total time in the central region and a significantly greater number of entries into the open arms compared to the 21Mo/Veh group, as in crossing, rearing and grooming behaviors, evidencing an anxiolytic profile. In the RO test, the 21Mo/Veh group decreased long-term memory, and the 21Mo/E2 group maintained the same index as at 17 months of age, in addition to a better balance of the hippocampal redox state, prevention of neuronal cell loss and better gait. Based on the results, it appears that exogenous E2 supplementation during periestropause may help preserve neurological functions and potentially prevent neuropsychological and neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Wear mechanism severity analysis constitutes one of the principal strategies for selecting more wear-resistant materials. A machine learning model was developed to characterize and recognize wear mechanisms and severity in worn surfaces of industrial equipment. Particularly, deep features were computed from a convolutional net (VGG16 and Resnet50), while wear mechanisms and severity classification were computed from a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The histogram of oriented gradient (HoG) was also implemented to compute an image descriptor and thereafter a classification was carried out with Random Forest classifier. From a set of images of worn surfaces of transfer chute linings, two different datasets were employed to search independently among five wear mechanisms and four levels of wear severity. The proposed approach was successful in recognizing and mapping wear mechanisms and determining their severity levels, as confirmed by the high values of metrics obtained using the deep features. A comparison was carried out between the mass loss performance of the materials tested in the field and their wear severity levels recognized by the machine learning model. A satisfactory correlation was identified between the materials with the lowest and highest wear, as determined by their measured mass losses from a field test, and the corresponding levels of wear severity on their worn surfaces obtained by the machine learning model. This result demonstrates the potential of using machine learning for the worn surface analysis to support industrial equipment wear analysis.

AB  - Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (DM) is linked to attentional deficits and cognition deterioration. The neurohormone melatonin is an endogenous synchronizer of circadian rhythms with multiple protective properties. This research was designed to assess its effect against learning and memory decline in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. Rats were assigned to control, melatonin-treated control, diabetic, and melatonin-treated diabetic groups. Melatonin was administered i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day for 47 days. Treatment of diabetic rats with melatonin reversed decline of spatial recognition memory in Y maze, performance of rats in novel object discrimination, and retention and recall in passive avoidance tasks. Furthermore, melatonin appropriately attenuated hippocampal malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and improved superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and improved mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and nuclear factor (erythroidderived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) with no significant effect on nitrite, glutathione (GSH) and catalase activity. Besides, hippocampal level of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) decreased following melatonin treatment. There was also a reduction of dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA1 area in diabetic group that was significantly alleviated upon melatonin treatment. Melatonin could ameliorate learning and memory disturbances in diabetic rats through mitigation of cholinesterase activity, astrocytes, oxidative stress and inflammation and also via upregulation of some antioxidants in addition to its prevention of dendritic spine loss.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by immune system dysregulation, impacting both central and peripheral immune responses. The study aimed to investigate the mechanism behind the neurotoxic effects of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide in the rat brain including the study of neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and alterations in peripheral immune responses (PIR). The neuroinflammation brought on by A beta(1-42) and is unknown to influence PIR. Animal models were prepared, after 28 days, control, sham, and treated rats were anaesthetized and inflammatory markers of hippocampus and serum levels (reactive oxygen species, nitrite, tumor necrosis factor-a, and interleukin-1 beta), and some markers of PIR (splenic mononuclear cells or MNC, cytotoxicity and phagocytic index of the white blood cells leukocyte adhesion inhibition index or LAI), as well as polymorphonuclear cells of the spleen, were assessed. In addition to changes in peripheral immune responses, the present study found that AD rats had higher blood levels of inflammatory markers. Based on the study, the immune system irregularities observed in AD rats in the peripheral regions might be connected to neuroinflammation, which is facilitated by a compromised blood-brain barrier. Hence, it is viable to propose that the neuroinflammatory condition in rats with A beta-induced AD could modify immune responses in the peripheral areas with significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines markers in the hippocampal tissue in A beta-injected AD rats.

AB  - Depression and related mood disorders constitute an enormous burden on health, quality of life, and the global economy, and women have roughly twice the lifetime risk of men for experiencing depression. Here, we review sex differences in human brain physiology that may be connected to the increased susceptibility of women to major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, we summarize decades of preclinical research using animal models for the study of mood dysfunction that uncover some of the potential molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms that may underlie sex differences and disease etiology. We place particular emphasis on a series of recent studies demonstrating the central contribution of the circuit projecting from ventral hippocampus to nucleus accumbens and how inherent sex differences in the excitability of this circuit may predict and drive depression-related behaviors. The findings covered in this review underscore the continued need for studies using preclinical models and circuit-specific strategies for uncovering molecular and physiological mechanisms that could lead to potential sex-specific diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and/or treatments for MDD and other mood disorders.

AB  - Excessive physical exercise (overtraining, OT) charactered by long-term and excessive training results in the damage of multiple vital tissues including hippocampus which plays a critical role in learning and memory. A combination of dasatinib (D) plus quercetin (Q) (D+Q) belongs to senolytic drugs which selectively kill senescent cells in vitro and vivo. In this study, the rats that suffered a five-week excessive swimming training were subjected to the oral administration of D+Q. D+Q alleviated the decline in exercise performance of OT rats during the swimming training, and prevented learning and memory deficits in Morris water maze, Y-maze and novel object recognition tests after excessive swimming training. Analytical results by SA-beta-gal staining and western blotting showed that D+Q significantly reduced senescent cells with repressed expression of senescence-related proteins, p53 and p21, in hippocampus. Nissl and immunohistochemical staining showed that D+Q significantly attenuated neuronal loss caused by apoptosis. Interestingly, we observed elevated level of cleaved caspase 3, an apoptosis executor protein, in p21 positive hippocampus cells by D+Q treatment in immunofluorescent staining, suggesting that senescent cells were induced to apoptosis in D+Q-treated rats. The positive control drug, silibinin, showed similar protective effect against OT, but did not induce the apoptosis of senescent cells, suggesting a difference in the protective mechanisms. These results indicated that D+Q alleviates overtraining-induced deficits in learning and memory through elimination of senescent cells and reduction of apoptotic cell number.

AB  - Nowadays, the interest in studying the impact of feed additives on the organism of piglets during critical periods of weaning remains increasingly relevant. Feed additives containing blends of essential oils with plant extracts, preparations containing dry yeast, organic acids, pro- and prebiotics are suggested to replace growth promoters and antibiotics. This contributes to the increased productivity, survivability, immune response formation, and ensuring normal intestine morphology in piglets. Proper concentrations and timing of feed additive application aimed at maintaining a healthy intestine in piglets after weaning and improving their productivity remain equally important. This study presents the results of an experiment on the use of various feed additives for piglets before weaning and their effect on the morphology of the immune system organs.The research was conducted on piglets of the Large White breed, divided into four groups of ten individuals each. From days 7 to 28 of life, various feed additives were introduced into the main diet for each group: piglets of the control group (I) received a standard nutritionally balanced diet; piglets of group II had a supplement added to the standard diet containing a combination of live yeast of the Saccharomyces genus and a complex of 6 enzymes (proteases, cellulases, xylanases, alpha-amylases, beta-glucanases, and phytases) at a rate of 0.5 kg per ton of feed; piglets of group III received a feed additive containing a blend of essential oils with plant extracts (Thymus vulgaris, Rosmarinus officinalis, Origanum vulgaris, Capsium extract) at a rate of 0.2 kg per ton of feed; piglets of group IV had a feed additive added to the main diet containing dry yeast and egg powder enriched with immunoglobulins at a rate of 2 kg per ton of feed. The main feed used in the experiment was provided in the form of fine granules. Histological examination of the thymus, mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen, and duodenum lymphoid formations revealed that the morphological structure of the organs was preserved in piglets of all experimental groups. The partial structure of the thymus was well defined, with a clear differentiation into cortical and medullary substances. Piglets receiving the feed additive "Activo" with a blend of essential oils from plant extracts and the feed additive "Globigen Jump Start," which includes dry yeast and egg powder enriched with immunoglobulins, demonstrated a slight increase in the thymic cortex relative area, both on days 14 and 28 of the study, and an increase in the number of plasma cells. In the spleen and lymph nodes of piglets in all experimental groups, the lymphoid tissue was predominantly represented by small and medium lymphocytes; lymphoid nodules of large size with reactive centers were observed too. Brachet staining in the lymph nodes of piglets in all experimental groups revealed plasma cells with bright eosinophilia, and large nuclei predominantly with a single nucleus. However, their quantity varied, with the highest number of plasma cells observed in piglets of group IV, which received the feed additive "Globigen Jump Start" with dry yeast and egg powder enriched with immunoglobulins. Histologically, in the piglets' duodenum, the villi were closely packed, a small number of goblet cells were located between enterocytes, plasma cells with distinct eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentrically placed nuclei were localized in the lymphoid nodules of the mucous membrane and in the crypt areas. Their quantity was higher in piglets of groups III and IV.

AB  - Treating drug-resistant cancer cells is a clinical challenge and it is also vital to screen for new cancer drugs. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell clonal cancer that, despite many experimental therapeutics, remains incurable. In this study, two MM cell line lines U266 and RPMI 8226 were used to determine the impact of camel whey protein (CWP). The CWP IC50 was calculated by MTT examination, while the flow cytometry analysis was used to investigate the chemotaxis responses of MM cells in relation to CXCL12 and the pro-apoptotic effect of CHP. MM cells were treated with CWP and Western blot analysis was used to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms. Dose and time based on the impact of CWP on the cell viability of MM cells with IC50 of 50 mu g/ml, without affecting the viability of normal healthy PBMCs. CWP reduced chemotaxis of MM cells significantly from the CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12). Using Western blot analysis, we found that CWP decreased the activation of AKT, mTOR, PLC beta 3, NF alpha B and ERK, which was mechanistically mediated by CXCL12/CXCR4. In both U266 and RPMI 8226, CWP induced apoptosis by upregulating cytochrome C expression. In addition, CWP mediated the growth arrest of MM cells by robustly decreasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1. Conversely, the expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bak, Bax and Bim was increased after treatment with CWP. Our data indicates CWP's therapeutic potential for MM cells.

AB  - Firefighters face significant risks of exposure to toxic chemicals, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), during fire suppression activities. PAHs have been found in the air, on the gear and equipment, and in biological samples such as the skin, breath, urine, and blood of firefighters after fire response. However, the extent to which exposure occurs via inhalation, dermal absorption, or ingestion is unclear. In this study, three PAHs, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and benzo[a]pyrene, were applied to porcine skin in vitro in an artificial sweat solution to better gauge firefighters' dermal exposures while mimicking their sweaty skin conditions using an artificial sweat dosing vehicle. Multiple absorption characteristics were calculated, including cumulative absorption, percent dose absorbed, diffusivity, flux, lag time, and permeability. The absorption of the PAHs was greatly influenced by their molecular weight and solubility in the artificial sweat solution. Naphthalene had the greatest dose absorption efficiency (35.0 +/- 4.6% dose), followed by phenanthrene (6.8 +/- 3.2% dose), and lastly, benzo[a]pyrene, which had the lowest absorption (0.03 +/- 0.04% dose). The lag times followed a similar trend. All chemicals had a lag time of approximately 60 min or longer, suggesting that chemical concentrations on the skin may be reduced by immediate skin cleansing practices after fire exposure.

AB  - The present brief review for this Special Issue summarizes some of the original research on the emotional modulation of memory. The review begins by highlighting the pioneering research from James L. McGaugh and colleagues demonstrating modulatory effects of post-training drug administration on memory consolidation, in particular the stress hormone epinephrine. The subsequent discovery of a critical role for the basolateral amygdala in emotional modulation of memory is described. Within the context of a multiple systems approach to memory focusing on selective roles for the hippocampus and dorsolateral striatum in cognitive and habit memory, the original studies indicating that robust emotional arousal can bias animals and humans toward the predominant use of habit memory are reviewed. This effect of emotional arousal on the relative use of multiple memory systems depends on a modulatory role of the basolateral amygdala. Finally, we briefly consider how an emotion-induced enhancement of dorsolateral striatal-dependent memory may be relevant to understanding maladaptive habitual behaviors in certain human psychopathologies.

AB  - Social isolation and loneliness inducing cognitive decline are serious health problems in the elderly. Although the hydrophilic glycoproteins of Capsosiphon fulvescens (Cf-hGP) prevent aging-induced cognitive impairment, its effects on social isolation-induced cognitive dysfunction are unclear. This study investigated the efficacy of Cf-hGP against cognitive dysfunction in aged rats and delineated its underlying mechanisms. The oral administration of Cf-hGP (15 mg/kg/d, 4 weeks) reversed the social isolation-induced decreases in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), postsynaptic density protein 95, and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor subunit 1 and increased expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in the synaptosome of the dorsal hippocampus. Furthermore, Cf-hGP prevented social isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, and its effects were attenuated by inhibition of ERK1/2 or deglycosylation of Cf-hGP. Cf-hGP-induced clustering of ERK1/2-mediated postsynaptic density protein 95 in the dorsal hippocampus improves memory formation in socially isolated aged rats, and protein glycosylation contributes to enhancing the Cf-hGP effect.

AB  - Simple Summary Elephants are known for their complex vocalization system and for being able to imitate sounds. Here, we show that African elephants apply unusual and individualistic sound production mechanisms to generate idiosyncratic sounds. These sounds are produced by manipulating non-phonatory structures, e.g., applying an ingressive airflow at the trunk tip to emit extraordinarily high-frequency sounds or repeatedly contract superficial muscles at the trunk base to generate lower-frequency pulsated sounds. Intriguingly, each individual establishes its own distinctive sound-producing strategy (e.g., contracting different muscle bundles). The production of these sounds on cue is encouraged via positive reinforcement training. This suggests that social feedback and reinforcement can facilitate vocal creativity and learning behavior in elephants. Social interactions and positive feedback are also crucial for early speech learning in human infants. Increasing knowledge on sound production plasticity in elephants-long-living, highly social mammals-is crucial in the effort to better understand their communicative and vocal learning ability and its function in wild elephant populations. How do elephants achieve their enormous vocal flexibility when communicating, imitating or creating idiosyncratic sounds? The mechanisms that underpin this trait combine motoric abilities with vocal learning processes. We demonstrate the unusual production techniques used by five African savanna elephants to create idiosyncratic sounds, which they learn to produce on cue by positive reinforcement training. The elephants generate these sounds by applying nasal tissue vibration via an ingressive airflow at the trunk tip, or by contracting defined superficial muscles at the trunk base. While the production mechanisms of the individuals performing the same sound categories are similar, they do vary in fine-tuning, revealing that each individual has its own specific sound-producing strategy. This plasticity reflects the creative and cognitive abilities associated with 'vocal' learning processes. The fact that these sounds were reinforced and cue-stimulated suggests that social feedback and positive reinforcement can facilitate vocal creativity and vocal learning behavior in elephants. Revealing the mechanism and the capacity for vocal learning and sound creativity is fundamental to understanding the eloquence within the elephants' communication system. This also helps to understand the evolution of human language and of open-ended vocal systems, which build upon similar cognitive processes.

AB  - Ammonia excretion in fish excretory epithelia is a complex interplay of multiple membrane transport proteins and mechanisms. Using the model system of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae, here we identified three paralogues of a novel ammonia transporter, hippocampusabundant transcript 1 (DrHiat1), also found in most vertebrates. When functionally expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, DrHiat1a and DrHiat1b promoted methylamine uptake in a competitive manner with ammonia. In situ hybridization experiments showed that both transporters were expressed as early as the 4-cell stage in zebrafish embryos and could be identified in most tissues 4 days postfertilization. Larvae experiencing morpholino-mediated knockdown of DrHiat1b exhibited significantly lower whole-body ammonia excretion rates compared with control larvae. Markedly decreased site-specific total ammonia excretion of up to 85% was observed in both the pharyngeal region (site of developing gills) and the yolk sac (region shown to have the highest NH4+ flux). This study is the first to identify DrHiat1b/DrHIAT1 in particular as an important contributor to ammonia excretion in larval zebrafish. Being evolutionarily conserved, these proteins are likely involved in multiple other general ammonia-handling mechanisms, making them worthy candidates for future studies on nitrogen regulation in fishes and across the animal kingdom.

AB  - Sugarcane bagasse (SCB) is an abundant by-product from sugar production and promising biomass for cellulose extraction. Simulated elephant colon pretreatment (SEP) to reduce chemical use in cellulose extraction from SCB was investigated using elephant dung as fermentation inoculum. The 16S rRNA gene sequences showed microorganisms in elephant dung that corresponded to metabolites during pretreatment. Organic acid accumulation in the fermentation broth was confirmed by the presence of lactic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids. Lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase and xylanase detected during the pretreatment enhanced lignin removal. The SEP fiber showed increased cellulose content, while lignin content decreased with reduced bleaching time from 7 to 5 h and high whiteness and crystallinity indices. lignin removal was also confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed increasing internal surface area through opening up the fiber structure. SEP offered an efficient and promising approach for cellulose fiber extraction with reduced use of chemicals for the bleaching process.

AB  - Rodent cages equipped with access to a voluntary running wheel are commonly used to study the effects of aerobic physical activity on physiology and behavior. Notable discoveries in exercise neurobiology, including the key role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in neural plasticity and cognition, have been made using rodents housed with voluntary running wheels. A major advantage of using home-cage running wheels over treadmills is the elimination of stress potentially associated with forced running. In addition, voluntary wheel running may simulate a more natural running pattern in laboratory mice. Singly housing mice with voluntary running wheels is traditionally employed to obtain exact quantitation of the distance ran; however, social isolation stress is often ignored to obtain precise running distances. Moreover, voluntary exercise studies in adolescent mice must consider the neurodevelopmental implications of isolation stress. In this protocol, we wean 21-day-old mouse pups directly into running wheel-equipped cages and pair-house them to reduce the impact of social isolation and other developmentally specific factors that could adversely affect their behavior or development. Individual running distances are obtained from each mouse in the cage using a radio-frequency identification (RFID) ear tag and a hidden antenna placed directly under the running wheel. We have demonstrated that voluntary running during a specific juvenile-adolescent developmental period can improve hippocampal memory when tested during adolescence (Ivy et al., 2020). Individual exercise tracking of group-housed mice can enable future studies to precisely correlate the amount of exercise with readouts such as cell-specific gene expression, epigenetic mechanisms, serum biomarkers, and behavior, in an intra-individual manner.

AB  - beta-defensin family plays a critical role in host defense against infections. In this study, we found that pBD129 are widely expressed in porcine tissues such as the intestine, liver, and spleen. Interestingly, the expression level of pBD129 in most tissues was higher in Tibetan pigs than in DLY (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) pigs (P < 0.05), and was significantly upregulated upon E. coli K88 infection (P < 0.05). The pBD129 protein was successfully expressed in E. coli and the molecule weight was estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 37.2 kDa. Mass spectrometry verified the protein as a pBD129. The protein showed antibacterial activities against Streptococcus and E. coli DH5 alpha with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 32 mu g/mL. Hemolytic and cytotoxicity assays indicated that pBD129 had no detrimental effect on cell viability. Importantly, pBD129 significantly reduced the apoptosis of porcine intestinal epithelial cells exposure to bacterial endotoxins, which was associated with down-regulation of inflammatory cytokines such as the IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha (P < 0.05), and down-regulation of apoptosis-related genes such as the caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 (P < 0.05). These results suggested that pBD129 is a novel modulator of innate immunity involved in mammalian inflammatory responses.

AB  - Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne pathogen for which humans are an incidental host. POWV infection can be fatal or result in long-term neurological sequelae; however, there are no approved vaccinations for POWV. Integral to efficacious vaccine development is the identification of correlates of protection, which we accomplished in this study by utilizing a murine model of POWV infection. Using POWV lethal and sublethal challenge models, we show that (1) robust B and T cell responses are necessary for immune protection, (2) POWV lethality can be attributed to both viral-and host-mediated drivers of disease, and (3) knowledge of the immune correlates of protection against POWV can be applied in a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccination approach that provides protection from lethal POWV challenge. Identification of these immune protection factors is significant as it will aid in the rational design of POWV vaccines.

AB  - Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe congenital heart disease (CHD) with underdevelopment of left-sided heart structures. While previously uniformly fatal, surgical advances now provide highly effective palliation that allows most HLHS patients to survive their critical CHD. Nevertheless, there remains high morbidity and mortality with high risk of heart failure. As hemodynamic compromise from restricted aortic blood flow has been suggested to underlie the poor LV growth, this suggests the possibility of prenatal fetal intervention to recover LV growth. As such interventions have yielded ambiguous results, the optimization of therapy will require more mechanistic insights into the developmental etiology for HLHS. Clinical studies have shown high heritability for HLHS, with an oligogenic etiology indicated in conjunction with genetic heterogeneity. This is corroborated with the recent recovery of mutant mice with HLHS. With availability-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes from HLHS mice and patients, new insights have emerged into the cellular and molecular etiology for the LV hypoplasia in HLHS. Cell proliferation defects were observed in conjunction with metaphase arrest and the disturbance of Hippo-YAP signaling. The left-sided restriction of the ventricular hypoplasia may result from epigenetic perturbation of pathways regulating leftright patterning. These findings suggest new avenues for fetal interventions with therapies using existing drugs that target the Hippo-YAP pathway and/or modulate epigenetic regulation.

AB  - The miR-302s/367 family has the ability to induce mouse and human somatic cell reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), inhibit the proliferation of several types of cancer cells, and even cause cancer cell apoptosis. However, the functions of the miR-302s/367 family in other mammals have not been explored. In the present study, the effects of miR-302s/367 on reprogramming, proliferation, and apoptosis in sheep fetal fibroblasts (SFFs) were evaluated by the delivery of a plasmid vector containing synthetic precursor miRNAs into cells, followed by the induction of mature miR-302s/367 expression. The results showed that miR-302s/367 could not reprogram SFFs into iPSCs; however, they could inhibit both the proliferation and apoptosis of SFFs by targeting CDK2, E2F1, E2F2, and PTEN in the cell cycle and PI3K-Akt pathways. Based on our findings, a novel mechanism was proposed in which the miR-302s/367 family functions in both the proliferation and apoptosis of somatic cells in mammals, suggesting that caution is needed when using miR-302s/367 as therapeutic agent.

AB  - The populations of cave-dwelling bat species are encountering a remarkable decline all over the world. To plan effective conservation projects for bats and their cave roosts, collecting data on their distribution in a particular region is essential. Furthermore, developing an applicable index that incorporates both biotic and abiotic parameters relevant to caves is useful to prioritize caves for conservation management. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying bat fauna of Iran. The Kurdistan province in west of the country is entirely mountainous, having a suitable geological substratum for formation of caves. Previously, five bat species were reported from Kurdistan. The current study has improved the data by doubling the number of cave-dwelling bat species of the province. A total number of 61 records of 10 species were documented. Overall, of 28 caves studied, 26 caves were used by bats. Each cave hosted one to six bat species. To prioritize Kurdistan caves for conservation programs, the Bat Cave Vulnerability Index (BCVI) was employed for 26 caves explored in this study. Four caves, including Karaftu, Kamtaran, Darvish Ouliya, and Kouna Sham-Sham, were highlighted due to their highest BCVI value. The other 22 caves received medium or low priority values. In the current study, we provided data on the bat fauna of Kurdistan caves, in addition to evaluate their conservation priorities by applying an assessing index for the first time in the country.

AB  - Viral infections activate pattern recognition receptors in the host, triggering an innate immune response that involves the production of interferons, which, in turn, stimulates the expression of antiviral effector genes. Viperin is one of the most highly induced interferon-stimulated genes and displays broad antiviral activity, especially against tick-borne viruses. Of late, camelid-borne zoonotic viruses have been on the rise in the Arabian Peninsula, but research into camelid antiviral effector genes has been limited. This is the first report of an interferon-responsive gene from the mammalian suborder Tylopoda to which modern camels belong. From camel kidney cells treated with dsRNA mimetic, we cloned viperin cDNA encoding 361 amino acid protein. Sequence analysis of camel viperin reveals high levels of amino acid conservation, particularly within the RSAD domain. Compared to kidney, the relative mRNA expression of viperin was higher in blood, lung, spleen, lymph nodes, and intestines. The in-vitro expression of viperin was induced by poly(I:C) and interferon treatment in camel kidney cell lines. Viperin expression was subdued in camel kidney cells infected with the camelpox virus during the early stages of infection, suggesting possible suppression by the virus. Overexpression of camel viperin through transient transfection significantly enhanced the resistance of cultured camel kidney cell lines to infection with camelpox virus. Research into the role of viperin in host immunity against emerging viral pathogens of camels will provide insight into novel mechanisms of antiviral activity of the protein, viral immune evasion strategies, and enable the development of better antivirals.

AB  - Parasitic gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) cause diseases that are a major challenge to livestock production. Chemical control is the most widely used method, but it has many economic and environmental problems. This study was to evaluate in vitro the nematicidal and enzymatic activity of Pleurotus djamor against Trichostrongylus spp., and Strongyloides papillosus. The fungus was cultivated in a solid medium composed of wheat seeds for 25 days. The enzyme extraction was then performed using distilled water in the ratio of 1:5. Subsequently, by means of filtration and then centrifugation, the cell-free crude extract (CFCE) was obtained. Proteolytic activity was measured at pH 5 using the caseinolytic assay. The nematophagous assay of the P. djamor on the infective larvae (L-3) was performed for 6 h. The nematicidal effect of the CFCE (active and denatured) was analysed over a period of 48 h. The CFCE showed proteolytic activity of 8.9 +/- 0,5 U mL(-1). P. djamor reduced the number of L-3 by 75% (p < 0.01). The active CFCE showed a statistical difference compared to the control and the denatured (p < 0.01). On the other hand, there was no significant difference between the denatured group and the control group (without enzymes). The percentage reduction of L3 was 57%. This result suggests that the nematicidal action occurred mainly due to the activity of the proteases present in the CFCE. This study reports for the first time the applicability of proteases produced by P. djamor in the biochemical control of GINs, which could become an alternative biopesticide in the future.

AB  - DNA damage in early-stage embryos impacts development and is a risk factor for segregation of altered genomes. DNA damage response (DDR) encompasses a sophisticated network of proteins involved in sensing, signaling, and repairing damage. DDR is regulated by reversible post-translational modifications including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and SUMOylation. While important regulators of these processes have been characterized in somatic cells, their roles in early-stage embryos remain broadly unknown. The objective of this study was to explore how ubiquitylation and SUMOylation are involved in the regulation of early development in porcine embryos by assessing the mRNA profile of genes encoding ubiquitination (UBs), deubiquitination (DUBs), SUMOylation (SUMOs) or deSUMOylation (deSUMOs) enzymes in oocyte and embryos at different stages of development, and to evaluate if the induction of DNA damage at different stages of embryo development would alter the mRNA abundance of these genes. Pig embryos were produced by in vitro fertilization and DNA damage was induced by ultraviolet (UV) light exposure for 10 s on days 2, 4 or 7 of development. The relative mRNA abundance of most UBs, DUBs, SUMOs, and deSUMOs was higher in oocytes and early-stage embryos than in blastocysts. Transcript levels for UBs (RNF20, RNF40, RNF114, RNF169, CUL5, DCAF2, DECAF13, and DDB1), DUBs (USP16), and SUMOs (CBX4, UBA2 and UBC9), were upregulated in early-stage embryos (D2 and/or D4) compared to oocytes and blastocysts. In response to UV-induced DNA damage, transcript levels of several UBs, DUBs, SUMOs, and deSUMOs decreased in D2 and D4 embryos, but increased in blastocysts. These findings revealed that transcript levels of genes encoding for important UBs, DUBs, SUMOs, and deSUMOs are regulated during early embryo development and are modulated in response to induced DNA damage. This study has also identified candidate genes controlling post-translational modifications that may have relevant roles in the regulation of normal embryo development, repair of damaged DNA, and preservation of genome stability in the pig embryo.

AB  - Repeated sevoflurane exposure in neonatal mice triggers neuroinflammation with detrimental effects on cognitive function. Yet, the mechanism of the sevoflurane-induced cytokine response is largely unknown. In this study, we reveal that 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, attenuated the sevoflurane-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction, including the decreased freezing time and fewer platform crossings, in the neonate mice. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) suppressed sevoflurane-induced expression of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factoralpha in vitro. Moreover, sevoflurane activates IRF3, facilitating cytokine transcription in an AKT3-dependent manner. Mechanistically, sevoflurane-induced autophagic degradation of dehydrocholesterol-reductase-7 (DHCR7) resulted in accumulations of its substrate 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), mimicking the effect of sevoflurane on AKT3 activation and IRF3-driven cytokine expression. 3-MA significantly reversed sevofluraneinduced DHCR7 degradation, AKT phosphorylation, IRF3 activation, and the accumulation of 7-DHC in the hippocampal CA1 region. These findings pave the way for additional investigations aimed at developing novel strategies to mitigate postoperative cognitive impairment in pediatric patients.

AB  - Sperm cells require time to adjust to lower temperatures. While some studies have established stabilization periods ranging from two to four hours for ovine semen, the exploration of longer periods of stabilization remains limited. The objective of the study is to evaluate the 12-hour refrigeration curve during ovine semen cryopreservation and the impact of a diluent medium containing egg yolk and liposomes. Eight mixed-breed rams (Y2 Dorper and Y2 Santa In & ecirc;s) provided two ejaculates each, divided into two groups. Group A used a commercial egg yolk-based diluent (Botu-Bov (R)- Botupharma Ltda, Brazil), while Group B used a commercial liposome-based diluent (OptiXcell (R), IMV Technologies, France). Semen was packaged in French straws, cooled, cryopreserved, and thawed for analysis. Group A exhibited superior values (P < 0.05) in progressive motility (MP), progressive linear velocity (VSL), straightness (STR), and linearity (LIN) post-thawing and after 3 hours at 37 degrees C (TTR). Conversely, Group B showed higher (P < 0.05) values for path velocity (VAP), curvilinear velocity (VCL), lateral head displacement amplitude (ALH) post-thawing, and VAP, VSL, VCL, and ALH after TTR. Flow cytometry revealed Group A's higher (P > 0.05) plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity and membrane stability. However, Group B exhibited greater (P > 0.05) superoxide anion generation and lipid peroxidation, indicative of higher oxidative stress. In conclusion, the egg yolk-based diluent outperformed the diluent containing liposomes in sperm kinetic parameters evaluated by CASA, although liposomes showed increased oxidative stress, 12 hours of refrigeration at 5.0 degrees C is an alternative viable for semen cryopreservation in sheep.

AB  - Eisosomes are large hemitubular structures that underlie the invaginated microdomains in the plasma membrane of various ascomycetous fungi, lichens and unicellular algae. In fungi, they are organized by BAR-domain containing proteins of the Pil1 family. Two such proteins, Pil1 and Lsp1, participate in eisosome formation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Under normal laboratory conditions, deletion of the PIL1 gene results in the inability of cells to assemble wild-type-like eisosomes. We found that under certain stress conditions, Lsp1 partially substitutes for the Pil1 function and mediates assembly of eisosomes, specifically following a decrease in the activity of serine palmitoyltransferase, for example, in response to hyperosmotic stress. Besides Lsp1, the assembly of eisosomes lacking Pil1 also requires Seg1 and Nce102 proteins. Using next -generation sequencing, we found that the seg1Ance102Apil1A strain, which is unable to form eisosomes, overexpresses genes coding for proteins of oxidative phosphorylation and tricarboxylic acid cycle. By contrast, genes involved in DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis and cell cycle are downregulated. Our results identify Lsp1 as a stress -responsive eisosome organizer and indicate several novel functional connections between the eisosome and essential cellular processes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the most prevalent form of neuropsychiatric disorder among the elderly population, impacting a minimum of 50 million individuals worldwide. Current pharmacological treatments rely on the prescribing cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. However,recently anecdotal findings based on low-quality real-world data had prompted physicians, patients, and their relatives to consider the use of cannabinoids, especially Cannabidiol (CBD), for alleviating of AD symptoms. CBD the primary non-psychotomimetic compound found in the Cannabis sp. plant, exhibits promising therapeutic potential across various clinical contexts. Pre-clinical and in vitro studies indicate that CBD could mitigate cognitive decline and amyloidbeta-induced neurodegeneration by modulating oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. In addition, CBD demonstrates significant effects in promoting neuroplasticity, particularly in brain regions such as the hippocampus. However, the available clinical evidence presents conflicting results, and no randomized placebo-controlled trials have been published to date. In conclusion, although pre-clinical and in vitro studies offer encouraging insights into the potential benefits of CBD in AD models, new and well-designed clinical trials are imperative to ascertain the clinical relevance of CBD use in the management of AD symptoms, especially in comparison to conventional treatments.

AB  - A new bear specimen was recovered from the Ghurban site near the Sakhi Sarwar area in Koh-Sulaiman, Pakistan. The fossil site belongs to the Litra Formation dated as Late Miocene (11-6 Ma). The Koh Sulaiman range comprises Permo-Triassic to Quaternary deposits with a rich fossil record. Fossils of mammalian families, including Elephantidae, Suidae, Equidae, Cervidae, Bovidae, and Tragulidae, are reported from the Sulaiman range. Here, we describe a fossil specimen of the family Ursidae belonging to the genus Indarctos based on a comparative analysis of dental morphological and metric dimensions with other taxa and assigned to species I. cf. atticus. This research aims to report the first document of Indarctos from there and update its stratigraphic distribution from the Koh-Sulaiman Range, South Punjab, Pakistan. The paleoenvironment during the Late Miocene of the Litra Formation in the Ghurban site suggests an open habitat, with a cooler climate than before, prominence of the monsoon system, and expansion of C4 grasslands.

AB  - Extracts from Drosera rotundifolia are traditionally used to treat cough symptoms during a common cold. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of extracts from D. rotundifolia and active compounds on the respiratory tract. Tracheal slices of C57BL/6N mice were used ex vivo to examine effects on airway smooth muscle (ASM) and ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition assays were carried out to test whether PDE1 or PDE4 are targeted by the active compounds. An ethanol-water extract, as well as an aqueous fraction of this extract, exerted antispasmodic properties against acetylcholine-induced contractions. In addition, contractions induced by 60 mM K+ were abrogated by the aqueous fraction. Effects on ASM could be attributed to the flavonoids quercetin, 2 ''-O-galloylhyperoside and hyperoside. Moreover, the Drosera extract and the aqueous fraction increased the CBF of murine tracheal slices. Quercetin and 2 ''-O-galloylhyperoside were identified as active compounds involved in the elevation of CBF. Both compounds inhibited PDE1A and PDE4D. The elevation of CBF was mimicked by the subtype-selective PDE inhibitor rolipram (PDE4) and by 8-methoxymethyl-IBMX. In summary, our study shows, for the first time, that a Drosera extract and its flavonoid compounds increase the CBF of murine airways while antispasmodic effects were transferred to ASM.

AB  - Depressive state adversely affects the memory functions, especially in the geriatric population. The initial stage of memory deficits associated with depression is particularly called as pseudodementia. It is the starting point of memory disturbance before dementia. The purpose of this research was to study depression and its consequent pseudodementia. For this purpose 24 male albino Wistar rats were divided into four groups. Depression was induced by 14 days of chronic restraint stress (CRS) daily for 4 h. After developing a depression model, pattern separation test was conducted to monitor pseudodementia in rats. Morris water maze test (MWM) was also performed to observe spatial memory. It was observed that model animals displayed impaired pattern separation and spatial memory. Treatment was started after the development of pseudodementia in rats. Curcumin at a dose of 200 mg/kg was given to model rats for one week along with the stress procedure. Following the treatment with curcumin, rats were again subjected to the aforementioned behavioral tests before decapitation. Corticosterone levels, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurochemical analysis were conducted. Model rats showed depressogenic behavior and impaired memory performance. In addition to this, high corticosterone levels and decreased hippocampal BDNF, 5-HT, dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine (ACh) levels were also observed in depressed animals. These behavioral biochemical and neurochemical changes were effectively restored following treatment with curcumin. Hence, it is suggested from this study that pseudodementia can be reversed unlike true dementia by controlling the factors such as depression which induce memory impairment.

AB  - Intramuscular fat (IMF) contributed positively to pork quality, whereas subcutaneous fat (SCF) was often considered to be a detrimental factor impacting growth and carcass traits. Reducing SCF while maintaining optimal IMF levels requires a thorough understanding of the adipogenic differences between these two adipose depots. Our study explored the differences in adipogenesis between porcine IMF and SCF, and the results showed that subcutaneous adipocytes (SCAs) demonstrate a greater potential for adipogenic differentiation, both in vivo and in vitro. Lipidomic and transcriptomic analyses suggested that intramuscular adipocytes (IMAs) are more inclined to biosynthesize unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was employed to dissect the intrinsic and microenvironmental discrepancies in adipogenesis between porcine IMF and SCF. Comparative analysis indicated that SCF was enriched with preadipocytes, exhibiting an enhanced adipogenic potential, while IMF was characterized by a higher abundance of stem cells. Furthermore, coculture analyses of porcine intramuscular adipogenic cells and myogenetic cells indicated that the niche of IMAs inhibited its adipogenic differentiation. Cell communication analysis identified 160 ligand-receptor pairs and channels between adipogenic and myogenetic cells in IMF. Collectively, our study elucidated two intrinsic and microenvironmental novel mechanisms underpinning the divergence in adipogenesis between porcine SCF and IMF.

AB  - Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), often referred to as a plasticizer, is commonly used in the production of plastic products, food packaging, children's toys. However, it has been identified as an endocrine disruptor that is difficult to degrade in the environment, resulting in the accumulation of pollutants. The long term consumption of food containing excessive levels of DBP can lead to health problems, such as infertility or cancer. To solve the problem of DBP pollution from CM milk sources in dairy enterprises, eliminate the pollution and waste of CM raw materials, and reduce the cost of producing functional CM products based on milk in dairy enterprises, three cleaner processing methods, ultrasonic (US), ozone (O-3), and ultrasonic-catalyzed ozone (US/O-3), were used in this study. The results showed that the DBP degradation was 84.93 % when the O-3 concentration was 2333 mg/kg. The removal rate of DBP was 71.96 %, when the US power was 550 W, and the action time was 70 min. After treatment with US/O-3 for 60 min, the highest degradation rate was 90.82 %, which was consistent with the first-order reaction kinetics model. DBP residues in milk were lower than the regulatory limits in the European Union and China. This treatment method had no significant effect on the protein, lactose, and water contents (P > 0.05), but it reduced the fat content and displayed varying differences in ash content. The total milk particle size also decreased, with no significant change in soluble nitrogen content, and fatty acids generally showed a tendency to be oxidized.

AB  - The population in Indonesia is currently around 270.2 million people and is expected to increase to 318.9 million people by 2045. This led to a significant increase in the demand for food, especially protein. Approximately 53.4% of the Indonesian population consumes protein below recommendation. This is caused by the gap in demand and availability of animal-based protein, which only enables it to meet 60% of needs. However, Indonesia actually has great potential to utilize edible insects as a sustainable- and halal-protein alternative, such as Javanese Grasshopper (Valanga nigricornis). This research aimed to develop an insect-based meat-analog product using Javanese Grasshopper, kidney beans (complete the amino acid score), and elephant foot yam (build the texture) as ingredients to create a high-protein, low-cholesterol alternative product. This research involved product development, followed by physical-, chemical-, sensory-, and microbiological-testing. The optimal formulation, integrating a 30% replacement of grasshopper and 5% kidney beans, yielded a meat analog patty with a high protein content (27.86 g/100 g, >30% of Daily value), and a low cholesterol content (0.018 g/ 100 g, <0.02 g/100 g). The development is expected to be a part of alternative disturbed strategy in covering the protein gap in Indonesia.

AB  - A variety of active factors in milk and foods have been proven to serve as microbial nutrients that regulate the formation of early gut microbiota (GM), thereby ensuring the healthy development of infants. This study demonstrated that dietary nucleotides (NTs), one of the main nitrogen-containing substances in human milk, promoted the neurodevelopment of neonatal rats and the expression of Sox2, Dcx, Tuj1, and NeuN in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, but had no significant regulatory effects in the striatum. 16s rRNA sequencing and metabolomics of the colon contents of neonatal rats at different developmental stages showed that the early intake of NTs promoted an increase in the abundance of beneficial microorganisms related to neurodevelopment, digestion, and gut absorption, such as g_Romboutsia and g_Akkermansia. Changes in the ability of the GM to regulate folate synthesis, riboflavin metabolism, and other processes were also observed. Further analysis revealed significant correlations between the level of characteristic metabolites, namely, trans-3-indoleacrylic acid, urocanic acid, inosine, and adenosine, in the gut with neurodevelopment and characteristic GM components. These findings suggest that NTs in milk may affect neurodevelopment and maturation in early life by regulating the GM composition-gut-brain axis.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough the Notch signaling pathway is known to play an important role in ovarian follicle development in mammals, whether it is involved in oocyte maturation remains unclear. Therefore, this study was performed to elucidate the existence and role of the Notch signaling pathway during oocyte maturation in a porcine model.MethodsReverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunocytochemical assays were used to determine the existence of Notch signaling pathway-related transcripts and proteins in porcine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). In vitro maturation (IVM) and parthenogenetic activation of oocytes were employed to examine the effects of Notch signaling inhibition on meiotic progression and embryogenesis of COCs using RO4929097 (RO), an inhibitor of gamma secretase. Various staining methods (TUNEL, Phalloidin-TRITC, MitoTracker, JC-1, BODIPY FL ATP, ER-Tracker, Fluo-3, and Rhod-2) and immunocytochemical and quantitative PCR assays were used to identify the effects of Notch signaling inhibition on meiotic progression, embryogenesis, cell cycle progression, spindle assembly, chromosome alignment, mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum distribution, and downstream pathway targets in COCs.ResultsThe RT-PCR and immunocytochemical analyses revealed the presence of Notch signaling-related receptors (NOTCH1-4) and ligands (JAG1 and 2 and DLL1, 3, and 4) at 0, 22, 28, and 44 h of IVM in the COCs. RO treatment during oocyte maturation markedly reduced meiotic maturation and embryogenesis, inhibiting the cell cycle progression, spindle assembly, and chromosome alignment processes that are important for meiotic maturation. Furthermore, RO significantly impaired the cellular distribution and functions of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticula, which are important organelles for the cytoplasmic maturation of oocytes. Finally, the involvement of canonical Notch signaling in oocyte maturation was confirmed by the decreased expression of HES and HEY family transcripts and proteins in the RO-treated COCs.ConclusionsIt was first demonstrated that Notch signaling pathway-related transcripts and proteins were expressed during the meiotic maturation of porcine COCs. Furthermore, the inhibition of Notch signaling during IVM revealed the essential role of this signaling pathway during oocyte maturation in pigs.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) causes multiple cerebrovascular disruptions and oxidative stress. These pathological mechanisms are often accompanied by serious impairment of cerebral blood flow autoregulation and neuronal and glial degeneration. Background/Objectives: Multiple biochemical cascades are triggered by brain damage, resulting in reactive oxygen species production alongside blood loss and hypoxia. However, most currently available early antioxidant therapies lack capacity and hence sufficient efficacy against TBI. The aim of this study was to test a novel catalytic antioxidant nanoparticle to alleviate the damage occurring in blast TBI. Methods: TBI was elicited in an open blast rat model, in which the rats were exposed to the effects of an explosive blast. Key events of the post-traumatic chain in the brain parenchyma were studied using immunohistochemistry. The application of a newly developed biologically compatible catalytic superoxide dismutase mimetic carbon-based nanocluster, a poly-ethylene-glycol-functionalized hydrophilic carbon cluster (PEG-HCC), was tested post-blast to modulate the components of the TBI process. Results: The PEG-HCC was shown to significantly ameliorate neuronal loss in the brain cortex, the dentate gyrus, and hippocampus when administered shortly after the blast. There was also a significant increase in endothelial activity to repair blood-brain barrier damage as well as the modulation of microglial and astrocyte activity and an increase in inducible NO synthase in the cortex. Conclusions: We have demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively that the previously demonstrated antioxidant properties of PEG-HCCs have a neuroprotective effect after traumatic brain injury following an explosive blast, acting at multiple levels of the pathological chain of events elicited by TBI.

AB  - This study investigated the protective effect of dulcitol on LPS-induced intestinal injury in piglets and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. A total of 108 piglets were divided into three groups: CON, LPS, and DUL. The CON and LPS groups were fed a basal diet, the DUL group was fed a diet supplementation with 500 mg/kg dulcitol. On day 29, 6 piglets in the LPS and DUL groups were injected with 100 mu g/kg BW of LPS. At 4 h postchallenge, all pigs were slaughtered, and colonic samples were collected. Results showed that dulcitol supplementation boosted intestinal barrier function in LPSchallenged piglets by enhancing intestinal morphology and integrity, and increasing the gene expression of zonula occludens-1, claudin-1, , and occludin in the colonic mucosa ( P < 0.05). Metabolomics showed DUL supplementation mainly increased ( P < 0.05) the metabolites related to steroid and vitamin metabolism (Cholesterol and Vitamin C). Proteomics showed that dulcitol supplementation altered the protein expression involved in maintaining barrier integrity (FN1, CADM1, and PARD3), inhibiting inflammatory response (SLP1, SFN, and IRF3), and apoptosis (including FAS, ING1, BTK, MTHFR, NOX, and P53BP2) in LPS-challenged piglets ( P < 0.05). Additionally, dulcitol addition also suppressed the TLR4/NF-kappa B kappa B signaling pathway and apoptosis in mRNA and protein levels. Dulcitol increased the abundance of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria ( Lactobacillus, Blautia, , and Faecalibacterium) at the genus level, but decreased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria at the phylum level and Pseudomonas and Delftia at the genus level in piglets ( P < .05). In conclusion, these results suggested that the addition of dulcitol alleviated LPS-induced intestinal barrier injury in piglets, probably by maintaining its integrity, inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kappa B kappa B signaling pathways and apoptosis, and modulating the gut microbiota. Therefore, dulcitol can be considered a potential dietary additive for improving intestinal health in pig models.

AB  - Background: The herbivores Danaus plexippus (Lepidoptera), Oncopeltus fasciatus, and Aphis nerii (Hemiptera) are special insects that feed on Calotropis procera (Apocynaceae) (Sodom Apple). At least 35 chemically distinct cardenolides have been reported in C. procera.
   Objective: We aimed to evaluate the interaction between cardenolides and Na+/K+ ATPases from herbivores.
   Methods: The Na+/K+ ATPases from these insects were modeled, and docking studies were performed involving cardenolides from C. procera.
   Results: The replacement of serine in sensitive Na+/K+ ATPase by histidine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine in the structures examined suggested spatial impairment caused by interaction, probably making the herbivorous insects resistant against the cardenolides of C. procera. In addition, the ability of the insects to avoid cardenolide toxicity was not correlated with cardenolide polarity. Therefore, the plant fights predation through molecular diversity, and the insects, regardless of their taxonomy, face this molecular diversity through amino acid replacements at key positions of the enzyme targeted by the cardenolides.
   Conclusion: The results show the arsenal of chemically distinct cardenolides synthesized by the C. procera.

AB  - UV-B radiation regulates numerous morphogenic, biochemical and physiological responses in plants, and can stimulate some responses typically associated with other abiotic and biotic stimuli, including invertebrate herbivory. Removal of UV-B from the growing environment of various plant species has been found to increase their susceptibility to consumption by invertebrate pests, however, to date, little research has been conducted to investigate the effects of UV-B on crop susceptibility to field pests. Here, we report findings from a multi-omic and genetic-based study investigating the mechanisms of UV-B-stimulated resistance of the crop, Brassica napus (oilseed rape), to herbivory from an economically important lepidopteran specialist of the Brassicaceae, Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth). The UV-B photoreceptor, UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8), was not found to mediate resistance to this pest. RNA-Seq and untargeted metabolomics identified components of the sinapate/lignin biosynthetic pathway that were similarly regulated by UV-B and herbivory. Arabidopsis mutants in genes encoding two enzymes in the sinapate/lignin biosynthetic pathway, CAFFEATE O-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (COMT1) and ELICITOR-ACTIVATED GENE 3-2 (ELI3-2), retained UV-B-mediated resistance to P. xylostella herbivory. However, the overexpression of B. napus COMT1 in Arabidopsis further reduced plant susceptibility to P. xylostella herbivory in a UV-B-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of a component of the sinapate/lignin biosynthetic pathway in a member of the Brassicaceae can enhance UV-B-stimulated resistance to herbivory from P. xylostella.

AB  - The overheating of buildings and their need for mechanical cooling is a growing issue as a result of climate change. The main aim of this paper is to examine the impact of surface texture on heat loss capabilities of concrete panels through evaporative cooling. Organisms maintain their body temperature in very narrow ranges in order to survive, where they employ morphological and behavioral means to complement physiological strategies for adaptation. This research follows a biomimetic approach to develop a design solution. The skin morphology of elephants was identified as a successful example that utilizes evaporative cooling and has, therefore, informed the realization of a textured facade panel. A systematic process has been undertaken to examine the impact of different variables on the cooling ability of the panels, bringing in new morphological considerations for surface texture. The results showed that the morphological variables of assembly and depth of texture have impact on heat loss, and the impact of surface area to volume (SA:V) ratios on heat loss capabilities varies for different surface roughness. This study demonstrates the potential exploitation of morphological adaptation to buildings, that could contribute to them cooling passively and reduce the need for expensive and energy consuming mechanical systems. Furthermore, it suggests areas for further investigation and opens new avenues for novel thermal solutions inspired by nature for the built environment.

AB  - Objective: To explore the changes in the cerebral microstructure of patients with noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Method: Overall, 122 patients with NIHL (mild [MP, n = 79], relatively severe patients [including moderate and severe; RSP, n = 32], and undetermined [lost to follow-up, n = 11]) and 84 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. All clinical data, including age, education level, hearing threshold, occupation type, noise exposure time, and some scale scores (including the Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE], tinnitus handicap inventory [THI], and Hamilton Anxiety Scale [HAMA]), were collected and analyzed. All participants underwent T1WI3DFSPGR and DTI, and tract-based spatial statistics and region of interest (ROI) analysis were used for assessment. Results: The final sample included 71 MP, 28 RSP, and 75 HCs. The HAMA scores of the three groups were significantly different (p < .05). The noise exposure times, hearing thresholds, and HAMA scores of the MP and RSP were significantly different (p < .05). The noise exposure time was positively correlated with the hearing threshold and negatively correlated with the HAMA scores (p < .05), whereas the THI scores were positively correlated with the hearing threshold (p < .05). DTI analysis showed that all DTI parameters (fractional anisotropy [FA], axial diffusivity [AD], mean diffusivity [MD], and radial diffusivity [RD]) were significantly different in the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) for the three groups (p < .05). In addition, the FA values were significantly lower in the bilateral corticospinal tract (CST), right fronto-pontine tract (FPT), right forceps major, left superior longitudinal fasciculus (temporal part) (SLF), and left cingulum (hippocampus) (C-H) of the MP and RSP than in those of the HCs (p < .05); the AD values showed diverse changes in the bilateral CST, left IFOF, right anterior thalamic radiation, right external capsule (EC), right SLF, and right superior cerebellar peduncle (SCP) of the MP and RSP relative to those of the HC (p < .05). However, there were no significant differences among the bilateral auditory cortex ROIs of the three groups (p > .05). There was a significant negative correlation between the FA and HAMA scores for the left IFOF/ILF, right FPT, left SLF, and left C-H for the three groups (p < .05). There was a significant positive correlation between the AD and HAMA scores for the left IFOF/ILF and right EC of the three groups (p < .05). There were significantly positive correlations between the RD/MD and HAMA scores in the left IFOF/ILF of the three groups (p < .05). There was a significant negative correlation between the AD in the right SCP and noise exposure time of the MP and RSP groups (p < .05). The AD, MD, and RD in the left ROI were significantly positively correlated with hearing threshold in the MP and RSP groups (p < .05), whereas FA in the right ROI was significantly positively correlated with the HAMA scores for the three groups (p < .05). Conclusion: The changes in the white matter (WM) microstructure may be related to hearing loss caused by noise exposure, and the WM structural abnormalities in patients with NIHL were mainly located in the syndesmotic fibers of the temporooccipital region, which affected the auditory and language pathways. This confirmed that the auditory pathways have abnormal structural connectivity in patients with NIHL.

AB  - Plant-made oral vaccines can be a cost-effective method to control infectious diseases of humans and farm animals. Pig edema is a bacterial disease caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli producing the toxin Shiga toxin 2e (Stx2e). In our previous report, we chose the non-toxic B subunit of Stx2e (Stx2eB) as a vaccine antigen, and Stx2eB was expressed in lettuce (Lactuca sativa L., cv. Green wave). We found that a double repeated Stx2eB (2xStx2eB) accumulates to higher levels than a single Stx2eB. In this study, we analyzed progeny plants introduced with 2xStx2eB in which the gene was expressed under the control of conventional cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA (CaMV 35S) promoter, and found that the lettuce underwent transgene silencing and bore few seeds. We resolved these problems by using a transgene cassette which harbored a transcriptional promoter derived from the lettuce ubiquitin gene and a longer version of HSPT. The lettuce harboring this expression construct will be valuable in establishing the seed lot system on the basis that thousands of seeds can be obtained from one plant body and the resulting progeny plants accumulate 2xStx2eB at high levels without the transgene silencing.

AB  - l-Theanine hydrolysis in tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves not only reduces the quality of tea products but also decreases their health benefits. Postharvest dehydration-induced abscisic acid (ABA) contributes to l-theanine hydrolysis, but the specific underlying mechanism has not been explored. Based on transcriptome analysis and gene silencing experiments, CsNCED3a was shown to be a key gene for ABA synthesis in harvested tea leaves, and CsABF7 up-regulated the expression of CsWRKY40, which encodes a transcription factor that directly regulates a l-theanine hydrolysis gene, resulting in the loss of l-theanine. CsWRKY53 and CsWRKY40 activated the expression of CsNCED3a. The CsWRKY53-CsWRKY40 complex exhibited a stronger regulatory effect than the individual transcription factors. These findings reveal an ABA-mediated regulatory pathway for l-theanine hydrolysis, and highlight the pivotal role of ABA in the postharvest metabolism of critical flavor-contributing metabolites in tea leaves.

AB  - Simple Summary Mitigating and reducing the impacts of elephant crop-raiding has become a major focus of conservation intervention. By observing the behaviour amongst two groups of semi-captive African and Asian elephants in Zambia and Thailand, we found that a novel olfactory crop-raiding mitigation method called the "smelly elephant repellent" elicited clear reactions from the elephants. However, unlike trials with wild elephants, the repellent did not prevent the elephants from entering areas or eating food protected by the solution. We found that elephant personality played a role in responses towards the repellent, as the individuals that entered the experimental plots were bolder and more curious individuals. Although captive environments provide controlled settings for experimental testing, the ecological validity of testing human-elephant conflict mitigation methods with captive wildlife should be strongly considered. Understanding animal behaviour is essential for improving human-elephant coexistence and for designing deterrence mechanisms, and the smelly elephant repellent may be a useful mitigation method when used in combination with other methods.Abstract Crop-raiding by elephants is one of the most prevalent forms of human-elephant conflict and is increasing with the spread of agriculture into wildlife range areas. As the magnitude of conflicts between people and elephants increases across Africa and Asia, mitigating and reducing the impacts of elephant crop-raiding has become a major focus of conservation intervention. In this study, we tested the responses of semi-captive elephants to the "smelly" elephant repellent, a novel olfactory crop-raiding mitigation method. At two trial sites, in Zambia and Thailand, African elephants (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) were exposed to the repellent, in order to test whether or not they entered an area protected by the repellent and whether they ate the food provided. The repellent elicited clear reactions from both study groups of elephants compared to control conditions. Generalised linear models revealed that the elephants were more alert, sniffed more, and vocalised more when they encountered the repellent. Although the repellent triggered a response, it did not prevent elephants from entering plots protected by the repellent or from eating crops, unlike in trials conducted with wild elephants. Personality played a role in responses towards the repellent, as the elephants that entered the experimental plots were bolder and more curious individuals. We conclude that, although captive environments provide controlled settings for experimental testing, the ecological validity of testing human-elephant conflict mitigation methods with captive wildlife should be strongly considered. This study also shows that understanding animal behaviour is essential for improving human-elephant coexistence and for designing deterrence mechanisms. Appreciating personality traits in elephants, especially amongst "problem" elephants who have a greater propensity to crop raid, could lead to the design of new mitigation methods designed to target these individuals.

AB  - 3D concrete printing (3DCP) structural components for construction assemblies are known for reduced material use and enhanced efficiency and design freedom. This article investigates the limitations in the geometrical and toolpath design of 3DCP structural components and presents an automated and comprehensive approach to their toolpath design and optimization. It exploits hierarchical geometric data structures and graph algorithms to achieve the following features: (1) By analyzing the overhang of toolpaths, the method offers quantitative criteria for determining the buildability of the components and predicting failure, thus assisting design decisions. (2) It provides toolpath offsetting and filleting methods that can enhance the dimensional accuracy of the print concerning layer line textures and overfills. (3) For branching and porous geometries, the method creates as-continuous-as-possible toolpaths with minimal stop-starts based on their topologies, thus reducing seam defects. (4) It converts the toolpath into efficient visualization meshes representing layer line textures and toolpath meshes compatible with finite elements analysis. The proposed method is implemented as a plug-in software within the environment of Grasshopper (R) for Rhino (R) to facilitate designers and engineers working with 3DCP. The effectiveness and versatility of the tool are demonstrated through the toolpath design and printing of four sets of examples. The tool reduces the number of toolpaths by 90% for a typical 80 mm nozzle and takes 0.21 s per meter of toolpath to slice, analyze overhang, generate continuous printing toolpaths, and visualize the print.

AB  - The aspire of the present investigation is to develop a novel mercury-free electrochemical sensor for the sensitive detection of toxic pollutant in environmental sources. The synthesis of N,N'-bis(salicylaldehyde)-1,2-diaminobenzene (BSD) as a pre designed Schiff-base ligand (SBL) coated on surface of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) modified working electrode for the detection of Pb2+ and Hg2+ in various water sources. The role of BSD contains hydroxyl and imine ions acting as active sites to detect the metal ions in 0.1 M of acetate buffer solution. A star like crystal structure for BSD/MWCNTs modified surface of electrode was observed using SEM analysis. The conductance (sigma) for PIG electrode (unmodified), MWCNTs modified and BSD/MWCNTs modified electrodes are 4.7 x 10(-5) S cm(-1), 408.1 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) and 553.2 x 10(-5) S cm(-1) were estimated. BSD/MWCNTs modified electrode shows the best conductivity compared with other electrodes. For the selective detection of Pb2+ and Hg2+, the square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) was utilised. The linear range of Pb2+ and Hg2+ in the concentration from 2.0 to 155 nM and limits of detection for Pb2+ and Hg2+ were observed at 0.3 nM and 0.6 nM by SWASV. This sensor is often used for sensitive detection of analytes like Pb2+ and Hg2+ in different water samples. The results of SWASV recovered value are comparing with atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Qiangji Decoction (QJD), a Chinese medicine, is widely used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat amnesia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), showing significant anti-AD effects. However, the precise mechanisms behind these effects are not well understood and require more research. Aim of the study: This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms by which QJD ameliorates neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial impairment in AD through the regulation of ROCK2/Drp1-mediated mitochondrial dynamics. Materials and methods: UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS was used to identify active components in QJD extract. The study used SAMP8 mice for AD modeling and SAMR1 mice as controls. Cognitive function in SAMP8 mice was assessed with the Morris Water Maze after following treatment with QJD and the mitochondrial fission inhibitor Mdivi-1. Nissl and FJB staining evaluated QJD's effect on hippocampal injury. Synaptic integrity was examined with Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial function in hippocampal neurons was assessed using electron microscopy, JC-1 staining, and reagent kits. Western blot analyzed expression of proteins related to mitochondrial fission (ROCK2, Drp1, Fis1, Mff) and fusion (Mfn1, Mfn2, OPA1). Results: The analysis of QJD extract via UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS led to the identification of 46 active compounds. In SAMP8 mice, administration of QJD resulted in decreased escape latency, increased platform crossings, and extended duration in the target quadrant. Additionally, QJD exhibited neuroprotective effects on the hippo- campus of SAMP8 mice, effectively preventing neuronal loss and damage. QJD also facilitated the extension and thickening of dendritic spines, enhanced the ultrastructure of hippocampal synapses, and upregulated synaptic function-related proteins, including PSD95 and SYN1. Furthermore, QJD ameliorated mitochondrial damage, improved mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP content, and reduced ROS expression in hippocampal neurons of SAMP8 mice. These effects were mediated through the downregulation of ROCK2, phosphorylated Drp1 (Ser616), Fis1, and Mff, as well as the upregulation of Mfn1, Mfn2, and OPA1. Conclusions: QJD may reduce neuronal damage, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial impairment in SAMP8 mice by regulating mitochondrial dynamics through the ROCK2/Drp1 pathway.

AB  - The metabolism of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is different in carriers of APOE4, the main genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The brain relies on the plasma DHA pool for its need, but the plasma-liver-brain axis in relation to cognition remains obscure. We hypothesized that this relationship is compromised in APOE4 mice considering the differences in fatty acid metabolism between APOE3 and APOE4 mice. Male and female APOE3 and APOE4 mice were fed either a diet enriched with DHA (0.7 g DHA/100 g diet) or a control diet for 8 months. There was a significant genotype x diet interaction for DHA concentration in the liver and adipose tissue. In the cortex, a genotype effect was found where APOE4 mice had a higher concentration of DHA than APOE3 mice fed the control diet. There was a significant genotype x diet interaction for the liver and hippocampal arachidonic acid (AA). APOE4 mice had 20-30% lower plasma DHA and AA concentrations than APOE3 mice, independent of diet. Plasma and liver DHA levels were significantly correlated in APOE3 and APOE4 mice. In APOE4 mice, there was a significant correlation between plasma, adipose tissues, cortex DHA and the Barnes maze and/or with a better recognition index. Moreover, higher AA levels in the liver and the hippocampus of APOE4 mice were correlated with lower cognitive performance. Our results suggest that there is a plasma-liver-brain axis of DHA that is modified in APOE4 mice. Moreover, our data support that APOE4 mice rely more on plasma DHA than APOE3 mice, especially in cognitive performance. Any disturbance in plasma DHA metabolism might have a greater impact on cognition in APOE4 carriers.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) is a key mediator of the Hippo signaling pathway and regulates structural and functional homeostasis in various tissues. TAZ activation is associated with the development of pancreatic cancer in humans, but it is unclear whether TAZ directly affects the structure and function of the pancreas. So we sought to identify the TAZ function in the normal pancreas. TAZ defect caused structural changes in the pancreas, particularly islet cell shrinkage and decreased insulin production and beta-cell markers expression, leading to hyperglycemia. Interestingly, TAZ physically interacted with the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1), a key insulin transcription factor, through the N-terminal domain of TAZ and the homeodomain of PDX1. TAZ deficiency decreased the DNA-binding and transcriptional activity of PDX1, whereas TAZ overexpression promoted PDX1 activity and increased insulin production even in a low glucose environment. Indeed, high glucose increased insulin production by turning off the Hippo pathway and inducing TAZ activation in pancreatic beta-cells. Ectopic TAZ overexpression along with PDX1 activation was sufficient to produce insulin in non-beta-cells. TAZ deficiency impaired the mesenchymal stem cell differentiation into insulin-producing cells (IPCs), whereas TAZ recovery restored normal IPCs differentiation. Compared to WT control, body weight increased in TAZ-deficient mice with age and even more with a high-fat diet (HFD). TAZ deficiency significantly exacerbated HFD-induced glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Therefore, TAZ deficiency impaired pancreatic insulin production, causing hyperglycemia and exacerbating HFD-induced insulin resistance, indicating that TAZ may have a beneficial effect in treating insulin deficiency in diabetes.

AB  - Apoptotic bodies (ABs) are a type of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that could contribute to the paracrine effect of stem cells. However, their potential in treating cardiovascular diseases is largely unexplored. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of ABs derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) on cardiac recovery in a porcine model of myocardial infarction (MI). In vitro, ABs reduced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) conditions and enhanced the capacity of migration and tube formation in endothelial cells. In vivo, akin to MSCs, administration of ABs improved contractile function, reduced infarct size, and mitigated adverse remodeling in pig hearts with MI, concomitantly with increased cardiomyocyte survival and angiogenesis. These cardioprotective effects were mediated through the regulation of autophagy by activating the adenosine monophosphate - activated protein kinase (AMPK) and transcription factor EB (TFEB) signaling pathways. microRNAs contained in ABs were sequenced, revealing that let-7f-5p was the most abundant. let-7f-5p promoted AMPK phosphorylation by targeting protein phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B alpha (PPP2R2A) and decreased TFEB phosphorylation by targeting MAP4K3 to regulate autophagy, thereby contributing to the effects of ABs. Overall, these findings indicate that MSC-derived ABs have the potential to be a promising and effective acellular therapeutic option for treating MI.

AB  - Fat deposition is critical to pork quality. However, the mechanism of fat deposition remains to be elucidated. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are ideal biomarkers and are involved in adipogenesis. Here, we investigated the effect and mechanism of circHOMER1 on porcine adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Western blotting, Oil red O staining, and HE staining were used to assess the function of circHOMER1 in adipogenesis. The results showed that circHOMER1 inhibited adipogenic differentiation of porcine preadipocytes and suppressed adipogenesis in mice. Dual-luciferase reporter gene, RIP, and pull- down assays demonstrated that miR-23b directly bound to circHOMER1 and the 3 '-UTR of SIRT1. Rescue experiments further illustrated the regulatory relationship among circHOMER1, miR-23b, and SIRT1. Conclusively, we demonstrate that circHOMER1 plays an inhibitory role in porcine adipogenesis through miR-23b and SIRT1. The present study revealed the mechanism of porcine adipogenesis, which may be helpful to improve pork quality.

AB  - Delirium is a severe acute neuropsychiatric syndrome that commonly occurs in the elderly and is considered an independent risk factor for later dementia. However, given its inherent complexity, few animal models of delirium have been established and the mechanism underlying the onset of delirium remains elusive. Here, we conducted a comparison of three mouse models of delirium induced by clinically relevant risk factors, including anesthesia with surgery (AS), systemic inflammation, and neurotransmission modulation. We found that both bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine (Scop) induction reduced neuronal activities in the delirium-related brain network, with the latter presenting a similar pattern of reduction as found in delirium patients. Consistently, Scop injection resulted in reversible cognitive impairment with hyperactive behavior. No loss of cholinergic neurons was found with treatment, but hippocampal synaptic functions were affected. These findings provide further clues regarding the mechanism underlying delirium onset and demonstrate the successful application of the Scop injection model in mimicking delirium-like phenotypes in mice.

AB  - Combining products of natural origin with different mechanisms of action on insect herbivores may provide an alternative among methods of plant protection against pests that are less risky for the environment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mixtures of Thuja occidentalis L. essential oil and diatomite (EO + DE) compared to each substance separately in reducing economically important pests such as black bean aphid (BBA) Aphis fabae Scop., Colorado potato beetle (CPB) Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say., and pea leaf weevil (PLW) Sitona lineatus L. The effects on mortality (all pests) and foraging intensity (CPB and PLW) were tested. The improvement in effectiveness using a mixture of EO + DE versus single components against BBA was dose- and the developmental stage-dependent. The effect of enhancing CPB foraging inhibition through DE addition was obtained at a concentration of 0.2% EO (both females and males of CPB) and 0.5% EO (males) in no-choice experiments. In choice experiments, mixtures EO + DE with both 0.2% and 0.5% EO concentrations resulted in a significant reduction in CPB foraging. A significant strengthening effect of EO 0.5% through the addition of DE at a dose of 10% against PLW males was observed in the no-choice experiment, while, when the beetles had a choice, the synergistic effect of a mixture of EO 0.5% and DE 10% was also apparent in females. In conclusion, the use of DE mixtures with EO from T. occidentalis appears to be a promising strategy. The results support the idea of not using doses of EO higher than 0.5%.

AB  - Computational modeling methods combined with non-invasive imaging technologies have exhibited great potential and unique opportunities to model new bone formation in scaffold tissue engineering, offering an effective alternate and viable complement to laborious and time-consuming in vivo studies. However, existing numerical approaches are still highly demanding computationally in such multiscale problems. To tackle this challenge, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based approach to predict bone ingrowth outcomes in bulk tissue scaffolds. The proposed in silico procedure is developed by correlating with a dedicated longitudinal (12-month) animal study on scaffold treatment of a major segmental defect in sheep tibia. Comparison of the ML-based time-dependent prediction of bone ingrowth with the conventional multilevel finite element (FE2) model demonstrates satisfactory accuracy and efficiency. The ML-based modeling approach provides an effective means for predicting in vivo bone tissue regeneration in a subject-specific scaffolding system.
   The study develops a machine learning approach for predicting bone regeneration in an additively manufactured bioceramic scaffold, which is correlated with an in vivo sheep model, exhibiting effectiveness for solving such a multiscale modeling problem.

AB  - BackgroundMost of the resources that support the early development of the embryo are stored in the oocyte. Clearing of maternal resources and activation of the embryonic genome to produce its own mRNA transcripts marks the maternal-to-embryo transition. Dependence on stored mRNA can last from a few hours to several days, depending on animal species. The mechanisms regulating stabilization and recruitment of stored maternal transcripts have not yet been described in full detail but are known to involve reversible polyadenylation and modulation of 3'UTR-mediated elements. RNA epigenetic modifications, new players in this field, have an important role in RNA regulation and stabilization.ResultsThe objectives of this study were first to determine if some of post-transcriptional methylation of stored mRNA is greater in oocytes than in somatic cells. We found that m(6)A, known to be the most prevalent and involved in various aspects of RNA metabolism and physiological functions, is particularly abundant in porcine oocyte mRNA compared to liver used as a somatic tissue reference. The second objective was to compare the epitranscriptome machinery, such as methyltransferases ("writers"), binding proteins ("readers") and demethylases ("erasers") catalyzing the different process, in follicles and oocytes of different mammalian species by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. The expression and localization patterns of these proteins differ between mice, pigs and cows ovaries and oocytes. m(5)C-associated proteins were generally less abundant. In contrast, m(6)A-associated proteins were expressed strongly during the early and late stages of folliculogenesis. Transzonal projections were found to contain more granules bearing the m(5)C mark in mice but both m(5)C and m(6)A methylation marks in association with mature oocytes of pigs and cows. Eraser proteins showed the greatest interspecies diversity in terms of distribution in the germinal tissues.ConclusionsSo far, few studies have looked at the oocyte and ovarian epitranscriptomic profile. Our findings indicate that a hitherto unrecognized species-specific layer of transcript regulation occurs at the RNA level and might be consequential during the oocyte transcriptional silencing period.

AB  - Sauropods, the largest terrestrial animals, were a clade of quadrupedal dinosaurs nested within sauropodomorphs, whose early representatives were small bipeds. Their evolution towards gigantism was associated with acquisition of specialized features, notably the columnar limbs. However, their tarsus, mainly represented by the astragalus, has received little attention despite its crucial position and role in limb architecture. We aim to quantify the three-dimensional shape of a large sample of sauropodomorph astragali to assess how its morphology evolved through time and with the emergence of the sauropod bauplan. Acquisition of sauropod-related features was stepwise, congruently with previous results for the hindlimb zeugopod, with marked distinction and diversification of the eusauropod subclade. Size-related variations were congruent with weight-bearing constraints, with flatter distal articular surfaces and more tightly interlocked proximal ones. The subhorizontal pes organization in eusauropods is comparable to that in elephants, suggesting a link with the evolution of an extensive foot pad in both groups. Our evolutionary rates analysis could appear to support this hypothesis. However, our randomization procedure showed that our test was highly sensitive to temporal uncertainties. Our case study therefore encourages acknowledgement of sensitivity in phylogenetically informed palaeobiological analyses to assess more robustly the degree of confidence to put on subsequent interpretations.

AB  - The liver is a highly regenerative organ. During acute liver injury, the remaining hepatocytes rapidly proliferate to restore liver parenchyma and liver function. However, hepatocytes-driven regeneration is compromised in severe liver injury; instead, liver progenitor cells (LPCs) proliferate and differentiate into hepatocytes or cholangiocytes to restore mass and function of liver. The Hippo signaling pathway is of vital importance in liver regeneration, and Yes-associated protein (YAP) is the key component of the Hippo pathway. The therapeutic role of YAP has been well studied in hepatocytes-driven liver regeneration. However, the role of LPCs transplantation in acute liver injury has not been defined. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effect of splenic-transplantation of LPCs in CCl4-induced acute liver injury and explored the role of YAP during the procedure. LPCs isolated from choline-deficient, ethioninesupplemented diet (CDE) model were infected with GFP-YAP cDNA lentiviral vector, GFP-YAP shRNA lentiviral vector, and GFP lentiviral vector as control, respectively. At 48 h after CCl4 injection, PBS (control group), GFP lentiviral vector-infected LPCs (GFP-LPC group), GFP-YAP cDNA lentiviral vectorinfected LPCs (YAP-LPC group) and GFP-YAP shRNA lentiviral vector-infected LPCs (sh-YAP-LPC group) were injected into spleens in CCl4-treated mice. Histological and serological analyses were performed to evaluate pathology and liver function. The effect of LPCs on the proliferation of hepatocytes and inflammation was investigated. We demonstrated that intra-splenic transplantation of LPCs alleviates CCl4-induced acute liver injury and YAP signaling acts a key role during the procedure. Further studies suggested that LPCs alleviate acute liver injury by promoting pre-existing hepatocytes proliferation rather than differentiating into hepatocytes. Furthermore, intra-splenic transplantation of LPCs attenuates inflammation, which facilitates tissue repair in acute liver injury. In conclusion, LPCs transplantation is a potential treatment for acute liver injury and YAP is a prospective therapeutic target in acute liver injury.

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] oilseed cake has been identified as an alternative protein feedstuff and as a valuable feed resource. Moreover, over the last decades, there has been an increased interest in the organic production of feed supplements. A 2-year field experiment was conducted in a split-plot design with three replications, two main plots (conventional tillage: moldboard ploughing at 25 cm followed by rotary hoeing at 10-15 cm, and minimum tillage: chiseling at 25 cm depth followed by rotary hoeing at 10-15 cm), and three sub-plots (organic fertilization type: untreated, vermicompost, and compost) to evaluate the fertilization and tillage system effect on the yield and quality of cold-pressed camelina seed cake. Seed yield and cake yield were only affected by organic fertilization, with the highest values observed in the compost treatment. Crude protein was influenced by both factors examined, and the greatest content was found under conventional tillage and compost application. As for the fatty acid composition of oilseed cake, this can be characterized as a major source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (similar to 52% of total FAs), particularly linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, which were only affected by fertilization, with the highest values found after compost application. To conclude, the cold-pressed cake from camelina seed cultivated under compost fertilization and conventional tillage appears to be an effective alternative to conventionally used protein feed ingredients.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are persistent environmental pollutants, which occasionally appear as contaminants in consumer products. Upon dermal contact, transfer of PAH into the stratum corneum (s.c.) and migration through the skin may occur, resulting in this class of highly toxic compounds to become bioavailable. In this study, dermal penetration through human and porcine skin of 24 PAH, comprising broad molar mass (M: 152-302 g/mol) and octanol-water partition coefficient (logP: 3.9-7.3) ranges, was evaluated via Franz diffusion cell in vitro assays. More lipophilic and potentially more toxic PAH had decreased permeation rates through the rather lipophilic s.c. into the more hydrophilic viable (epi-)dermis. Furthermore, human skin was less permeable than pigskin, a commonly used surrogate in skin penetration studies. In particular, the s.c. of human skin retains a greater share of PAH, an effect that is more pronounced for smaller PAH. Additionally, we compared the skin permeation kinetics of different PAH in pigskin. While small PAH (M < 230 g/mol, logP < 6) permeate the skin quickly and are detected in the receptor fluid after 2 h, large PAH (M > 252 g/mol, logP >= 6) do not fully permeate the skin up to 48 h. This indicates that highly lipophilic PAH do not become bioavailable as readily as their smaller congeners when transferred to the skin surface. Our data suggest that pigskin could be used as a surrogate for worst case scenario estimates of dermal PAH permeation through human skin.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is considered one of the most relevant indicators of physical well-being and relevant biomarker for preventing cardiovascular risks. More recently, a growing amount of research has tracked an association between HRV and cognitive functions (i.e., attention). Research is still scarce on spatial orientation, a basic capability in our daily lives. It is also an important indicator of memory performance, and its malfunctioning working as an early sign of dementia. In this study, a total of 43 female students (M Age = 18.76; SD = 2.02) were measured in their lnRMSSD using the photoplethysmography technique with the Welltory smartphone app. They were also tested in their spatial memory with The Boxes Room, a virtual navigation test. Measures of physical activity were obtained with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Correlation analyses and repeated measures ANOVA were performed, comparing participants with high / low lnRMSSD in their spatial performance. Results showed that, at an equal level of physical activity, participants with a higher lnRMSSD were more effective in the early trials of The Boxes Room, being more precise in estimating the correct position of the stimuli. Moreover, a subsequent simple linear regression showed that a higher lnRMSSD was related to a smaller number of errors at the beginning of the spatial task. Overly, these results outline the relationship between HRV and navigation performance in early stages of processing, where the environment is still unknown and the situation is more demanding.

TI  - Caffeic acid supplementation ameliorates intestinal injury by modulating intestinal microbiota in LPS-challenged piglets
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - During weaning, piglets are susceptible to intestinal injuries caused by a range of infections, which result in serious economic losses for pig producers. Caffeic acid (CA) is a plant-derived phenolic acid that exhibits potential as a dietary supplement for enhancing intestinal health. There is, however, limited information available about the potential benefits of CA supplementation on intestinal injury and growth performance in piglets. A 28-day study was conducted to examine the effectiveness of CA supplementation in protecting against intestinal injury induced by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in piglets. Twenty-four piglets (7.43 & PLUSMN; 0.79 kg body weight; Duroc x Landrace x Large White; barrows) were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group, the LPS group, the LPS + CA group, and the CA group. Piglets were administered with LPS or saline on d21 and d28 of the experiment. Supplementation with CA improved intestinal barrier function in LPS-challenged piglets by enhancing intestinal morphology and integrity, as well as increasing the expression of Claudin-1 and ZO-1. Meanwhile, CA supplementation improved the systemic and colonic inflammation responses, oxidative stress, and apoptosis induced by LPS. CA supplementation improved the alpha diversity and structure of the intestinal microbiota by increasing the abundance of beneficial microbiota. Additionally, it was found that it improves metabolic disorders of colonic bile acids (BAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in LPS-challenged piglets, including an increase in primary BAs and isovalerate. In conclusion, CA supplementation could enhance intestinal integrity and barrier function by modifying intestinal microbiota and its metabolites, which could lead to a reduction in inflammatory responses and oxidative stress and ultimately enhanced growth performance in piglets.

AB  - Contextual information is represented in the hippocampus (HPC) partially through the recruitment of distinct neuronal ensembles. It is believed that reactivation of these ensembles underlies memory retrieval processes. Recently, we showed that norepinephrine input from phasic locus coeruleus activation induces hippocampal plasticity resulting in the recruitment of new neurons and disengagement from previously established representations. We hypothesize that norepinephrine may provide a neuromodulatory mnemonic switch signaling the HPC to move from a state of retrieval to encoding in the presence of novelty, and therefore, plays a role in memory updating. Here, we tested whether bilateral dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) infusions of the beta-adrenergic receptor (BAR) agonist isoproterenol (ISO), administered prior to encoding or retrieval, would impair spatial working and reference memory by reverting, the system to encoding (thereby recruiting new neurons) potentially interfering with the retrieval of the previously established spatial ensemble. We also investigated whether dDG infusions of ISO could promote cognitive flexibility by switching the system to encoding when it is adaptive (ie, when new information is presented, eg, reversal learning). We found that intra-dDG infusions of ISO given prior to retrieval caused deficits in working and reference memory which was blocked by pretreatment with the BAR-antagonist, propranolol (PRO). In contrast, ISO administered prior to reversal learning led to improved performance. These data support our hypothesis that norepinephrine serves as a novelty signal to update HPC contextual representations via BAR activation-facilitated recruitment of new neurons. This can be both maladaptive and adaptive depending on the situation.

AB  - This is the first comprehensive review of marine mammal records from the Haswell archipelago (Davis Sea, East Antarctica), collected in 1912-2016. The goal of the review is to provide baseline ecological and faunal information on the marine mammals during the historical period (species diversity and status). Eight marine mammal species were recorded within the survey area. Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) and sei whales (Balaenoptera borealis) were seen very rarely. Killer whales (Orcinus orca), southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) and leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) appeared rare -ly and few in numbers. Crabeater seals (Lobodon carcinophaga) were rare in general but common during the rare seasons of early fast ice breaking. Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) were common year-round. Antarctic minke whales (Balaenoptera bonaeren-sis) were seasonally common. Weddell seals and Antarctic minke whales were recorded annually. Only Weddell seals were found year-round. Leopard seals were seasonal resi-dents, the remaining species were seasonal visitors in the area. The archipelago is an annual breeding site for Weddell seals (up to 10 pups per breeding season). Rare breed -ing of crabeater seals is possible. The information presented in this paper was obtained mostly through random observations and few historical records. During the long-term monitoring, a single agreed-upon data collection protocol was not used. As a result, the status of each marine mammal species in this paper should be regarded as preliminary. The review represents a basis for the development of further research programs. A uni-fied protocol for the year-round registration of marine mammals under the conditions of the Mirny Station for the program for monitoring the biota of the Haswell archipelago is proposed.

AB  - Antioxidants protect cellular function and structure by neutralizing the oxidative stress caused by increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) during sperm freezing. Studies on cryopreservation using various antioxidants have demonstrated encouraging results. Many studies have used antioxidants to increase the efficiency of sperm freezing and to improve the success rate of artificial insemination and pregnancy. Manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP) is a newly synthesized antioxidant with positive effects on sperm morphology and capacitation in humans, rams, and stallions. In this study, porcine semen was treated with 0, 50, 100, and 150 mu M of MnTBAP based on a Tris-egg-yolk extender and frozen to determine whether MnTBAP can assist the status of sperm during cryopreservation. First, motility was assessed using the computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) system, with the 100 mu M treatment group showing the highest motile rate (66.8%) compared with that of the other groups (control, 51.1%; 50 mu M and 150 mu M, 59.6%); therefore, the remaining analyses were conducted comparing the two groups (control vs. 100 mu M group; p < 0.01). Second, fluorescence staining was applied to examine the control and 100 mu M groups using fluorescence microscopy. The viability (41.7% vs. 62.4%) and the acrosome integrity (77.9% vs. 86.4%) differed significantly (p < 0.05). In addition, the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was 46.5% vs. 51.9%; the fragmentation rate, estimated using the Sperm-sus-Halomax kit, was 63.4% vs. 57.4%; and the detected caspase activity was 30.1% vs. 22.9%. These tended to be higher in the treated group but did not differ significantly. Third, measurements using FACSLyric revealed that the 100 mu M treatment group exhibited a state of elevated normal lipid arrangement within the plasma membrane and diminished levels of apoptosis and ROS (p < 0.01). We assessed the expression of genes relevant to antioxidant effectiveness using real-time RT-qPCR. Our findings indicated significant alterations in the expression levels of various mRNA species, with the exception of NOX5 (p < 0.05). Finally, the straws were dissolved and used to treat matured denuded oocytes to investigate the effect on fertilization and embryo development in vitro. The cleavage rate was (77.6% vs. 84.1%), and the blastocyst rate was 9.7% vs. 11.4% (p < 0.05). In conclusion, these results suggest that MnTBAP positively affected sperm freeze-thawing, improving the fertilization capacity, and leading to increased embryo development.

AB  - Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by disrupted circadian rhythms and neuronal loss. Lithium amplifies circadian rhythms and is neuroprotective, indicating mechanistic overlap across cellular systems. We examined the role of neuroprotection in determining lithium response and how circadian clock genes regulate apoptosis. In stem-cell-derived neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) from BD patients, and in immortalized mouse hippocampal neurons, lithium was neuroprotective against staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis. However, neuroprotection did not distinguish lithium-responders (Li-Rs) from nonresponders (Li-NRs). Disruption of selected clock genes-period circadian regulator 1 (PER1), basic helix-loop-helix ARNT like 1 (ARNTL, also known as BMAL1), and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1 (NR1D1; also known as REV-ERB alpha)-with small interfering RNA (siRNA) had distinct effects on apoptosis in mouse neurons and human NPCs. In BD patient NPCs, reduced expression of PER1 and BMAL1 increased apoptosis more in Li-NR NPCs vs. Li-R NPCs. Reduced expression of REV-ERB alpha caused more extensive apoptosis in BD vs. control NPCs, but did not distinguish Li-Rs vs. Li-NRs. The REV-ERB agonist GSK4112 was neuroprotective in mouse neurons and control NPCs, but did not reduce apoptosis in BD NPCs. Simultaneous treatment of NPCs with STS and GSK4112 revealed BD- and Li-R-associated differences in apoptosis-related gene expression. In summary, the pharmacological effects of lithium in promoting neuroprotection are not sufficient to distinguish between Li-Rs and Li-NRs. However, genetic and pharmacological manipulations of the circadian clock reveal distinct roles in apoptosis in BD patient NPCs, some of which do distinguish Li-Rs and Li-NRs. We conclude that genetic disruption of cellular circadian clocks may predispose neurons to apoptosis preferentially in BD and/or Li-NR. These findings imply that differences in BD between Li-Rs/Li-NRs primarily arise from defining biological characteristics of patient subgroups, not from distinct pharmacodynamic factors following lithium treatment.

AB  - Early in auditory processing, neural responses faithfully reflect acoustic input. At higher stages of auditory processing, however, neurons become selective for particular call types, eventually leading to specialized regions of cortex that preferentially process calls at the highest auditory processing stages. We previously proposed that an intermediate step in how nonselective responses are transformed into call-selective responses is the detection of informative call features. But how neural selectivity for informative call features emerges from nonselective inputs, whether feature selectivity gradually emerges over the processing hierarchy, and how stimulus information is represented in nonselective and feature-selective populations remain open question. In this study, using unanesthetized guinea pigs (GPs), a highly vocal and social rodent, as an animal model, we characterized the neural representation of calls in 3 auditory processing stages-the thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body (vMGB)), and thalamorecipient (L4) and superficial layers (L2/3) of primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that neurons in vMGB and A1 L4 did not exhibit call-selective responses and responded throughout the call durations. However, A1 L2/3 neurons showed high call selectivity with about a third of neurons responding to only 1 or 2 call types. These A1 L2/3 neurons only responded to restricted portions of calls suggesting that they were highly selective for call features. Receptive fields of these A1 L2/3 neurons showed complex spectrotemporal structures that could underlie their high call feature selectivity. Information theoretic analysis revealed that in A1 L4, stimulus information was distributed over the population and was spread out over the call durations. In contrast, in A1 L2/3, individual neurons showed brief bursts of high stimulus-specific information and conveyed high levels of information per spike. These data demonstrate that a transformation in the neural representation of calls occurs between A1 L4 and A1 L2/3, leading to the emergence of a feature-based representation of calls in A1 L2/3. Our data thus suggest that observed cortical specializations for call processing emerge in A1 and set the stage for further mechanistic studies.

AB  - Ceramide is a critical molecule in both the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system. The most studied aspect is its effect on embryonic/stem cells. A salient question is whether low doses of ceramide induce neuronal differentiation without interfering with sphingolipid metabolism and whether high doses can be used in glioblastoma for their cytotoxic effect. Here, we examined the effect of a high dose of ceramide (13 mu M) on HN9.10e cells. Interestingly, 13 mu M ceramide induced an immediate increase in cell viability, followed by an increase in the number of mitochondria. Microscopic and morphometric analysis revealed a decrease in the number of differentiated cells with 13 mu M compared to 0.1 mu M but with longer neurites. Furthermore, the lipidomic study demonstrated an increase in the formation of medium-long-chain ceramide and sphingomyelin species and sphingosine 1 phosphate. Sphingolipid modification correlated with SMPD3, ASAH2, and SPHK2 gene expression coding for neutral sphingomyenase 2, ceramidase 2, and sphingosine kinase 2, respectively. Overall, our data show that the variety of responses to ceramide of the same cell type is dependent on the concentration used. Low doses do not affect sphingolipid metabolism, and high doses do so with a different cellular response.

AB  - Simple Summary Mastitis causes economic loss due to discarded milk and reduced milk production and quality, increased medical care costs and somatic cell count (SCC) penalties. The use of genetic markers associated with the variability of this trait through marker-assisted selection (MAS) could help traditional methods. Our objectives were to identify new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with mastitis resistance in Assaf sheep by using the Illumina Ovine Infinium (R) HD SNP BeadChip (680K). Firstly, corrected phenotype estimates for somatic cell score (SCS) were calculated using 6173 records from 1894 multiparous Assaf ewes, and were used to select 192 extreme animals (low SCS group: n = 96; and high SCS group: n = 96) for the genome-wide association study (GWAS). Four SNPs (rs419096188, rs415580501, rs410336647, and rs424642424), three of them totally linked, were found to be significant at the chromosome level (FDR 10%) in two different regions of OAR19 close to genes related to the immune system response. Validation studies of two SNPs (rs419096188 and rs424642424) by Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) genotyping in the total population (n = 1894) confirmed previous GWAS association results for the SCS trait. Finally, the SNP rs419096188 was also associated with lactose content trait. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to identify new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes associated with mastitis resistance in Assaf sheep by using the Illumina Ovine Infinium HD SNP BeadChip (680K). In total, 6173 records from 1894 multiparous Assaf ewes with at least three test day records and aged between 2 and 7 years old were used to estimate a corrected phenotype for somatic cell score (SCS). Then, 192 ewes were selected from the top (n = 96) and bottom (n = 96) tails of the corrected SCS phenotype distribution to be used in a GWAS. Although no significant SNPs were found at the genome level, four SNPs (rs419096188, rs415580501, rs410336647, and rs424642424) were significant at the chromosome level (FDR 10%) in two different regions of OAR19. The SNP rs419096188 was located in intron 1 of the NUP210 and close to the HDAC11 genes (61 kb apart), while the other three SNPs were totally linked and located 171 kb apart from the ARPP21 gene. These three genes were related to the immune system response. These results were validated in two SNPs (rs419096188 and rs424642424) in the total population (n = 1894) by Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) genotyping. Furthermore, rs419096188 was also associated with lactose content.

AB  - Birth asphyxia and the resulting hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) are highly associated with perinatal and neonatal death, neonatal seizures, and an adverse later-life outcome. Currently used drugs, including phenobarbital and midazolam, have limited efficacy to suppress neonatal seizures. There is a medical need to develop new therapies that not only suppress neonatal seizures but also prevent later-life consequences. We have previously shown that the loop diuretic bumetanide does not potentiate the effects of phenobarbital in a rat model of birth asphyxia. Here we compared the effects of bumetanide (0.3 or 10 mg/kg i.p.), midazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.), and a combination of bumetanide and midazolam on neonatal seizures and later-life outcomes in this model. While bumetanide at either dose was ineffective when administered alone, the higher dose of bumetanide markedly potentiated midazolam's effect on neonatal seizures. Median bumetanide brain levels (0.47-0.53 lM) obtained with the higher dose were in the range known to inhibit the Na-K-Cl-cotransporter NKCC1 but it remains to be determined whether brain NKCC1 inhibition was underlying the potentiation of midazolam. When behavioral and cognitive alterations were examined over three months after asphyxia, treatment with the bumetanide/midazolam combination, but not with bumetanide or midazolam alone, prevented impairment of learning and memory. Furthermore, the combination prevented the loss of neurons in the dentate hilus and aberrant mossy fiber sprouting in the CA3a area of the hippocampus. The molecular mechanisms that explain that bumetanide potentiates midazolam but not phenobarbital in the rat model of birth asphyxia remain to be determined. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is one of the leading causes of sensorineural hearing loss with global importance. The current treatment of choice for patients with hearing problems is a hearing aid or a cochlear implant. However, there is currently no treatment to restore physiological hearing. The development of preventive drugs is currently the focus of hearing research. In order to test the efficacy of a drug, the active ingredient has to be applied at reliable concentrations over a period of time. Osmotic minipumps can provide local drug delivery into the perilymph. Combined with a cochlear implant or a tube, the implantation of the pumps may lead to increased hearing thresholds. Such surgery-related threshold shifts complicate the examination of other factors, such as noise. The aim of the present study was to develop an animal model for the examination of substances that potentially prevent NIHL. For this purpose, six male guinea pigs were unilaterally implanted with a silicon catheter with a hook-shaped microcannula at its tip, attached to an artificial perilymph containing osmotic minipump. One week after surgery, the animals were exposed to four hours of a musical piece, presented at 120 dB SPL, to induce a threshold shift. The implantation of the hook-delivery device caused a moderate threshold shift that allows to detect an additional noise-induced temporary threshold shift. This method enables to investigate drug effects delivered prior to the noise insult in order to establish a preventive strategy against noise-induced temporary threshold shifts. The established drug delivery approach allows the release of drugs into the inner ear in a known concentration and for a known duration. This provides a scientific tool for basic research on drug effects in normal hearing animals.

AB  - Computational analysis of protein-ligand interactions is of crucial importance for drug discovery. Assessment of ligand binding energy allows us to have a glimpse of the potential of a small organic molecule to be a ligand to the binding site of a protein target. Available scoring functions, such as in docking programs, all rely on equations that sum each type of protein-ligand interactions in order to predict the binding affinity. Most of the scoring functions consider electrostatic interactions involving the protein and the ligand. Electrostatic interactions constitute one of the most important part of total interactions between macromolecules. Unlike dispersion forces, they are highly directional and therefore dominate the nature of molecular packing in crystals and in biological complexes and contribute significantly to differences in inhibition strength among related enzyme inhibitors. In this study, complexes of HIV-1 protease with inhibitor molecules (JE-2147 and darunavir) were analyzed by using charge densities from the transferable aspherical-atom University at Buffalo Databank (UBDB). Moreover, we analyzed the electrostatic interaction energy for an ensemble of structures, using molecular dynamic simulations to highlight the main features of electrostatic interactions important for binding affinity.

AB  - Long-range membrane traffic is guided by microtubuleassociated proteins and posttranslational modifications, which collectively comprise a traffic code. The regulatory principles of this code and how it orchestrates the motility of kinesin and dynein motors are largely unknown. Septins are a large family of GTP-binding proteins, which assemble into complexes that associate with microtubules. Using singlemolecule in vitro motility assays, we tested how the microtubule-associated SEPT2/6/7, SEPT2/6/7/9, and SEPT5/ 7/11 complexes affect the motilities of the constitutively active kinesins KIF5C and KIF1A and the dynein-dynactin-bicaudal D (DDB) motor complex. We found that microtubule-associated SEPT2/6/7 is a potent inhibitor of DDB and KIF5C, preventing mainly their association with microtubules. SEPT2/6/7 also inhibits KIF1A by obstructing stepping along microtubules. On SEPT2/6/7/9-coated microtubules, KIF1A inhibition is dampened by SEPT9, which alone enhances KIF1A, showing that individual septin subunits determine the regulatory properties of septin complexes. Strikingly, SEPT5/7/11 differs from SEPT2/6/7, in permitting the motility of KIF1A and immobilizing DDB to the microtubule lattice. In hippocampal neurons, filamentous SEPT5 colocalizes with somatodendritic microtubules that underlie Golgi membranes and lack SEPT6. Depletion of SEPT5 disrupts Golgi morphology and polarization of Golgi ribbons into the shaft of somato-proximal dendrites, which is consistent with the tethering of DDB to microtubules by SEPT5/7/11. Collectively, these results suggest that microtubule-associated complexes have differential specific- ities in the regulation of the motility and positioning of microtubule motors. We posit that septins are an integral part of the microtubule-based code that spatially controls membrane traffic.

AB  - The Pacific seahorse (Hippocampus ingens) is an important cultural and economic resource for coastal communities in the state of Sinaloa, Mexico. However, the conservation of this species is threatened by overfishing, habitat loss, and lack of awareness about its ecological importance. In this study, we examine the local ecological knowledge and use of the Pacific seahorse by residents of Sinaloa. Through ethnographic interviews and participant observation, we document the traditional knowledge and practices associated with this species, including its habitat, behavior, and uses. We find that local ecological knowledge has played a crucial role in the management and conservation of the Pacific seahorse, and that community-based approaches are necessary to address the conservation challenges facing this species.

AB  - Simple Summary Stress is an important risk factor for the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, although people cope differently with adverse life events. While resilient people are able to successfully adapt to stressful experiences, vulnerable people have difficulty coping appropriately with changes in the environment. The reasons for this are not known, but could be explained by individual genetic variants, sex and previous life experiences. The Val66Met variant of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which impairs intracellular BDNF transport and activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, has been associated with increased susceptibility to the development of various neuropsychiatric disorders, although the evidence is still controversial. Here, we found that exposure to subchronic stress induced an anxiety-like phenotype in all mice, regardless of genotype and sex. Interestingly, all mice are able to recover from the anxiety-like phenotype in the long term, except the male heterozygous mice carrying the Val66Met variant of BDNF. Furthermore, we found that recovery was associated with changes in epigenetic mechanisms and neurotrophic factors. Overall, our results show that the presence of Val66Met BDNF reduces the ability of only male mice to recover from a stressful event. Stress is an important risk factor for the onset of anxiety and depression. The ability to cope with stressful events varies among different subjects, probably depending on different genetic variants, sex and previous life experiences. The Val66Met variant of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), which impairs the activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, has been associated with increased susceptibility to the development of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Adult male and female wild-type Val/Val (BDNFV/V) and heterozygous Val/Met (BDNFV/M) mice were exposed to two sessions of forced swimming stress (FSS) per day for two consecutive days. The mice were behaviorally tested 1 day (short-term effect) or 11 days (long-term effect) after the last stress session. Protein and mRNA levels were measured in the hippocampus 16 days after the end of stress exposure. Stressed mice showed a higher anxiety-like phenotype compared to non-stressed mice, regardless of the sex and genotype, when analyzed following the short period of stress. In the prolonged period, anxiety-like behavior persisted only in male BDNFV/M mice (p < 0.0001). Interestingly, recovery in male BDNFV/V mice was accompanied by an increase in pCREB (p < 0.001) and Bdnf4 (p < 0.01) transcript and a decrease in HDAC1 (p < 0.05) and Dnmt3a (p = 0.01) in the hippocampus. Overall, our results show that male and female BDNF Val66Met knock-in mice can recover from subchronic stress in different ways.

AB  - Currently, antimicrobial drug resistance is a problem that deserves thoughtful consideration. Especially in the swine production industry, many pig farms tend to release wastewater into natural water sources, which villagers use for their livelihood. This study aimed to demonstrate the occurrence of phenotypic and genotypic resistance characteristics of E. coli, as well as antibiotic residues in manure and wastewater on swine farms in Prachinburi Province, Thailand. Samples were collected in 2020 and 2021 during the rainy and summer seasons. The results of a questionnaire showed that farmers used antibiotics for disease treatment and prevention at a ratio of 2/4 (50%). The most common antibiotic used was amoxicillin (4/4, 100%), followed by Enrofloxacin (75%) and colistin (25%). The analysis of antibiotic residue in wastewater by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LCMS, LC-MS) during the rainy season revealed that amoxicillin (54%) was the highest, followed by florfenicol (14%) and tiamulin (13%). While oxytetracycline (59%), amoxicillin (20%), and florfenicol (11%) were the highest in the summer. The study of Risk Quotient (RQ) indicated that water resources present a risk of antibiotic contamination by sulfonamides, trimethoprim, b-lactam, quinolones, and tetracycline at high levels (SRQ >1) during both seasons. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by an antibiotic susceptibility test (AST), analyzed by microdilution technique, and VITEK?? 2 Compact. The test result indicated that a total of 143 isolates were found in manure (45/143), pre-treatment (51/143), and final effluent (posttreatment, 47/143). ESBL-positive resistance was detected at 13%. However, an immensely high percentage of antimicrobial resistance was found for ampicillin (90%), whereas imipenem did not show any drug resistance (0%). The average MIC value towards colistin in all samples was 2.71 mg/ml, while mcr1 was not found in any samples. Furthermore, MDR was expressed in E. coli at as high as 76.22% (109/143). The highest MDR pattern detected was AMP-TET-FFC-SXT. The PCR technique detected that the diversity and abundance of AMR genes were not significantly different from animal manure and wastewater at the swine farms. The bla-TEM was found more frequently than bla-PS. While the tetracycline group (tetA, tetB) and aminoglycoside (aadA1, aadA2, aadB) represented a major proportion, respectively. The PFGE study revealed the possibility of similar genetic morphology from the different isolates found in this study. ?? 2022 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) modified by plant-associated microbes can attract or repel the oviposition of herbivores. Here, we explored the effects of three different fungi on apples' VOCs and the cascading impacts on the oviposition preference of yellow peach moth [YPM, Conogethes punctiferalis (Guenee)].
   RESULTS: Among Penicillium crustosum-infected apples (PCA), Rhizopus oryzae-infected apples (ROA), Colletotrichum gloeosporioidesinfected apples (CGA) and healthy apples (HA), mated YPM females preferred to oviposit eggs on ROA and CGA, and showed significant attractiveness to VOCs from PCA, ROA, and CGA under laboratory conditions. The VOCs analyses showed that there were significant differences between fungi-infected apples (ROA, CGA) and control treatments (mechanically damaged apples (MDA), HA) in terms of the relative contents of 13 VOCs. The relative contents of ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, ethyl caprylate, estragole, ethyl hexanoate in ROA and CGA were higher than those in MDA. The relative content of isopropyl 2-methylbutyrate in ROA was significantly higher than those in HA and CGA. The relative contents of 2-methylbutyl acetate, butyl 2-methylbutyrate, hexyl 2-methylbutyrate, amyl hexanoate, hexyl hexanoate, (E, E)-.alpha-farnesene in ROA and CGA were lower than those in HA. The relative content of hexyl acetate in ROA and CGA was significantly higher than that in MDA, but lower than that in HA. Additionally, 10 fungi-induced VOCs were detected in ROA and/or CGA. When 20 VOCs from ROA and/or CGA were tested as individuals or mixed blends in Y-tube olfactometer assays, mated YPM females preferred amyl 2-methylbutyrate, isoamyl 2-methylbutyrate, isopropyl 2-methylbutyrate, hexyl propionate (common VOCs in ROA, CGA, and HA), and heptacosane (a fungi-induced VOC in ROA), but no significant preferences were observed between individual compounds and mixed blends, except for hexyl propionate.
   CONCLUSION: Different fungi infection increased the relative contents of common VOCs from healthy and fungi-infected apples, which ultimately resulted in the significant attractiveness for the oviposition of mated YPM females. This study clarified why fungi-infected apples were more attractive to YPMs than healthy apples and screened out the crucial VOCs for YPM oviposition. (c) 2023 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Entacapone, a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, can strengthen the therapeutic effects of levodopa on the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, few studies are reported on whether entacapone can affect hippocampal neurogenesis in mice. To investigate the effects of entacapone, a modulator of dopamine, on proliferating cells and immature neurons in the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus, 60 mice (7 weeks old) were randomly divided into a vehicle-treated group and the groups treated with 10, 50, or 200 mg/kg entacapone. The results showed that 50 and 200 mg/kg entacapone increased the exploration time for novel object recognition. Immunohistochemical staining results revealed that after entacapone treatment, the numbers of Ki67-positive proliferating cells, doublecortin-positive immature neurons, and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (pCREB)-positive cells were significantly increased. Western blot analysis results revealed that treatment with tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) receptor antagonist significantly decreased the exploration time for novel object recognition and inhibited the expression of phosphorylated TrkB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Entacapone treatment antagonized the effects of TrkB receptor antagonist. These results suggest that entacapone treatment promoted hippocampal neurogenesis and improved memory function through activating the BDNF-TrkB-pCREB pathway.

AB  - Background Livestock work is unique due to worker exposure to animal-associated microbiomes within the workplace. Swine workers are a unique cohort within the US livestock labor force, as they have direct daily contact with pigs and undertake mandatory biosecurity interventions. However, investigating this occupational cohort is challenging, particularly within tightly regulated commercial swine operations. Thus, little is known about the impacts of animal exposure and biosecurity protocols on the swine worker microbiome. We obtained unique samples from US swine workers, using a longitudinal study design to investigate temporal microbiome dynamics.Results We observed a significant increase in bacterial DNA load on worker skin during the workday, with concurrent changes in the composition and abundance of microbial taxa, resistance genes, and mobile genetic elements. However, mandatory showering at the end of the workday partially returned the skin's microbiome and resistome to their original state.Conclusions These novel results from a human cohort demonstrate that existing biosecurity practices can ameliorate work-associated microbiome impacts.

AB  - The number of parvalbumin neurons can be modified by social, multisensory, and cognitive stimuli in both mammals and birds, but nothing is known about their plasticity in long-distance migratory shorebirds. Here, in the spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularius), we investigated the plasticity of parvalbumin neurons of two brain areas during this species' wintering period at a lower latitude. We compared individuals in a nonmigratory rest period (November-January) and premigration (May-July) period. We used parvalbumin as a marker for counting a subpopulation of inhibitory neurons in the hippocampal formation (HF), with the magnocellular nucleus of the tectal isthmus (IMC) as a control area. Because the HF is involved in learning and memory and social interaction and the IMC is essential for control of head, neck, and eye movements, we hypothesized that parvalbumin neurons would increase in the HF and remain unchanged in the IMC. We used an optical fractionator to estimate cell numbers. Compared with the nonmigratory rest birds, parvalbumin neuron count estimates in the premigration birds increased significantly in the HF but remained unchanged in IMC. We suggest that the greater number of parvalbuminergic neurons in the HF of A. macularius in the premigration period represents adaptive circuitry changes involved in the migration back to reproductive niches in the northern hemisphere.

AB  - During pregnancy, blood flow to the uterus changes to support fetal demand. Placentomes serve as vascular attachment sites on the placenta for exchange of gases, nutrients, and metabolic products. Non-invasive methods of ultrasonography and biomarkers have been described to assess placental health and fetal viability. Pregnancy associated glycoproteins (PAGs) are produced by the ruminant placenta and are detected in maternal circulation. In cattle, changes in circulating PAG concentrations are associated with embryonic and fetal outcomes. The objective of this study was to determine the association between placentome blood perfusion and circulating PAG concentrations as they relate to the health of the developing fetus. We hypothesized that placentome perfusion and PAG concentration will be positively correlated and associated with neonatal outcome. A prospective, observational study was designed using 26 pregnant, nulliparous, Angus heifers in which PAG concentration and placentome blood perfusion were assessed throughout gestation, with assessment of calving characteristics following parturition. Placentome blood perfusion was visualized at 30-day intervals via transrectal Doppler ultrasonography with power flow function. Ultrasound images were analyzed using ImageJ software to determine the percent area of perfusion and integrated pixel densities. Venous blood was collected and PAG concentrations were determined via serum PAG enzyme-linked immunoassay. Mean placentome blood perfusion increased as gestation advanced. PAG concentrations demonstrated the expected temporal trend, increasing with gestation length, and were positively linearly correlated with placentome perfusion (P < 0.0001). The relationship identified between circulating PAG concentration and placentome blood perfusion suggests the use of transrectal power flow Doppler ultrasonography as a noninvasive technique to determine placental blood flow morphometrics to assess conceptus wellbeing throughout pregnancy.

AB  - Simple Summary Umbilical hernia in swine is a congenital condition that may require surgical treatment. Locoregional anesthesia is commonly used in livestock to provide analgesia for surgery. However, the relatively low pH of inflamed tissue may reduce, slow down, or compromise the efficacy of local anesthetics. Phlegmon, ulcers, and dermatitis are very common lesions in livestock, that result in an inflammatory process with pH reduction of the tissues. Consequently, a locally effective opioid may replace or compliment the analgesic efficacy of local anesthetics. Tramadol is a weak opioid with good analgesic efficacy and few side effects. The results of the study showed that tramadol could be used for pain management in livestock.Abstract The aim of the study was to compare the analgesic efficacy of tramadol and lidocaine for local anesthesia during umbilical hernia repair in swine. The study was performed on 66 large white crossbred swine. The swine received a mixture of tiletamine/zolazepam at 5 mg/kg and romifidine at 80 mu g/kg, administered intramuscularly. Then, they were divided into three groups (n = 22) that received different treatments with lidocaine at 4 mg/kg and tramadol at 4 mg/kg. The LL group received lidocaine both by infiltration of the surgical planes and intraperitoneally. The LT group received lidocaine by infiltration of the surgical planes and tramadol intraperitoneally. The TT group received tramadol both by infiltration of the surgical planes and intraperitoneally. In all groups, the infiltration of the surgical planes into the umbilical region involved both the skin and muscle planes. Heart rate, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, and respiratory frequency were recorded during surgery. The response to the surgical stimulus was evaluated using a cumulative pain scale (the cut-off point for rescue analgesia was set to 10). Postoperative pain was assessed using the UNESP-Botucatu pig composite acute pain scale (the cut-off point was set to 4). The trend of physiological variables was adequate for patients under anesthesia. No subject required intraoperative and postoperative rescue analgesia. Tramadol could therefore be used for pain management in livestock.

AB  - The 'dusting' technique of lithotripsy for the removal of infected urinary calculi and the wide use of drainage after endoscopic surgery may stimulate spreading of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains. Antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT) is one promising method for the elimination these strains. The purpose of our study was to evaluate alterations of renal pelvis morphology and renal function in laboratory animals after bactericidal regimens of PDT. Renal pelvises of pigs were filled with Photoditazine and then assessed either by examining the accumulation of Photoditazine in the urothelium or by illumination with a laser at a wavelength of 662 nm. A renal test and a complete blood count was performed to assess a negative effect of the treatment on health. Structural alterations of the kidney tissues were analyzed by histological examination. No photosensitizer fluorescence was detected in the urothelium of the pelvis. Histological study showed that PDT caused minor changes to the urothelium of the renal pelvis but did not affect the underlying connective tissue. No renal function abnormalities were found after PDT. Thus, the study indicates that antibacterial PDT is a safety technique that can complement common antibiotic therapy in the surgical treatment of urolithiasis.

AB  - Simple Summary The development of horse managing tools is needed to prevent accidents and to improve welfare for domestic horses because the safety hazards for people who are exposed to horses are well documented. Androstenone, a pheromone secreted from boars, changes the behavior of dogs to become less excited. In horses, a previous study showed that a specific receptor for androstenone was expressed in the vomeronasal organ and nasal cavity. Horses treated with androstenone also showed more compliant behaviors. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the mechanism of androstenone for changing horse behaviors. The change in the plasma concentrations of serotonin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol in response to the treatment of androstenone was evaluated using an immunoassay. The results of this study demonstrated that androstenone may control the neuroendocrine system of horses, resulting in behavioral changes. This is the first work that studies the mechanism of pheromone treatment in horses and can be applied for further study about the effect of pheromone therapy on horses. Androstenone influences the changing behaviors of animals. Previous studies discovered that an androstenone receptor was expressed in horses and treatment with androstenone induced horses to be more compliant. As changes in the level of neuroendocrine factors result in animal behavioral changes, the objective of the study was to monitor the changes in the concentrations of 5-HT, beta-endorphin, and cortisol in response to androstenone. Eight thoroughbred horses (five mares and three geldings) were treated with androstenone diluted in jojoba oil (10 mu g/mL) and only oil for a control cross-overly. A handler applied the treatments to the horses ' nostril and rubbed for 5 s. Blood samples were collected before, 15, 30, and 60 min after each treatment. The concentrations of each neurotransmitter were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentrations of each neurotransmitter after the treatment were compared to its baseline concentration. The concentration of 5-HT of the androstenone-treated horses remained consistent throughout the experiment, while the concentration of the control group significantly decreased over time. The plasma concentration of beta-endorphin in the androstenone-treated group also remained constant, whereas the concentration increased in the control group. Cortisol levels did not change in either the treated or untreated groups. An androstenone treatment triggers changes in the secretion of 5-HT and beta-endorphin in horses.

AB  - Spectrins are membrane cytoskeletal proteins generally thought to function as heterotetramers comprising two alpha-spectrins and two beta-spectrins. They influence cell shape and Hippo signaling, but the mechanism by which they influence Hippo signaling has remained unclear. We have investigated the role and regulation of the Drosophila beta-heavy spectrin (beta(H)-spectrin, encoded by the karst gene) in wing imaginal discs. Our results establish that beta(H)-spectrin regulates Hippo signaling through the Jub biomechanical pathway due to its influence on cytoskeletal tension. While we find that alpha-spectrin also regulates Hippo signaling through Jub, unexpectedly, we find that beta(H)-spectrin localizes and functions independently of alpha-spectrin. Instead, beta(H)-spectrin co-localizes with and reciprocally regulates and is regulated by myosin. In vivo and in vitro experiments support a model in which beta(H)-spectrin and myosin directly compete for binding to apical F-actin. This competition can explain the influence of beta(H)-spectrin on cytoskeletal tension and myosin accumulation. It also provides new insight into how beta(H)-spectrin participates in ratcheting mechanisms associated with cell shape change.

AB  - The green synthesized nanoparticles have been determined as a novel pesticide against arthropod pests. This study was designed to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal activity of green synthesized nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) using aqueous extract of Melia azedarach ripened fruits against different developmental stages of the camel tick Hyalomma dromedarii in addition to their toxic effect on laboratory animals. The synthesized NiO NPs were characterized by UV-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The UV-Vis spectra of the NiO NPs showed an absorption peak at 307 nm. FTIR analysis showed the possible functional groups used for capping and stabilization of NiO NPs with strong bands at 3416.2 and 1626.6 cm(-1). The SEM images of the NiO NPs exhibited a size ranging from 21 to 35 nm. The immersion test was used for the in vitro application of the synthesized NiO NPs on the various tick stages (egg, nymph, larva, and adult). Mortality percentages and LC50 values of each tick stage were calculated. The oviposition and hatchability of the engorged females were monitored for the survived tick after treatment. The LC50 values for NiO NPs on embryonated eggs, larvae, and engorged nymphs were 5.00, 7.15, and 1.90 mg/mL, respectively. The egg productive index (EPI), egg number, and hatchability (%) were lower in females treated with the NiO NPs than in control ticks. The toxicity of the NiO NPs on laboratory animals was also investigated using Swiss albino mice by oral dose of 500 mg/kg/day administration for five consecutive days. The hematological, biochemical, and histopathological changes were evaluated. The hematological analysis showed significant increase in the level of white blood cells (WBC) and hemoglobin (Hb). Biochemical analysis showed non-significant decrease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alanine amino transferase (ALT). We concluded that NiO NPs have a significant acaricidal activity as demonstrated on eggs, larvae, engorged nymphs, and fully fed females of H. dromedarii. From a toxicological point of view further in vivo investigations are needed to determine the mechanism of toxic effect of NiO NPs.

AB  - One of Clayton's major contributions to our understanding of animal minds has been her work on episodic-like memory. A central reason for the success of this work was its focus on ecological validity: rather than looking for episodic memory for arbitrary stimuli in artificial contexts, focussing on contexts in which episodic memory would serve a biological function such as food caching. This review aims to deepen this insight by surveying the numerous functions that have been proposed for episodic memory, articulating a philosophically grounded framework for understanding what exactly functions are, and drawing on these to make suggestions for future directions in the comparative cognitive psychology of episodic memory. Our review suggests four key insights. First, episodic memory may have more than one function and may have different functions in different species. Second, cross-disciplinary work is key to developing a functional account of episodic memory. Third, there is scope for further theoretical elaboration of proposals relating episodic memory to food caching and, in particular, future-oriented cognition. Finally, learning-related functions suggested by AI (artificial intelligence)-based models are a fruitful avenue for future behavioural research.

AB  - The inflammasome is a multiprotein oligomer in the cell cytoplasm and is part of the innate immune system. It plays a crucial role in the pathological process of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). However, the mechanisms of NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation in NIHL have not been clearly demonstrated. In this study, miniature pigs were exposed to white noise at 120 dB(A) and auditory brainstem response measurements were used to measure their hearing function. Immunofluorescence staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy, western blot assay, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze inflammasome-related protein distribution and expression. NLRP3, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-18, and cleaved-caspase-1 were highly expressed in the cochlea after 120 dB(A) white noise exposure. Our findings suggest that NLRP3-inflammasomes in the cochlea may be activated after acoustic trauma, which may be an important mechanism of noise-induced hearing loss.

AB  - Major depressive disorder is often associated with cognitive impairments, and neuroinflammation is considered a key contributor to the onset of depression. Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which augments endocannabinoid signaling, has emerged as a promising approach to treating depression. The main purpose of this study is to asses the influence of FAAH inhibitor URB597 on inflammatory response and oxidative stress in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depressive female and male rats and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Chronically stressed animals showed long-term memory deficits, while URB597 improved memory only in stressed males. URB597 treatment enhanced levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and mPFC of stressed female and male rats and increased phosphorylated calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (pCaMKII) levels in the hippocampus and mPFC of CUS males. Additionally, increased phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in the hippocampus and mPFC of CUS male and female rats, was reduced following URB597 treatment. URB597 decreased the CUS-enhanced iNOS protein expression in the hippocampus and mPFC of both sexes. Furthermore, URB597 normalized CUS-induced reductions in Nrf2 and HO-1 levels in the mPFC of both sexes, with no changes in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that URB597 may inhibit the CUS-induced neuroinflammatory response by suppressing the proinflammatory mediators and the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling in the hippocampus and mPFC of both sexes. URB597 treatment contributed to synaptic plasticity in a sex-specific manner by upregulating brain CaMKII signaling in males. URB597 also exerts neuroprotective effects through region-specific antioxidant properties. These results have implications for sex-specific treatment strategies in stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Pannexin-1 (Panx1) hemichannel is a non-selective transmembrane channel that may play important roles in intercellular signaling by allowing the permeation of ions and metabolites, such as ATP. Although recent evidence shows that the Panx1 hemichannel is involved in controlling excitatory synaptic transmission, the role of Panx1 in inhibitory transmission remains unknown. Here, we studied the contribution of Panx1 to the GABAergic synaptic efficacy onto CA1 pyramidal neurons (PyNs) by using patch-clamp recordings and pharmacological approaches in wild-type and Panx1 knock-out (Panx1-KO) mice. We reported that blockage of the Panx1 hemichannel with the mimetic peptide (10)Panx1 increases the synaptic level of endocannabinoids (eCB) and the activation of cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1Rs), which results in a decrease in hippocampal GABAergic efficacy, shifting excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance toward excitation and facilitating the induction of long-term potentiation. Our finding provides important insight unveiling that Panx1 can strongly influence the overall neuronal excitability and play a key role in shaping synaptic changes affecting the amplitude and direction of plasticity, as well as learning and memory processes.

AB  - In the U.S. millions of commercially raised piglets are routinely tail docked. Human and veterinary medical patients experienced reduced inflammation, healing time and post-procedural pain using a CO2 surgical laser compared to standard surgical instruments. Refinement of the tail docking procedure using a laser may improve piglet welfare by reducing tail docking-associated pain compared to cutting pliers. The objectives of this pilot study were to evaluate the ability of a CO2 surgical laser to 1) reduce pain and 2) improve wound healing of piglets after tail docking. Thirty piglets (male and female; 2 days old) were randomly allocated to one of three treatments (n = 10 piglets/treatment): tail docking with side pliers (SP), tail docking with a CO2 surgical laser (LA) or sham-tail docking (control; CON). Piglet vocalizations were recorded during the tail docking procedure and the maximum frequency, amplitude and energy were quantified. Piglet behavior was recorded for 30 min at baseline and at 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, and 24 h post-procedure. Facial images were collected at the same time points to assess facial grimacing using the Piglet Grimace Scale (PGS). Digital images of the tail tip were taken at baseline and up to 168 h post-procedure for wound healing assessment. Infrared thermography (IRT) images of the tail tip and its surrounding tissues were taken at baseline, 0, 0.5, 8, and 24 h post-procedure to assess inflammation. Blood samples were collected from each piglet at baseline and 0.5 h and saliva samples at baseline, 0.5 and 8 h post-procedure for cortisol analysis. The LA and CON groups elicited calls of higher energy than the SP group (P < 0.0001). Across the assessment period, the SP group had higher grimace scores than the LA group (P = 0.03). Additionally, male piglets grimaced more than female piglets (P = 0.009). A treatment effect was observed for both wound scores and IRT (P < 0.0001). At 0 h the SP group had significantly higher wound scores than the LA and CON group (P < 0.0001). At 0 h, the SP group had a greater temperature difference between the tail tip and surrounding tissue compared to the LA group (P = 0.02). Behavioral indicators of pain were not different between the SP and LA piglets. In conclusion, LA piglets had less tail damage immediately post-procedure and lower facial grimace scores throughout the assessment period, suggesting it may have the utility as a less painful alternative to traditional tail docking with cutting pliers in piglets.

AB  - Clinical and basic science investigation indicates a link between insulin resistance and anhedonia. Previous results of this laboratory point to impaired nucleus accumbens (NAc) insulin signaling as an underpinning of dietinduced anhedonia, based on use of a glucose lick microstructure assay. The present study evaluated whether advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptor (RAGE), known to mediate obesogenic diet-induced inflammation and pathological metabolic conditions, are involved in this behavioral change. Six weeks maintenance of male and female rats on a high fat-high sugar liquid diet (chocolate Ensure) increased body weight gain, and markedly increased circulating insulin and leptin, but induced anhedonia (decreased first minute lick rate and lick burst size) in males only. In these subjects, anhedonia correlated with plasma concentrations of insulin. Although the diet did not alter plasma or NAc AGEs, or the expression of RAGE in the NAc, marginally significant correlations were seen between anhedonia and plasma content of several AGEs and NAc RAGE. Importantly, a small molecule RAGE antagonist, RAGE229, administered twice daily by oral gavage, prevented diet-induced anhedonia. This beneficial effect was associated with improved adipose function, reflected in the adiponectin/leptin ratio, and increased pCREB/total CREB in the NAc, and a shift in the pCREB correlation with pThr34-DARPP-32 from near-zero to strongly positive, such that both phospho-proteins correlated with the rescued hedonic response. This set of findings suggests that the receptor/signaling pathway and cell type underlying the RAGE229-mediated increase in pCREB may mediate anhedonia and its prevention. The possible role of adipose tissue as a locus of diet-induced RAGE signaling, and source of circulating factors that target NAc to modify hedonic reactivity are discussed.

AB  - We have previously demonstrated that pre- and early postnatal malnutrition in sheep induced depot- and sex-specific changes in adipose morphological features, metabolic outcomes, and transcriptome in adulthood, with perirenal (PER) as the major target followed by subcutaneous (SUB) adipose tissue. We aimed to identify coexpressed and hub genes in SUB and PER to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the early nutritional programming of adipose-related phenotypic outcomes. Transcriptomes of SUB and PER of male and female adult sheep with different pre- and early postnatal nutrition histories were used to construct networks of coexpressed genes likely to be functionally associated with pre- and early postnatal nutrition histories and phenotypic traits using weighted gene coexpression network analysis. The modules from PER showed enrichment of cell cycle regulation, gene expression, transmembrane transport, and metabolic processes associated with both sexes' prenatal nutrition. In SUB (only males), a module of enriched adenosine diphosphate metabolism and development correlated with prenatal nutrition. Sex-specific module enrichments were found in PER, such as chromatin modification in the male network but histone modification and mitochondria- and oxidative phosphorylation-related functions in the female network. These sex-specific modules correlated with prenatal nutrition and adipocyte size distribution patterns. Our results point to PER as a primary target of prenatal malnutrition compared to SUB, which played only a minor role. The prenatal programming of gene expression and cell cycle, potentially through epigenetic modifications, might be underlying mechanisms responsible for observed changes in PER expandability and adipocyte-size distribution patterns in adulthood in both sexes.

AB  - Cholinergic degeneration is one of the key pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition that is characterized by synaptic disorders and memory impairments. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is secreted in brain regions that receive projections from the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. The trophic effects of NGF rely on the appropriate maturation of NGF from its precursor, proNGF. The ratio of proNGF/NGF is known to be increased in patients with AD; however, the mechanisms that underlie this observation have yet to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that levels of miR-144-3p are increased in the hippocampi and the medial prefrontal cortex of an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. These mice also exhibited cholinergic degeneration (including the loss of cholinergic fibers, the repression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, the reduction of cholinergic neurons, and an increased number of dystrophic neurites) and synaptic/memory deficits. The elevated expression of miR-144-3p specifically targets the mRNA of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and reduces the expression of tPA, thus resulting in the abnormal maturation of NGF. The administration of miR-144-3p fully replicated the cholinergic degeneration and synaptic/memory deficits observed in the APP/PS1 mice. The injection of an antagomir of miR-144-3p into the hippocampi partially rescued cholinergic degeneration and synaptic/memory impairments by restoring the levels of tPA protein and by correcting the ratio of proNGF/NGF. Collectively, our research revealed potential mechanisms for the disturbance of NGF maturation and cholinergic degeneration in AD and identified a potential therapeutic target for AD.

TI  - Dietary choline metabolite TMAO impairs cognitive function and induces hippocampal synaptic plasticity declining through the mTOR/P70S6K/4EBP1 pathway
T2  - FOOD & FUNCTION
LA  - English
AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate state between "healthy" and "dementia", which affects memory and cognitive function. Timely intervention and treatment of MCI can effectively prevent it from developing into an incurable neurodegenerative disease. Lifestyle factors, such as dietary habits, were highlighted as risk factors for MCI. The effect of a high-choline diet on cognitive function is contentious. In this study, we focus our attention on the choline metabolite trimethylamine-oxide (TMAO), an acknowledged pathogenic molecule of cardiovascular disease (CVD). With recent studies indicating that TMAO also plays a potential role in the central nervous system (CNS), we aim to explore the effect of TMAO on synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, the basic structure of studying and memory. Using various hippocampal-dependent spatial references or working memory-related behavioral texts, we found that TMAO treatment caused both long-term memory (LTM) and short-term memory (STM) deficits in vivo. Simultaneously, the plasm and whole brain levels of choline and TMAO were measured by employing liquid phase mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Furthermore, the effects of TMAO on the hippocampus were further explored by applying Nissl staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins, including synaptophysin (SYN), postsynaptic density protein95 (PSD95), and N-methyl-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), was examined by western blotting and immunohistochemical (IHC). The results showed that TMAO treatment contributes to neuron loss, synapse ultrastructure alteration, and synaptic plasticity impairments. In mechanism, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates synaptic function, and the activation of the mTOR signaling pathway was observed in TMAO groups. In conclusion, this study confirmed that the choline metabolite TMAO can induce hippocampal-dependent learning and memory ability impairment with synaptic plasticity deficits by activating the mTOR signaling pathway. The effects of choline metabolites on cognitive function may provide a theoretical basis for establishing the daily reference intakes (DRIs) of choline.

AB  - The behavioral and neural mechanisms that support spatial cognition have been an enduring interest of psychologists, and much of that enduring interest is attributable to the groundbreaking research of Ken Cheng. One manifestation of this interest, inspired by the idea of studying spatial cognition under natural field conditions, has been research carried out to understand the role of the avian hippocampal formation (HF) in supporting homing pigeon navigation. Emerging from that research has been the conclusion that the role of HF in homing pigeon navigation aligns well with the canonical narrative of a hippocampus important for spatial memory and the implementation of such memories to support navigation. However, recently an accumulation of disparate observations has prompted a rethinking of the avian HF as a structure also important in shaping visual-spatial perception or attention antecedent to any memory processing. In this perspective paper, we summarize field observations contrasting the behavior of intact and HF-lesioned homing pigeons from several studies, based primarily on GPS-recorded flight paths, that support a recharacterization of HF's functional profile to include visual-spatial perception. Although admittedly still speculative, we hope the offered perspective will motivate controlled, experimental-laboratory studies to further test the hypothesis of a HF important for visual-perceptual integration, or scene construction, of landscape elements in support of navigation.

AB  - The massive use of chlorpyrifos (CPF) has been associated with an increased prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Some previous studies have shown that prenatal, but not postnatal, CPF exposure causes social behavior deficits in mice depending on sex while others have found that in transgenic mice models carrying the human apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 3 and epsilon 4 allele confer different vulnerabilities to either behavioral or metabolic disorders after CPF exposure. This study aims to evaluate, in both sexes, how prenatal CPF exposure and APOE genotype impact on social behavior and its relation to changes in GABAergic and glutamatergic systems. For this purpose, apoE3 and apoE4 transgenic mice were exposed through the diet to 0 or 1 mg/kg/day of CPF, between gestational day 12 and 18. A three-chamber test was used to assess social behavior on postnatal day (PND) 45. Then, mice were sacrificed, and hippocampal samples were analyzed to study the gene expression of GABAergic and glutamatergic elements. Results showed that prenatal exposure to CPF impaired social novelty preference and increased the expression of GABA-A alpha 1 subunit in females of both genotypes. In addition, the expression of GAD1, the ionic cotransporter KCC2 and the GABA-A alpha 2 and alpha 5 subunits were increased in apoE3 mice, whereas CPF treatment only accentuated the expression of GAD1 and KCC2. Nevertheless, future research is needed to evaluate whether the influences detected in the GABAergic system are present and functionally relevant in adults and old mice.

AB  - Despite compelling evidence that stress or stress-related hormones influence fear memory consolidation pro-cesses, the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of stress is still fragmentary. The release of corticosterone in response to pre-learning stress exposure has been demonstrated to modulate posi-tively or negatively memory encoding and/or consolidation according to many variables such as stress intensity, the emotional valence of the learned material or the interval between stressful episode and learning experience. Here, we report that contextual but not cued fear memory consolidation was selectively impaired in male mice exposed to a 50 min-period of restraint stress just before the unpaired fear conditioning session. In addition to behavioral impairment, acute stress down-regulated activated/phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) in dorsal hippocampal area CA1 in mice sacrificed 60 min and 9 h after unpaired conditioning. In lateral amygdala, although acute stress by itself increased the level of pERK1/2 it nevertheless blocked the peak of pERK1/2 that was normally observed 15 min after unpaired conditioning. To examine whether stress-induced corticosterone overflow was responsible of these detrimental effects, the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, was administered 30 min before stress exposure. Metyrapone abrogated the stress-induced contextual fear memory deficits but did not alleviate the effects of stress on pERK1/2 and its downstream target phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) in hippocampus CA1 and lateral amygdala. Collectively, our observations suggest that consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memory and the associated signaling pathway are particularly sensitive to stress. However, behavioral normalization by preventive metyrapone treatment was not accompanied by renormali-zation of the canonical signaling pathway. A new avenue would be to consider surrogate mechanisms involving proper metyrapone influence on both nongenomic and genomic actions of glucocorticoid receptors.

AB  - A-esterases are a classical term applied to enzymatic activity of the proteins by a mechanism not involving intermediate covalent phosphorylation, but requiring a divalent cation cofactor. Recently, a copper-dependent Aesterase activity has been identified in goat serum albumin (GSA) on the organophosphorus insecticide trichloronate. This hydrolysis was identified ex vivo with spectrophotometry and chromatography techniques. Albumin mechanism of action and catalytic site as Cu2+-dependent A-esterase are still unknown. Therefore, to know the copper bind to albumin is relevant. N-terminal sequence has been reported as the high affinity site for this cation, due to the histidine in position 3. The aim of this work in silico is to explore how occurs this metallic binding and active the esterase catalytic function. The GSA crystallized structure (PDB: 5ORI) was chosen for molecular docking and dynamics. A site-directed docking, for N-terminal site and a blind docking was done with trichloronate as ligand. Root-mean-square deviation and frequency plot was calculated to find the most frequent predicted structure and visualize the amino acids involved in binding site. The affinity energy in the blind docking (-5.80 kcal/mol) is almost twice lower than site-directed docking (-3.81 kcal/mol) and N-terminal amino acids do not appear in the most repeated structure binding site, suggesting that the protein has a site with higher affinity to the trichloronate ligand. His145 could be involved in the binding site as has been reported in previous studies.

AB  - Simple Summary Chronic heat-stress exposure directly affects broiler immune response. Immunosuppression was demonstrated in broiler exposed to chronic heat stress with deterioration in humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Natural immune modulator material is considered as a safe material for human consumption of poultry products. Citrullus colocynthis (CC) is a natural herb plant that has traditionally been used in folk remediation. Anti-diabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory attributes are some of the CC medical properties. The present study aims to investigate the immune modulator potentials of CC seeds supplementation to chronically heat- stressed-exposed broilers. Results demonstrated that CC seeds supplementation to heat-stressed broilers was able to alleviate the negative impacts of heat stress on broiler immune responses and antioxidant status. Thus, CC seeds are suggested to be added to broilers reared under heat stress in order to improve the immune response and consequently ameliorate productivity. There is an extensive search for natural products that can be introduced to broiler rations to improve performance, especially during the unfavorable breeding conditions. Under heat-stress conditions, the immune response seriously deteriorates, which consequently impairs broiler production performance. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the potentials of Citrullus colocynthis seeds (CCs) supplementation to modulate the immune response of broilers subjected to chronic heat stress. A total of 300 Cobb-500 male broiler chickens aged 21 days were randomly divided into two equal groups and reared under either thermo-neutral condition (24 +/- 1 degrees C) or subjected to cyclic heat stress (34 +/- 1 degrees C for 8 h). Each group was further divided into two groups (5 replicate x 15 chicks) and was fed either the basal diet or the basal diet with 0.1% CCs supplementation. The results showed that heat stress impaired the production performance by lowering the final body weight and feed intake as well as impairing feed conversion. The levels of stress markers (i.e., malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and corticosterone) increased (p < 0.05), whereas the activity of antioxidant enzymes decreased in broilers exposed to heat stress. Further, heat stress caused direct suppression of broiler humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. The stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes proliferation, as well as the antibody titer against sheep red blood cells, were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by heat-stress exposure. However, CCs supplementation to broilers subjected to heat stress improved (p < 0.05) the final body weight, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio (FCR), compared to the non-supplemented stressed group. The cellular and cell-mediated immune response indicators significantly enhanced (p < 0.05) with CCs supplementation. Supplementation of CCs to broilers reared under similar environmental conditions elevated the total white blood cells (TWBCs) count and the broiler stimulating index of T and B lymphocytes. It can be concluded that CC seeds can be effectively used to stimulate the immune response and improve the production performance of broilers reared under heat-stress condition.

AB  - In a variety of species and behavioral contexts, learning and memory formation recruits two neural systems, with initial plasticity in one system being consolidated into the other over time. Moreover, consolidation is known to be selective; that is, some experiences are more likely to be consolidated into long-term memory than others. Here, we propose and analyze a model that captures common computational principles underlying such phenomena. The key component of this model is a mechanism by which a long-term learning and memory system prioritizes the storage of synaptic changes that are consistent with prior updates to the short-term system. This mechanism, which we refer to as recall-gated consolidation, has the effect of shielding long-term memory from spurious synaptic changes, enabling it to focus on reliable signals in the environment. We describe neural circuit implementations of this model for different types of learning problems, including supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and autoassociative memory storage. These implementations involve synaptic plasticity rules modulated by factors such as prediction accuracy, decision confidence, or familiarity. We then develop an analytical theory of the learning and memory performance of the model, in comparison to alternatives relying only on synapse-local consolidation mechanisms. We find that recall-gated consolidation provides significant advantages, substantially amplifying the signal-to-noise ratio with which memories can be stored in noisy environments. We show that recall-gated consolidation gives rise to a number of phenomena that are present in behavioral learning paradigms, including spaced learning effects, task-dependent rates of consolidation, and differing neural representations in short- and long-term pathways.

AB  - Understanding the relationships between cognitive abilities and fitness is integral to an evolutionary study of brain and behavior. However, these relationships are often difficult to measure and detect. Here we draw upon an opportunistic sample of brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) subjects that had two separate research experiences: First, they engaged in a large series of cognitive tests in David Sherry's Lab in the Advanced Facility for Avian Research (AFAR) at Western University, then subsequently moved to the Field Avian Research Megalab (FARM) at Wilfrid Laurier University where they lived in large breeding flocks in aviaries with other wild-caught cowbirds. Thus, we had extensive measures of cognitive abilities, breeding behavior, and reproductive success for these birds. We report here, for the fist time, the surprisingly strong connections we found among these different measures. Female cowbirds' spatial cognitive abilities correlated positively with how intensely they were courted by males, and with their overall egg production. Males' spatial cognition correlated positively with their ability to engage in singing contests ("countersinging") with other males. In addition, a separate non-spatial cognitive ability correlated positively with the attractiveness of the songs they sung. In sum, these results suggest the cognitive skills assessed in the lab were strongly connected to breeding behavior and reproductive success. Moreover, since certain cognitive abilities related to different aspects of breeding success, it suggests that cognitive modules may have specialized adaptive value, but also that these specialized skills may interact and influence fitness in surprising ways.

AB  - Currently, allergic rhinitis (AR) is the most common allergic disease worldwide. AR is defined as immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated chronic inflammatory disease of the upper airways. It characterizes by symptoms like nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and sneezing. The immune system and genetic susceptibility in the interaction with the environment lead to the development of AR. Many cytokines, chemokines and cells maintain allergic inflammation. Studies show that 10% to 30% of the adult population are affected, and that prevalence rates are increasing world widely. AR, nasal polyps (NP), as well as chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are all associated with eosinophilic infiltration and large quantities of mast cells (MCs) within the mucosa. The diagnosis and management of chronic sinonasal diseases involves the analysis of eosinophilic infiltration, MCs, and their markers eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) and tryptase. Regarding nasal cancer, nasal allergies were found to exhibit a dual function: immune surveillance may help in the defense against malignant cells, but an opposite effect is observed in tissues with chronic stimulation and inflammation. In the present paper, we studied a group of 70 patients diagnosed with AR and NP, rhinosinusitis or nasal cancer, admitted to the Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT) Clinic of the Emergency City Hospital, Timisoara, Romania, between January 2016 and December 2020, and we identified 37 (53%) patients diagnosed with AR and NP, 25 (36%) patients diagnosed with AR and rhinosinusitis, and eight (11%) patients diagnosed with AR and nasal cancer. The average age of the patients was 53 years old. Every patient included in the study was histopathologically and immunohistochemically diagnosed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well established that in cryosurgery some cells can survive one freeze thaw cycle and that surviving cells are found at the margin of the frozen lesion. Numerous techniques are being developed to ensure the survival of frozen cells to the margin of the frozen region. OBJECTIVE: We thought that it would be of fundamental interest to observe the pattern of cell survival in a liver treated with one freeze-thaw cycle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed six ultrasound-guided single freeze-thaw cryosurgery procedures on the liver of four Landrace pigs, using two cryosurgery probes separated by 25 mm inserted in parallel. Treated organs were removed 24 hours after the cryosurgery and processed for histology with hematoxylin and eosin. The tissues were analyzed with a digital slice scanner. RESULTS: We found an unexpected pattern of cell survival; sheets of live cells, about 200 ??m in width, that follow the network of interlobular connective tissue septae to a distance of several millimeter from the outer edge of the one freeze-thaw cycle cryosurgery treated lesion. The sheets of live cells surround lobule cores that have undergone complete coagulative necrosis. In addition, larger blood vessels, as far as 5 mm from the outer rim of the treated lesion, have a major and complex effect on cell survival with large areas of completely necrotic and completely alive cells intermixed. CONCLUSION: This study may have value as a baseline for developing new cryosurgery protocols designed to ablate cells to the margin of the frozen lesion.

AB  - Animals and humans have multiple memory systems. While both black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) are under selective pressure to remember reliable long-term spatial locations (habit memory), chickadees must additionally quickly form and rapidly update spatial memory for unique cache sites (one-trial memory). We conducted a series of three experiments in which we assessed the degree to which habit and one-trial memory were expressed in both species as a function of training context. In Experiment 1, birds failed to demonstrate habits on probe trials after being trained in the context of a biased Match-to-Sample task in which the same high-frequency target was always correct. In Experiment 2, habit strongly controlled performance when habits were learned as Discriminations, defining a specific training context. In Experiment 3, context no longer defined when to express habits and habit and one-trial memory competed for control of behavior. Across all experiments, birds preferentially used the memory system at test that was consistent with the context in which it was acquired. Although the memory adaptations that allow chickadees to successfully recover cached food might predispose them to favor one-trial memory, we found no species differences in the weighting of habit and one-trial memory. In the experiments here, context was a powerful factor controlling the interaction of memory systems.

AB  - The lower Meghna River, the easternmost part of the Ganges Delta, faces severe anthropogenic perturbations as it receives a huge discharge and industrial effluents. To measure the metal concentrations and human health hazards, edible tissues of 15 commercially important fish species were collected from the local fish markets and the lower Meghna River, Bangladesh. Trace and heavy metals such as Pb, Cr, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe, Hg, Ni, Ca, Co, Se, Rb, Sr, and As were detected using the Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) method. The hierarchy of mean metal concentrations obtained was: Fe (162.198 mg/kg) > Zn (113.326 mg/kg) > Ca (87.828 mg/kg) > Sr (75.139 mg/kg) > Cu (36.438 mg/kg) > Se (9.087 mg/kg) > Cr (7.336 mg/kg) > Mn (6.637 mg/kg) > Co (3.474 mg/kg) > Rb (1.912 mg/kg) > Hg (1.657 mg/kg) > Ni (1.467 mg/kg) > Pb (0.521 mg/kg) > As (BDL). Based on the metal concentration obtained, the carnivorous species contained more metals than omnivores and herbivores. Similarly, the euryhaline and benthic feeder fishes had more metals than the stenohalines and demersal fishes. The metal pollution index (MPI) suggested that the highly consumed fish species Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) and Rui (Labeo rohita) accumulated higher metals than other fishes. Both the Targeted Hazard Quotient (THQ) and Hazard Index (HI) values for adult and child consumers were <1, indicating that consumers would not experience the non-carcinogenic health effects. Although children were more susceptible than adults, carcinogenic risk (CR) exposure of Cr for all the consumers was found in the acceptable range (10(-6) to 10(-4)), but the CR exposure of Pb was negligible for all the consumers. The correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), and cluster analysis were conducted to identify the sources of metals identified from the fish tissue. The results indicated that the probable sources of the pollutants were anthropogenic, arising from agricultural activities, electroplating materials, and lubricants used near the study area. However, the present study showed a different metal concentration in the samples at different levels but within the threshold levels non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks; hence, the fishes of the area, in general, are safe for human consumption.

AB  - Vivid episodic memories in humans have been described as the replay of the flow of past events in sequential order. Recently, Panoz-Brown et al. Current Biology, 28, 1628-1634, (2018) developed an olfactory memory task in which rats were presented with a list of trial-unique odors in an encoding context; next, in a distinctive memory assessment context, the rats were rewarded for choosing the second to last item from the list while avoiding other items from the list. In a different memory assessment context, the fourth to last item was rewarded. According to the episodic memory replay hypothesis, the rat remembers the list items and searches these items to find the item at the targeted locations in the list. However, events presented sequentially differ in memory trace strength, allowing a rat to use the relative familiarity of the memory traces, instead of episodic memory replay, to solve the task. Here, we directly manipulated memory trace strength by manipulating the odor intensity of target odors in both the list presentation and memory assessment. The rats relied on episodic memory replay to solve the memory assessment in conditions in which reliance on memory trace strength is ruled out. We conclude that rats are able to replay episodic memories.

AB  - Automated animal activity recognition (AAR) has advanced greatly through recent advances in sensing technologies and deep learning, and improved livestock management efficiency, animal health, and welfare monitoring. In practical automated AAR systems where animals need to be monitored over a long period, the sampling rate dramatically affects the energy consumption and battery life of sensing devices due to continuous data collection and transmission. Considering real-world benefits, existing works have often lowered the sampling rate to reduce energy costs. However, when the sampling rate falls below a threshold, the AAR performance degrades rapidly due to many relevant signals being missed. Therefore, this study proposed a novel method, dubbed teacher-to-student information recovery (T2S-IR), to improve the performance of AAR at low sampling rates. This approach effectively leverages the knowledge obtained from high-sampling-rate data, to assist in recovering the missing information in features extracted by the classification network trained on low-samplingrate data. The workflow of the T2S-IR contains two main steps. (1) we utilize high-sampling-rate data for training teacher classification and reconstruction networks sequentially. (2) Then, we train a student classification network using low-sampling-rate data, while promoting its performance by exploiting the knowledge learned by trained teacher networks via two novel modules, namely the reconstruction-based information recovery (RIR) module and the correlation-distillation-based information recovery (CDIR) module. Specifically, the RIR module employs the pretrained teacher reconstruction network to enforce the student classification network to learn complete and descriptive features. The CDIR module enforces the feature maps of student network to mimic internal correlations within feature maps of pretrained teacher classification network along temporal and sensor axes directions. To validate our proposed T2S-IR, we conducted experiments on two public datasets acquired for horses and goats using triaxial accelerometers and gyroscopes with an initial sampling rate of 100 Hz. Data having low sampling rates were obtained by downsampling the original data at different frequencies (i.e., 50, 25, 12.5, 10, 5, and 2 Hz). The results demonstrated that our method remarkably boosted the classification network trained on low-sampling-rate data (e.g., percentage-point increments in the precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy of 3.33%, 3.58%, 3.45%, and 2.19%, respectively, for the 12.5-Hz horse data and 7.6%, 4.44%, 6.9%, and 0.79%, respectively, for the 5-Hz goat data) while outperforming existing knowledge distillation methods. The enhanced classification network can be directly applied in practical AAR tasks with low sampling rates, significantly beneficial for scenarios with constrained energy sources for wearable devices.

AB  - Retinal degenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide, and legal blindness is generally associated with the loss of cone photoreceptors located in the central region of the retina called the macula. Currently, there is no treatment to replace the macula. Addressing this unmet need, we employed control isogenic and hypoimmunogenic induced pluripotent stem cell lines to generate spontaneously polarized retinal sheets (RSs). RSs were enriched in retinal progenitor and cone precursor cells, which could differentiate into mature S- and M/L-cones in long-term cultures. Single-cell RNAseq analysis showed that RSs recapitulate the ontogeny of the developing human retina. Isolation of neural rosettes for sub-retinal transplantation effectively eliminated unwanted cells such as RPE cells. In a porcine model of chemically induced retinal degeneration, grafts integrated the host retina and formed a new, yet immature, photoreceptor layer. In one transplanted animal, functional and immunohistochemical assays suggest that grafts exhibited responsiveness to light stimuli and established putative synaptic connections with host bipolar neurons. This study underscores the potential and challenges of RSs for clinical applications.

AB  - Rodent and human data implicate the hippocampus in the arbitration of approach-avoidance conflict (AAC), which arises when an organism is confronted with a stimulus associated simultaneously with reward and punishment. Yet, the precise contributions of this structure are underexplored, particularly with respect to the decision-making processes involved. We assessed humans with hippocampal damage and matched neurologically healthy controls on a computerized AAC paradigm in which participants first learned whether individual visual images were associated with the reward or loss of game points and were then asked to approach or avoid pairs of stimuli with non-conflicting or conflicting valences. To assess hippocampal involvement more broadly in response conflict, we also administered a Stroop and a Go/No-go task. On the AAC paradigm, following similar learning outcomes in individuals with hippocampal damage and matched controls, both participant groups approached positive and negative image pairs at the same rate but critically, those with hippocampal damage approached conflict pairs more often than controls. Choice and response AAC data were interrogated using the hierarchical drift diffusion model, which revealed that, compared to controls, individuals with hippocampal damage were more biased towards approach, required less evidence to make a decision during conflict trials, and were slower to accumulate evidence towards avoidance when confronted with conflicting image pairs. No significant differences were found between groups in performance accuracy or response time on the response conflict tasks. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of the hippocampus to the evidence accumulation processes supporting value-based decision-making under motivational conflict.

AB  - Introduction The long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) gene is a retrotransposon whose methylation status appears to play a role in spermatogenesis, the outcome of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), and even in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Advanced paternal age appears associated with altered sperm parameters, RPL, poor ART outcomes, and compromised offspring health. The methylation status of LINE1 has been reported to be affected by age. The latest meta-analysis on the LINE1 methylation pattern in spermatozoa found no significant differences in methylation levels between infertile patients and fertile controls. However, to the best of our knowledge, no updated meta-analysis on this topic has been published recently. Furthermore, no comprehensive meta-regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between sperm LINE1 methylation pattern and age.Objectives To provide an updated and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis on sperm LINE1 gene methylation degree in patients with abnormal sperm parameters compared to men with normal sperm parameters and to probe the association between sperm LINE1 methylation status and age and/or sperm concentration.Methods This meta-analysis was registered in PROSPERO (registration n. CRD42023397056). It was performed according to the MOOSE guidelines for Meta-analyses and Systematic Reviews of Observational Studies and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Only original articles evaluating LINE1 gene methylation in spermatozoa from patients with infertility or abnormalities in one or more sperm parameters compared to fertile or normozoospermic men were included.Results Of 192 abstracts evaluated for eligibility, only 5 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis, involving a total of 340 patients and 150 controls. Our analysis showed no significant difference in LINE1 gene methylation degree in patients with infertility and/or abnormal sperm parameters compared to fertile controls and/or men with normal sperm parameters, although there was significant heterogeneity across studies. No significant evidence of publication bias was found, and no study was sensitive enough to alter the results. In meta-regression analysis, we found that the results were independent of both ages and sperm concentration. A sub-analysis examining patients and controls separately was also conducted and we found a trend for a positive correlation between LINE1 methylation and sperm concentration in the control group only.Conclusions The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis do not suggest a determining role of sperm LINE1 gene methylation degree in patients with infertility and/or abnormal sperm parameters. Therefore, we do not suggest including LINE1 in the genetic panel of prospective studies aimed at identifying the most representative and cost-effective genes to be analyzed in couples undergoing ART cycles.

AB  - There is currently a limited understanding of the effect of food structure on physical breakdown and gastric emptying of solid starch-based foods during gastric digestion. Moisture uptake, pH, particle size, rheological, and textural properties of six solid starch-based diets from different sources (Durum wheat and high amylose white rice) and of different macrostructures (porridge, native grain, agglomerate/couscous, and noodle) were monitored during 240 min of gastric digestion in a growing pig model. Changes in the physical properties of the gastric digesta were attributed to the influence of gastric secretions and gastric emptying, which were both dependent on the buffering capacity and initial macrostructure of the diets. Differences between the proximal and distal stomach regions were found in the intragastric pH and texture of the gastric digesta. For example, rice couscous, which had the smallest particle size and highest buffering capacity among the rice-based diets, had the shortest gastric emptying half-time and no significant differences between proximal and distal stomach digesta physical properties. Additionally, a relationship between gastric breakdown rate, expressed as gastric softening half-time from texture analysis, and gastric emptying half-time of dry matter was also observed. These findings provide new insights into the breakdown processes of starch-based solid foods in the stomach, which can be beneficial for the development of food structures with controlled rates of breakdown and gastric emptying during digestion.

   In this work, we provide a platform for nasal tissue regeneration, consisting of poly(vinyl alcohol)/gelatin sponges and mesodermal progenitor cells as a single stem cell source for connective and vascular tissues. These scaffolds show promise for application in rhinoplasty, as well as nasal tissue reconstruction following sinonasal tumor resection.
   Need for regeneration and repair of nasal tissues occurs as a consequence of several pathologies affecting the nose, including, but not limited to infective diseases, traumas and tumor resections. A platform for nasal tissue regeneration was set up using poly(vinyl alcohol)/gelatin sponges with 20%-30% (w/w) gelatin content to be used as scaffolds, for their intrinsic hydrophilic, cell adhesive and shape recovery properties. We propose mesodermal progenitor cells (MPCs) isolated from the bone marrow as a unique stem cell source for obtaining different connective tissues of the nose, including vascular tissue. Finally, epithelial cell immune response to these scaffolds was assessed in vitro in an environment containing inflammatory molecules. The results showed that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) deriving from MPCs could be used to differentiate into cartilage and fibrous tissue; whereas, in combination with endothelial cells still deriving from MPCs, into pre-vascularized bone. Finally, the scaffold did not significantly alter the epithelial cell response to inflammatory insults derived from interaction with bacterial molecules.

AB  - Recent evidence suggested that autologous concentrated growth factor (CGF), a new bioactive compound from autologous blood is used widely as an ingenious biomaterial in tissue regeneration with anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated whether CGF could be involved in the treatment of fistula healing in the anal fistula. For this purpose, the porcine anal fistula model was conducted using the rubber band ligation method and collected pig autogenic CGF to treat the fistulas. CGF treatment promoted fistula healing, which was reflected in the downregulation of inflammatory factors, upregulation of growth factors, and promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition with increased collagen synthesis. Besides, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of fistula tissues between the control and CGF groups showed that the microbial populations exhibiting significant differences were VadinCA02, Blastomonas, Deinococcus, Devosia, Sphingomonas, Rubrobacteria, and GW_34. CGF of volunteers were collected to process small interfering RNA- (siRNA-) ERK or siRNA-negative control transfected human skin fibroblasts (HSF). The results showed that CGF also promoted the proliferation and extracellular matrix-related functions in HSF, as well as activated the MEK/ERK pathway in vitro and in vivo. Finally, knockdown ERK reversed the effects of CGF in promoting wound healing in HSF. Collectively, our results suggest that the CGF as the bioactive compound from autologous blood exhibited great potential for repairing fistulas as well as promoting the proliferation and migration of human skin fibroblasts by triggering MEK/ERK signaling. These findings provided a fresh perspective for understanding the role of CGF in the management of fistulas.

AB  - Inflammation in the female reproductive system causes serious health problems including infertility. The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-beta/delta (PPAR beta/delta) ligands on the transcriptomic profile of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated pig corpus luteum (CL) in the mid-luteal phase of the estrous cycle using RNA-seq technology. The CL slices were incubated in the presence of LPS or in combination with LPS and the PPAR beta/delta agonist-GW0724 (1 mu mol/L or 10 mu mol/L) or the antagonist-GSK3787 (25 mu mol/L). We identified 117 differentially expressed genes after treatment with LPS; 102 and 97 differentially expressed genes after treatment, respectively, with the PPAR beta/delta agonist at a concentration of 1 mu mol/L or 10 mu mol/L, as well as 88 after the treatment with the PPAR beta/delta antagonist. In addition, biochemical analyses of oxidative status were performed (total antioxidant capacity and activity of peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione S-transferase). This study revealed that PPAR beta/delta agonists regulate genes involved in the inflammatory response in a dose-dependent manner. The results indicate that the lower dose of GW0724 showed an anti-inflammatory character, while the higher dose seems to be pro-inflammatory. We propose that GW0724 should be considered for further research to alleviate chronic inflammation (at the lower dose) or to support the natural immune response against pathogens (at the higher dose) in the inflamed corpus luteum.

AB  - Populations of roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) in southern Africa have experienced a drastic decline over the past few decades and this situation has led to the development of intensive breeding programmes to support conservation efforts. However, little is known about related welfare aspects, including stress-related physiological biomarkers. The present study set out to establish a non-invasive method to monitor faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as a measure of stress and determine fGCM concentrations in relation to male reproductive activity and female reproductive status in the roan antelope. An adrenocorticotrophic hormone challenge was performed using two adult roan antelope (one male and one female) at Lapalala Wilderness Nature Reserve, South Africa, to determine the suitability of five enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for monitoring adrenocortical function in roan antelope. An 11-oxoaetiocholanolone I EIA detecting 11,17 dioxoandrostanes performed best showing 17-20 folds increases in fGCM concentrations after 12 h-17 h post-injection. The identified EIA was then used to monitor fGCM concentrations during active and non-active reproductive periods in males (n = 3), and during periods of cyclicity, gestation, and postpartum in females (n = 10). Males showed an overall 80% increase in fGCM concentrations when reproductively active and females showed a progressively significant increase in fGCM levels throughout pregnancy, with overall fGCM concentrations being 1.5 to 2.6-fold higher than the respective fGCM concentrations during periods of postpartum and cyclicity, respectively. Furthermore, fGCM concentrations remained above baseline for up to 21 days post-partum. A correlation between ecological parameters (rainfall and temperature) and fGCM concentrations revealed elevated fGCM concentrations during the dry season for males, but not females. The non-invasive method validated in this study provides a valuable tool to quantify stress-related biomarkers in roan antelope, and findings can be used to support management decisions in conservation breeding facilities.

AB  - Chemical synapses exhibit a diverse array of internal mechanisms that affect the dynamics of transmission efficacy. Many of these processes, such as release of neurotransmitter and vesicle recycling, depend strongly on activity-dependent influx and accumulation of Ca2+. To model how each of these processes may affect the processing of information in neural circuits, and how their dysfunction may lead to disease states, requires a computationally efficient modelling framework, capable of generating accurate phenomenology without incurring a heavy computational cost per synapse. Constructing a phenomenologically realistic model requires the precise characterization of the timing and probability of neurotransmitter release. Difficulties arise in that functional forms of instantaneous release rate can be difficult to extract from noisy data without running many thousands of trials, and in biophysical synapses, facilitation of per-vesicle release probability is confounded by depletion. To overcome this, we obtained traces of free Ca2+ concentration in response to various action potential stimulus trains from a molecular MCell model of a hippocampal Schaffer collateral axon. Ca2+ sensors were placed at varying distance from a voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) cluster, and Ca2+ was buffered by calbindin. Then, using the calcium traces to drive deterministic state vector models of synaptotagmin 1 and 7 (Syt-1/7), which respectively mediate synchronous and asynchronous release in excitatory hippocampal synapses, we obtained high-resolution profiles of instantaneous release rate, to which we applied functional fits. Synchronous vesicle release occurred predominantly within half a micron of the source of spike-evoked Ca2+ influx, while asynchronous release occurred more consistently at all distances. Both fast and slow mechanisms exhibited multi-exponential release rate curves, whose magnitudes decayed exponentially with distance from the Ca2+ source. Profile parameters facilitate on different time scales according to a single, general facilitation function. These functional descriptions lay the groundwork for efficient mesoscale modelling of vesicular release dynamics.

AB  - Maintaining the stability of human body temperature is the basis of ensuring the normal life activities of witness, and the emergence of various functional clothing is committed to assisting the human body temperature in thermal comfort range in the changeable environment. However, achieve dual-mode thermal regulation for cooling and insulation on an integrated material without energy input and addition of functional particles has thus far been a huge challenge. Herein, a biomimetic camel-fur designed micro-extruded physically foamed porous elastic fiber (MEPF) using thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer as raw material is reported, and its dual-layered fabric (MEPFT-d) for effective personal thermal comfortable management at extreme temperature differences. Benefit from its micro-nano-pores structure, MEPFT-d represents radiate cooling capacity by high solar reflectance and emissivity, behaves low thermal conductivity delaying heat scattering, and promotes evaporative cooling by unidirectional water transport. These excellent properties ensure that MEPFT-d reduces heat loss in cold weather (7.2 degrees C higher than cotton) and blocks outside heat in hot weather (10.2 degrees C lower than cotton), which is suitable for various complex outdoor scenes. The cost-effectiveness and superior wearing comfort of this work provide innovative pathways for sustainable energy, smart textiles, and personal thermal comfort applications.
   Existing personal thermal regulation materials fall short of meeting the demands for sustainable all-climate wide range temperature management. Herein, an elastic porous fiber and its fabric are developed by micro-extrusion physical foaming method, which not only has excellent radiation cooling performance and evaporative cooling function, but also has good thermal insulation effect. This work provides an effective strategy for mass-prepared fabrics for personal thermal regulation of extreme temperatures. image

AB  - Cobalt is an environmental toxicant, and excessive bodily exposure can damage the nervous system. Particularly, our previous study reported that low-dose cobalt (significantly less than the safety threshold) is still able to induce neuro-degenerative changes. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still insufficient revealed. Herein, we further investigate the molecular mechanism between cobalt-induced neurodegeneration and autophagy, as well as explore the interplay between hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and autophagy in cobalt-exposed mice and human neuroglioma cells. We first reveal cobalt as an environmental toxicant to severely in-duce f3 amyloid (Af3) deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and dysregulated autophagy in the hippocampus and cor-tex of mice. In particular, we further identify that cobalt-induced neurotoxicity is triggered by the impairment of autophagic flux in vitro experiments. Moreover, the mechanistic study reveals that cobalt exposure extremely activates HIF-1 alpha expression to facilitate the overproduction of ROS. Then, elevated ROS can target the amino-threonine kinase (AKT)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) signaling pathway to participate in cobalt-induced impairment of autophagic flux. Subsequently, defected autophagy further exacerbates cobalt-induced neurotoxicity for its unable to eliminate the deposition of pathological protein. Therefore, our data provide scientific evidence for cobalt safety evaluation and risk assessment and propose a breakthrough for under-standing the regulatory relationship between HIF-1a, ROS, and autophagy in cobalt-induced neurodegeneration.

AB  - A ketogenic diet (KD) has been promoted as an obesity management diet, yet its underlying mechanism re-mains elusive. Here we show that KD reduces energy intake and body weight in humans, pigs, and mice, accompanied by elevated circulating growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). In GDF15-or its receptor GFRAL-deficient mice, these effects of KD disappeared, demonstrating an essential role of GDF15-GFRAL signaling in KD-mediated weight loss. Gdf15 mRNA level increases in hepatocytes upon KD feeding, and knockdown of Gdf15 by AAV8 abrogated the obesity management effect of KD in mice, corroborating a he-patic origin of GDF15 production. We show that KD activates hepatic PPARg, which directly binds to the reg-ulatory region of Gdf15, increasing its transcription and production. Hepatic Pparg-knockout mice show low levels of plasma GDF15 and significantly diminished obesity management effects of KD, which could be restored by either hepatic Gdf15 overexpression or recombinant GDF15 administration. Collectively, our study reveals a previously unexplored GDF15-dependent mechanism underlying KD-mediated obesity man-agement.

AB  - Restricted by synaptic plasticity, dopamine receptor (DR) upregulation takes a long time to work. Moreover, the impact of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on delivery efficiency restricts the development of drugs. Taking inspiration from snuff bottles, a convenient, fast-acting, and nonaddictive nasal drug delivery system has been developed to rapidly reshape the balance of synaptic transmitters. This optical and magnetic response system called CFs@DP, comprised of carbonized MIL-100 (Fe) frameworks (CFs) and domperidone (DP), which can enter the brain via nasal administration. Under dual stimulation of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation and catecholamine-induced complexation, CFs@DP disintegrates to release iron ions and DP, causing upregulation of the dopamine type 1 (D1), type 2 (D2) receptors, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to achieve a therapeutic effect. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the DR density of mice (postnatal day 50-60) increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) after 10 days of therapy, resulting in antidepressant-like and cognitive enhancement effects. Interestingly, the cognitive enhancement effect of CFs@DP is even working in noniron deficiency (normal fed) mice, making it a promising candidate for application in enhancing learning ability.
   Inspired from snuff bottle, a nasal delivery system with the combination of iron supplementation and a peripheral D2 receptor antagonist is developed for dopamine receptors upregulation which can solve a variety of mental disorders (such as depression, anxiety, and addiction) and improve cognition of patients. image

AB  - The analysis of neurons that exhibit receptive fields dependent on an organism's spatial location, such as grid, place or boundary cells typically begins by mapping their activity in space using firing rate maps. However, mapping approaches are varied and depend on multiple tuning parameters that are usually chosen qualitatively by the experimenter and thus vary significantly across studies. Small changes in parameters such as these can impact results significantly, yet, to date a quantitative investigation of firing rate maps has not been attempted. Using simulated datasets, we examined how tuning parameters, recording duration and firing field size affect the accuracy of spatial maps generated using the most widely used approaches. For each approach we found a clear subset of parameters which yielded low-error firing rate maps and isolated the parameters yielding 1) the least error possible and 2) the Pareto-optimal parameter set which balanced error, computation time, place field detection accuracy and the extrapolation of missing values. Smoothed bivariate histograms and averaged shifted histograms were consistently associated with the fastest computation times while still providing accurate maps. Adaptive smoothing and binning approaches were found to compensate for low positional sampling the most effectively. Kernel smoothed density estimation also compensated for low sampling well and resulted in accurate maps, but it was also among the slowest methods tested. Overall, the bivariate histogram, coupled with spatial smoothing, is likely the most desirable method in the majority of cases.
   Spatially modulated neurons in the brain increase their activity when an animal visits specific regions of its environment. Studying these neurons often begins with the creation of a firing rate map: a statistical representation of the cell's activity in space. Different methods, relying on different parameters, are commonly used to generate these maps. These parameters can have a huge impact on the maps created and, in turn, any results derived from them. Yet, very little quantification of these parameters has been attempted and they are almost universally chosen based on qualitative, study-dependent assessments. In this paper we quantify the 'best' combinations of parameters for each method and provide a way for researchers to calculate these for their own data. Using parameters that are both consistent across studies and quantifiably demonstrated to be the most accurate will reduce the variability between future studies while improving the validity of their results.

AB  - Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important type of pathogenic bacteria that causes diarrhea in humans and young livestock. The pathogen has a high morbidity and mortality rate, resulting in significant economic losses in the pig industry. To effectively prevent piglet diarrhea, we developed a new tetravalent genetically engineered vaccine that specifically targets ETEC. To eliminate the natural toxin activity of ST1 enterotoxin and enhance the preventive effect of the vaccine, the mutated ST (1) , K88ac, K99, and LT (B) genes were amplified by PCR and site-specific mutation techniques. The recombinant strain BL21(DE3)(pXKK3SL) was constructed and achieved high expression. Animal experiments showed that the inactivated vaccine had eliminated the natural toxin activity of ST1. The immune protection test demonstrated that the inclusion body and inactivated vaccine exhibited a positive immune effect. The protection rates of the inclusion body group and inactivated vaccine group were 96 and 98%, respectively, when challenged with 1 minimum lethal dose, indicating that the constructed K88ac-K99-3ST(1)-LTB vaccine achieved a strong immune effect. Additionally, the minimum immune doses for mice and pregnant sows were determined to be 0.2 and 2 mL, respectively. This study suggests that the novel K88ac-K99-3ST(1)-LTB vaccine has a wide immune spectrum and can prevent diarrhea caused by ETEC through enterotoxin and fimbrial pathways. The aforementioned research demonstrates that the K88ac-K99-3ST(1)-LTB vaccine offers a new genetically engineered vaccine that shows potential for preventing diarrhea in newborn piglets.

AB  - Despite improvements in treatment options and techniques, articular cartilage (AC) repair continues to be a challenge for orthopedic surgeons. The use of osteochondral allografts for AC repair is currently limited by the availability and short shelf life of donor cartilage. AC vitrification-which is an ice-free cryopreservation technology-will increase the availability of viable graft tissue for large joint defects. Although different protocols have been developed for AC vitrification, it is still unknown if vitrified and fresh osteochondral grafts are equivalent in terms of long-term joint resurfacing efficacy. In the present study, we compared the ability of vitrified porcine osteochondral dowels to repair full thickness cartilage defects to that of fresh porcine osteochondral dowels kept for 21 days at 4 degrees C. Eighteen pigs were randomly assigned to three experimental groups according to the kind of osteochondral dowel they received transplanted to medial femoral condyles: Long-Term Vitrified osteochondral dowel group (n = 6), Short-Term Vitrified osteochondral dowel group (n = 6), and Fresh osteochondral dowel group (n = 6). Lameness score was evaluated before and after transplantation surgery. Animals were euthanized 6 months after transplantation to obtain medial femoral condyles, and the contralateral condyle was used as the positive (no defect) control. Samples were evaluated for macroscopic appearance, morphometric-microstructural measures of bone, chondrocyte density, proteoglycan distribution, and repair tissue quality. The overall repair quality in all grafts (including fresh controls) was incomplete likely due to the animal model and surgical technique. In the areas where repair was documented, this study demonstrated that the repair effect of vitrified transplanted dowels (both Long-Term and Short-Term) was equivalent to that of the Fresh dowels that were stored for 21 days at 4 degrees C when comparing lameness scores, quality of regenerated cartilage based on direct visualization of the gross appearance (ICRS Scores), chondrocyte density, proteoglycan distribution within the extracellular matrix, morphometric measures of bone quantity and microstructural quality, and microscopic histological characteristics of the repair tissue. The vitrification of osteochondral dowels will mitigate the short shelf life of commonly used fresh osteochondral transplants, significantly increasing their availability for use by physicians and patients.

AB  - Cities in which the synurbization of some important predators began simultaneously with, or earlier than, the synurbization of prey species are a precious tool for studying the specificity of predator-prey interactions in urban landscapes. The city of Moscow is an excellent example. The following bird species can be considered synurbic in the city: Tadorna ferruginea (introduced), Bucephala clangula (a successfully introduced species, but the breeding population has declined dramatically since 2010), Anas platyrhynchos (reintroduced), Accipiter gentilis, Falco subbuteo, F. tinnunculus, Corvus cornix, Turdus pilaris, Parus major, and Cyanistes caeruleus. Accipiter nisus, Gallinula chloropus, Asio otus, Motacilla alba, Lanius collurio, Sturnus vulgaris, Hippolais icterina, Sylvia atricapilla, Muscicapa striata, Erithacus rubecula, Luscinia luscinia, Turdus philomelos, T. merula, Fringilla coelebs, Carduelis chloris, and C. carduelis are also successful inhabitants of the city, although their maximum breeding densities in urban green spaces are not obviously higher than those in rural/natural landscapes. A huge and dense population of Corvus cornix, an important nest predator, was formed in Moscow during the 1960s and early 1970s. The urban population of Accipiter gentilis varying during the last decades around 35-40 pairs yearly developed between the late 1970s and early 1990s. Currently, some areas within the city support comparatively diverse predator assemblages. For example, the 1.7-km(2) initial area of the Lomonosov Moscow State University at Vorob'evy Gory contains at least 18 predatory species of mammals and birds in the breeding season, including Falco peregrinus, F. subbuteo, F. tinnunculus, Accipiter nisus, Asio otus, Garrulus glandarius, etc. At the same time, some important predators, like most mustelids, are lacking or rare in Moscow. The order and approximate timing of the establishment of urban populations of different species indicate that a number of avian prey species have reached or been able to maintain high breeding densities in urban green spaces simultaneously with and/or after the synurbization of important predators. In several prey species studied at some localities of the city over the last decades, the proportion of depredated nests was, on average, relatively moderate for a given species (in Turdus philomelos) or sufficiently low (in Parus major, Cyanistes caeruleus, and Turdus pilaris). In general, these conclusions are supported by published data on the same or other prey species from some other cities located in the European part of Russia (Kaliningrad, Ryazan, Voronezh). Even in the presence of numerous predators, urban environments are more or less successfully occupied by substantial numbers of avian prey species from distant taxa and different ecological groups. These include many open-nesters whose clutches and nestlings are highly vulnerable to such predators as corvids and owls. To conclude, a negative answer, although with some reservations, must be given to the question: are predators a difficult barrier for the synurbization of avian prey species?

AB  - Background: Gelsenicine, the most toxic constituent of Gelsemium elegans Benth., is known for its diverse pharmacological activities alongside potent neurotoxicity, frequently leading to poisoning incidents following mistaken ingestion. However, its molecular mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Purpose: This study aimed to elucidate the key mechanistic network underlying gelsenicine-induced neurotoxicity by employing a comprehensive strategy that integrated metabolomics, network toxicology, molecular docking, and experimental validation. Methods: Acute oral toxicity tests were conducted in C57BL/6J mice to assess toxic symptoms, determine the median lethal dose (LD50), and evaluate histopathological changes. Untargeted metabolomics was performed to identify differential metabolites and associated pathways in serum, hippocampus (HIP), and medulla oblongata (MO). Integration of network toxicology pinpointed core targets and pathways, which were further validated through molecular docking and RT-qPCR. A core "compound-target-metabolite-pathway" network involved in gelsenicine-induced neurotoxicity was established. Results: Gelsenicine exhibited an oral LD50 of approximately 1.82 mg/kg and induced neurotoxic damage in the HIP and MO. Two untargeted metabolomic approaches detected a broad range of metabolites, revealing that gelsenicine markedly altered the metabolic profiles of serum, HIP, and MO. Network toxicology analysis identified 187 key targets associated with gelsenicine neurotoxicity. Integrated analyses with the predicted targets of differential metabolites indicated that gelsenicine primarily interferes with the energy metabolism network centered on the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS), affecting pathways such as carbon metabolism, amino acid metabolism, TCA cycle, and PPAR signaling pathway. Malate, glutamate, and aspartate were identified as core metabolites and potential biomarkers of gelsenicine poisoning. RT-qPCR validation revealed that gelsenicine interfered with the expression of core targets, including GLUD1, MDH, GOT and ME, all of which exhibited good binding energy with gelsenicine. Conclusion: This study unveiled a novel mechanistic insight into gelsenicine-induced neurotoxicity, demonstrating its capacity to perturb multiple energy metabolism pathways associated with MAS. These findings could enhance the theoretical understanding of gelsenicine's neurotoxic effects and highlight potential applications in clinical diagnosis and forensic identification.

AB  - Arsenic is a natural toxin which is widely distributed in the environment, incurring diverse toxicities and health problems. Previous studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) are also reported to contribute to As-induced adverse effects. LncRNAs are involved in the development of nerve injury, generally acting as sponges for microRNAs (miRNAs). This study aimed to investigate the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory networks associated with arsenic-induced nerve damage. A total of 40 male Wistar rats were exposed to different doses of arsenic for 12 weeks, and samples were collected for pathological observation and high-throughput sequencing. The ceRNA network was constructed using Cytoscape, and key genes were identified through the PPI network and CytoHubba methods. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was performed to validate gene expression levels. The results showed that subchronic exposure to arsenic in drinking water resulted in pathological and ultrastructural damage to the hippocampal tissue, including changes in neuron morphology, mitochondria, and synapses. Exposure to arsenic results in the dysregulation of LncRNA and mRNA expression in the hippocampal tissues of rats. These molecules participated in multiple ceRNA axes and formed a network of ceRNAs associated with nerve injury. This study also verified key molecules within the ceRNA network and provided preliminary evidence implicating the ENRNOT-00000022622-miR-206-3p-Bdnf axis in the mechanism of neural damage induced by arsenic in rats. These findings provide novel insights into the underlying mechanism of nervous system damage induced by arsenic exposure.

AB  - Hormone transition phases may trigger depression in some women, yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In a pharmacological sex-hormone manipulation model, we previously reported that estradiol reductions, induced with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa), provoked subclinical depressive symptoms in healthy women, especially if neocortical serotonin transporter (SERT) binding also increased. Within this model, we here evaluated if GnRHa, compared to placebo, reduced hippocampal volume, in a manner that depended on the magnitude of the estradiol decrease and SERT binding, and if this decrease translated to the emergence of subclinical depressive symptoms.Sixty-three healthy, naturally cycling women were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled GnRHa-intervention study. We quantified the change from baseline to follow-up (n = 60) in serum estradiol (AEstradiol), neocortical SERT binding ([11C] DASB positron emission tomography; ASERT), subclinical depressive symptoms (Hamilton depression rating scale; AHAMD-17), and hippocampal volume (magnetic resonance imaging data analyzed in Freesurfer 7.1, AHippocampus). Group differences in AHippocampus were evaluated in a t-test. Within the GnRHa group, associations between AEstradiol, AHippocampus, and AHAMD17, in addition to ASERT-by-AEstradiol interaction effects on AHippocampus, were evaluated with linear regression models.Mean AHippocampus was not significantly different between the GnRHa and placebo group. Within the GnRHa group, hippocampal volume reductions were associated with the magnitude of estradiol decrease (p = 0.04, Cohen's f2 = 0.18), controlled for baseline SERT binding, but not subclinical depressive symptoms. There was no ASERT-by-AEstradiol interaction effects on AHippocampus. If replicated, our data highlight a possible association between estradiol fluctuations and hippocampal plasticity, adjusted for serotonergic contributions.

TI  - LncRNA MIR17HG promotes colorectal cancer liver metastasis by mediating a glycolysis-associated positive feedback circuit
T2  - ONCOGENE
LA  - English
AB  - Glycolysis plays a crucial role in reprogramming the metastatic tumor microenvironment. A series of lncRNAs have been identified to function as oncogenic molecules by regulating glycolysis. However, the roles of glycolysis-related lncRNAs in regulating colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) remain poorly understood. In the present study, the expression of the glycolysis-related lncRNA MIR17HG gradually increased from adjacent normal to CRC to the paired liver metastatic tissues, and high MIR17HG expression predicted poor survival, especially in patients with liver metastasis. Functionally, MIR17HG promoted glycolysis in CRC cells and enhanced their invasion and liver metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MIR17HG functioned as a ceRNA to regulate HK1 expression by sponging miR-138-5p, resulting in glycolysis in CRC cells and leading to their invasion and liver metastasis. More interestingly, lactate accumulated via glycolysis activated the p38/Elk-1 signaling pathway to promote the transcriptional expression of MIR17HG in CRC cells, forming a positive feedback loop, which eventually resulted in persistent glycolysis and the invasion and liver metastasis of CRC cells. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the lactate-responsive lncRNA MIR17HG, acting as a ceRNA, promotes CRLM through a glycolysis-mediated positive feedback circuit and might be a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for CRLM.

AB  - Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to hypoxia. Although prolyl hydroxylation-mediated degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitination complex is a well-established regulatory mechanism, the role of lactate-induced posttranslational modifications in HIF-1 alpha stabilization remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that lactate induces lysine lactylation of HIF-1 alpha at distinct residues across species-specifically, K644 in mice and K12 in humans and pigs-to increase protein stability by impairing VHL recognition. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis analyses revealed that lactylation at these sites reduces K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, even when HIF-1 alpha is hydroxylated. Structural modeling and functional assays revealed that lactylation sterically hinders VHL binding without affecting hydroxylation. Notably, lactylated HIF-1 alpha exhibited increased transcriptional activity, as evidenced by increased promoter occupancy and upregulation of hypoxia-responsive genes (Vegfa, Glut1). Cross-species comparisons highlighted evolutionary divergence in lactylation sites while preserving the functional conservation of this modification. Our findings reveal that lactylation is a universal regulatory mechanism that overrides classical hydroxylation-dependent degradation, expanding our understanding of metabolic control over hypoxic signaling.

AB  - Ensuring food production with low nitrogen (N) environmental emissions requires good quantitative knowledge of N flows in agricultural systems to monitor emissions and N use efficiency (NUE, the ratio of N outputs to inputs). Our study quantifies the main N agricultural flows at subnational and national scales in Denmark and Sweden from 2011 to 2020, calculating the NUE for crop and livestock production and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) emissions. In Denmark, our results indicate a similar use of organic (manure) and synthetic N fertilizers (230 and 213 kt N y-1, 83 and 77 kg N ha-1 y-1); in contrast, Sweden used more synthetic (162 kt N y-1, 54 kg N ha-1 y-1) than organic N (108 kt N y-1, 36 kg N ha-1 y-1), with subnational variation in manure use as determined by livestock population. Livestock feed N intake was twice as large in Denmark (384 kt N y-1) as in Sweden (176 kt N y-1), reflecting Denmark's larger livestock population. Denmark's national crop NUE was lower (0.51) than Sweden's (0.72), likely due to a lower proportion of grass-clover leys, higher N input rates, and more intensive production systems. However, considerable subnational variation existed in both countries. The livestock NUE was 0.29 in Denmark and 0.25 in Sweden; these differences are mainly due to a higher proportion of ruminants in Sweden with lower N feed use efficiency than pigs. Sweden emitted less N2O and NH3 per unit area (similar to 56% for both gases) and in total (similar to 52% for both gases) than Denmark due to lower use of N inputs and less intensive farming systems. West Denmark and South Sweden were identified as emission hotspots. Our research provides essential information at subnational and national scales to improve N management and reduce gaseous N pollution, supporting the transition towards more sustainable agroecosystems in Denmark and Sweden.

AB  - Genetic evidence indicates that Progamotaenia macropodis Beveridge, 1976 (Cestoda: Anoplocephalidae), found in various macropodid host species, is a complex of cryptic species. However, the genetic data are incomplete, and no morphological re-appraisal of the species has been undertaken since its original description. Here, additional mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I sequence data have been added from the type host, Macropus giganteus, as well as other host species, and a morphological study of all available material undertaken. A new species, Progamotaenia mollicula sp. nov., is erected for specimens from the tammar wallaby, Notamacropus eugenii, which are smaller, and the testes in pre-mature and mature proglottids occur invariably in two lateral groups. Specimens from the remaining host species, Macropus fuliginosus, Notamacropus parryi, N. rufogriseus, Osphranter robustus, and Wallabia bicolor are highly variable with obvious differences in length and proglottid shape, but with no reliable internal morphological characters for separating the various genotypes. The study was limited by incomplete molecular data (N. rufogriseus) and the poor quality of some of the preserved material.

AB  - Arsenic is a widespread environmental contaminant known to accumulate in the brain, leading to cognitive impairment. However, the exact mechanisms by which arsenic causes cognitive deficits remain unclear. The present study aims to discover whether the destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediated by matrix metalloproteinases 2 and matrix metalloproteinases 9 (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and subsequent neuronal apoptosis are involved in arsenic-induced cognitive impairment. Ninety male mice were given 0, 25, and 50 mg/L NaAsO2 in drinking water and 30 mg/kg doxycycline hyclate (DOX, an inhibitor of MMPs) gavage for 12 weeks to observe the alterations in learning and memory of mice, the morphology of hippocampal neurons, as well as the BBB permeability and ultrastructure, the localization and expression of tight junction proteins, MMP-2, and MMP-9. Our findings indicated that arsenic exposure induced learning and memory impairment in mice, accompanied by neuronal loss and apoptosis. Furthermore, arsenic exposure increased hematogenous IgG leakage into the brain, disrupted the tight junctions, reduced the expression of Claudin5, Occludin, and ZO1 in the endothelial cells, and increased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the endothelial cells and astrocytes. Finally, DOX intervention preserved BBB integrity, alleviated hippocampal neuronal apoptosis, and improved cognitive impairment in mice caused by arsenic exposure. Our research demonstrates that cognitive disfunction in mice induced by arsenic exposure is associated with MMP-2 and MMP-9-mediated BBB destruction and neuronal apoptosis. The current investigation provides new insights into mechanisms of arsenic neurotoxicity and suggests that MMP-2 and MMP-9 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for treating arsenic-induced cognitive dysfunction in the future.

AB  - Motivated by regulating/eliminating the population of herbivorous pests, we investigate a discrete-time plant-herbivore model with two different constant control strategies (removal versus reduction), and formulate the corresponding optimal control problems when its dynamics exhibits varied types of bi-stability and fluctuating environments. We provide basic analysis and identify the critical factors to characterize the optimal controls and the corresponding plant-herbivore dynamics such as the control upper bound (the effectiveness level of the implementation of control measures) and the initial conditions of the plant and herbivore. Our results show that optimal control could be easier when the model has simple dynamics such as stable equilibrium dynamics under constant environment or the model exhibits chaotic dynamics under fluctuating environments. Due to bistability, initial conditions are important for optimal controls. Regardless of with or without fluctuating environments, initial conditions taken from the near the boundary makes optimal control easier. In general, the pest is hard to be eliminated when the control upper bound is not large enough. However, as the control upper bound is increased or the initial conditions are chosen from near the boundary of the basin of attractions, the pest can be manageable regardless of the fluctuating environments.

AB  - Silent infarcts (SI) are a cerebral small vessel disease characterized by small subcortical infarcts. These occur in the absence of typical ischemia symptoms but are linked to cognitive decline and dementia. While there are no approved treatments for SI, recent results from our laboratory suggest that tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is a viable candidate. In the present study, we induced SI in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 region of rats and assessed the effects of systemic administration of tamoxifen (5 mg/kg, twice) 21 days after injury on cognitive and pathophysiological measures, including cell loss, apoptosis, gliosis and estrogen receptors (ERs). We found that tamoxifen protected against the SI-induced cognitive dysfunction on the hippocampaldependent, place recognition task, cell and ER loss, and increased apoptosis and gliosis in the CA1. Exploratory data analyses using a scatterplot matrix and principal component analysis indicated that SI-tamoxifen rats were indistinguishable from sham controls while they differed from SI rats, who were characterized by enhanced cell loss, apoptosis and gliosis, lower ERs, and recognition memory deficit. Supervised machine learning using support vector machine (SVM) determined predictors of progression from the early ischemic state to the dementia-like state. It showed that caspase-3 and ER alpha in the CA1 and exploration proportion were reliable and accurate predictors of this progression. Importantly, tamoxifen ameliorated SI-induced effects on all three of these variables, providing further evidence for its viability as a candidate treatment for SI and prevention of associated dementia.

AB  - Estrogens play an important role in the regulation of female social recognition; however, their mechanisms have not yet been elucidated. The present study established a mouse model of adolescent ovariectomy (Ovx) supplemented with a physiological dose of estradiol benzoate (EB, 10 mu g/kg). Familiar-novel individual identification, urine odor discrimination, and social memory behaviors were assessed after adulthood. The results showed that Ovx-induced impairment of individual identification, urine odor discrimination, and social memory 24 h after testing were significantly improved by EB supplementation. Meanwhile, EB restored 17(3-estradiol (17(3-E2) and oxytocin (OT) levels in the brain and serum of Ovx females. EB upregulated the expression level of OT receptor (OTR) protein and increased the numbers of ER alpha-ir and ER(3-ir cell in the medial amygdala (MeA). Electrophysiological studies further showed that OT (10 and 100 nM) promoted the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA2 region of the hippocampal slices in vitro, which could be abolished by pretreatment with OTR antagonist l-368,899. 17(3-E2 (10 nM) not only promoted LTP, but also synergistically enhanced the promotion effect of 10 nM OT on LTP, which was eliminated by pretreatment with ERs antagonists ICI182780. These results suggest that estrogen promotes the OT system in the MeA and synergistically promotes OT increasing the synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus through ERs, which enhances social odor discrimination and social memory, and ultimately improves social recognition in female mice.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a burden on the public health system because it is a neurodegenerative disease that is incurable and for which there is no successful treatment. AD patients suffer from symptoms for many years, with progressive loss of cognitive and functional abilities. In addition to the features of AD, described as amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, neuroinflammatory processes, genetic factors, and lifestyle also play important roles. Increasing evidence for lifestyle factors includes possible changes due to smoking, social engagement, and physical activity. Methods: Morris water maze behavioral tasks were performed to analyze the formation of spatial memory. APPswe/PS1dE9 mice with a remarkable increase in amyloid-beta production associated with certain behavioral abnormalities comparable to AD symptoms and age-matched wild-type littermates were trained several times at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age and compared with untrained groups at 9 and 12 months of age. Performance during the acquisition phase, in the reference memory test, and in searching strategies were analyzed. Results: 9- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice showed cognitive impairment, especially in the reference memory test and searching strategies. This cognitive deterioration was reversed in 9- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice that had been previously trained several times. Even in the reversal test, in which memory formation must be adapted to the new platform position, several trained APP/PS1 mice performed better. Conclusion: Repeated spatial memory training in the water maze showed positive effects on memory formation in APP/PS1 mice. Interestingly, the cohort that had been previously trained several times was able to use increased hippocampus-dependent strategies, similar to the WT mice. This may suggest that cognitively demanding and physically active tasks can improve cognitive function.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) act as versatile regulators of many biological processes and play vital roles in various diseases. lncRNASNP is dedicated to providing a comprehensive repository of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and somatic mutations in lncRNAs and their impacts on lncRNA structure and function. Since the last release in 2018, there has been a huge increase in the number of variants and lncRNAs. Thus, we updated the lncRNASNP to version 3 by expanding the species to eight eukaryotic species (human, chimpanzee, pig, mouse, rat, chicken, zebrafish, and fruitfly), updating the data and adding several new features. SNPs in lncRNASNP have increased from 11 181 387 to 67 513 785. The human mutations have increased from 1 174 768 to 2 387 685, including 1 031 639 TCGA mutations and 1 356 046 CosmicNCVs. Compared with the last release, updated and new features in lncRNASNP v3 include (i) SNPs in lncRNAs and their impacts on lncRNAs for eight species, (ii) SNP effects on miRNA-lncRNA interactions for eight species, (iii) lncRNA expression profiles for six species, (iv) disease & GWAS-associated lncRNAs and variants, (v) experimental & predicted lncRNAs and drug target associations and (vi) SNP effects on lncRNA expression (eQTL) across tumor & normal tissues.

AB  - Introduction Seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a high-altitude plant with immense medicinal, nutritional, and therapeutic value. Earlier studies have documented the presence of various useful bioactive substances in this species; however, comprehensive metabolome profiling of seabuckthorn berries originating from different regions of the Indian Himalayas has not been undertaken. Objective Metabolomic profiling of seabuckthorn berries originating from different geographical sites in the Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir regions of the Indian Himalayas was performed by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Materials and methods The GC-MS metabolome profiles of seabuckthorn berries collected from different sites (altitude 1,400-4,270 m; average temperature 8 degrees C-27 degrees C) were subjected to multivariate analysis following principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. Results The GC-MS results showed substantial variability for berry metabolites, including fatty acids, alkyl ethers, and alkyl esters. Fatty acids and their esters were mainly responsible for the variation in the berry metabolome. The metabolite expression profile heat map revealed two distinct groups of seabuckthorn berries originating from Himachal Pradesh (Lahaul and Spiti) and Jammu & Kashmir (Leh, Nubra, and Kargil), the former showing higher expression of metabolites. Interestingly, a strong negative association existed between altitude and the amounts of metabolites such as amides, alkyl esters, alcohols, sugars, and sugar esters. In contrast, temperature showed a strong positive association with ketone and alkyl ether levels. Conclusion GC-MS profiling provides important phytochemical indicators to distinguish between seabuckthorn berries from different geographical sites. Our metabolome profiling analysis generated valuable information that will be useful in the formulation of various seabuckthorn products, benefiting farmers and industries.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Velvet antler extracts (VAE) are composed of a variety of active substances and growth factors, and have been reported to improve sleep quality and memory.
   Aim of the study: We aimed to explore the protective effects and mechanism of action for VAE on Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans model.
   Materials and methods: C. elegans were cultivated at 40% relative humidity on solid nematode growth medium (NGM) containing live E. coli (OP50) as the food source, with Strain N2 (normal) held at 20 degrees C and the CL4176s (transgenic) held at 16 degrees C. AD-like aggregation of A beta peptide in the CL4176s strain is induced by lifting the temperature to 25 degrees C. Nematodes were treated with three types of VAEs and Resveratrol (positive control). Analyses included qRT-PCR for quantification of gene transcripts of interest; ELISA for measuring levels of amyloid-beta protein; Thioflavin T fluorescent staining for localizing A beta depositions; assays for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide dismutase activity (SOD).
   Results: VAEs reduced beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) toxicity in the transgenic C. elegans model. An enzymatically-digested VAE (EDVAE) was superior to both a cold-water VAE (CWVAE) and a hot-water VAE (HWVAE) from the same velvet antler. EDVAE treatment reduced the severity of the A beta-induced paralysis phenotype and decreased the amount of A beta deposits in the AD model nematodes, and these effects were found to be significantly better than that of the positive control Resveratrol. In addition, EDVAE treatment reduced production of ROS (induced by A beta), enhanced SOD activity, and elevated expression levels of antioxidant-related transcription factors, although it is not known whether these effects were achieved directly or indirectly.
   Conclusion: EDVAE had a protective role in A beta-induced toxicity in the transgenic AD nematodes, possibly through reducing accumulation of toxic A beta and enhancing the ability of nematodes to resist oxidative stress. Thus, EDVAE has potential to be an effective treatment to relieve the symptoms of AD.

AB  - Simple Summary: Milk proteins are crucial for a healthy diet and offer various health benefits. Genetic variants of milk proteins are often drivers of different technological and nutritional milk characteristics, as shown in cow milk research. Similarly, genetic variants have been identified in camel caseins, but information on the alpha s2-casein gene (CSN1S2) is limited. Therefore, this study investigated the CSN1S2 gene in Old-World camels (Camelus bactrianus and Camelus dromedarius). Both camel species share most of the gene characteristics, including the presence of the exon 12, formerly not described in large camels. Two novel allelic variants were discovered: one was a missense mutation (Bactrian camel), and the other was a noncoding mutation (dromedary camel). The gene promoter mutations affected the binding sites of transcription factors, and there were differences in microRNA seed sequences due to a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at the 3'Untranslated region (UTR). The gene structure and interspersed element locations indicate a divergence between Tylopoda and Ruminantia.
   The CSN1S2 gene encodes alpha s2-casein, the third most abundant protein in camel milk. Despite its importance in foals, human nutrition, and dairy processing, the CSN1S2 gene in camels has received little attention. This study presents the first complete characterization of the CSN1S2 gene sequence in Old-World camels (Camelus bactrianus and Camelus dromedarius). Additionally, the gene promoter, consisting of 752 bp upstream of exon 1, was analyzed. The entire gene comprises 17 exons, ranging in length from 24 bp (exons 4, 8, 11, and 13) to 280 bp (exon 17). Interesting was the identification of the exon 12 in both species. The promoter analysis revealed 24 putative binding sites in the Bactrian camel and 22 in dromedary camel. Most of these sites were typical elements associated with milk protein, such as C/EBP-alpha, C/EBP-beta Oct-1, and AP1. The SNP discovery showed relatively high genetic diversity compared to other camel casein genes (CSN1S1, CSN2, and CSN3), with a total of 34 polymorphic sites across the two species. Particularly noteworthy is the transition g.311G>A in the CSN1S2 promoter, creating a new putative consensus binding site for a C/EBP-beta in the Bactrian camel. At the exon level, two novel variants were found. One was detected in exon 6 of the Bactrian camel (g.3639C>G), resulting in an amino acid replacement, p.36Ile>Met. The second variant was found in noncoding exon 17 of dromedary CSN1S2 (g.1511G>T). Although this mutation occurs in the 30-UnTranslated Region, it represents the first example of exonic polymorphism in the CSN1S2 for this species. This SNP also affects the binding sites of different microRNAs, including the seed sequence of the miRNA 4662a-3p, highlighting its role as a regulatory factor for CSN1S2 gene. A PCR-RFLP was set up for genotyping a dromedary Tunisian population (n = 157), and the minor allele frequency was found to be 0.27 for the G allele, indicating a potential yield improvement margin. The interspersed elements (INEs) analysis revealed 10 INEs covering 7.34% and 8.14% of the CSN1S2 sequence in the Bactrian and dromedary camels, respectively. Furthermore, six elements (A, B, F, H, I, and L) are shared among cattle and camels and are partially found in other ruminants, suggesting a common ancestral origin of these retrotransposons. Conversely, elements C, D, E, and G are specific to camels.

AB  - In the current study, camel whey protein (CWP) was hydrolyzed with alcalase for 12 h at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/200 (w/w). The antioxidant activity, antibacterial activity, and antifungal activity of the hydrolysates at different times (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h) were evaluated. The highest DH is 47%, which was obtained after 12 h in comparison with those obtained after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h (20, 26, 32, 39, and 47%, respectively). After 8 h, proteolysis presented the highest antioxidant activity against DPPH free radical (70% at a concentration of 200 mu g/mL). The bacteria S. typhimurium and E. coli were most affected, with MIC values of 78 and 625 mu g mL-1, respectively. The fungal growth of B. cinerea was reduced by 44%, 56%, and 78%, respectively, when CWPH was administered at 250, 500, and 1000 mu g mL-1. It can be concluded that camel whey protein hydrolysates have antibacterial, antioxidant, and antifungal activity against pathogenic bacteria and fungi.

AB  - Although extensive research has shown the pathological effect of fine and ultrafine airborne particles, clear evidence of association of environmental exposure to them and inflammatory changes in human nasal mucosa is missing. Meanwhile, pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis, despite being a disease with high prevalence in the population, is still unclear. The increasing evidence of the pro-inflammatory properties of these particles raises the question of their possible role in chronic rhinosinusitis. The presented study focused on detection of microsized anorganic particles and clusters of nanosized anorganic particles in the nasal mucosa of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis by Raman microspectroscopy and comparison of their composition to histologic findings. The results were compared to the findings in mucosa obtained from cadavers with no history of chronic rhinosinusitis. Solid particles were found in 90% of tissue samples in the group with chronic rhinosinusitis, showing histologic signs of inflammation in 95%, while in the control group, the particles were found in 20% of samples, with normal histologic findings in all of them. The main detected compounds were graphite, TiO2, amorphous carbon, calcite, ankerite and iron compounds. The results are in accordance with the premise that exogenous airborne particles interact with the nasal mucosa and possibly deposit in it in cases where the epithelial barrier is compromised in chronic rhinosinusitis.

AB  - Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of developing dementia and cognitive deficits. Neuroinflammation is one of the most important mechanisms behind cognitive impairment in obese patients. In recent years, the neuroendocrine hormone melatonin has been suggested to have therapeutic effects for memory decline in several neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. However, the effects of melatonin on cognitive function under obesity conditions still need to be clarified. The purpose of this study was to determine whether melatonin treatment can improve cognitive impairment in obese mice. To this end, male C57BL6 mice were treated with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks to induce obesity. The animal received melatonin for 8 weeks. Cognitive functions were evaluated using the Y maze, object recognition test, and the Morris water maze. We measured inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL) -17A, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of obese mice. Our results show that HFD-induced obesity significantly impaired working, spatial and recognition memory by increasing IFN-gamma and IL -17A and decreasing BDNF levels in the hippocampus of mice. On the other hand, melatonin treatment effectively improved all cognitive impairments and reduced TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-17A and elevated BDNF levels in the hippocampus of obese mice. Taken together, this study suggests that melatonin treatment could have a beneficial role in the treatment of cognitive impairment in obesity.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, the gray wolf population has recovered in France, initially to wolves from Italy passing through the Alps. The population is carefully monitored, but little information is available on their helminth fauna, which includes parasites of public health importance: Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato. Capitalizing on the availability of 911 fecal samples collected for the noninvasive genetic monitoring of French wolf populations, along with the intestines from 15 dead wolves, the presence of Echinococcus species among others helminth species was evaluated in French wolves. A copro-PCR approach amplifying a large spectrum of parasites was used for fecal samples while intestines were analyzed using SCT. The fecal occurrences of E. granulosus sensu stricto (2.4%) and E. multilocularis (0.3%), and indeedother parasitic species, are similar to those of other European wolf populations including Taenia hydatigena (7.2%), Taenia krabbei (2.4%), Uncinaria stenocephala (2.4%), Mesocestoides litteratus (1.9%), Taenia ovis (0.3%), Taenia multiceps (0.1%), and Toxascaris leonina (0.1%). The three most abundant species were also found in the intestines. Infections by E. granulosus sensu stricto are in accordance with the overlap of wolf pack areas and sheep breeding pastoral units. However, the wolf does not appear to play a significant role in the lifecycle of E. granulosus sensu stricto. The availability of this opportunistic fecal sampling of wolves in southeastern France means that they can be used as sentinels for the surveillance of E. multilocularis in the context of its southward expansion observed in recent years.

AB  - Background and purposeCerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a major factor underlying the high mortality and morbidity rates in stroke patients. Our previous study found that the combination of Astragalus membranaceus extract and ligustrazine (Ast+Lig) treatment could protect brain tissues against inflammation in rats with thrombolytic cerebral ischemia. Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) is implicated in brain damage induced by cerebral I/R injury. MethodsWe used in vivo and in vitro models of cerebral I/R injury for middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion in mice and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation in primary rat cerebral cortical neurons to evaluate the protective effects of Ast+Lig on cerebral I/R injury, and whether the protective mechanism was related to the regulation of NMDAR-ERK/CREB signaling. ResultsTreatment with Ast+Lig, or MK-801 (an inhibitor of NMDAR) significantly ameliorated neurological deficits, decreased infarct volumes, suppressed neuronal damage and Ca2+ influx, and maintained the mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo and in vitro following cerebral I/R injury based on 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent staining. Furthermore, treatment with Ast+Lig evidently prevented the upregulation of NR2B, but not NR2A, in vivo and in vitro following cerebral I/R injury based on western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses. Moreover, treatment with Ast+Lig significantly increased the phosphorylation of ERK and CREB, as well as increasing their mRNA expression levels in vivo and in vitro following cerebral I/R injury. ConclusionsThe overall results thus suggest that the Ast+Lig combination conferred neuroprotective properties against cerebral I/R injury via regulation of the NR2B-ERK/CREB signaling pathway.

AB  - The angular gyrus (AG) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) demonstrate extensive structural and functional connectivity with the hippocampus and other core recollection network regions. Consequently, recent studies have explored neuromodulation targeting these and other regions as a potential strategy for restoring function in memory disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease. However, determining the optimal approach for neuromodulatory devices requires understanding how parameters like selected stimulation site, cognitive state during modulation, and stimulation duration influence the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on electrophysiological features relevant to episodic memory. We report experimental data examining the effects of high-frequency stimulation delivered to the AG or PCC on hippocampal theta oscillations during the memory encoding (study) or retrieval (test) phases of an episodic memory task. Results showed selective enhancement of anterior hippocampal slow theta oscillations with stimulation of the AG preferentially during memory retrieval. Conversely, stimulation of the PCC attenuated slow theta oscillations. We did not observe significant behavioral effects in this (open-loop) stimulation experiment, suggesting that neuromodulation strategies targeting episodic memory performance may require more temporally precise stimulation approaches.

AB  - MYB transcription factors (TFs) play a key role in plant resistance to abiotic and biotical stresses. However, little is currently known about their involvement in the plant defense to piercing-sucking insects. Here, we studied the MYB TFs that responded to and resisted Bemisia tabaci whitefly in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. Firstly, a total of 453 NbMYB TFs in N. benthamiana genome were identified and 182 R2R3-MYB TFs were analyzed for molecular characteristics, phylogenetic analysis, genetic structure, motif composition, and cis-elements. Then, six stress-related NbMYB genes were selected for further study. The expression pattern shows they were highly expressed in mature leaves and intensively induced upon whitefly attack. Combined with bioinformatic analysis, overexpression, beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) assay, and virus-induced silencing tests, we determined the transcriptional regulation of these NbMYBs on the genes in lignin biosynthesis and SA-signaling pathways. Meanwhile, we tested the performance of whitefly on plants with increased or silenced NbMYB genes expression and found that NbMYB42, NbMYB107, NbMYB163, and NbMYB423 were resistant to whitefly. Our results contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the MYB TFs in N. benthamiana. Furthermore, our findings will facilitate further studies on the role of MYB TFs in the interaction between plants and piercing-sucking insects.

AB  - Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), which is emerging as a pervasive global health concern and a considerable economic burden, is characterized by a detrimental effect on renal function and structure. Recent research indicates that the progression of DKD is facilitated by lipotoxic injury to tubular epithelial cells (TECs). However, the specific mechanisms that contribute to this cellular damage have yet to be fully elucidated. Our results revealed a significant upregulation of F2RL1 in vivo and in vitro models, which was positively correlated with the expression of inflammatory factors. Knockdown of F2RL1 significantly reduced inflammatory response in palmitate-stimulated HK-2 cells. Mechanistically, F2RL1 might exacerbate lipotoxicity-induced DKD through the modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that modulating F2RL1 expression may be a strategic approach to mitigate the inflammatory damage to RTECs associated with DKD, potentially through its involvement in the Hippo signaling pathway. Given these findings, F2RL1 merits consideration as a candidate therapeutic target for DKD.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effect of two types of stressors, regarding the extent of involvement of ouabain (OUA), hippocampal sodium/potassium ATPase (NKA) expression, and the hippocampal corticosterone receptors (CR)/melatonin receptors (MR) expression ratio, on the behavioral and cardiovascular responses and on the hippocampal cornu ammonis zone 3 (CA3) and dentate gyrus (DG). Thirty adult male Wistar albino rats aged 7-8 months were exposed to either chronic immobilization or a disturbed dark/light cycle and treated with either ouabain or vehicle. In the immobilized group, in the absence of hippocampal corticosterone (CORT) changes, rats were non-responsive to stress, despite experiencing increased pulse rate, downregulated hippocampal sodium/potassium pump, and enhanced hippocampal CR/MR expression ratio. Prolonged darkness precipitated a reduced upright attack posture, with elevated CORT against hippocampal MR downregulation. Both immobilization and, to a lesser extent, prolonged darkness stress resulted in histopathological and ultrastructural neurodegenerative changes in the hippocampus. OUA administration did not change the behavioral resilience in restrained rats, despite persistence of the underlying biochemical derangements, added to decreased CORT. On the contrary, with exposure to short photoperiods, OUA reverted the behavior towards a combative reduction of inactivity, with unvaried CR/MR and CORT, while ameliorating hippocampal neuro-regeneration, with co-existing NKA and MR repressions. Therefore, the extent of OUA, hippocampal NKA expression, and CR/MR expression, and subsequent behavioral and cardiac responses and hippocampal histopathology, differ according to the type of stressor, whether immobilization or prolonged darkness.

AB  - Myopia is characterized of maladaptive increases in scleral fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation(FMT). Scleral hypoxia is a significant factor contributing to myopia, but how hypoxia induces myopia ispoorly understood. Here, we showed that myopia in mice and guinea pigs was associated with hypoxia-induced increases in key glycolytic enzymes expression and lactate levels in the sclera. Promotion of scleralglycolysis or lactate production induced FMT and myopia; conversely, suppression of glycolysis or lactateproduction eliminated or inhibited FMT and myopia. Mechanistically, increasing scleral glycolysis-lactatelevels promoted FMT and myopia via H3K18la, and this promotedNotch1expression. Genetic analyses iden-tified a significant enrichment of two genes encoding glycolytic enzymes,ENO2andTPI1. Moreover,increasing sugar intake in guinea pigs not only induced myopia but also enhanced the response to myopiainduction via the scleral glycolysis-lactate-histone lactylation pathway. Collectively, we suggest that scleralglycolysis contributes to myopia by promoting FMT via lactate-induced histone lactylation.

AB  - Cystic echinococcosis is a worldwide-distributed zoonotic parasitic disease. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the seroprevalence and risk factors potentially associated with Echinococcus granulosus in healthy blood donors from Timis County, an endemic region in Western Romania. Serum samples were collected from 1347 Romanian blood donors. Serologic tests to determine the presence of anti-Echinococcus antibodies were performed using an anti-Echinococcus-ELISA immunoassay. Anti-Echinococcus antibodies were detected in 38 blood donors, indicating an overall seroprevalence of 2.8%. The seropositivity rate was 3.7% in females and 3.1% in blood donors residing in urban areas. The highest seropositivity was found in the age group of 31-40 years (3.6%). There were no significant differences between Echinococcus seropositivity and gender, area of residence, age, contact with dogs, or raising sheep. This serologic survey evaluated for the first time the presence of Echinococcus antibodies in healthy blood donors from Western Romania and the potential risk factors associated with echinococcosis. Our results suggest that this zoonotic infection might evolve asymptomatically in apparently healthy individuals. Further studies should be conducted in the general population to estimate the true extent of human echinococcosis and its risk factors.

AB  - Disease's severity, mortality rates, and common failures to achieve clinical improvement during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic exposed the emergency need for new antiviral therapeutics with higher efficacy and fewer adverse effects. This study explores the potential to encapsulate multi-component plant extracts in liposomes as optimized delivery systems and to verify if they exert inhibitory effects against human seasonal betacoronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) in vitro. The selection of Sambucus nigra, Potentilla reptans, Allium sativum, Aesculus hippocastanum, and Glycyrrhiza glabra L. plant extracts was based on their established pharmacological and antiviral properties. The physicochemical characterization of extract-loaded liposomes was conducted by DLS and electrokinetics. Encapsulated amounts of the extract were evaluated based on the total flavonoid content (TFC) and total polyphenol content (TPC) by colorimetric methods. The BALB 3T3 neutral red uptake (NRU) phototoxicity/cytotoxicity assay was used to estimate compounds' safety. Photo irritation factors (PIFs) of the liposomes containing extracts were <2 which assigned them as non-phototoxic substances. The antiviral capacities of liposomes containing medicinal plant extracts against HCoV-OC43 were measured by the cytopathic effect inhibition test in susceptible HCT-8 cells. The antiviral activity increased by several times compared to "naked" extracts' activity reported previously. A. hippocastanum extract showed 16 times higher inhibitory properties reaching a selectivity index (SI) of 58.96. Virucidal and virus-adsorption effects were investigated using the endpoint dilution method and triangle lgs comparison with infected and untreated controls. The results confirmed that nanoparticles do not directly affect the viral surface or cell membrane, but only serve as carriers of the active substances and the observed protection is due solely to the intracellular action of the extracts.

AB  - Numerous source attribution studies for foodborne pathogens based on epidemiological and microbiological methods are available. These studies provide empirical data for modelling frameworks that synthetize the quantitative evidence at our disposal and reduce reliance on expert elicitations. Here, we develop a statistical model within a Bayesian estimation framework to integrate attribution estimates from expert elicitations with estimates from microbial subtyping and case-control studies for sporadic infections with four major bacterial zoonotic pathogens in the Netherlands (Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli [STEC] O157 and Listeria). For each pathogen, we pooled the published fractions of human cases attributable to each animal reservoir from the microbial subtyping studies, accounting for the uncertainty arising from the different typing methods, attribution models, and year(s) of data collection. We then combined the population attributable fractions (PAFs) from the case-control studies according to five transmission pathways (domestic food, environment, direct animal contact, human-human transmission and travel) and 11 groups within the foodborne pathway (beef/lamb, pork, poultry meat, eggs, dairy, fish/shellfish, fruit/vegetables, beverages, grains, composite foods and food handlers/vermin). The attribution estimates were biologically plausible, allowing the human cases to be attributed in several ways according to reservoirs, transmission pathways and food groups. All pathogens were predominantly foodborne, with Campylobacter being mostly attributable to the chicken reservoir, Salmonella to pigs (albeit closely followed by layers), and Listeria and STEC O157 to cattle. Food-wise, the attributions reflected those at the reservoir level in terms of ranking. We provided a modelling solution to reach consensus attribution estimates reflecting the empirical evidence in the literature that is particularly useful for policy-making and is extensible to other pathogens and domains.

AB  - Radiofrequency ablation can damage the cardiac tissues and affect their functions. Amiodarone is a commonly used antiarrhythmic drug that protects the heart tissues. This study used nanoparticle contrast technology to explore the protective effects of amiodarone catheter perfusion on cardiac injury caused by radiofrequency ablation. The model of atrial fibrillation (AF) was established in healthy piglets. All piglets were subjected to three-dimensional heart reconstruction with nano-computed tomography (CT) before surgery, followed by radiofrequency ablation. Subsequently, the random number table method divided them into experimental (four P: 203.8.109.20 On Sat, 07 Oct 2023 05 30:45 Copyright: American Scientific Publishers piglets) and control groups (four piglets). The experimental roup was treated with amiodarone catheter infuDelivered by Ingenta sion, and the control group was the amiodarone non-intervention group. The changes in serum myoglobin (Mb), troponin I (cTnI), and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) in the two groups before an operation, 6 h, 12 h, and 48 h after the operation, were analyzed. The degree of injury of right atrial radiofrequency ablation was analyzed and compared between the two groups. The total time and the number of radiofrequency ablation discharges were recorded. After 12 h of radiofrequency ablation, the levels of Mb and CK-MB in the pigs' serum increased (P < 0.05). The levels of cTnI increased 12 h after surgery (P < 0.01) and became normal 48 h after surgery. The depth and width of right atrial heart tissue injury, Mb, CK-MB, and cTnI in the experimental group were significantly lower than in the control group. After treatment, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and cardiac index (CI) in the two groups were higher, while the left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) was lower than those before treatment. The LVEF and CI in the experimental group were higher, and LVESV was lower than those in the control group. The myocardial injury caused by radiofrequency ablation is a minor myocardial injury, which can increase the serum myocardial damage markers to varying degrees; CK-MB, cTnI, and Mb can be used for radiofrequency catheter ablation monitoring of myocardial injury. Amiodarone catheter perfusion produces protective effects on cardiac injury caused by radiofrequency ablation. This study provides a new therapeutic method for cardiac injury caused by radiofrequency ablation.

AB  - Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common form of dementia, has been reported to influence 27 million individuals globally. Several risk factors including oxidative stress, gut microbiota imbalance, and cognitive activity are reported to be closely associated with the initiation or progression of AD. Although miR-483-3p was identified to be downregulated in AD patient serum. However, the biological role and mechanism of miR-483-3p remained unknown in AD. Here, we explored the role of miR-483-3p in AD. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with homocysteine (Hcy) to establish an AD animal model. The Morris water maze tests and contextual fear tests were conducted to assess the cognitive and memory abilities of rats. TUNEL staining was utilized to determine cell apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the binding relation between miR-483-3p and exportin 1 (XPO1). Results Homocysteine treatment (400 mu g/kg) induced the learning, cognitive and memory defects of rats. miR-483-3p was downregulated in Hcy-treated rat hippocampus. Functionally, miR-483-3p alleviated cell apoptosis and impairments of learning and memory abilities in Hcy-treated rats. In addition, miR-483-3p inhibited cell apoptosis and protein level of AD-associated factors (APP, BACE1, and A beta 1-42) in PC12 cells. In mechanism, miR-483-3p was confirmed to target XPO1 in PC12 cells. XPO1 displayed high level in rat hippocampus and was negatively correlated with miR-483-3p levels. Finally, XPO1 overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-483-3p on cell apoptosis and protein levels of AD-associated factors. Conclusions miR-483-3p alleviates neural cell apoptosis and impairments of learning and memory abilities by targeting XPO1 in AD.

AB  - Background: Aging is an inevitable physiological process, associated with a decline in cognitive function. Recently, metformin, as the first-line treatment for type II diabetes, has been shown to increase the life expectancy of diabetic patients. Therefore, researchers are paying increasing attention to its anti-aging properties. Oxygen free radicals are responsible for oxidative stress, which is a prominent factor in age-associated diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of long-term administration of metformin on age-dependent oxidative stress and cognitive function.
   Methods: In this experimental study, 32 normal (nondiabetic) male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into control and metformin groups (n = 16 per group). The metformin group received 100 mg/kg of metformin in drinking water daily for six months. The shuttle box test was used for the passive avoidance task in 24-month-old rats. For the biochemical assay, the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level were measured. Nissl and TUNEL staining were also used for histopathological assessments. Data were analyzed using independent t-test.
   Results: The present findings revealed that metformin significantly reduced the MDA level and increased the TAC in the hippocampus of the metformin group (p < 0.05). The survival of hippocampal CA1 neurons was significantly higher in the metformin group as compared to the control group, while the number of TUNEL-positive neurons decreased significantly (p < 0.05). On the other hand, metformin markedly improved the passive avoidance memory in the metformin group as compared to the control group (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: It can be concluded that long-term metformin intake, by modulating the oxidant/antioxidant mechanisms, prevents the loss of hippocampal neurons caused by age-dependent oxidative stress and improves memory.

AB  - Classic atherosclerosis risk factors do not explain all cases of chronic heart disease. There is significant evidence that gut microbiota may influence the development of atherosclerosis. The widespread prevalence of chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori, HP) infections suggests that HP can be the source of components that stimulate local and systemic inflammatory responses. Elevated production of reactive oxygen species during HP infection leads to cholesterol oxidation, which drives atherogenesis. The aim of this study is to explore the link between persistent HP infection and a high-fat diet in the development of proinflammatory conditions that are potentially proatherogenic. An in vivo model of Caviae porcellus infected with HP and exposed to an experimental diet was investigated for the occurrence of a proinflammatory and proatherogenic endothelial environment. Vascular endothelial primary cells exposed to HP components were tested in vitro for oxidative stress, cell activation and apoptosis. The infiltration of inflammatory cells into the vascular endothelium of animals infected with HP and exposed to a high-fat diet was observed in conjunction with an increased level of inflammatory markers systemically. The arteries of such animals were the least elastic, suggesting the role of HP in arterial stiffness. Soluble HP components induced transformation of macrophages to foam cells in vitro and influenced the endothelial life span, which was correlated with Collagen I upregulation. These preliminary results support the hypothesis that HP antigens act synergistically with a high-fat diet in the development of proatherogenic conditions.

AB  - In most Mediterranean countries, soymeal is an imported and economically unstable feedstuff that unpredictably affects the profitability of dairy farms. Here we examined whether the partial substitution of soymeal with a mixture of locally produced flaxseed and lupins could affect milk yield and cheese production in dairy cows. Sixty Holstein cows were fed either a standard food, or a meal in which 50% of soymeal was replaced by a flaxseed-lupin (FL) mixture. Milk yield and composition, as well as cheese characteristics of five replicates, were examined. The feed modification did not affect the general health and milk yield of the animals. Milk yield and composition, as well as cheese characteristics, were examined. The feed modification did not affect the general health and milk yield of the animals. Milk from the FL group had decreased levels of saturated fatty acids, while cheese made from milk from this group had increased polyunsaturated fatty acids when compared to controls. These results imply that replacement of soymeal with flaxseed and lupin is profitable as it confers special characteristics to milk and cheese that are of benefit to human health.
   The effect of partial substitution of soybean meal by equal quantities of flaxseed and lupins in diets of Holstein dairy cows and heifers was investigated. A total of 6 animals (30 multiparous and 30 primiparous) were allocated into two equal groups in a randomised block design and fed control (group CO) or modified (group FL) TMR diets from three weeks prior to calving until day 40 postpartum. The TMR of group CO contained corn, barley, soybean meal, rapeseed cake, corn silage, and Lucerne hay, whereas in group FL equal quantities of whole flaxseed and lupins were used to replace 50% of the soybean meal in the TMR. All animals were fed twice daily with a daily allowance of 24 kg dry matter intake per animal. Milking was carried out three times daily and milk yield was recorded during every milking. Milk samples were analysed for chemical composition and SCC content. White cheeses were manufactured from bulk milk of each group at industrial level. Bulk milk and white cheese were analysed for chemical composition and fatty acid profile; cheese was also assessed for its organoleptic properties. Results indicate that milk yield did not differ among groups. Lipid oxidation values were similar among the groups, for both milk and cheese. However, FL inclusion resulted in lower (p < 0.05) protein carbonyls and higher (p < 0.05) phenolic compounds in both milk and cheese samples. Milk from the FL group had decreased palmitic (p < 0.05) and myristic (p < 0.05) and increased oleic (p < 0.05) and linolenic acid (p < 0.05) when compared to group CO. White cheese from group FL showed a decrease in saturated fatty acids (SFA) (p < 0.05), an increase in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (p < 0.05), and a higher increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (p < 0.05) when compared with that of group CO. The white cheese of cows fed diets with flaxseed and lupins showed compositional and organoleptic properties quite similar to control group cheese; aroma, texture, and color were acceptable and desirable in both cheeses. However, increased levels of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were found in the cheese of FL fed animals. The substitution of soybean meal by flaxseed and lupins in diets of Holstein cows warrants further investigation, especially towards the production of cheese that meet the consumers' demand for novel and healthier dairy products.

AB  - Coracias benghalensis, commonly known as Indian Roller, a subtropical seasonally breeding bird native to Prayagraj (25 degrees 28 ' N, 81 degrees 54 ' E), U.P., India, exhibits a specific rolling behavior (an ornate sexual display) to attract the female for courtship. We hypothesized that the emergence of the seasonal rolling behavior of C. benghalensis would coincide with seasonal neuronal morphology changes in the dorsomedial hippocampus (DMH) area of the hippocampal complex (HCC). To test this hypothesis, the present study aimed to reveal qualitative and quantitative changes in neuronal plasticity in various neuronal classes of DMH across the breeding (pre-breeding and breeding) and the non-breeding (quiescent and regression) phases of the reproductive cycle of C. benghalensis. Plasticity in the morphology of four neuronal types (unipolar, bipolar, pyramidal, and multipolar) in the DMH area of HCC during the breeding and the non-breeding phases was characterized by using Golgi-Colonnier staining for identification and characterization of neuronal morphology. As compared to the quiescent phase, a significant increase of soma diameter, dendritic field, dendritic thickness, length of spine neck, spine head diameter, number of visible spines, and spine density in all four types of neurons was observed during the breeding phase. In contrast, significant decreases were observed during the bird's non-breeding phase compared to the breeding phase. This study concludes that during the breeding phase of C. benghalensis, neuronal arborization was substantially increased in DMH, suggesting an enhanced capability for circuit plasticity possibly underlying rolling behavior. Our study establishes seasonal plasticity in DMH and will serve as a novel model for future studies investigating the molecular, physiological, and cellular mechanisms underlying complex, yet stereotyped, sensorimotor behavior.

AB  - A large percentage of crop loss is due to insect damage, especially caterpillar damage. Plant chitinases are considered excellent candidates to combat these insects since they can degrade chitin in peritrophic matrix (PM), an important protective structure in caterpillar midgut. Compared to chemical insecticides, chitinases could improve host plant resistance and be both economically and environmentally advantageous. The focus of this research was to find chitinase candidates that could improve plant resistance by effectively limiting caterpillar damage. Five classes of endochitinase (I-V) genes were characterized in the maize genome, and we isolated and cloned four chitinase genes (chitinase A, chitinase B, chitinase I, and PRm3) present in two maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines Mp708 and Tx601, with different levels of resistance to caterpillar pests. We also investigated the expression of these maize chitinases in response to fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW) attack. The results indicated that both chitinase transcript abundance and enzymatic activity increased in response to FAW feeding and mechanical wounding. Furthermore, chitinases retained activity inside the caterpillar midgut and enzymatic activity was detected in the food bolus and frass. When examined under scanning electron microscopy, PMs from Tx601-fed caterpillars showed structural damage when compared to diet controls. Analysis of chitinase transcript abundance after caterpillar feeding and proteomic analysis of maize leaf trichomes in the two inbreds implicated chitinase PRm3 found in Tx601 as a potential insecticidal protein.

AB  - Patients with stress-triggered major depression disorders (MDD) can often seek comfort or temporary relief through alcohol consumption, as they may turn to it as a means of self-medication or coping with overwhelming emotions. The use of alcohol as a coping mechanism for stressful events can escalate, fostering a cycle where the temporary relief it provides from depression can deepen into alcohol dependence, exacerbating both conditions. Although, the specific mechanisms involved in stress-triggered alcohol dependence and MDD comorbidities are not well understood, a large body of literature suggests that the serotonin transporter (SERT) plays a critical role in these abnormalities. To further investigate this hypothesis, we used a lentiviral-mediated knockdown approach to examine the role of hippocampal SERT knockdown in social defeat stress-elicited depression like behavior and ethanol-induced place preference (CPP). The results showed that social defeat stress -pro depressant effects were reversed following SERT knockdown demonstrated by increased sucrose preference, shorter latency to feed in the novelty suppressed feeding test, and decreased immobility time in the tail suspension and forced swim tests. Moreover, and most importantly, social stress-induced ethanol-CPP acquisition and reinstatement were significantly reduced following hippocampal SERT knockdown using short hairpin RNA shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors. Finally, we confirmed that SERT hippocampal mRNA expression correlated with measures of depression- and ethanol-related behaviors by Pearson ' s correlation analysis. Taken together, our data suggest that hippocampal serotoninergic system is involved in social stress-triggered mood disorders as well as in the acquisition and retrieval of ethanol contextual memory and that blockade of this transporter can decrease ethanol rewarding properties.

AB  - This study aims to explore the effect of Tectorigenin in chronic cerebral ischemia (CCI)-induced cognitive impairment mice model. Cognitive impairment, hippocampal tissue histopathology, and myelin density in CCI mice were detected. HT22 cells were used to induce oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury. Cell viability and apoptosis of transfected HT22 cells and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) pathway-related factor levels in hippocampal tissue and OGD/R models were detected. CCI caused cognitive impairment, hippocampal damage, and decreased myelin density in mice while promoting interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, TLR4, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88, p-p65, NLRP3, and ASC levels. Tectorigenin reversed the effects of CCI in mice and reversed the promoting effects of OGD/R on apoptosis and TLR4/NF-kappa B pathway-related factors levels, while overexpressed TLR4 reversed the effects of Tectorigenin in OGD/R-induced HT-22 cells. Tectorigenin alleviated cognitive impairment in CCI mice by inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - With the growth of the plant-based food sector, increasing amounts of by-products are generated. Sea buckthorn pomace (SBP), a by-product of juice and other manufacturing products, is rich in bioactive compounds such as phenolics, oligosaccharides, proteins, and dietary fiber. The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of modification methods, such as enzymatic hydrolysis and supercritical carbon dioxide extraction (SFE-CO2), on the chemical composition and technological properties of SBP. SBP and SBP obtained after SFE-CO2 (SBP-CO2) were enzymatically modified using Pectinex (R) Ultra Tropical, Viscozyme (R) L, and Celluclast (R) 1.5 L (Novozyme A/S, Bagsv ae rd, Denmark). The SBP's main constituent was insoluble dietary fiber (IDF), followed by crude proteins and lipids (respectively, 58.7, 21.1 and 12.6 g/100 in d.m.). SFE-CO2 reduced the lipid content (by 85.7%) in the pomace while increasing protein and TDF content. Enzymatic hydrolysis decreased the content of both soluble dietary fiber (SDF) and IDF, and increased the content of mono- and oligosaccharides as well as free phenolics, depending on the commercial enzyme preparation used in SBP and SBP-CO2 samples. Celluclast (R) 1.5 L was the most effective in hydrolyzing IDF, while Viscozyme (R) L and Pectinex (R) Ultra Tropical were the most effective in degrading SDF. Enzymatic treatment improved water swelling capacity, water retention capacity, water solubility index, oil retention capacity of SBP and SBP-CO2; however, it did not have a significant effect on the stability of the emulsions. Modification of SBP by SFE-CO2 effectively increased WSC and WSI, however it reduced WRC. These findings highlight the potential of targeted modifications to enhance the nutritional and technological properties of SBP for functional food applications.

AB  - African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a highly contagious and severe hemorrhagic viral disease with high mortality in domestic pigs of all ages. Although the virus is harmless to humans, the ongoing ASFV epidemic could have severe economic consequences for global food security. Recent studies have found a few antiviral agents that can inhibit ASFV infections. However, currently, there are no vaccines or antiviral drugs. Hence, there is an urgent need to identify new drugs to treat ASFV. Based on the structural information data on the targets of ASFV, we used molecular docking and machine learning models to identify novel antiviral agents. We confirmed that compounds with high affinity present in the region of interest belonged to subsets in the chemical space using principal component analysis and k-means clustering in molecular docking studies of FDA-approved drugs. These methods predicted pentagastrin as a potential antiviral drug against ASFVs. Finally, it was also observed that the compound had an inhibitory effect on AsfvPolX activity. Results from the present study suggest that molecular docking and machine learning models can play an important role in identifying potential antiviral drugs against ASFVs.

AB  - Increases in power and frequency of hippocampal theta activity have been related to efficient place learning and memory acquisition in hippocampal-dependent tests. The complex medial septum-diagonal band of Broca (MS/ DBB) is the pacemaker of hippocampal theta activity, influenced by the ascending synchronizing system, and modulated by serotonergic raphe medial afferents, acting on cholinergic and GABAergic septal neurons. The suppression of hippocampal theta expression and the modulation of hippocampal learning and memory are attributed to serotonin. To simultaneously test these hypotheses, a daily local serotonin increase was induced by citalopram (CIT) infusion (100 mu M, 0.88 mu l, 0.2 mu l/m) 15 min before training in the Morris water maze. The theta activity was recorded in the MS/DBB, dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 of one group infused with artificial cerebrospinal liquid (ACL) and the other with CIT on Days 1-6 of training. After a probe trial (Day 7) and one resting day, the treatments were reversed (Days 8-11). The CIT MS/DBB infusion in the first 6 training days reduced the efficiency of spatial learning in association with reduced power in the DG, reduced MS/DBB-DG coherence, increased DG-CA1 coherence, and a lack of a negative correlation between MS/DBB power and swam distances. No effect of the CIT occurred once the information was acquired under ACL training. These results support a role of serotonin, in acting on the MS/DBB in the fine tuning of hippocampal learning and memory efficiency through the modulation of learning-related theta activity power and septohipocampal synchronization.

AB  - Swine are attracting increasing attention as a biomedical model, due to many immunological similarities with humans. However, porcine macrophage polarization has not been extensively analyzed. Therefore, we investigated porcine monocyte-derived macrophages (moM phi) triggered by either IFN-gamma + LPS (classical activation) or by diverse "M2-related " polarizing factors: IL-4, IL-10, TGF-beta, and dexamethasone. IFN-gamma and LPS polarized moM phi toward a proinflammatory phenotype, although a significant IL-1Ra response was observed. Exposure to IL-4, IL-10, TGF-beta, and dexamethasone gave rise to four distinct phenotypes, all antithetic to IFN-gamma and LPS. Some peculiarities were observed: IL-4 and IL-10 both enhanced expression of IL-18, and none of the "M2-related " stimuli induced IL-10 expression. Exposures to TGF-beta and dexamethasone were characterized by enhanced levels of TGF-beta 2, whereas stimulation with dexamethasone, but not TGF-beta 2, triggered CD163 upregulation and induction of CCL23. Macrophages stimulated with IL-10, TGF-beta, or dexamethasone presented decreased abilities to release proinflammatory cytokines in response to TLR2 or TLR3 ligands: IL-10 showed a powerful inhibitory activity for CXCL8 and TNF release, whereas TGF-beta provided a strong inhibitory signal for IL-6 production. While our results emphasized porcine macrophage plasticity broadly comparable to human and murine macrophages, they also highlighted some peculiarities in this species.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a short period of normobaric hypoxic exposure on spatial learning and memory, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the rat hippocampus. Hypoxic conditions were set at 12.5% O-2. We compared all variables between normoxic trials (Norm), after 24 h (Hypo-24 h), and after 72 h of hypoxic exposure (Hypo-72 h). Spatial learning and memory were evaluated by using a water-finding task in an open field. Time to find water drinking fountains was significantly extended in Hypo 24 h (36.2 +/- 21.9 s) compared to those in Norm (17.9 +/- 12.8 s; P < 0.05), whereas no statistical differences between Norm and Hypo-72 h (22.7 +/- 12.3 s). Moreover, hippocampal BDNF level in Hypo-24 h was significantly lower compared to Norm (189.4 +/- 28.4 vs. 224.9 +/- 47.7 ng/g wet tissue, P < 0.05), whereas no statistically differences in those between Norm and Hypo-72 h (228.1 +/- 39.8 ng/g wet tissue). No significant differences in the changes in corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were observed across the three conditions. When data from Hypo-24 h and Hypo-72 h of hypoxia were pooled, there was a marginal negative relationship between the time to find drinking fountains and BDNF (P < 0.1), and was a significant negative relationship between the locomotor activities and BDNF (P < 0.05). These results suggest that acute hypoxic exposure (24 h) may impair spatial learning and memory; however, it recovered after 72 h of hypoxic exposure. These changes in spatial learning and memory may be associated with changes in the hippocampal BDNF levels in rats.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease with a major economic impact in the global pig industry, and this study aims to identify potential anti-PRRSV drugs. We examined the cytotoxicity of four medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) (caprylic, caprylic monoglyceride, decanoic monoglyceride, and monolaurin) and their inhibition rate against PRRSV. Then the MCFAs with the best anti-PRRSV effect in in vitro assays were selected for subsequent in vivo experiments. Potential anti-PRRSV drugs were evaluated by viral load assay, pathological assay, and cytokine level determination. The results showed that caprylic monoglyceride (CMG) was the least toxic to cells of the four MCFAs, while it had the highest PRRSV inhibition rate. Then the animals were divided into a low-CMG group, a medium-CMG group, and a high-CMG group to conduct the in vivo evaluation. The results indicated that piglets treated with higher concentrations of caprylic monoglyceride were associated with lower mortality and lower viral load after PRRSV infection (p < 0.05). The pulmonary pathology of the piglets also improved after CMG treatment. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha) were significantly downregulated, and the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) were significantly upregulated in the CMG-treated piglets compared to the positive control group (p < 0.05). Taken together, the present study revealed for the first time that caprylic monoglyceride has strong antiviral activity against PRRSV in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that caprylic monoglyceride could potentially be used as a drug to treat PRRS infection.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) activity responded to physical and mechanical cues such as extracellular matrix (ECM), cell density and the mechanical regulation of YAP controlled cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptotic signals. The intervertebral disc (IVD) comprises a heterogeneous population of cells, including those of the nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF), which are diverse in phenotype, partly due to the different ECM and mechanical loads they experience. How do IVD cells sense microenvironment and what is the relationship between YAP and cytoskeleton in the process of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) are not well understood. First, Hippo pathway and cytoskeleton organisation were assessed in the NP and AF of immature (4 weeks), mature (14 weeks), aged (50 weeks), and degenerated (14 weeks, 4 weeks after annulus puncture) IVDs. Second, to assess the effect of ECM composition and cell density on cytoskeleton and YAP levels, we seeded cells at different densities on three types of ECM. In this study, YAP and F-actin activity decreased gradually with age in natural IDD. Hippo signalling was suppressed in the early stages of disc injury, demonstrating the potential for endogenous repair, but this repair did not prevent further disc degeneration. beta-tubulin and vimentin filaments provide the cell with its shape and its elastic properties in resisting mechanical forces. The Hippo pathway and cytoskeleton were shown to be regulated by cell density and the ECM composition.

AB  - Wada testing remains an important component of pre-surgical testing to assess the feasibility of temporal lobectomy for patients with intractable epilepsy. In this procedure, an anesthetic is injected into either internal carotid artery while memory and language testing is performed, simulating the effect of temporal lobe resection. The mechanism remains poorly understood because the hippocampal vasculature is predominantly via the posterior circulation. We recorded hippocampal EEG during bilateral methohexital Wada testing in three patients who had previously been implanted with a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS) to determine the effect of the injections on hippocampal activity. In all six injections from three patients, methohexital caused immediate, transient increases in hippocampal spikes. With at least two of these injections, the electrographic changes were consistent with electrographic seizures. In all cases, the epileptiform activity was not apparent on scalp EEG and was without obvious clinical correlate other than the negative findings expected from the anesthetic. The results demonstrate the utility of intracranial EEG during Wada testing and suggest that the elicitation of seizures or continuous spiking might contribute to dysfunction of the hippocampus during the Wada test. We hypothesize that this effect is due to disconnection and disinhibition of medial temporal structures.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) patch used as an adjuvant therapy in fetal myelomeningocele (MMC) surgery in the ovine model.MethodshUC-MSCs were isolated from human umbilical cords (UC) using the explant method, cultured and characterized. hUC-MSCs were then embedded in a fibrin patch. MMC were surgically created at 75 days of gestation and repaired at 89 days of gestation in sheep fetuses. Two groups were compared: the hUC-MSCs group in which MMC was repaired using a cellular patch and the control group, in which MMC was repaired using an acellular patch. Safety was evaluated by clinical ewes' monitoring during gestation, and clinical and histological examinations of lambs after birth. Efficacy was assessed by clinical neurological evaluation at 2 and 24 h of life using the sheep locomotor rating scale and by histological analyses.ResultsAmong the 17 operated lambs, nine were born alive: six in the hUC-MSCs group and three in the control group. Overall fetal loss was 47% (8/17) without differences between the two groups. No fever was reported in ewes. No tumors were detected in clinical and histological examinations in the lambs. At 24 h of life, mean Sheep Locomotor Rating score was higher in the hUC-MSCs group than in the control group: 15.0 versus 2.0 (p = 0.07). Histological analyses showed a higher large neurons density in the hUC-MSCs group in comparison with the control group: 9.9 versus 6.3/mm2 of gray matter (p = 0.04). Lambs in the hUC-MSCs group had lower fibrosis around the spinal cord and at the level of the MMC scar: 70.9 versus 253.7 mu m (p = 0.10) and 691.3 versus 1684.4 mu m (p = 0,18), respectively.ConclusionsOvine fetal repair of MMC using human UC-MSCs seems to be an effective and safe procedure.

AB  - Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is defined as a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system, witnessing over the past years a remarkable progress in the therapeutic approaches of the inflammatory process. Yet, the ongoing neurodegenerative process is still ambiguous, under-assessed, and probably under-treated. Atrophy and cognitive dysfunction represent the radiological and clinical correlates of such process. In this study, we evaluated the effect of one specific MS treatment, which is natalizumab (NTZ), on brain atrophy evolution in different anatomical regions and its correlation with the cognitive profile and the physical disability. Methods We recruited 20 patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RR-MS) and treated with NTZ. We tracked brain atrophy in different anatomical structures using MRI scans processed with an automated image segmentation technique. We also assessed the progression of physical disability and the cognitive function and its link with the progression of atrophy. Results During the first 2 years of treatment, a significant volume loss was noted within the corpus callosum and the cerebellum gray matter (GM). The annual atrophy rate of the cortical GM, the cerebellum GM, the thalamus, the amygdala, the globus pallidus, and the hippocampus correlated with greater memory impairment. As for the third and fourth years of treatment, a significant atrophy revolved around the gray matter, mainly the cortical one. We also noted an increase of the thalamus volume. Conclusion Atrophy in RR-MS patients treated with NTZ is regional and targeting highly cognitive regions mainly of the subcortical gray matter and the cerebellum. The cerebellum atrophy was a marker of physical disability progression. NTZ did not accelerate the atrophy process in MS and may play a neuroprotective role by increasing the thalamus volume.

AB  - The consumption of a high-fat diet (HFD) has been implicated in the etiology of obesity and various neuropsychiatric disturbances, including anxiety and depression. Compelling evidence suggests that far-infrared ray (FIR) possesses beneficial effects on emotional disorders. However, the efficacy of FIR therapy in addressing HFD-induced anxiety and the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Here, we postulate that FIR emitted from a graphene-based therapeutic device may mitigate HFD-induced anxiety behaviors. The graphene-FIR modify the gut microbiota in HFD-mice, particularly by an enriched abundance of beneficial bacteria Clostridiaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, coupled with a diminution of harmful bacteria Lachnospiraceae, Anaerovoracaceae, Holdemania and Marvinbryantia. Graphene-FIR also improved intestinal barrier function, as evidenced by the augmented expression of the tight junction protein occludin and G protein-coupled receptor 43 (GPR43). In serum level, we observed the decreased free fatty acids (FFA), lipopolysaccharides (LPS), diamine oxidase (DAO) and D-lactate, and increased the glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) levels in graphene-FIR mice. Simultaneously, inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1 beta, and TNF-alpha manifested a decrease subsequent to graphene-FIR treatment in both peripheral and central system. Notably, graphene-FIR inhibited over expression of astrocytes and microglia. We further noticed that the elevated the BDNF and decreased TLR4 and NF-kappa B expression in graphene-FIR group. Overall, our study reveals that graphene-FIR rescued HFD-induced anxiety via improving the intestine permeability and the integrity of blood-brain barrier, and reduced inflammatory response by down regulating TLR4/NF-kappa B inflammatory pathway.

AB  - Correlations between early- and late-life performance are a major prediction of life-history theory. Negative early-late correlations can emerge because biological processes are optimized for early but not late life (e.g., rapid development may accelerate the onset of senescence; "developmental theory of aging") or because allocation to early-life performance comes at a cost in terms of late-life performance (as in the disposable soma theory). But variation in genetic and environmental challenges that each individual has to cope with during early life may also lead to positive early-late life-history trait correlations (the "fixed heterogeneity" or "individual quality" hypothesis). We analyzed individual life-history trajectories of 7,420 known-age female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) monitored over 36 yr to determine how actuarial senescence (a proxy for late-life performance) correlate with age at first reproduction (a proxy for early-life performance). As some breeding events may not be detected in this field study, we used a custom "multievent" hierarchical model to estimate the age at first reproduction and correlate it to other life-history traits. The probability of first reproduction was 0.34 at age 3, with most females breeding for the first time at age 4, and comparatively few at older ages. Females with an early age of first reproduction outperformed delayed breeders in all aspects we considered (survival, rate of senescence, net reproductive output) but one: early breeders appeared to have an onset of actuarial senescence 1 yr earlier compared to late breeders. Genetics and environmental conditions during early life likely explain the positive correlation between early- and late-life performance. Our results provide the first evidence of actuarial senescence in female southern elephant seals.

AB  - Inflammation in the female reproductive system is one of the most common causes of reproductive dysfunction such as infertility, delay of the reproductive cycle and a reduction in reproductive efficiency. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARg) ligands on the expression of selected inflammatory mediators: nuclear factor kappa (NF-KB), interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-4, IL-10, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in the porcine endometrium treated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on days 10-12 and 18-20 of the estrous cycle. In addition, two experimental protocols were applied to evaluate the role of PPARg agonists in ongoing and developing inflammation. Endometrial slices were incubated in vitro in the presence of LPS (to induce inflammation) and PPARg agonists, prostaglandin J2 or pioglitazone (natural or synthetic, respectively). The study showed that PPARg agonists decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory (NFKB, TLR4, IL-6) and increased the abundance of anti-inflammatory mediators (IL-10) in the inflamed endometrium of pigs. These findings indicate anti-inflammatory properties of the tested ligands. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on brain function have previously been investigated; however, the specific neurotransmitter-mediated mechanisms responsible for UV radiation-induced neurobehavioral changes remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms underlying UV radiation-induced neurobehavioral changes. In a mouse model, we observed that UV irradiation of the skin induces deficits in hippocampal memory, synaptic plasticity, and adult neurogenesis, as well as increased dopamine levels in the skin, adrenal glands, and brain. Chronic UV exposure altered the expression of genes involved in dopaminergic neuron differentiation. Furthermore, chronic peripheral dopamine treatments resulted in memory deficits. Systemic administration of a dopamine D1/D5 receptor antagonist reversed changes in memory, synaptic plasticity, adult neurogenesis, and gene expression in UV-irradiated mice. Our findings provide converging evidence that chronic UV exposure alters dopamine levels in the central nervous system and peripheral organs, including the skin, which may underlie the observed neurobehavioral shifts, such as hippocampal memory deficits and impaired neurogenesis. This study underscores the importance of protection from UV exposure and introduces the potential of pharmacological approaches targeting dopamine receptors to counteract the adverse neurological impacts of UV exposure.
   Exposure to ultraviolet radiation, which is a harmful type of light from the sun, can cause skin inflammation and other health problems. This study looked at how UV radiation affects the brain, specifically focusing on dopamine, a chemical in the brain that helps control movement and emotional responses. The researchers did experiments on mice, exposing them to UV radiation and observing changes in their behavior and brain function. They found that UV radiation increased dopamine levels in the skin, adrenal glands, and brain. This increase was linked to memory loss and changes in behavior. The researchers concluded that UV radiation can affect brain function and behavior by changing dopamine levels. This study shows the importance of protecting against UV radiation and suggests that targeting dopamine receptors could help reduce the negative brain effects of UV exposure.This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.

AB  - Several herbivorous caterpillars contain effectors in their oral secretions that alter the emission of green leaf volatiles (GLVs) produced by the plants upon which the caterpillars are feeding. These effectors include an isomerase, a fatty acid dehydratase (FHD), and a heat-stable hexenal trapping (HALT) molecule. GLVs serve as signaling compounds in plant-insect interactions and inter-and intra-plant communication. However, it is not known whether these GLV-altering effectors are common among herbivorous caterpillars, or the evolutionary context of these effectors in relation to GLV emission by host plants in response to feeding damage. Here, we examined the distribution and activity of the isomerase, FHD, and HALT effectors across 10 species spanning 7 lepidopteran families. Six of the 10 species possessed all three effectors in their oral secretions. Activity from the HALT and FHD effectors was observed in all examined caterpillar species, while activity from the isomerase effector varied in some species and was absent in others. There was no discernable pattern in effector activity based on evolutionary divergence, since individual species within a family did not possess similar mechanisms to alter GLV emission. These data, demonstrating the GLV-altering effectors acting at different steps in the GLV biosynthetic pathway and present in the examined caterpillar species at different combinations with different activities, highlight the importance of these effectors in changing the emission of these compounds during caterpillar herbivory. Understanding the prevalence and roles of GLV-altering effectors and GLV emission itself will open new research areas in the dynamics of plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Biological control may benefit from the behavioral manipulation of natural enemies using volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Among these, herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) provide potential tools for attracting or retaining predators and parasitoids of insect pests. This work aimed to characterize the VOCs emitted by pear plants in response to attack by Cacopsylla bidens (Hemiptera: Psyllidae), a major pest in pear orchards, to compare these with VOCs induced by a leaf chewing insect, Argyrotaenia sphaleropa (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), and to evaluate the behavioral response of Chrysoperla externa (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) to HIPVs from pear plants damaged by either herbivore. The results demonstrated that plants damaged by the pear psylla emitted VOC blends with increased amounts of aliphatic aldehydes. Leafroller damage resulted in increased amounts of benzeneacetonitrile, (E)-4,8-dimethylnona-1,3,7-triene, beta-ocimene and caryophyllene. In olfactometer bioassays, larvae of C. externa were attracted to herbivore-damaged plants when contrasted with undamaged plants. When plant odors from psylla-damaged were contrasted with those of leafroller-damaged plants, C.externa preferred the former, also showing shorter response lag-times and higher response rates when psylla-damaged plants were present. Our results suggest that pear plants respond to herbivory by modifying their volatile profile, and that psylla-induced volatiles may be used as prey-specific chemical cues by chrysopid larvae. Our study is the first to report HIPVs in pear plants attacked by C. bidens, as well as the attraction of C. externa to psyllid-induced volatiles.

AB  - Eurema mandarina is a pierid butterfly that primarily feeds on plants in the family Fabaceae. In mainland Japan, adult females preferentially lay eggs on Albizia julibrissin and Lespedeza cuneata. In the field, females may oviposit on non-fabaceous plants, although rarely. When maintained in our laboratory with their natural hosts removed, females showed moderate oviposition responses to Oxalis corniculata (Oxalidaceae), but newly hatched larvae failed to grow to the second instar on the leaves. This indicated that females made oviposition mistakes on O. corniculata because it is not suitable for larval development. We attempted to identify the phytochemicals that regulate oviposition of E. mandarina on O. corniculata. Females hardly responded to the methanolic leaf extract and its aqueous fraction but responded weakly to the most polar subfraction. Further fractionation of this subfraction by ion-exchange column chromatography revealed high oviposition-eliciting activity in the acidic subfraction and low activity in the acidic/neutral/amphoteric and neutral/amphoteric subfractions. Mass spectrometry and oviposition bioassays identified erythronic and threonic acids as stimulants in the acidic subfraction, and arabinose and arabitol as deterrents in the neutral/amphoteric subfraction. Leaf samples of O. corniculata varied greatly in the composition of the four components; however, none contained the concentration of stimulants necessary to induce oviposition without being counteracted by deterrents. These results suggest that oviposition mistakes on O. corniculata, though infrequently, occur when females discover non-hosts with sufficiently high concentrations of stimulants and sufficiently low concentrations of deterrents.

AB  - The cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera, is one of the most destructive agricultural pests in the world, infesting cotton, maize, soybean, and many other crops. In recent years, H. armigera has been observed damaging walnuts, Juglans regia, in Xinjiang China. Here we examine the chemical perception by H. armigera of the marginal host J. regia. In Y-tube olfactometer tests, we found H. armigera females and males both showed significant behavioral responses to odors from walnut branches. Furthermore, nine electrophysiologically active volatiles (alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, myrcene, limonene, eucalyptol, ocimene, beta-caryophyllene, (E)-beta-farnesene, and germacrene D) were identified from walnuts with gas chromatography coupled with electroantennography (GC-EAD) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Among these volatiles, beta-pinene and eucalyptol were released in relatively higher amounts. In electroantennogram (EAG) dose-dependent trials, all compounds evoked responses in H. armigera adults when tested at high concentrations, with germacrene D evoking the greatest response. In wind tunnel tests, H. armigera females preferred eight of the electrophysiologically active volatile dilutions compared with clean air, while males showed preference for only five compounds. As such we describe the chemical recognition of H. armigera for walnut, a marginal host. This study contributes to understanding the interaction between polyphagous pests and their host plants.

AB  - Background and aims - Fluorescence is the emission of light by a fluorophore that has absorbed light of shorter wavelengths. While the role of fluorescence in visual communication has been documented in some animals (budgerigars, gelatinous zooplankton), it is controversially discussed in plants. Floral nectar fluorescence has been mainly found in flowers pollinated by bees. It has been suggested as direct visual cue by which bees can evaluate the available quantity of nectar, thus being important for pollination and foraging efficiency. However, this function has been questioned, since fluorescence is said to be obscured by floral reflections due to low quantum efficiency. The aim of this study was to examine the nectar of plants pollinated by non-flying mammals, namely Eucomis regia, Massonia grandiflora, M. echinata, and M. pustulata (Asparagaceae) from South Africa. Material and methods - To detect possible fluorescence in flowers, the plants were illuminated in a darkened room under UV light and photographed with a camera equipped with a UV/IR cut filter (transmitting at 400-700 nm). Key results - Within the inflorescences, the nectar of all species showed blue to bluish fluorescence and UV absorption. Conclusion - As fluorescence in flowers occurs not only in bee-pollinated plants but also in plants pollinated by wind, and by nocturnal or crepuscular pollinators (non-flying mammals, bats, moths) for which floral scent is an important attractant, floral fluorescence seems to have no adaptive value for the attraction of flower visitors. We discuss the potential role of fluorescence in flowers as just a by-product of compounds that might have other functions such as visual attraction by reflection (or UV absorbance), protection of genetic material in pollen from UV induced damage, or as a floral filter causing nectar to be bitter, repelling ineffective pollinators but not effective ones.

AB  - Hydrangea (Hydrangea arborescens var. "Annabelle") flowers are composed of sweet aroma sepals rather than true petals and can change color. Floral volatiles plays important roles in plants, such as attracting pollinators, defending against herbivores, and signaling. However, the biosynthesis and regulatory mechanisms underlying fragrance formation in H. arborescens during flower development remain unknown. In this study, a combination of metabolite profiling and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was employed to identify genes associated with floral scent biosynthesis mechanisms in "Annabelle" flowers at three developmental stages (F1, F2, and F3). The floral volatile data revealed that the "Annabelle" volatile profile includes a total of 33 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and VOCs were abundant during the F2 stage of flower development, followed by the F1 and F3 stages, respectively. Terpenoids and benzenoids/phenylpropanoids were abundant during the F2 and F1 stages, with the latter being the most abundant, whereas fatty acid derivatives and other compounds were found in large amounts during the F3 stage. According to ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer analysis, benzene and substituted derivatives, carboxylic acids and derivatives, and fatty acyls play a significant role in the floral metabolite profile. The transcriptome data revealed a total of 17,461 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with 7585, 12,795, and 9044 DEGs discovered between the F2 and F1, F3 and F1, and F2 and F3 stages, respectively. Several terpenoids and benzenoids/phenylpropanoids biosynthesis-related DEGs were identified, and GRAS/bHLH/MYB/AP2/WRKY were more abundant among transcription factors. Finally, DEGs interlinked with VOCs compounds were determined using Cytoscape and k-means analysis. Our results pave the way for the discovery of new genes, critical data for future genetic studies, and a platform for the metabolic engineering of genes involved in the production of Hydrangea's signature floral fragrance.

AB  - Terpene synthases (TPSs) have diverse biological functions in plants. Though the roles of TPSs in herbivore defense are well established in many plant species, their role in bacterial defense has been scarce and is emerging. Through functional genomics, here we report the in planta role of potato (Solanum tuberosum) terpene synthase (StTPS18) in bacterial defense. Expression of StTPS18 was highest in leaves and was induced in response to Pseudomonas syringae and methyl jasmonate treatments. The recombinant StTPS18 exhibited bona fide (E,E)-farnesol synthase activity forming a sesquiterpenoid, (E,E)-farnesol as the sole product, utilising (E,E)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Subcellular localization of GFP fusion protein revealed that StTPS18 is localized to the cytosol. Silencing and overexpression of StTPS18 in potato resulted in reduced and enhanced tolerance, respectively, to bacterial pathogens P. syringae and Ralstonia solanacearum. Bacterial growth assay using medium containing (E,E)-farnesol significantly inhibited P. syringae growth. Moreover, StTPS18 overexpressing transgenic potato and Nicotiana tabacum leaves, and (E,E)-farnesol and P. syringae infiltrated potato leaves exhibited elevated expression of sterol pathway and members of pathogenesis-related genes with enhanced phytosterol accumulation. Interestingly, enhanced phytosterols in C-13(3)-(E,E)-farnesol infiltrated potato leaves were devoid of any noticeable C-13 labeling, indicating no direct utilization of (E,E)-farnesol in phytosterols formation. Furthermore, leaves of StTPS18 overexpressing transgenic lines had no detectable (E,E)-farnesol similar to the control plant, and emitted lower levels of sesquiterpenes than the control. These findings point towards an indirect involvement of StTPS18 and its product (E,E)-farnesol in bacterial defense through upregulation of phytosterol biosynthesis and defense genes.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is concocted from tea plant shoot tips that produce catechins, caffeine, theanine, and terpenoids, which collectively determine the rich flavors and health benefits of the infusion. However, little is known about the integrated regulation of shoot tip development and characteristic secondary metabolite biosynthesis in tea plants. Here, we demonstrate that MYB transcription factors (TFs) play key and yet diverse roles in regulating leaf and stem development, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and environmental stress responses in tea plants. By integrating transcriptomic and metabolic profiling data in different tissues at a series of developmental stages or under various stress conditions, alongside biochemical and genetic analyses, we predicted the MYB TFs involved in regulating shoot development (CsMYB2, 98, 107, and 221), epidermal cell initiation (CsMYB184, 41, 139, and 219), stomatal initiation (CsMYB113 and 153), and the biosynthesis of flavonoids (including catechins, anthocyanins, and flavonols; CsMYB8 and 99), caffeine (CsMYB85 and 86), theanine (CsMYB9 and 49), carotenoids (CsMYB110), mono-/sesquiterpenoid volatiles (CsMYB68, 147, 148, and 193), lignin (CsMYB164 and 192), and indolic compounds (CsMYB139, 162, and 198), as well as the MYB TFs that are likely involved in hormone signaling-mediated environmental stress and defense responses. We characterized the functions of some key MYBs in regulating flavonoid and carotenoid biosynthesis for tea quality and flavor. This study provides a cross-family analysis of MYBs in tea alongside new insights into the coordinated regulation of tea plant shoot development and secondary metabolism, paving the way towards understanding of tea quality trait formation and genetic improvement of quality tea plants.

AB  - Background Catechins are crucial in determining the flavour and health benefits of tea, but it remains unclear that how the light intensity regulates catechins biosynthesis. Therefore, we cultivated tea plants in a phytotron to elucidate the response mechanism of catechins biosynthesis to light intensity changes. Results In the 250 mu mol center dot m(- 2)center dot s(- 1) treatment, the contents of epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate and total catechins were increased by 98.94, 14.5 and 13.0% respectively, compared with those in the 550 mu mol center dot m(- 2)center dot s(- 1) treatment. Meanwhile, the photosynthetic capacity was enhanced in the 250 mu mol center dot m(- 2)center dot s(- 1) treatment, including the electron transport rate, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and expression of related genes (such as CspsbA, CspsbB, CspsbC, CspsbD, CsPsbR and CsGLK1). In contrast, the extremely low or high light intensity decreased the catechins accumulation and photosynthetic capacity of the tea plants. The comprehensive analysis revealed that the response of catechins biosynthesis to the light intensity was mediated by the photosynthetic capacity of the tea plants. Appropriately high light upregulated the expression of genes related to photosynthetic capacity to improve the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), and electron transfer rate (ETR), which enhanced the contents of substrates for non-esterified catechins biosynthesis (such as EGC). Meanwhile, these photosynthetic capacity-related genes and gallic acid (GA) biosynthesis-related genes (CsaroB, CsaroDE1, CsaroDE2 and CsaroDE3) co-regulated the response of GA accumulation to light intensity. Eventually, the epigallocatechin gallate content was enhanced by the increased contents of its precursors (EGC and GA) and the upregulation of the CsSCPL gene. Conclusions In this study, the catechin content and photosynthetic capacity of tea plants increased under appropriately high light intensities (250 mu mol center dot m(- 2)center dot s(- 1) and 350 mu mol center dot m(- 2)center dot s(- 1)) but decreased under extremely low or high light intensities (150 mu mol center dot m(- 2)center dot s(- 1) or 550 mu mol center dot m(- 2)center dot s(- 1)). We found that the control of catechin accumulation by light intensity in tea plants is mediated by the plant photosynthetic capacity. The research provided useful information for improving catechins content and its light-intensity regulation mechanism in tea plant.

TI  - Antifungal Activity and Possible Mode of Action of Ningnanmycin Against Tea Gray Blight Disease Pathogen Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - MECHANISM
AB  - Gray blight is a serious disease of tea (Camellia sinensis) for which there is currently no effective control or preventive measure apart from fungicides. Screening for effectiveness of a natural antimicrobial against this pathogen and identifying its mode of action could contribute to the management of this disease. Antifungal activity of the antimicrobial ningnanmycin (NNM) from Streptomyces noursei var. xichangensis against the pathogen causing gray blight disease, Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis strain GZHS-2017-010, was confirmed in vitro by the mycelial growth rate method. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were used to observe morphological changes in hyphae of P. camelliae-sinensis treated with NNM. RNA sequencing, bioinformatics, and quantitative real-time PCR were used to identify genes in the hyphae that were differentially expressed in response to treatment with NNM. Thirty-eight genes from 16 pathways, known as targets of antifungal agents, were used to investigate gene expression in hyphae at the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50), EC30, and EC70 for 1, 7, or 14 h. The results indicated that NNM can inhibit the growth of hyphae in vitro, with an EC50 of 75.92 U/ml, inducing morphological changes in organelles, septa, and extracellular polysaccharides, targeting ribosomes to disturb translation in protein synthesis and influencing some biosynthetic functions of the hyphae.

AB  - Background In the present study, we investigated the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on cognitive behaviors in female rats with a high-fat diet + streptozotocin (STZ)-induced type 2 diabetes.Methods Twenty-four female rats were divided into four groups randomly (n = 6): control (C), control + exercise (Co + EX), diabetes mellitus (type 2) (T2D), and diabetes mellitus + exercise (T2D + EX). Diabetes was induced by a two-month high-fat diet and a single dose of STZ (35 mg/kg) in the T2D and T2D + EX groups. The Co + EX and T2D + EX groups performed HIIT for eight weeks (five sessions per week, running on a treadmill at 80-100% of VMax, 4-10 intervals). Elevated plus maze (EPM) and open field test (OFT) were used for assessing anxiety-like behaviors, and passive avoidance test (PAT) and Morris water maze (MWM) were applied for evaluating learning and memory. The hippocampal levels of beta-amyloid (A beta) and Tau were also assessed using Western blot.Results An increase in fasting blood glucose (FBG), hippocampal level of Tau, and a decrease in the percentage of open arm time (%OAT) as an index of anxiety-like behavior were seen in the female diabetic rats which could be reversed by HIIT. In addition, T2D led to a significant decrease in rearing and grooming in the OFT. No significant difference among groups was seen for the latency time in the PAT and learning and memory in the MWM.Conclusions HIIT could improve anxiety-like behavior at least in part through changes in hippocampal levels of Tau.

AB  - Plant defense against herbivores is primarily regulated by the phytohormone jasmonate (JA). At the core, JA signaling is the MYC2 transcription factor (TF) that regulates the expression of an extensive array of defense-related genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying MYC2-mediated herbivore resistance in rice are not fully understood. We employed brown planthopper (BPH) bioassays, transcriptional activation assays, transcriptome profiling, targeted metabolomics and cleavage under targets and tagmentation-sequencing analysis to investigate the biological function and regulatory mechanism of the JAMYB TF. JAMYB is induced by BPH infestation and is transcriptionally regulated by MYC2. Mutations of JAMYB rendered rice plants susceptible to BPH attacks under laboratory and field conditions, indicating that JAMYB positively contributes to BPH resistance. BPH-elicited biosynthesis of phenolamides and volatile compounds was reduced in jamyb mutants compared with wild-type plants. These specialized metabolites, regulated by JAMYB, function as direct and indirect defenses to deter BPH damage or attract parasitoid wasps of BPH eggs. Furthermore, we found that JAMYB directly binds to AC motifs of key phenylpropanoid pathway genes and activates their expression, likely altering the metabolic flux for phenolamide biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the MYC2-JAMYB module in JA-mediated rice resistance to BPH.

AB  - Plants are constantly exposed to a wide range of stress situations, such as biotic stressors caused by pathogenic microbes and herbivores, as well as abiotic stress factors like drought, salinity, and severe temperature. Plants have developed an intricate and sophisticated network of molecular signaling in response to various stresses that allow them to recognize and respond to challenging circumstances. Plant peptides have emerged as key participants in orchestrating biotic and abiotic stress responses, as well as taking part in signaling pathways for reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS play a key role as secondary messengers in stress signaling and include chemicals, including superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen. This exhaustive review investigates the multiple functions of plant peptides in ROS signaling and stress responses and clarifies the interaction between plant peptide-mediated stress responses and ROS signaling. We have highlighted several plant peptide classes such as defense peptides, antimicrobial peptides and signaling peptides that contribute to the complex interaction between abiotic and biotic stress response pathways. A thorough overview of the complex regulatory network that permits plants to flourish under demanding environmental conditions is presented by synthesizing recent gains in our knowledge of the functions of plant peptides in stress responses and ROS signaling. We have also highlighted the fact that knowledge of such peptide-mediated signaling may be used for crop improvement that would increase agricultural sustainability and stress tolerance, ultimately boosting food security and environmental resilience on a global scale.

AB  - Plants activate an immune or symbiotic response depending on the detection of distinct signals from root-interacting microbes. Both signalling cascades involve Ca2+ as a central mediator of early signal transduction. In this study, we combined aequorin- and cameleon-based methods to dissect the changes in cytosolic and nuclear Ca2+ concentration caused by different chitin-derived fungal elicitors in Lotus japonicus roots. Our quantitative analyses highlighted the dual character of the evoked Ca2+ responses taking advantage of the comparison between different genetic backgrounds: an initial Ca2+ influx, dependent on the LysM receptor CERK6 and independent of the common symbiotic signalling pathway (CSSP), is followed by a second CSSP-dependent and CERK6-independent phase, that corresponds to the well-known perinuclear/nuclear Ca2+ spiking. We show that the expression of immunity marker genes correlates with the amplitude of the first Ca2+ change, depends on elicitor concentration, and is controlled by Ca2+ storage in the vacuole. Our findings provide an insight into the Ca2+-mediated signalling mechanisms discriminating plant immunity- and symbiosis-related pathways in the context of their simultaneous activation by single fungal elicitors.

AB  - Plants perceive environmental stresses as whole organisms via distant signals conveying danger messages through their vasculature. In parallel to vascular transport, airborne plant volatile compounds, including green leaf volatiles (GLVs), can bypass the lack of vascular connection. However, some small volatile compounds move through the vasculature; such vascular transport is little known about GLVs. Here we illustrate GLV alcohols as solutes move within xylem vessels in Zea mays. We describe GLV alcohols, including Z-3-hexen-ol and its isomer E-3-hexen-ol, which is not synthesized in maize, moving through the transpiration stream via xylem vessels. Since transpiration is mediated by the stomatal aperture, closing stomata by two independent methods diminishes the transport of GLV alcohol and its isomer. In addition, the lower transport of GLV alcohols impairs their function in inducing terpenoid biosynthesis, suggesting that xylem transport of GLV alcohols plays a significant role in their systemic function. Our study suggests that GLV alcohols, in addition to airborne signals, are transported through xylem vessels. Our findings can be critical in future studies about the perception and function of these compounds in plants.

AB  - Composite generalist herbivores are comprised of host-adapted populations that retain the ability to shift hosts. The degree and overlap of mechanisms used by host-adapted generalist and specialist herbivores to overcome the same host plant defenses are largely unknown. Tetranychidae mites are exceptionally suited to address the relationship between host adaptation and specialization in herbivores as this group harbors closely related species with remarkably different host ranges-an extreme generalist the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch [Tu]) and the Solanaceous specialist Tetranychus evansi (Te). Here, we used tomato-adapted two-spotted spider mite (Tu-A) and Te populations to compare mechanisms underlying their host adaptation and specialization. We show that both mites attenuate induced tomato defenses, including protease inhibitors (PIs) that target mite cathepsin L digestive proteases. While Te solely relies on transcriptional attenuation of PI induction, Tu and Tu-A have elevated constitutive activity of cathepsin L proteases, making them less susceptible to plant anti-digestive proteins. Tu-A and Te also rely on detoxification of tomato constitutive defenses. Te uses esterase and P450 activities, while Tu-A depends on the activity of all major detoxification enzymatic classes to disarm tomato defensive compounds to a lesser extent. Thus, even though both Tu-A and Te use similar mechanisms to counteract tomato defenses, Te can better cope with them. This finding is congruent with the ecological and evolutionary times required to establish mite adaptation and specialization states, respectively.

AB  - Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid-type phytohormones that not only control growth and development but also responses to biotic and abiotic stressors in plants. However, little is known about the function of BRs in the protection of tea against the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum fructicola causing anthracnose disease. Here, we revealed that 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) could improve tea resistance against C. fructicola, which was linked to the EBR-induced accumulation of lignin in tea leaves. Time-course of the relative expression of ITS/Cs18SrDNA showed that its expression increased after the inoculation with C. fructicola; however, EBR pretreatment significantly decreased the ITS/Cs18SrDNA expression at 3, 24 and 96 h postinoculation. Following an initial increase in 3 h postinoculation, lignin content significantly decreased from 6 to 24 h postinoculation with C. fructicola. In contrast to inoculation with only C. fructicola, exogenous EBR pretreatment significantly increased lignin contents throughout the postinoculation period. According to the qRT-PCR assay, EBR and C. fructicola differentially regulated the expression of 14 genes involved in the phenylpropanoid and lignin-specific pathways. Moreover, the activity of peroxidase (POD), a central enzyme in the final phase of lignin biosynthesis increased significantly at 3 h postinoculation with EBR treatment. Gene expression analysis revealed that EBR induced CsMYB4-like expression possibly to activate the transcription of CsPOD5-like gene responsible for lignin biosynthesis in response to C. fructicola. These findings suggest that EBR plays a positive role in disease resistance by inducing lignin synthesis, which may have potential application for the prevention of C. fructicola in tea plants.

AB  - The current crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the global economy hard, causing significant damage to every aspect of the global banking system, and Bangladesh is no exception. For that reason, its performance and profitability have been affected. In this study, we investigate the impact of COVID-19 on the financial performance and profitability of the listed private commercial banks in Bangladesh. We initially compute each bank's financial performance index (FPI) to determine the position according to their financial performance individually before and the current period of COVID-19 by the standardized CAMELS rating system. After assessing the position, the fixed-effect regression model is used to explore the impact of the bank's specific variables and macroeconomic variables along with the banks' variables on the banks' profitability. The banks that performed better during the pre-pandemic period of COVID-19 also performed better during the pandemic period of COVID-19. The performance of AIBL, EBL, and BBL was almost autonomously higher during both periods. In the case of bank profitability, our paper discovered that during the pandemic period of COVID-19, high non-performing loan rates, holding more liquid assets, a high amount of hedging capital, and inappropriate bank size lessened the banks' profitability. In contrast, a low leverage position and inflation rate enhanced the bank's profitability during this period. The outcome of this study will help bank authorities detect the loopholes and take preventive measures that can improve their profitability during a crisis period like COVID-19. The investors and depositors who invest money in banks can precisely decide their portfolios.

AB  - Hippocampal circuitry stimulation is sufficient to regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis and ameliorate depressive-like behavior, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, it is shown that inhibition of medial septum (MS)-dentate gyrus (DG) circuit reverses the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced depression-like behavior. Further analysis exhibits that inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons in MS projecting to the DG (MSGABA+-DG) increases the expression of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in somatostatin (SOM) positive interneurons of DG, which contributes to the antidepressant-like effects. Overexpression of the PDGF-BB or exogenous administration of PDGF-BB in DG rescues the effect of chronic stress on the inhibition of neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation and dendritic growth of adult-born hippocampal neurons, as well as on depressive-like behaviors. Conversely, knockdown of PDGF-BB facilitates CSDS-induced deficit of hippocampal neurogenesis and promotes the susceptibility to chronic stress in mice. Finally, conditional knockdown platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFR beta) in NSCs blocks an increase in NSCs proliferation and the antidepressant effects of PDGF-BB. These results delineate a previously unidentified PDGF-BB/PDGFR beta signaling in regulating depressive-like behaviors and identify a novel mechanism by which the MSGABA+-DG pathway regulates the expression of PDGF-BB in SOM-positive interneurons.

AB  - Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) type VI glandular trichomes that occur on the surface of leaves, stems, young fruits and flowers produce and store a blend of volatile monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. These compounds play important roles in the interaction with pathogens and herbivorous insects. Although the function of terpene synthases in the biosynthesis of volatile terpenes in tomato has been comprehensively investigated, the deciphering of their transcriptional regulation is only just emerging. We selected transcription factors that are over-expressed in trichomes based on existing transcriptome data and silenced them individually by virus-induced gene silencing. Of these, SlSCL3, a scarecrow-like (SCL) subfamily transcription factor, led to a significant decrease in volatile terpene content and expression of the corresponding terpene synthase genes when its transcription level was downregulated. Overexpression of SlSCL3 dramatically increased both the volatile terpene content and glandular trichome size, whereas its homozygous mutants showed reduced terpene biosynthesis. However, its heterozygous mutants also showed a significantly elevated volatile terpene content and enlarged glandular trichomes, similar to the overexpression plants. SlSCL3 modulates the expression of terpene biosynthetic pathway genes by transcriptional activation, but neither direct protein-DNA binding nor interaction with known regulators was observed. Moreover, transcript levels of the endogenous copy of SlSCL3 were decreased in the overexpression plants but increased in the heterozygous and homozygous mutants, suggesting feedback repression of its own promoter. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the role of SlSCL3 in the complex regulation of volatile terpene biosynthesis and glandular trichome development in tomato.

AB  - The gray blight incited by Pestalotiopsis and allied genera is a prevalent disease affecting tea cultivation, and managing it with Trichoderma spp. is an alternative to synthetic fungicides. Plants modify their arsenal system against pathogens when they are exposed to Trichoderma spp., which produces proteins and enzymes associated with pathogenesis. Understanding the expression pattern of defense-related markers will help in developing gray blight resistance tea cultivars. Thus, this study intended to induce resistance against gray blight in tea by Trichoderma harzianum TIND02. For this, a total of eight Trichoderma isolates originated from organic tea rhizospheres were characterized and evaluated for their efficacy. Dual culture test revealed isolate TIND02 as the most potential candidate with 74.6% inhibitory activity against gray blight pathogen Pseudopestalotiopsis theae. Molecular characterization based on ITS and tef-1 alpha genes confirmed isolate TIND02 as T. harzianum. Scanning electron microscopic study showed the mycoparasitic nature of T. harzianum TIND02 (TH-TIND02) to Ps. theae. The ethyl acetate extract of TH-TIND02 at 100 and 200 mu g mL(-1) showed potential inhibitory activity (>69.9%) against Ps. theae which confirmed the presence of higher volatile metabolites. Gas chromatography-Mass spectrometry study revealed that ethyl acetate extract of TH-TIND02 was composed of 21 major and minor volatile organic compounds with acetamide, 2, 2, 2-trifluoro-N, N-bis trimethyIsilyl-C (94.74%) as a major component. The isolate also produced chitinase, cellulase, beta-1, 3 glucanase, and protease hydrolytic enzymes. Nursery experiments revealed that 2% and 5% doses (2 x 10(6) CFU mL(-1)) of TH-TIND02 significantly reduced respective 65.0% and 70.0% disease severity over control with improved plant growth. Besides, expressions of defense-related enzymes (chitinase, pHenolics, peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, beta-1, 3-glucanase, and polyphenol oxidase) and pathogenesis-related genes (chitinase and beta-1, 3-glucanase) due to TH-TIND02 were determined. The secretion of defense-related enzymes was highly upregulated in plants applied with TH-TIND02 followed by Ps. theae inoculation compared to controls. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that the expression of both genes in co-inoculated plants was two-fold higher than in control after 21-day post incubation. These results suggest that TH-TIND02 application reduced gray blight severity by elevated enzyme activity and overexpressed pathogenesis-related genes in tea plants which offer for its eco-friendly and sustainable use as a bio-fungicide in tea gardens.

AB  - Trichomes, specialized hair-like structures on the surfaces of many plants, play a crucial role in defense against herbivorous insects. We investigated the biomechanics of type VI glandular trichome rupture in cultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and a wild relative (Solanum habrochaites). Using micropipette force sensors and high-speed imaging, we uncovered the rupture mechanics underlying gland bursting, highlighting the small forces and short time scales involved in this process. Additionally, we observed larvae of the Western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), a major pest in tomato cultivation, inadvertently triggering trichome rupture and accumulating glandular secretions on their bodies. We developed a method to directly measure these insect-triggered rupture forces by analyzing the trichome stalk deflections during these interactions, which yielded forces of the same order of magnitude as our micropipette measurements. These findings demonstrate how rapid gland bursting and the fluid dynamics of glandular secretions act as an efficient and swift plant defense mechanism against insect herbivory.
   Glandular trichomes function as ultra-fast biomechanical defense triggers in tomatoes, rupturing upon contact with insects and exposing them to sticky and toxic secretions.

AB  - While Egypt's ' s canola production per unit area has recently grown, productivity remains low, necessitating increased productivity. Hydrogels are water -absorbent polymer compounds that can optimize irrigation schedules by increasing the soil's ' s ability to retain water. Accordingly, two fi eld experiments were conducted to examine hydrogel application to sandy soil on canola growth, biochemical aspects, yield, yield traits, and nutritional quality of yielded seeds grown under water deficit fi cit stress conditions. The experiments were conducted by arranging a split -plot layout in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three times replications of each treatment. While water stress at 75% or 50% of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) lowered chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, and total pigments content, indole-3-acetic acid, plant development, seed yield, and oil and total carbohydrates of seed yield, hydrogel treatment enhanced all of the traits mentioned above. Furthermore, hydrogel enhanced to gather compatible solutes (proline, amino acids, total soluble sugars), phenolics content in leaves, seed protein, and crop water productivity, which increased while the plants were under water stress. The results revealed that the full irrigation (100%ETc) along with hydrogel compared to water -stressed (50%ETc) led to enhanced seed yield (kg ha -1 ), Oil (%), and Total carbohydrates (%) of rapeseed by 57.1%, 11.1% and 15.7%, respectively. Likewise, under water -stressed plots with hydrogel exhibited enhancement by 10.0%, 3.2% and 5.1% in seed yield (kg ha -1 ), oil (%), and total carbohydrates (%) of rapeseed by 57.1%, 11.1% and 15.7%, respectively compared to control. As a result, the use of hydrogel polymer will be a viable and practical solution for increasing agricultural output under water deficit fi cit stress situations.

AB  - Bridelia ferruginea Benth is a plant usually found in Savannah regions, used in ethno-medicine for treatment of dysentery, elephantiasis, intestinal and bladder disorder. Chemical compounds present in the leaf, twig, stem bark, stem wood and root wood of Bridelia ferruginea essential oils, their antioxidant and toxicity assays are been reported. The essential oils were obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by means of gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antioxidant assay was conducted using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) while the brine shrimp lethality test was carried out using Artemia salina eggs. Leaf, twig, stem bark, stem wood and root wood essential oils gave yields of 0.44%, 0.42%, 0.51%, 0.20% and 0.26% respectively. A total of eighty-two (82) compounds were identified in the five essential oils. Ethyl salicylate was the dominant constituent of the leaf essential oil (41.15%) while methyl salicylate was most abundant in the twig (33.33%) and stem bark (24.67%) essential oils. Stem wood oil contained ethyl salicylate (12.60%) while the root wood oil was composed mostly of 1-octadecene (18.53%). The antioxidant assay showed that stem bark had the most activity (53.12 mu g/mL) while the least activity was recorded for twig oil (1037.14 mu g/mL). The brine shrimp lethality test revealed that lethal concentration at 50% level (LC50) for leaf essential oil was non-toxic (74361.99 mu g/mL). Bridelia ferruginea is rich in antioxidants; significant amounts of monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenes in the essential oils support the use of the plants in ethno-medicine.

AB  - Trypsin inhibitors (TIs) are widely distributed in plants and are known to play a protective role against herbivores. TIs reduce the biological activity of trypsin, an enzyme involved in the breakdown of many different proteins, by inhibiting the activation and catalytic reactions of proteins. Soybean (Glycine max) contains two major TI classes: Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI) and Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI). Both genes encoding TI inactivate trypsin and chymotrypsin enzymes, which are the main digestive enzymes in the gut fluids of Lepidopteran larvae feeding on soybean. In this study, the possible role of soybean TIs in plant defense against insects and nematodes was investigated. A total of six TIs were tested, including three known soybean trypsin inhibitors (KTI1, KTI2 and KTI3) and three genes encoding novel inhibitors identified in soybean (KTI5, KTI7, and BBI5). Their functional role was further examined by overexpression of the individual TI genes in soybean and Arabidopsis. The endogenous expression patterns of these TI genes varied among soybean tissues, including leaf, stem, seed, and root. In vitro enzyme inhibitory assays showed significant increase in trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitory activities in both transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis. Detached leaf-punch feeding bioassays detected significant reduction in corn earworm (Helicoverpa zea) larval weight when larvae fed on transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis lines, with the greatest reduction observed in KTI7 and BBI5 overexpressing lines. Whole soybean plant greenhouse feeding bioassays with H. zea on KTI7 and BBI5 overexpressing lines resulted in significantly reduced leaf defoliation compared to non-transgenic plants. However, bioassays of KTI7 and BBI5 overexpressing lines with soybean cyst nematode (SCN, Heterodera glycines) showed no differences in SCN female index between transgenic and non-transgenic control plants. There were no significant differences in growth and productivity between transgenic and non-transgenic plants grown in the absence of herbivores to full maturity under greenhouse conditions. The present study provides further insight into the potential applications of TI genes for insect resistance improvement in plants.

AB  - Dioecious plants have evolved effective defense strategies to deal with various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little is known regarding sexual differences in their defense against herbivores. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of systemic defense responses in male and female Populus cathayana attacked by Plagiodera versicolora Laicharting. The results revealed that P. cathayana exhibits sexually differential responses to a defoliator. The percentage of damaged leaf area was greater in males than in females. Furthermore, the observed saccharide changes imply that males and females exhibit different response times to defoliators. The contents of flavonoids and anthocyanins were significantly increased in both sexes but were higher in females. Specifically, the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway plays an important role. Expression of pest-related genes further revealed that hormones induce changes in downstream genes and metabolites, and upregulation of JA ZIM-domain (JAZ) and CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1) was more significant in females. In the undamaged adjacent leaves, metabolite and gene changes displayed similar patterns to the damaged local leaves, but levels of JA, JAZ1, and COI1 were higher in females. Therefore, our data confirmed that plants initiate the JA pathway to defend against herbivores, that there is systematic signal transduction, and that this ability is stronger in females than in males. This study provides new insights into the resistance of dioecious plants to herbivory and adds a new theoretical basis for the systemic signal transduction of plants in response to biotic stress.

AB  - Histone modifications (HMs) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression in every domain of life. Tea (Camellia assamica), which is a woody perennial plant, is exposed to various stresses during its different developmental stages and HMs are expected to play crucial roles in its adaptation under different stress conditions. Characterization of tea HM genes is still unexplored, therefore in the present study a complete genome-wide characterization of HM genes was performed. Around 77 HM genes representing 10 subfamilies were identified. Further, detailed characterization of gene structures, identification of conserved motifs, and domains, phylogenetic analysis, identification of cis elements and localization in the chromosomes were carried out. Comparative analysis showed that C. assamica had nearly half of the HM genes (77) that were found in China type tea, i.e., C. sinensis (151). Protein-protein interactions showed that HM genes of C. assamica participated in different plant developmental processes, seed dormancy, phytohormone signaling and biotic as well as abiotic stresses. Gene expression analysis through qRT-PCR from five different developmental tissues of tea plant and under three different abiotic stresses (cold, dehydration and salinity) showed that 26 family members had differential expression indicating their involvement in various developmental stages or responses under different abiotic stresses in tea plant.

AB  - Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] is currently gaining considerable attention as a potential oilseed feedstock for biofuel, oil and feed source, and bioproducts. Studies have shown the potential of using camelina in an intercropping system. However, there are no camelina genotypes evaluated or bred for shade tolerance. The objective of this study was to evaluate and determine the shade tolerance of sixteen spring camelina genotypes (growth stage: BBCH 103; the plants with 4-5 leaves) for intercropping systems. In this study, we simulated three different shade levels, including low (LST), medium (MST), and high shade treatments (HST; 15, 25, and 50% reduction of natural light intensity, respectively), and evaluated the photosynthetic and physiological parameters, seed production, and seed quality. The mean chlorophyll pigments, including the total chlorophyll and chlorophyll a and b across the 16 genotypes increased as shade level increased, while the chlorophyll fluorescence parameter F-v/F-m, chlorophyll a/b, leaf area, the number of silicles and branches plant(-1) decreased as shade level increased. The first day of anthesis and days of flowering duration of camelina treated with shade were significantly delayed and shortened, respectively, as shade increased. The shortened lifecycle and altered flowering phenology decreased camelina seed yield. Additionally, the shade under MST and HST reduced the seed oil content and unsaturated fatty acids, but not saturated fatty acids. The dendrograms constructed using the comprehensive tolerance membership values revealed that CamK9, CamC4, and 'SO-40' were the relatively shade-tolerant genotypes among the 16 camelina genotypes. These camelina genotypes can grow under the shade level up to a 25% reduction in natural light intensity producing a similar seed yield and seed oil quality, indicating the potential to intercrop with maize or other small grain crops. The present study provided the baseline information on the response of camelina genotypes to different shade levels, which would help in selecting or breeding shade-tolerant genotypes.

AB  - Certain tea plants (Camellia sinensis) have the ability to accumulate selenium. In plants, the predominant forms of bioavailable Se are selenite (SeO32-) and selenate (SeO42-). We applied transcriptomics and proteomics to hydroponically grown plants treated with selenite or selenate for 48 h in the attempt to elucidate the selenium absorption and assimilation mechanisms in tea. A total of 1,844 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 691 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were obtained by comparing the Na2SeO3 and Na2SeO4 treatments against the control. A GO analysis showed that the genes related to amino acid and protein metabolism and redox reaction were strongly upregulated in the plants under the Na2SeO3 treatment. A KEGG pathway analysis revealed that numerous genes involved in amino acid and glutathione metabolism were upregulated, genes and proteins associated with glutathione metabolism and ubiquinone and terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis were highly expressed. Genes participating in DNA and RNA metabolism were identified and proteins related to glutathione metabolism were detected in tea plants supplemented with Na2SeO4. ABC, nitrate and sugar transporter genes were differentially expressed in response to selenite and selenate. Phosphate transporter (PHT3;1a, PHT1;3b, and PHT1;8) and aquaporin (NIP2;1) genes were upregulated in the presence of selenite. Sulfate transporter (SULTR1;1 and SULTR2;1) expression increased in response to selenate exposure. The results of the present study have clarified Se absorption and metabolism in tea plants, and play an important theoretical reference significance for the breeding and cultivation of selenium-enriched tea varieties.

AB  - Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) are pathogenesis-related (PR5) proteins, which are induced in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. The present work was carried out to clone TLP of Camellia sinensis (CsTLP) and to evaluate the response of transgenic lines of Arabidopsis constitutively expressing CsTLP under drought conditions. Data showed that transgenic lines exhibited lower relative electrolyte leakage and higher water retention capacity as compared to the wild-type (WT) plants under drought stress. In addition, results with confocal microscopy showed CsTLP + GFP fusion protein to be localized in the cell membrane which moved to the intercellular spaces under prolonged drought stress. Expression of CsTLP enhanced seed yield and the plant survival in transgenic lines as compared to the WT plants under drought stress. Results suggested the importance of CsTLP in improving drought tolerance in Arabidopsis.

AB  - The FHY3/FAR1 transcription factor family, derived from transposases, plays important roles in light signal transduction, and in the growth and development of plants. However, the homologous genes in tea plants have not been studied. In this study, 25 CsFHY3/FAR1 genes were identified in the tea plant genome through a genome-wide study, and were classified into five subgroups based on their phylogenic relationships. Their potential regulatory roles in light signal transduction and photomorphogenesis, plant growth and development, and hormone responses were verified by the existence of the corresponding cis-acting elements. The transcriptome data showed that these genes could respond to salt stress and shading treatment. An expression analysis revealed that, in different tissues, especially in leaves, CsFHY3/FAR1s were strongly expressed, and most of these genes were positively expressed under salt stress (NaCl), and negatively expressed under low temperature (4 degrees C) stress. In addition, a potential interaction network demonstrated that PHYA, PHYC, PHYE, LHY, FHL, HY5, and other FRSs were directly or indirectly associated with CsFHY3/FAR1 members. These results will provide the foundation for functional studies of the CsFHY3/FAR1 family, and will contribute to the breeding of tea varieties with high light efficiency and strong stress resistance.

AB  - The genus Depressaria (Lepidoptera: Depressariidae) mostly comprises specialist herbivores with varying capacity for detoxification of defensive phytochemistry. Depressaria depressana, a Eurasian moth recently introduced into North America, is a family-level specialist of the Apiaceae, whose hosts include more than a dozen species in multiple tribes; Depressaria radiella is a super-specialist of Eurasian origin that feeds exclusively on species in the genera Pastinaca and Heracleum throughout its native and introduced range. In eastern North America, it feeds upon Pastinaca sativa, an invasive European species, and Heracleum maximum, a native species. We determined whether differences in furanocoumarin metabolism exist between D. depressana and two isolated populations of D. radiella, feeding exclusively on either P. sativa or H. maximum. We also compared gravimetric estimates of feeding efficiency to assess D. depressana larval performance on different diets. Both populations of D. radiella metabolized furanocoumarins at a greater rate than D. depressana. Although there was no difference in rates of metabolism of linear furanocoumarins in the two populations of D. radiella, individuals collected from H. maximum metabolized angular furanocoumarins more rapidly. The gravimetric assessments of feeding efficiencies revealed that D. depressana exhibited highest efficiencies consuming Daucus carota; moreover, this species survived to pupation consuming fruits of Zizia aurea, an apiaceous species native to North America. Our preliminary phylogenetic analysis, building on an earlier morphological analysis, incorporates mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 data from the BOLD database and revealed that the presence or absence of furanocoumarins is not a strong predictor of species-level evolution in Depressaria.

AB  - Animals use the geometry of their local environments to orient themselves during navigation. Single neurons in the rat postrhinal cortex (POR) appear to encode environmental geometry in an egocentric (self-centered) reference frame, such that they fire in response to the egocentric bearing and/or distance from the environ-ment center or boundaries. One major issue is whether these neurons truly encode high-level global param-eters, such as the bearing/distance of the environment centroid, or whether they are simply responsive to the bearings and distances of nearby walls. We recorded from POR neurons as rats foraged in environments with different geometric layouts and modeled their responses based on either global geometry (centroid) or local boundary encoding. POR neurons largely split into either centroid-encoding or local-boundary-encoding cells, with each group lying at one end of a continuum. We also found that distance-tuned cells tend to scale their linear tuning slopes in a very small environment, such that they lie somewhere between absolute and relative distance encoding. In addition, POR cells largely maintain their bearing preferences, but not their dis-tance preferences, when exposed to different boundary types (opaque, transparent, drop edge), suggesting different driving forces behind the bearing and distance signals. Overall, the egocentric spatial correlates encoded by POR neurons comprise a largely robust and comprehensive representation of environmental geometry.

AB  - Significant strides have been made by researchers aiming to understand the crucial role of the plant cell wall (PCW) in defending against pathogens. Numerous reviews have synthesized findings on plant-pathogen interactions, shedding light on the role of the PCW in defence, the generation of cell wall damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), perception, and signalling response. However, the role of the PCW in responses to herbivory remains underexplored. This review aims to fill this gap, offering a comprehensive analysis of the current knowledge in this area. For the first time, it consolidates studies focusing on the involvement of the PCW in pest response. The review examines key aspects, including the structural changes in the PCW following pest infestation, the role of cell wall-derived DAMPs, and the phenotypic traits of transgenic plants with modified cell wall components. Additionally, it delves into the genetic underpinnings of cell wall plasticity and the mechanisms of DAMP perception. Lastly, the article identifies promising research pathways to further unravel the complex role of the PCW in pest defence, encouraging advancements in this relatively nascent field. Through this effort, it aims to bridge the knowledge gap and inspire deeper investigations into the interplay between the PCW and pest resistance.
   This review uncovers the critical role of the plant cell wall in pest defence, integrating structural, molecular, and genetic insights to highlight its emerging significance in plant-pest interactions during herbivory.

AB  - Brassica napus, Camelina sativa and field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense), represent one highly economically valuable crop and two emerging oilseed crops of the Brassicaceae family, respectively. As sessile organisms, these crops are continuously exposed to various stresses when grown in the field. Interestingly, the responses of these three crops to different environmental stimuli vary to a great extent, but there is very limited knowledge about the molecular basis of these differential responses. In this study, we employed untargeted metabolomics to compare the metabolic profile of these crops, and examined the potentially related genes through further integration with transcriptomic analysis. Our data revealed distinctive overall metabolic profiles among these three crops, where in particular, a variety of phenylpropanoids showed differential accumulation and the corresponding putative genes' expression varied significantly. The results provide a valuable resource for those studying Brassicaceae species and will provide insight into the understanding of metabolic variation among these three important oilseed crops, and provide potential targets for the future breeding of stress tolerant crops.

AB  - Tea is one of the most prevalent non-alcoholic beverages. The leaves of tea plants hyperaccumulate anthocyanins under cold stress, resulting in enhanced bitterness. Previously, we determined that the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase CsMIEL1 from the tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is involved in the response to stress conditions. This study aimed to determine the role of CsMIEL1 in anthocyanin accumulation at the post-translational modification level. The results showed that the heterologous expression of CsMIEL1 led to an 86% decrease in anthocyanin levels, resulting in a significant decrease in the mRNA levels of related genes in Arabidopsis at low temperatures but no significant differences in other phenotypes. Furthermore, multi-omics analysis and yeast two-hybrid library screening were performed to identify potential downstream targets of CsMIEL1. The results showed that the overexpression of CsMIEL1 resulted in 45% (448) of proteins being differentially expressed, of which 8% (36) were downregulated in A.thaliana, and most of these differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were clustered in the plant growth and secondary metabolic pathways. Among the 71 potential targets that may interact with CsMIEL1, CsMYB90 and CsGSTa, which are related to anthocyanin accumulation, were selected. In subsequent analyses, these two proteins were verified to interact with CsMIEL1 via yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and pull-down analyses in vitro. In summary, we explored the potential mechanism by which the E3 ligase relieves anthocyanin hyperaccumulation at low temperatures in tea plants. These results provide a new perspective on the mechanisms of anthocyanin regulation and the molecular breeding of tea plants.

AB  - Menthyl ester of valine (MV) has been developed as a plant defense potentiator to induce pest resistance in crops. In this study, we attempted to establish MV hydrochloride (MV-HCl) in lettuce and tomato crops. When MV-HCl solutions were used to treat soil or leaves of potted tomato and lettuce plants, 1 mu M MV-HCl solution applied to potted plant soil was most effective in increasing the transcript level of defense genes such as pathogenesis-related 1 (PR1). As a result, leaf damage caused by Spodoptera litura and oviposition by Tetranychus urticae were significantly reduced. In addition, MV-HCl-treated plants showed an increased ability to attract Phytoseiulus persimilis, a predatory mite of T. urticae, when they were attacked by T. urticae. Overall, our findings showed that MV-HCl is likely to be effective in promoting not only direct defense by activating defense genes, but also indirect defense mediated by herbivore-induced plant volatiles. Moreover, based on the results of the sustainability of PR1 expression in tomato plants treated with MV-HCl every 3 days, field trials were conducted and showed a 70% reduction in natural leaf damage. Our results suggest a practical approach to promoting organic tomato and lettuce production using this new plant defense potentiator.

AB  - Terpenes are the main class of secondary metabolites produced in response to pest and germ attacks. In maize (Zea mays L.), they are the essential components of the herbivore-induced plant volatile mixture, which functioned as a direct or indirect defense against pest and germ attacks. In this study, 43 maize terpene synthase gene (ZmTPS) family members were systematically identified and analyzed through the whole genomes of maize. Nine genes, including Zm00001d032230, Zm00001d045054, Zm00001d024486, Zm00001d004279, Zm00001d002351, Zm00001d002350, Zm00001d053916, Zm00001d015053, and Zm00001d015054, were isolated for their differential expression pattern in leaves after corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis) bite. Additionally, six genes (Zm00001d045054, Zm00001d024486, Zm00001d002351, Zm00001d002350, Zm00001d015053, and Zm00001d015054) were significantly upregulated in response to corn borer bite. Among them, Zm00001d045054 was cloned. Heterologous expression and enzyme activity assays revealed that Zm00001d045054 functioned as d-limonene synthase. It was renamed ZmDLS. Further analysis demonstrated that its expression was upregulated in response to corn borer bites and Fusarium graminearum attacks. The mutant of ZmDLS downregulated the expressions of Zm00001d024486, Zm00001d002351, Zm00001d002350, Zm00001d015053, and Zm00001d015054. It was more attractive to corn borer bites and more susceptible to F. graminearum infection. The yeast one-hybrid assay and dual-luciferase assay showed that ZmMYB76 and ZmMYB101 could upregulate the expression of ZmDLS by binding to the promoter region. This study may provide a theoretical basis for the functional analysis and transcriptional regulation of terpene synthase genes in crops.

AB  - After recognizing a biotic stress, plants activate signalling pathways to fight against the attack. Typically, these signalling pathways involve the activation of phosphorylation cascades mediated by Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs). In the Arabidopsis thaliana-Tetranychus urticae plant-herbivore model, several Arabidopsis MAP kinases are induced by the mite attack. In this study, we demonstrate the participation of the MEKK-like kinases MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21. Leaf damage caused by the mite was assessed using T-DNA insertion lines. Differential levels of damage were found when the expression of MAPKKK17 was increased or reduced. In contrast, reduced expression of MAPKKK21 resulted in less damage caused by the mite. Whereas the expression of several genes associated with hormonal responses did not suffer significant variations in the T-DNA insertion lines, the expression of one of these kinases depends on the expression of the other one. In addition, MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21 are coexpressed with different sets of genes and encode proteins with low similarity in the C-terminal region. Overall, our results demonstrate that MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21 have opposite roles. MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21 act as positive and negative regulators, respectively, on the plant response. The induction of MAPKKK17 and MAPKKK21 after mite infestation would be integrated into the bulk of signalling pathways activated to balance the response of the plant to a biotic stress.

AB  - The tea plant is an important economic crop and is widely cultivated. Isopentenyl transferase (IPT) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of cytokinin (CK) signaling, which plays key roles in plant development and abiotic stress. However, the IPT gene family in tea plants has not been systematically investigated until now. The phylogenetic analyses, gene structures, and conserved domains were predicted here. The results showed that a total of 13 CsIPT members were identified from a tea plant genome database and phylogenetically classified into four groups. Furthermore, 10 CsIPT members belonged to plant ADP/ATP-IPT genes, and 3 CsIPTs were tRNA-IPT genes. There is a conserved putative ATP/GTP-binding site (P-loop motif) in all the CsIPT sequences. Based on publicly available transcriptome data as well as through RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis, the CsIPT genes which play key roles in the development of different tissues were identified, respectively. Furthermore, CsIPT6.2 may be involved in the response to different light treatments. CsIPT6.4 may play a key role during the dormancy and flush of the lateral buds. CsIPT5.1 may play important regulatory roles during the development of the lateral bud, leaf, and flower. CsIPT5.2 and CsIPT6.2 may both play key roles for increased resistance to cold-stress, whereas CsIPT3.2 may play a key role in improving resistance to high-temperature stress as well as drought-stress and rewatering. This study could provide a reference for further studies of CsIPT family's functions and could contribute to tea molecular breeding.

AB  - In plants, the bZIP family plays vital roles in various biological processes, including seed maturation, flower development, light signal transduction, pathogen defense, and various stress responses. Tea, as a popular beverage, is widely cultivated and has withstood a degree of environmental adversity. Currently, knowledge of the bZIP gene family in tea plants remains very limited. In this study, a total of 76 CsbZIP genes in tea plant were identified for the whole genome. Phylogenetic analysis with Arabidopsis counterparts revealed that CsbZIP proteins clustered into 13 subgroups, among which 13 ABFs related to the ABA signaling transduction pathway were further identified by conserved motif alignment and named CsABF1-13, these belonged to the A and S subgroups of CsbZIP and had close evolutionary relationships, possessing uniform or similar motif compositions. Transcriptome analysis revealed the expression profiles of CsABF genes in different tissues (bud, young leaf, mature leaf, old leaf, stem, root, flower, and fruit) and under diverse environmental stresses (drought, salt, chilling, and MeJA). Several CsABF genes with relatively low tissue expression, including CsABF1, CsABF5, CsABF9, and CsABF10, showed strong expression induction in stress response. Thirteen CsABF genes, were examined by qRT-PCR in two tea plant cultivars, drought-tolerant "Taicha 12" and drought-sensitive "Fuyun 6", under exogenous ABA and drought stress. Furthermore, CsABF2, CsABF8, and CsABF11, were screened out as key transcription factors regulating drought tolerance of tea cultivars. Subsequently, some potential target genes regulated by CsABFs were screened by co-expression network and enrichment analysis. This study update CsbZIP gene family and provides a global survey of the ABF gene family in tea plant. The resolution of the molecular mechanism of drought resistance in different varieties could be helpful for improving stress resistance in tea plant via genetic engineering.

AB  - Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) plays a role in stress response, secondary metabolism, and other physiological processes during plant growth and development, and is also a critical enzyme in black tea production. However, the regulatory mechanisms of PPO genes and their activity in tea plants are still unclear. In this study, we measured PPO activity in two different tea cultivars, Taoyuandaye (TYDY) and Bixiangzao (BXZ), which are commonly used to produce black tea and green tea, respectively. The expression pattern of CsPPO1 was assessed and validated via transcriptomics and quantitative polymerase chain reaction in both tea varieties. In addition, we isolated and identified an R2R3-MYB transcription factor CsMYB59 that may regulate CsPPO1 expression. CsMYB59 was found to be a nuclear protein, and its expression in tea leaves was positively correlated with CsPPO1 expression and PPO activity. Transcriptional activity analysis showed that CsMYB59 was a transcriptional activator, and the dual-luciferase assay indicated that CsMYB59 could activate the expression of CsPPO1 in tobacco leaves. In summary, our study demonstrates that CsMYB59 represents a transcriptional activator in tea plants and may mediate the regulation of PPO activity by activating CsPPO1 expression. These findings provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of PPO gene in Camellia sinensis, which might help to breed tea cultivars with high PPO activity.

AB  - It is known that undamaged plants that have been exposed to volatiles from damaged con- or heterospecific plants become more resistant against herbivores. This is one of the plants' induced resistant responses against herbivores. To test whether this response can be used for rice production, we conducted the following experiments over 2 years (2012 and 2013). Rice seedlings were first planted in the rice seedling bed for 2 weeks in early May. There, half of the rice seedlings were exposed to artificially damaged weed volatiles three times for 12 days (treated plants). Weeds were randomly collected from the areas that were > 100 m away from the seedling bed and the rice paddy fields. The remaining seedlings were not exposed (control plants). In the middle of May, bunches (ca. three seedlings per bunch) were transplanted to the rice paddy field. In July, leaf damage was observed. The total number of leaves in the treated and control plants was not significantly different. In contrast, the total number of damaged leaves in the treated plants was significantly lower than that in the control plants. In September, rice grains were harvested. The average weight of a rice grain from the treated and control plants was not significantly different. However, the weight of grains per bunch of treated plants was significantly higher than that of control plants; this indicated a significant increase of the number of grains by 23% in 2012 and by 18% in 2013 in the treated plants compared to that in the control plants. The volatiles emitted from the weeds included monoterpenoids (40.4% in total), green leaf volatiles (46.5%), short-chain alcohols (5.3%), short-chain ketone (5.4%), short-chain acetate (0.5%), short-chain aldehyde (1.1%), and hydrocarbon (0.7%). These results suggest that exposure of volatiles from artificially damaged weeds to rice seedlings has the potential to increase rice production.

AB  - Tea leaf spot caused by Didymella bellidis can seriously reduce the productivity and quality of tea (Camellia sinensis var. sinensis) leaves in Guizhou Province, southwest China. Analysis of the relationship between messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) of tea could provide insights into the plant-pathogen interaction. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs and lncRNAs from tea leaves during infection by D. bellidis was conducted using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. Infection by D. bellidis hyphae resulted in up- or downregulation of 553 and 191 of the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), respectively. As the S gene number (total number of genes with significantly differential expression annotated in the specified Gene Ontology [GO] database), three were enriched with respect to the defense response to the fungus at the biological process level. Expression of the DEmRNAs peroxidase 21 (TEA000222.1) and mcht-2 (TEA013240.1) originating from tea leaves were upregulated during challenge by D. bellidis hyphae, whereas expression of the LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase ERECTA (TEA016781.1) gene was downregulated. The infection of D. bellidis hyphae resulted in up- or downregulation of 227 and 958 of the differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs). The DEmRNAs associated with uncharacterized LOC101499401 (TEA015626.1), uncharacterized protein (TEA014125.1), structural maintenance of chromosomes protein 1 (TEA001660.1), and uncharacterized protein (TEA017727.1) occurred as a result of cis regulation by DElncRNAs MSTRG.20036, MSTRG.3843, MSTRG.26132, and MSTRG.56701, respectively. The expression profiling and lncRNA/mRNA association prediction in the tea leaves infected by D. bellidis will provide a valuable resource for further research into disease resistance.

AB  - The ZRT, IRT-like protein (ZIP) family plays an essential role in the homeostasis of zinc and iron in plants. However, studies on this family are mainly limited to model species. Here, 12 CsZIPs were identified and investigated the function in Camellia sinensis, being named CsZIP1-12 and divided into four different groups based on phylogenetic relationships. These CsZIPs contained 2-9 TMDs and other conserved motifs for ZIP proteins. And CsZIPs were located in cell membrane, excepting for CsZIP4 and CsZIP6. The expression of CsZIPs were different in varieties and organs of tea plants. They were involved in the response process of abiotic stresses, such as NaCl, drought, cold and exogenous Me-JA. In addition, 31 types of promoter elements were identified in the CsZIPs, including core promoters, light responsiveness, stress responsive and other elements. The CsZIP1, CsZIP2, CsZIP4, CsZIP5, CsZIP6, CsZIP11 and CsZIP12 could be induced by zinc deficiency and 50 mu M Zn treatment, but CsZIP7 and CsZIP8 were up regulated by 300 mu M Zn. Heterogeneous complementation analysis showed that CsZIP1, CsZIP2, CsZIP7 and CsZIP8 could complement the Zn sensitivity of delta zrc1cot1 yeast double mutant. There was a positive correlation between the expression of CsZIPs and secondary metabolites in tea plant. Together, our analysis of CsZIPs could provide comprehensive insights on the structure and function of this protein family in the regulation of zinc and ion homeostasis in the tea plant.

AB  - HOPs (HSP70-HSP90 organizing proteins) are a highly conserved family of HSP70 and HSP90 co-chaperones whose role in assisting the folding of various hormonal receptors has been extensively studied in mammals. In plants, HOPs are mainly associated with stress response, but their potential involvement in hormonal networks remains completely unexplored. In this article we describe that a member of the HOP family, HOP3, is involved in the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway and is linked to plant defense responses not only to pathogens, but also to a generalist herbivore. The JA pathway regulates responses to Botrytis cinerea infection and to Tetranychus urticae feeding; our data demonstrate that the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) hop3-1 mutant shows an increased susceptibility to both. The hop3-1 mutant exhibits reduced sensitivity to JA derivatives in root growth assays and downregulation of different JA-responsive genes in response to methyl jasmonate, further revealing the relevance of HOP3 in the JA pathway. Interestingly, yeast two-hybrid assays and in planta co-immunoprecipitation assays found that HOP3 interacts with COI1, suggesting that COI1 is a target of HOP3. Consistent with this observation, COI1 activity is reduced in the hop3-1 mutant. All these data strongly suggest that, specifically among HOPs, HOP3 plays a relevant role in the JA pathway by regulating COI1 activity in response to JA and, consequently, participating in defense signaling to biotic stresses.

AB  - Jasmonic acid (JA) and its derivatives, collectively known as jasmonates (JAs), are important signaling hormones for plant responses against chewing herbivores. In JA signaling networks, jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins are transcriptional repressors that regulate JA-modulated downstream herbivore defenses. JAZ repressors are widely presented in land plants, however, there is only limited information about the regulation/function of JAZ proteins in maize. In this study, we performed a comprehensive expression analysis of ZmJAZ genes with other selected genes in the jasmonate pathway in response to feeding by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda, FAW), mechanical wounding, and exogenous hormone treatments in two maize genotypes differing in FAW resistance. Results showed that transcript levels of JAZ genes and several key genes in JA-signaling and biosynthesis pathways were rapidly and abundantly expressed in both genotypes in response to these various treatments. However, there were key differences between the two genotypes in the expression of ZmJAZ1 and ZmCOI1a, these two genes were expressed significantly rapidly and abundantly in the resistant line which was tightly regulated by endogenous JA level upon feeding. For instance, transcript levels of ZmJAZ1 increase dramatically within 30 min of FAW-fed Mp708 but not Tx601, correlating with the JA accumulation. The results also demonstrated that wounding or JA treatment alone was not as effective as FAW feeding; this suggests that insect-derived factors are required for optimal defense responses.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD), a phytocannabinoid from the Cannabis sativa plant, exhibits a broad spectrum of potential therapeutic properties for neurodegenerative diseases. An accumulation of amyloid-beta (A beta) protein is one of the most important neuropathology in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Data on the effect of CBD on the amelioration of A beta-induced neurite degeneration and its consequences of life and health spans is sparse. This study aimed to investigate the effects of CBD on neurite outgrowth in cells and lifespan and health span in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). In human SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, CBD prevented neurite lesion induced by A beta(1-42) and increased the expression of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R). Furthermore, CBD both protected the reduction of dendritic spine density and rescued the activity of synaptic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) from A beta(1-42) toxicity in primary hippocampal neurons. In C. elegans, we used the transgenic CL2355 strain of C. elegans, which expresses the human A beta peptide throughout the nervous system and found that CBD treatment extended lifespan and improved health span. The neuroprotective effect of CBD was further explored by observing the dopaminergic neurons using transgenic dat-1: GFP strains using the confocal microscope. This study shows that CBD prevents the neurite degeneration induced by A beta, by a mechanism involving CB1R activation, and extends lifespan and improves health span in A beta-overexpressing worms. Our findings support the potential therapeutic approach of CBD for the treatment of AD patients.

AB  - In the production of natural sausage casings, three layers of serosa, muscular, and mucosa are removed from gastro-intestinal wall of sheep as waste materials. The submocusa layer is taken for further processing. There is no report about generating added value out of these wastes. In this study, a novel approach was introduced for bioconversion of waste gastro-intestinal wall (WGW) to a value-added product. Alkaline hydrolysis of WGW was investigated and the hydrolysate was utilized for cultivation of Dunaliella salina, a value-added biomass. The hydrolysate that contained the highest total soluble protein was used for three sets of cultivations on different medium compositions, i.e., (1) cultivations on the modified Johnson's medium enriched with different percentage of hydrolysate (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 (%v/v)), (2) cultivations on modified Johnson's medium which was free of nitrogen and carbon sources and enriched with different percentage of hydrolysate (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 (%v/v), and (3) cultivation on modified Johnson's medium which was free of nitrogen source and enriched with 2.5% hydrolysate. The results showed that WGW contained 60.7, 8.4, 15.8, and 15.2% protein, lipid, moisture, and ash, respectively and the enrichment of the medium with the hydrolysate (2.5%) increased biomass productivity by 20%. Additionally, substitution of 2.5% hydrolysate for nitrogen source (KNO3) resulted in the same biomass productivity. The results of this study revealed the potential of the hydrolysate as an alternative for KNO3 in cultivation of D. salina. Overall, this work proposed a novel approach for converting waste gastro-intestinal wall to value.

AB  - Lignin is a key structural polymer that also serves as a potent defense against biotic stress. Herbivore-induced, jasmonate-dependent pith lignification in Nicotiana attenuata plays a crucial role in defense against the stem-borer Trichobaris mucorea. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying herbivore-induced lignification remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that NaMYC2 and NaMYC3 orchestrate pith-specific lignification in response to T. mucorea attack. RNA-seq analysis reveals that monolignol biosynthetic genes and polymerization-associated genes fail to be induced in Namyc2/3 double mutants upon T. mucorea attack. Among NaMYC2/3-dependent genes in the attacked pith, we identify NaTHT1, responsible for synthesizing the noncanonical monolignol N-FT. Using Natht1 mutants, we further show that N-FT plays a key role in stem defense. Additionally, we identify NaNEC1a and NaNEC1c, NaMYC2/3-dependent superoxide dismutases in the pith. Nanec1a/1c double mutants exhibit reduced lignification and enhanced larval performance, supporting a direct link between superoxide metabolism and induced lignification. Our findings reveal a NaMYC2/3-mediated regulatory network in the pith that integrates monolignol biosynthesis, lignin polymerization, and noncanonical monolignol biosynthesis, thereby enhancing stem defense against T. mucorea.

AB  - As the main flavor components of tea, the contents of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), theanine and caffeine are regulated by ambient temperature. However, whether the biosynthesis of EGCG, theanine and caffeine in response to temperature is regulated by endogenous hormones and its mechanism is still unclear. In this study, tea cuttings cultivated in the phytotron which treated at different temperatures 15celcius, 20celcius, 25celcius and 30celcius, respectively. The UPLC and ESI-HPLC-MS/MS were used to determine the contents of EGCG, theanine, caffeine and the contents of phytohormones in one leaf and a bud. The results showed that indoleacetic acid (IAA), gibberellin 1(GA1) and gibberellin 3 (GA3) were significantly correlated with the content of EGCG; Jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-Ile) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) were strongly correlated with theanine content; IAA, GA1 and gibberellin 4 (GA4) were significantly correlated with caffeine content at different temperatures. In order to explore the internal intricate relationships between the biosynthesis of these three main taste components, endogenous hormones, and structural genes in tea plants, we used multi-omics and multidimensional correlation analysis to speculate the regulatory mechanisms: IAA, GA1 and GA3 up-regulated the expressions of chalcone synthase (CsCHS) and trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase (CsC4H) mediated by the signal transduction factors auxin-responsive protein IAA (CsIAA) and DELLA protein (CsDELLA), respectively, which promoted the biosynthesis of EGCG; IAA, GA3 and GA1 up-regulated the expression of CsCHS and anthocyanidin synthase (CsANS) mediated by CsIAA and CsDELLA, respectively, via the transcription factor WRKY DNA-binding protein (CsWRKY), and promoted the biosynthesis of EGCG; JA, JA-Ile and MeJA jointly up-regulated the expression of carbonic anhydrase (CsCA) and down-regulated the expression of glutamate decarboxylase (CsgadB) mediated by the signal transduction factors jasmonate ZIM domain-containing protein (CsJAZ), and promoted the biosynthesis of theanine; JA, JA-Ile and MeJA also jointly inhibited the expression of CsgadB mediated by CsJAZ via the transcription factor CsWRKY and AP2 family protein (CsAP2), which promoted the biosynthesis of theanine; IAA inhibited the expression of adenylosuccinate synthase (CspurA) mediated by CsIAA via the transcription factor CsWRKY; GA1 and gibberellin 4 (GA4) inhibited the expression of CspurA mediated by CsDELLA through the transcription factor CsWRKY, which promoted the biosynthesis of caffeine. In conclusion, we revealed the underlying mechanism of the biosynthesis of the main taste components in tea plant in response to temperature was mediated by hormone signal transduction factors, which provided novel insights into improving the quality of tea.

AB  - Terrestrial plants emit volatiles into the atmosphere to attract both pollinators and the enemies of herbivores, for defense. Phalaenopsis bellina is a scented orchid species in which the main scent components are monoterpenes, including linalool and geraniol, and their derivatives. Here, we investigated whether ABC transporters are involved in floral scent emission. We carried out whole-genome identification of ABC transporter-related genes using four floral transcriptomics libraries of P. bellina. We identified 86 ABC subfamily G genes related to terpenoid transport. After comparing the gene expression patterns of P. bellina with that of Phalaenopsis aphrodite subsp. formosana, a scentless species, followed by gene-to-gene correlation analysis, PbABCG1 and PbABCG2 were selected. The temporal expression of both PbABCG1 and PbABCG2 was highly correlated with that of the key enzyme PbGDPS and the major transcription factor PbbHLH4 in monoterpene biosynthesis, with optimal expression on day 5 post-anthesis. Spatial gene expression analysis showed that PbABCG1 was highly expressed in sepals, whereas PbABCG2 was expressed in the lip. Subcellular localization with a GFP fusion protein revealed that both PbABCG1 and PbABCG2 are cytoplasmic membrane proteins. Co-downregulation of PbABCG1 and PbABCG2 using both double-strand RNA interference and tobacco rattle virus-based gene silencing led to a significant decrease in monoterpene emission, accompanied by an increase in the internal monoterpene pools. Furthermore, ectopic expression of PbABCG1 and PbABCG2 in an ABC16(-) mutant yeast strain rescued its tolerance to geraniol. Altogether, our results indicate that PbABCG1 and PbABCG2 play substantial roles in monoterpene transport/emission in P. bellina floral scent.

AB  - The hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) often act antagonistically in controlling plant defense pathways in response to hemibiotrophs/biotrophs (hemi/biotroph) and herbivores/necrotrophs, respectively. Threonine deaminase (TD) converts threonine to alpha-ketobutyrate and ammonia as the committed step in isoleucine (Ile) biosynthesis and contributes to JA responses by producing the Ile needed to make the bioactive JA-Ile conjugate. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants have two TD genes: TD1 and TD2. A defensive role for TD2 against herbivores has been characterized in relation to JA-Ile production. However, it remains unknown whether TD2 is also involved in host defense against bacterial hemi/biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. Here, we show that in response to the bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flagellin flg22 peptide, an activator of SA-based defense responses, TD2 activity is compromised, possibly through carboxy-terminal cleavage. TD2 knockdown (KD) plants showed increased resistance to the hemibiotrophic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae but were more susceptible to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, suggesting TD2 plays opposite roles in response to hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. This TD2 KD plant differential response to different pathogens is consistent with SA- and JA-regulated defense gene expression. flg22-treated TD2 KD plants showed high expression levels of SA-responsive genes, whereas TD2 KD plants treated with the fungal PAMP chitin showed low expression levels of JA-responsive genes. This study indicates TD2 acts negatively in defense against hemibiotrophs and positively against necrotrophs and provides insight into a new TD2 function in the elaborate crosstalk between SA and JA signaling induced by pathogen infection.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is one of the three major beverage crops in the world with its leaves consumption as tea. However, it can hyperaccumulate fluoride with about 98% fluoride deposition in the leaves. Our previously studies found that cell wall proteins (CWPs) might play a central role in fluoride accumulation/detoxification in C. sinensis. CWP is known to be glycosylated, however the response of CWP N-glycosylation to fluoride remains unknown in C. sinensis. In this study, a comparative N-glycoproteomic analysis was performed through HILIC enrichment coupled with UPLC-MS/MS based on TMT-labeling approach in C. sinensis leaves. Totally, 237 N-glycoproteins containing 326 unique N-glycosites were identified. 73.4%, 18.6%, 6.3% and 1.7% of these proteins possess 1, 2, 3, and >= 4 modification site, respectively. 93.2% of these proteins were predicted to be localized in the secretory pathway and 78.9% of them were targeted to the cell wall and the plasma membrane. 133 differentially accumulated N-glycosites (DNGSs) on 100 N-glycoproteins (DNGPs) were detected and 85.0% of them exhibited upregulated expression after fluoride treatment. 78.0% DNGPs were extracellular DNGPs, which belonged to CWPs, and 53.0% of them were grouped into protein acting on cell wall polysaccharides, proteases and oxido-reductases, whereas the majority of the remaining DNGPs were mainly related to Nglycoprotein biosynthesis, trafficking and quality control. Our study shed new light on the N-glycoproteome study, and revealed that increased N-glycosylation abundance of CWPs might contribute to fluoride accumulation/detoxification in C. sinensis leave.

AB  - The elemental defense hypothesis supports that metal hyperaccumulation in plant tissues serves as a mechanism underpinning plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens. In this study, we investigate the interaction between Odontarrhena lesbiaca and broomrape parasitic species, in the light of the defense hypothesis of metal hyperaccumulation. Plant and soil samples collected from three serpentine sites in Lesbos, Greece were analyzed for Ni concentrations. Phelipanche nowackiana and Phelipanche nana were found to infect O. lesbiaca. In both species, Ni concentration decreased gradually from tubercles to shoots and flowers. Specimens of both species with shoot nickel concentrations above 1000 mg.kg(-1) were found, showing that they act as nickel hyperaccumulators. Low values of parasite to O. lesbiaca leaf or soil nickel quotients were observed. Orobanche pubescens growing on a serpentine habitat but not in association with O. lesbiaca had very low Ni concentrations in its tissues analogous to excluder plants growing on serpentine soils. Infected O. lesbiaca individuals showed lower leaf nickel concentrations relative to the non-infected ones. Elevated leaf nickel concentration of O. lesbiaca individuals did not prevent parasitic plants to attack them and to hyperaccumulate metals to their tissues, contrary to predictions of the elemental defense hypothesis.

AB  - Air potato, Dioscorea bulbifera L., is an invasive vine found in the southeastern United States and is native to Asia and Africa. The air potato leaf beetle Lilioceris cheni (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is a host specific biological control agent introduced for D. bulbifera control. In this study, odor cues that control the attraction of L. cheni to D. bulbifera were investigated. The first experiment investigated the response of L. cheni to D. bulbifera leaves versus no leaves in the presence or absence of air flow. The experiment showed a significant response of L. cheni to D. bulbifera leaves in the presence of air flow with leaves placed upwind. When air flow and/or leaves were absent, L. cheni dispersed randomly between the upwind and downwind targets, indicating L. cheni uses volatiles from D. bulbifera in host selection. The second experiment investigated L. cheni response to undamaged, larval-damaged, and adult-damaged plants. Lilioceris cheni showed preference to move towards conspecific damaged plants compared to undamaged plants but did not discriminate between larvae-damaged or adult-damaged plants. The third experiment investigated volatile profiles of damaged D. bulbifera plants using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectroscopy. We found significant differences in volatile profiles between adult and larval damaged plants compared to mechanically damaged and undamaged plants, with increases in 11 volatile compounds. However, larval and adult-damaged volatile profiles did not differ. The information acquired during this study could be used to develop strategies to monitor for L. cheni and improve its biological control program.

In this study, 40 GATA genes were identified in tea plants, with a focus on CsGATA12 and 17, whose expression patterns were correlated with nitrogen deficiency, nitrogen forms and nitrogen concentration. Among them, CsGATA17 is highly correlated with theanine and ethylamine contents in response to high nitrogen levels. Transcriptional regulation confirmed that CsGATA17 acts as a transcriptional activator to positively regulate CsAlaDC (alanine decarboxylase) to promote theanine synthesis in leaves with high nitrogen levels. This interaction was simulated and visualized by molecular docking and ultimately confirmed by EMSA. This study expands our understanding of GATA factors in tea plants and reveals the role of CsGATA17 in nitrogen metabolism and theanine regulation.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis [L.] O. Kuntze) is cultivated as a beverage crop. Despite being a hardy perennial, the tea plant is susceptible to various biotic stresses. Among them, the foliar disease blister blight (BB) is considered the most serious threat to the tea industry, particularly in Asia. BB caused by Exobasidium vexans (Basidiomycetes) was first reported from Northern India in 1868 and gradually established in other tea-growing countries. The fungus E. vexans attacks young harvestable shoots and causes 20 to 50% crop loss. Over the past 150 years, scientific research has delved into various aspects of BB disease, including pathogen biology, disease cycle, epidemiology, disease forecasting, crop loss assessment, and disease management strategies. In a recent shift in research focus, scientists have begun to investigate the resistance mechanisms of tea plants against BB and apply this knowledge to commercial tea cultivation. Although progress has been significant in understanding the fundamental aspects of BB resistance, the detailed molecular mechanisms driving this resistance remain under investigation. This paper focuses on the current understanding of defense mechanisms employed by tea plants against E. vexans and, conversely, how E. vexans overcomes these defenses. Furthermore, we discuss the application of plant resistance strategies in commercial tea cultivation. Lastly, we identify existing research gaps and propose future research directions in the field.

AB  - Background Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is a crucial crop for regions of the world that are prone to both heat and drought; however, the phytotoxic cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora) impairs plant physiology at low population levels. Both antibiotic and antixenotic forms of resistance to the aphid have been mapped to two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and near isogenic lines (NILs). The molecular mechanism for this resistance response remains unknown. Results To understand the genes underlying susceptibility and resistance, two cowpea lines with shared heritage were infested along a time course and characterized for transcriptome variation. Aphids remodeled cowpea development and signaling relative to host plant resistance and the duration of feeding, with resource acquisition and mobilization determining, in part, susceptibility to aphid attack. Major differences between the susceptible and resistant cowpea were identified including two regions of interest housing the most genetic differences between the lines. Candidate genes enabling aphid resistance include both conventional resistance genes (e.g., leucine rich repeat protein kinases) as well as multiple novel genes with no known orthologues. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that feeding by the cowpea aphid globally remodels the transcriptome of cowpea, but how this occurs depends on both the duration of feeding and host-plant resistance. Constitutive expression profiles of the resistant genotype link aphid resistance to a finely-tuned resource management strategy that ultimately reduces damage (e.g., chlorosis) and delays cell turnover, while impeding aphid performance. Thus, aphid resistance in cowpea is a complex, multigene response that involves crosstalk between primary and secondary metabolism.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) can hyperaccumulate fluoride (F-) without any toxic symptom, especially in mature leaves. However, the molecular mechanism of absorption and hyperaccumulation of F- was poorly understood in C. sinensis. Here, a transcriptomic analysis was performed to compare the responses to fluoride stress of tea leaves to understand F- accumulation and its influence on gene expression in C. sinensis leaves. The results indicated that numerous differentially expressed genes involved in ion absorption and transport exist in the process of F- absorption in C. sinensis leaves. The up-regulated expression of genes associated with uptake and transport of Ca2+ and K+ (CNGC, TPC1, CAX, and VHA) increased the intracellular and vacuole cation concentration during F- accumulation in C. sinensis leaves. We also found that some of AQP (PIPs and TIPs) genes may promote F- into the intracellular spaces and vacuoles in C. sinensis leaves, respectively. In addition, F- induced the expression of differential genes related to plant hormone metabolism and signaling pathways (ABA, auxin, and GA). Subsequently, a lot of transcription factors (WRKY, MYB, NAC, bHLH and AP2/ERF) were activated to respond to F- stress in tea leaves by regulating plant hormone signal transduction and other pathways. And ubiquitin systems were involved in the regulation of proteins homeostasis under F- stress indicating that they are responsible for the response of C. sinensis leaves to F-. Overall, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the F- absorption mechanism and its influence on gene expression in tea leaves.

AB  - Interactions of solar radiation with mammal fur are complex. Reflection of radiation in the visible spectrum provides colour that has various roles, including sexual display and crypsis, i.e., camouflage. Radiation that is absorbed by a fur coat is converted to heat, a proportion of which impacts on the skin. Not all absorption occurs at the coat surface, and some radiation penetrates the coat before being absorbed, particularly in lighter coats. In studies on this phenomenon in kangaroos, we found that two arid zone species with the thinnest coats had similar effective heat load, despite markedly different solar reflectances. These kangaroos were Red Kangaroos (Osphranter rufus) and Western Grey Kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus).Here we examine the connections between heat flow patterns associated with solar radiation, and the physical structure of these coats. Also noted are the impacts of changing wind speed. The modulation of solar radiation and resultant heat flows in these coats were measured at wind speeds from 1 to 10 m s-1 by mounting them on a heat flux transducer/temperature-controlled plate apparatus in a wind tunnel. A lamp with a spectrum like solar radiation was used as a proxy for the sun. The integrated reflectance across the solar spectrum was higher in the red kangaroos (40 +/- 2%) than in the grey kangaroos (28 +/- 1%). Fur depth and insulation were not different between the two species, but differences occurred in fibre structure, notably in fibre length, fibre density and fibre shape. Patterns of heat flux within the species' coats occurred despite no overall difference in effective solar heat load. We consider that an overarching need for crypsis, particularly for the more open desert-adapted red kangaroo, has led to the complex adaptations that retard the penetrance of solar radiation into its more reflective fur.

AB  - Simple Summary Deoxynivalenol (DON)-contaminated feed may cause anorexia, vomiting, immunosuppression, and intestinal dysfunction in pigs, which would lead to growth retardation and great losses in the pig industry. In this study, the effects of resveratrol (RES) on growth performance, the intestinal barrier, antioxidant capacity, and mitochondrial function in weaned pigs fed with DON-contaminated diets were investigated. Dietary supplementation with resveratrol increased the average daily feed intake of piglets. Diets supplemented with resveratrol increased the villus height and the ratio of the jejunum villus height to crypt depth, increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and increased the total antioxidant capacity in the jejunum mucosa. After being supplemented with RES, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mitochondria was decreased, while the mitochondrial membrane potential in the jejunum was increased. In conclusion, these results suggested that resveratrol effectively relieved DON-induced oxidative stress in weaned piglets, improved intestinal barrier function, enhanced mitochondrial function, and improved the growth performance of piglets. This study aimed to investigate the potential effects of resveratrol (RES) on intestinal function and oxidative stress in deoxynivalenol (DON)-challenged piglets. Twenty-four healthy Duroc x Yorkshire x Landrace weaned piglets at the age of 28 +/- 1 days were randomly divided into four groups with six repetitions per group. The four groups were as follows: the control group (CON), fed with a basic diet; the RES group, fed with a basal diet + 300 mg/kg RES; the DON group, fed with a basal diet containing 2.65 mg/kg DON; and the DON + RES group, fed with a basal diet containing 2.65 mg/kg DON + 300 mg/kg RES. The results showed that the growth performance and intestinal function of DON-challenged piglets were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with the DON group, the average daily feed intake of piglets in the DON + RES group was significantly increased (p < 0.05). Additionally, dietary RES ameliorated DON-induced intestinal morphology impairment, as indicated by the increased (p < 0.05) jejunal villi height and the ratio of the jejunal villi height/crypt depth. Furthermore, after the addition of RES, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) in the jejunum mucosa were significantly increased, and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) was significantly declined (p < 0.05). In addition, the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria was significantly reduced by RES, while the mitochondrial membrane potential in jejunum was significantly increased by RES (p < 0.05). However, there was no obvious difference between DON + RES and DON groups on average daily gain and the ratio of feed togain, except for the significant inhibition of average daily feed intake (p < 0.05). In conclusion, RES could effectively alleviate the DON-induced oxidative stress on weaned piglets, and reduce the damage to mitochondria and intestinal morphology, so as to improve the growth performance of piglets.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are known to activate immune signaling in plants; however, their effectiveness can vary depending on the genotype and the signaling pathway involved. In this study, we evaluated the transcriptional response of four citrus rootstocks (Carrizo citrange, Forner-Alcaide 5 (FA5), Forner-Alcaide 74 (FA74), and Microcitrus australasica) to six synthetic HIPVs [(Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate, methyl jasmonate, and methyl salicylate]. We focused on genes associated with the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways, as well as the susceptibility gene CsPUB21. Overall, the SA pathway was more consistently activated than the JA pathway, with upstream and intermediate genes induced across most genotypes and treatments. In contrast, downstream markers showed more variable expression, suggesting that synthetic HIPVs may induce a primed rather than fully activated defense state. Among the volatiles tested, (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate and (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol were the most effective, activating genes in both pathways. Importantly, these two compounds also consistently repressed CsPUB21 expression, a gene recently associated with huanglongbing (HLB) susceptibility, through coordinated transcriptional and post-translational regulation. Carrizo citrange showed the strongest transcriptional response, while FA74 exhibited more moderate activation, emphasizing the influence of genetic background on HIPV perception and signaling. These findings highlight the potential of selected synthetic HIPVs as sustainable defense priming agents capable of enhancing citrus immunity by simultaneously activating immune pathways and repressing susceptibility genes such as CsPUB21. This dual mode of action offers promising tools for the integrated management of HLB and other citrus diseases.

AB  - Tea, a perennial shrub, is severely impacted by various biotic and abiotic stresses, among which grey blight, caused by Pestalotiopsis microspora, plays a major role in significant crop loss. In this study, out of 15 locally available plants, the ethyl acetate extracts of Cymbopogon citratus and Piper nigrum were scrutinised. The in vitro bioassay revealed that C. citratus at 5 mL/L and 10 mL/L completely inhibited P. microspora under the food poisoning technique. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of C. citratus extract was found to be 2 mg/ mL. The GC-MS analysis confirmed the presence of 1-Iodo-2-methylundecane, Silane, trichlorooctadecyl-, and 1,3-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, bis(2-ethylhexyl) ester at higher levels, with saturated hydrocarbons as the most abundant class (48 %). The Elongation Factor 1-alpha (EF1) of Pseudopestalotiopsis theae was taken as the target protein, and a 3D model was built and validated with an active site containing 98 amino acid residues. The molecular docking results highlighted the compound 2,6-Dimethyl-6-trifluoroacetoxyoctane, having a binding affinity of -5.8 kcal/mol, compared to Carbendazim with -6.5 kcal/mol. Under visualisation, the ligands of 2,6Dimethyl-6-trifluoroacetoxyoctane formed conventional hydrogen bonds at ILE60, CYS80, and ILE83, aiding in the interaction and stability of the ligand-protein complex. Finally, C. citratus established a satisfactory control of 61 % against grey blight disease, which was on par with the organic recommended schedule under field conditions. This study suggests a sustainable and environmental-friendly control measure by reducing synthetic chemical inputs through an integrated disease management (IDM) strategy.

AB  - Inhibition of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling renders plants more susceptible to biotic stresses. Pathogen infection can induce an increase in JA levels. However, our understanding of the mechanisms mediating pathogen-induced JA accumulation in rice (Oryza sativa) remains limited. We characterized OsLOX9, a lipoxygenase gene of the 13-LOX subfamily involved in JA biosynthesis, which is induced upon infection by the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Two independent lox9 mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to M. oryzae infection, a phenotype that was fully restored by methyl jasmonate treatment, and showed reduced pathogen-induced accumulation of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, JA, and its bioactive form JA-Ile. RNA sequencing-based expression analysis in response to M. oryzae infection revealed an essential role of OsLOX9-produced jasmonates in up-regulating terpenoid phytoalexin pathway genes. Furthermore, we found that the JA core transcription factor, OsMYC2, can bind to the promoter of OsLOX9 and activate its expression, creating a positive feedback loop during pathogenesis. This study reveals that OsLOX9 is a key blast fungus-induced JA biosynthesis gene and contributes to resistance to blast disease in rice.
   The lipoxygenase gene OsLOX9 , regulated by the transcription factor OsMYC2, is induced upon blast fungus infection and promotes jasmonic acid accumulation, thereby enhancing rice resistance to Magnaporthe oryzae .

AB  - Dark brown leaf spot on tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) caused by Epicoccum mackenziei Jayasiri, Camporesi & K. D. Hyde has caused a loss in the yield and quality of tea leaves in Guizhou Province, Southwest China. No research has been published on the gene expression profiles of tea leaves during infection by E. mackenziei. In this study, we report the high-quality transcriptome sequencing of tea genes during infection, using high-throughput next-generation sequencing on the Illumina Novaseq 6000 platform. The infection resulted in significantly up- or downregulated expression of the 960 or 397 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) from tea leaves, respectively. The DEmRNAs were annotated using the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. The expression of DEmRNA peroxidase 21 (TEA000222.1) was upregulated in response to infection by the pathogen and was enriched in terms of defense response to fungi at the biological process aspect. Expression of 26 or 13 of the tea DEmRNAs enriched in the pathways of plant-pathogen interaction were up- or downregulated, respectively, such as the genes WRKY transcription factor 1 (TEA028099.1), probable disease resistance protein At4g27220 (TEA018574.1), and serine/threonine-protein kinase CDL1 (TEA006388.1), which were downregulated. This comprehensive gene expression profiling study of tea leaves infected by this fungal pathogen will provide a valuable resource for future research on the identification of the host genes associated with the response to pathogen challenge and ultimately with disease resistance in the host.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) regulate many biological processes in plants, including defense against pathogens and herbivores. Recently, many small ORFs embedded in lncRNAs have been identified to encode biologically functional peptides (small ORF-encoded peptides [SEPs]) in many species. However, it is unknown whether lncRNAs mediate defense against herbivore attack and whether there are novel functional SEPs for these lncRNAs. By sequencing Spodoptera litura-treated leaves at six time-points in Nicotiana tabacum, 22,436 lncRNAs were identified, of which 787 were differentially expressed. Using a comprehensive mass spectrometry (MS) pipeline, 302 novel SEPs derived from 115 tobacco lncRNAs were identified. Moreover, 61 SEPs showed differential expression after S. litura attack. Importantly, several of these peptides were characterized through 3D structure prediction, subcellular localization validation by laser confocal microscopy, and western blotting. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis revealed some specific chemical and physical properties of these novel SEPs, which probably represent the largest number of SEPs identified in plants to date. Our study not only identifies potential lncRNA regulators of plant response to herbivore attack but also serves as a valuable resource for the functional characterization of SEP-encoding lncRNAs.

AB  - Background C. sinensis is an important economic crop with fluoride over-accumulation in its leaves, which poses a serious threat to human health due to its leaf consumption as tea. Recently, our study has indicated that cell wall proteins (CWPs) probably play a vital role in fluoride accumulation/detoxification in C. sinensis. However, there has been a lack in CWP identification and characterization up to now. This study is aimed to characterize cell wall proteome of C. sinensis leaves and to develop more CWPs related to stress response. A strategy of combined cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics was employed to investigate CWPs. CWPs were extracted by sequential salt buffers, while N-glycoproteins were enriched by hydrophilic interaction chromatography method using C. sinensis leaves as a material. Afterwards all the proteins were subjected to UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Results A total of 501 CWPs and 195 CWPs were identified respectively by cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics profiling with 118 CWPs in common. Notably, N-glycoproteomics is a feasible method for CWP identification, and it can enhance CWP coverage. Among identified CWPs, proteins acting on cell wall polysaccharides constitute the largest functional class, most of which might be involved in cell wall structure remodeling. The second largest functional class mainly encompass various proteases related to CWP turnover and maturation. Oxidoreductases represent the third largest functional class, most of which (especially Class III peroxidases) participate in defense response. As expected, identified CWPs are mainly related to plant cell wall formation and defense response. Conclusion This was the first large-scale investigation of CWPs in C. sinensis through cell wall proteomics and N-glycoproteomics. Our results not only provide a database for further research on CWPs, but also an insight into cell wall formation and defense response in C. sinensis.

AB  - Roses are among the most economically important ornamental plants worldwide. But prickles on the stem and leaves cause difficulties for cultivation or inconveniences during harvest and transportation, thus are an undesirable horticultural character. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of prickle development. In this study, we sought to develop Rosa multiflora (in the family Rosaceae) as a model plant to study prickle formation. The morphology, structure, and ontogeny of prickles were characterized, and transcriptome analysis of prickly and prickleless R. multiflora genotypes was performed. Morphological observation and microscopic analyses revealed that prickles of R. multiflora were non-glandular prickles (NGPs) and their maturation went through five developmental stages, which was accompanied by the accumulation of secondary metabolites such as lignin and anthocyanins. Comparative transcriptome analysis identified key pathways and hub genes potentially involved in prickle formation. Interestingly, among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), several notable development and secondary metabolism-related transcription factors (TFs) including NAC, TCP, MYB, homeobox, and WRKY were up-regulated in prickly internodes. KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that DEGs were enriched in the pathways related to biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, flavonoids, and phenylpropanoids in the prickly R. multiflora. Our study provides novel insights into the molecular network underlying the regulation of prickle morphogenesis in R. multiflora, and the identified candidates might be applied to the genetic improvement of roses.

AB  - Brassicaceae (Cruciferae) are ostensibly defended in part against generalist insect herbivores by toxic isothiocyanates formed when protoxic glucosinolates are hydrolysed. Based on an analysis of published host records, feeding on Brassicas is widespread by both specialist and generalists in the Lepidoptera. The polyphagous noctuid moth Helicoverpa armigera is recorded as a pest on some Brassicas and we attempted to improve performance by artificial selection to, in part, determine if this contributes to pest status. Assays on cabbage and kale versus an artificial diet showed no difference in larval growth rate, development times and pupal weights between the parental and the selected strain after 2, 21 and 29 rounds of selection, nor in behaviour assays after 50 generations. There were large differences between the two Brassicas: performance was better on kale than cabbage, although both were comparable to records for other crop hosts, on which the species is a major pest. We discuss what determines "pest" status.

AB  - Plant cell and tissue responses to the attack of mining herbivores may be diagnosed by anatomical and histochemical analyses, herein investigated regarding the mining activity of Phyllocnistis hemera larvae in the leaf lamina of Daphnopsis fasciculata. The larva enters the leaf lamina through the adaxial epidermis, and feeds on palisade parenchyma cells. A healing tissue is produced after the larva passes, and its cells are reactive to histochemical tests for lignins and pectins. At first, the leaf mine is composed of a channel that is limited by palisade parenchyma cell wall fragments. Later, it is filled with a regenerative tissue constituted by isodiametric cells recruited from the spongy parenchyma, which fills up the mine channel. The cells differentiated inside the mine, regenerated the damage caused to leaf tissues, and may isolate the mine from the entrance of pathogens. Daphnopsis fasciculata is capable of reconstructing mesophyll tissues, which involves the totipotency of parenchyma cells and enables an important strategy for plant recovering after the attack of mining parasites.

AB  - This work presents the results of a multidisciplinary study on the characterization of the composition of certain joint mortars from the ancient city of Hippo (Algeria), one of the most important North African cities in antiquity. Twenty mortar samples were analysed by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), powder X-ray diffraction (XRPD), optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Their main physical properties, like solid and dry density and porosity, have been measured by geotechnical procedures. The typological observation by OM showed the existence of four types of sand used as aggregates that ranged from fine to coarse and were mixed with a white to russet natural lime binder. These mortars consisted mainly of mixtures of calcite and rock fragments, and sometimes pieces of red tile. It was recognized that the origins of the natural granules were sands produced by marine erosion of the Edough Mountains. The analysis by XRPD and TGA indicates that the mortars consisted of a mixture of lime/aggregates of low to medium hydraulicity. The analysis of the main chemical components by XRF allowed for the confirmation of the dating of certain monuments and suggested a new dating for other monuments.

AB  - This study demonstrates the high bactericidal efficiency of silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) nanoparticles synthesized via the laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) method. The antimicrobial effectiveness of these nanoparticles was confirmed against both Gram positive (S. aureus, L. monocytogenes) and Gram negative (P. aeruginosa, E. coli) bacterial biofilms in vitro (silica glass and CaF2 substrates), ex vivo (pig skin), and in vivo (mouse wounds). The LIFT method achieved minimal inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) within the lower range of bibliographic data, attributed to the uniform 2D-like surface coverage and chemically clean nature of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, biocompatibility studies revealed low cytotoxicity of LIFT-generated Ag and Cu nanoparticles in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. In vivo experiments on Balb/c mice demonstrated accelerated wound epithelialization without adverse inflammatory or allergic responses for NP-treated wounds compared to the untreated (control). Exposure to AgNPs and CuNPs did not affect the functional/behavioral status of mice. Future research will extend these findings by testing additional animal models and exploring multi-elemental nanoparticles to further elucidate the bactericidal mechanisms. This method can be implemented on the basis of portable laser systems for antibacterial treatment in the field.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder whose etiopathogenesis includes changes in cellular as well as extracellular structures. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) associated with parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVs) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are dysregulated in schizophrenia. However, the postnatal development of these structures along with their associated neurons in the PFC is unexplored, as is their effects on behavior and neural activity. Therefore, in this study, we employed a DISC1 (Disruption in Schizophrenia) mutation mouse model of schizophrenia to assess these developmental changes and tested whether enzymatic digestion of PNNs in the PFC affected schizophrenia-like behaviors and neural activity. Developmentally, we found that the normal formation of PNNs, PVs, and colocalization of these two in the PFC, peaked around PND 22 (postnatal day 22). However, in DISC1, mutation animals from PND 0 to PND 60, both PNNs and PVs were significantly reduced. After enzymatic digestion of PNNs with chondroitinase in adult animals, the behavioral pattern of control animals mimicked that of DISC1 mutation animals, exhibiting reduced sociability, novelty and increased ultrasonic vocalizations, while there was very little change in other behaviors, such as working memory (Y-maze task involving medial temporal lobe) or depression-like behavior (tail-suspension test involving processing via the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis). Moreover, following chondroitinase treatment, electrophysiological recordings from the PFC exhibited a reduced proportion of spontaneous, high-frequency firing neurons, and an increased proportion of irregularly firing neurons, with increased spike count and reduced inter-spike intervals in control animals. These results support the proposition that the aberrant development of PNNs and PVs affects normal neural operations in the PFC and contributes to the emergence of some of the behavioral phenotypes observed in the DISC1 mutation model of schizophrenia.

AB  - In vivo- and in vitro-produced bovine embryos have different metabolic profiles and differences in gene transcription patterns. These embryos also have a distinct ability to establish and sustain early pregnancies. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are secreted by embryos and carry bioactive molecules, such as miRNAs. We hypothesize that in vivo or in vitro-produced bovine hatched blastocysts on Day 9 and the sEVs secreted by them have different miRNA profiles. To address this hypothesis, embryos of both groups were placed in in vitro culture on Day 7. After 48 h, hatched embryos and hatched embryo-conditioned media (eCM) of both groups were collected. A total of 210 miRNAs were detected in embryos of both groups, of these 6 miRNAs were downregulated, while 7 miRNAs were upregulated in vitro group when compared to in vivo group. sEVs were isolated from eCM to determine miRNA profile. A total of 106 miRNAs were detected in both groups, including 14 miRNAs upregulated in sEVs from in vivo-eCM, and 2 miRNAs upregulated in sEVs from in vitro-eCM. These miRNAs express in embryos and sEVs secreted by them regulate early embryonic developmental and endometrial pathways, which can modify embryo-maternal communication during early pregnancy and consequently affect pregnancy establishment.

AB  - Adults of Aulacophora lewisii Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) defoliate Luffa acutangula (L.) Roxb. plants, and lessen its production. Successful oviposition by herbivorous insects on their host is an important factor in the host acceptance process. In this context, it is important to investigate whether leaf surface wax chemicals from three ridge gourd cultivars (Abhiskar, Debsundari and Jaipur Long) could serve as short-range attractants and stimulate oviposition in A. lewisii females. Surface waxes were isolated from each leaf using the gum arabic method. Twenty-one n-alkanes from n-C12 to n-C34 and nine free fatty acids (FFAs) from C12:0 to C19:0 were detected and quantified by GC-MS and GC-FID, respectively. One leaf equivalent surface wax (LESW) of each cultivar or a synthetic blend consisting of n-alkanes and FFAs mimicking one LESW of the same cultivar served as attractants through Y-tube olfactometer bioassays and stimulated oviposition in A. lewisii females. However, one LESW of Jaipur Long or a synthetic blend of n-alkanes and FFAs mimicking one LESW of Jaipur Long served as more potent oviposition stimuli in females than one LESW or synthetic blends mimicking one LESW of the other two cultivars. In field trials, a synthetic blend of pentadecane, heptadecane, pentacosane, hexacosane and linoleic acid mimicking Jaipur Long at mole ratios of 1:14.45:1.68:1.38:1.62 at 1.6 g/ml petroleum ether when used as lure in funnel traps resulted in attraction of A. lewisii. Hence, the above synthetic blend could be used as a lure in baited traps in eco-friendly pest management strategies.

AB  - Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels regulate neuronal excitability and represent a possible therapeutic target for major depressive disorder (MDD). These channels are regulated by intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). However, the relationship between cAMP signaling and the influence of HCN channels on behavior remains opaque. In this study, we investigated the role of hippocampal cAMP signaling on behavior using chemogenetic technology in mice. Acutely increasing cAMP limited spatial memory and motivated behavior by increasing HCN function. However, chronically elevated cAMP limited surface trafficking of HCN channels by disrupting the interaction between HCN and tetratricopeptide repeat-containing Rab8b-interacting protein (TRIP8b), an auxiliary subunit. Chronically increased cAMP in the dorsal hippocampus was also sufficient to rescue cognitive deficits induced by chronic stress in mice. These results reveal a behaviorally relevant form of regulation of HCN channel surface expression that has potential as a therapeutic target for cognitive deficits related to chronic stress.

AB  - Lifestyle influences physical and cognitive development during the period of adolescence greatly. The most important of these lifestyle factors are diet and stress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of high fat diet (HFD) and chronic mild stress on cognitive function and anxiety-like behaviors in young rats and to study the role of caffeic acid as a potential treatment for anxiety and cognitive dysfunction. Forty rats were assigned into 4 groups: control, HFD, HFD + stress, and caffeic acid-treated group. Rats were sacrificed after neurobehavioral testing. We detected memory impairment and anxiety-like behavior in rats which were more exaggerated in stressed rats. Alongside the behavioral changes, there were biochemical and histological changes. HFD and/or stress decreased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and induced oxidative and inflammatory changes in the hippocampus. In addition, they suppressed Wnt/beta-catenin pathway which was associated with activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta). HFD and stress increased arginase 1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels as well. These disturbances were found to be aggravated in stressed rats than HFD group. However, caffeic acid was able to reverse these deteriorations leading to memory improvement and ameliorating anxiety-like behavior. So, the current study highlights an important neuroprotective role for caffeic acid that may guard against induction of cognitive dysfunction and anxiety disorders in adolescents who are exposed to HFD and/or stress.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Xiaoyaosan (XYS), a representative and classic traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescription with function of dispersing stagnated liver and strengthening spleen, has been used for thousands of years to treat depression. XYS' anti-depression effect has been demonstrated both clinically and experimentally; however, the material basis for this effect has yet to be elucidated.
   Aim of the study: This study aimed to evaluate the impact and underlying action mechanism of XYS' antidepressant active component (Xiaoyaosan ethyl acetate fraction, XYSEF) against chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced depression-like behavior in mice.
   Materials and methods: First, we established a behavioral despair depression mouse model to preliminarily determine the effective antidepressant dose of XYSEF. Then, we created a CUMS mouse model and used various classic behavioral tests, including SPT, ST, NFST, and TST, to assess XYSEF's antidepressant properties. IGF-1 levels in mouse serum and hippocampus were quantified using ELISA. The average optical density of Nissl bodies in the mouse hippocampal CA3 region was determined utilizing toluidine blue staining. Brdu and DCX expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) was assayed using the immunofluorescence method. IGF-1R beta, PI3K, p-PI3K, Akt, p-Akt, Caspase-3, and cleaved Caspase-3 protein levels in the hippocampus were determined with Western blot.
   Results: The behavioral despair mouse model findings showed that 9.1 and 40 g/kg of XYSEF both significantly shortened the immobility time of mice, suggesting that the effective dose range was 9.1-40 g/kg. Compared to the CUMS mouse model, XYSEF at 20 and 40 g/kg markedly increased the sucrose preference percentage in the SPT and grooming time in the ST, shortened the immobility time in the TST and the feeding latency in the NSFT, and reversed the downregulated IGF-1 content in mouse serum and hippocampus. In addition, XYSEF amplified the average optical density of Nissl bodies in the hippocampal CA3 region, promoted Brdu and DCX expression in DG, and diminished IGF-1R beta, p-PI3K/PI3K, p-Akt/Akt, and cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3 protein levels in the hippocampi of CUMS mice.
   Conclusion: XYSEF acted as an antidepressant in mice exhibiting CUMS-induced depression-like behaviors, possibly by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis, reducing neuronal apoptosis, and inhibiting the over activation of the IGF-1R beta/PI3K/Akt pathway.

AB  - The two-component system (TCS), a ubiquitous signaling network consisting of histidine kinases (HKs), phosphotransfers (HPs), and response regulator proteins (RRs), participates in various functions, including responses to abiotic stresses. However, a comprehensive identification of TCS genes in tea plants is still lacking. Here, we identified 60 CsTCS members in tea plants, including 23 HKs, 10 HPs, and 27 RRs. The analysis of promoter cisregulatory elements indicated that CsTCS genes are involved in phytohormone signaling, stress responses, and growth and development. The expression of CsETR1, CsETR2b, CsERS1b, and CsEIN4b from the HK subfamily was down-regulated by ethylene, whereas CsHK2b and CsHK3a were down-regulated by cytokinin. Conversely, CsHK4a and CsHK4b were up-regulated by cytokinin. CsTCS genes were widely expressed in various tissues, with the majority associated with multiple stresses. Furthermore, we demonstrated that suppressing the type-A response regulator CsRR5 in tea plants reduced cold tolerance and the expression of CBF-COR pathway genes, indicating that CsRR5 positively regulates the cold stress response through the CBF pathway. Therefore, our study establishes a connection between the two-component system and its downstream regulation in tea plant cold stress response.

AB  - The phytohormones, jasmonates (JAs), mediate many plant developmental processes and their responses to important environmental stresses, such as herbivore attack. Bioactive JAs are perceived by CORONATINE INSENSITIVE (COI)-receptors, and associated JAZ proteins, to activate downstream responses. To date, the JA receptors of the important monocot crop plant, rice, remain to be explored.Here, we studied all three rice COI proteins, OsCOI1a, OsCOI1b, and OsCOI2, by ligand binding, genome editing, and phenotyping and examining some of the responsible mechanisms for the different responses.OsCOI2 binds to most individual OsJAZs in the presence of endogenous JA ligands, as OsCOI1a /1b do, albeit with greater partner selectivity. Single mutants of each OsCOI and OsCOI1a/1b double mutants were constructed by CRIPSR-Cas9-based genome editing and used to phenotype developmental and defense responses. OsCOI1b is involved in root growth and grain-size control and plays overlapping roles with OsCOI1a in spikelet development, while OsCOI2 regulates leaf senescence, male sterility, root growth, and grain size. All OsCOIs mediated resistance to the devastating rice pest, the brown planthopper. However, the defense sectors regulated by OsCOI1a/1b and OsCOI2 clearly differed.Our results revealed that all three OsCOIs are functional JA receptors that play diverse roles in regulating downstream JA responses.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a pest with an amazing appetite, damages many crops and causes great losses, especially maize. Understanding the differences in different maize cultivars' responses to S. frugiperda infestation is very important for revealing the mechanisms involved in the resistance of maize plants to S. frugiperda. In this study, a comparative analysis of two maize cultivars, the common cultivar 'ZD958' and the sweet cultivar 'JG218', was used to investigate their physico-biochemical responses to S. frugiperda infestation by a pot experiment. The results showed that the enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense responses of maize seedlings were rapidly induced by S. frugiperda. Frist, the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of infested maize leaves were significantly increased and then decreased to the level of the control. Furthermore, compared with the control leaves, the puncture force values and the total phenolics, total flavonoids, and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one contents of infested leaves were significantly increased within a certain time. The superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activities of infested leaves were significantly increased in a certain period of time, while the catalase activities decreased significantly and then increased to the control level. The jasmonic acid (JA) levels of infested leaves were significantly improved, whereas the salicylic acid and abscisic acid levels changed less. Signaling genes associated with phytohormones and defensive substances including PAL4, CHS6, BX12, LOX1, and NCED9 were significantly induced at certain time points, especially LOX1. Most of these parameters changed greater in JG218 than in ZD958. Moreover, the larvae bioassay showed that S. frugiperda larvae weighed more on JG218 leaves than those on ZD958 leaves. These results suggested that JG218 was more susceptible to S. frugiperda than ZD958. Our findings will make it easier to develop strategies for controlling S. frugiperda for sustainable maize production and breeding of new maize cultivars with increased resistance to herbivores.

AB  - Plants defend against folivores by responding to folivore-derived elicitors following activation of signaling cascade networks. In Arabidopsis, HAK1, a receptor-like kinase, responds to polysaccharide elicitors (Fra) that are present in oral secretions of Spodoptera litura larvae to upregulate defense genes (e.g., PDF1.2) mediated through downstream cytoplasmic kinase PBL27. Here, we explored whether other protein kinases, including CPKs and CRKs, function with PBL27 in the intracellular signaling network for anti-herbivore responses. We showed that CRK2 and CRK3 were found to interact with PBL27, but CPKs did not. Although transcripts of PDF1.2 were upregulated in leaves of wild-type Arabidopsis plants in response to mechanical damage with Fra, this failed in CRK2- and PBL27-deficient mutant plants, indicating that the CRK2/PBL27 system is predominantly responsible for the Fra-responsive transcription of PDF1.2 in S. litura-damaged plants. In addition to CRK2-phosphorylated ERF13, as shown previously, ethylene signaling in connection to CRK2-phosphorylated PBL27 was predicted to be responsible for transcriptional regulation of a gene for ethylene response factor 13 (ERF13). Taken together, these findings show that CRK2 regulates not only ERF13 phosphorylation but also PBL27-dependent de novo synthesis of ERF13, thus determining active defense traits against S. litura larvae via transcriptional regulation of PDF1.2.

AB  - K+ availability is important for growth and quality of tea (Camellia sinesis L.). K solubilising bacteria convert insoluble K to available K. This study was conducted to screen K solubilising bacteria isolated from tea rhizosphere soil in Qimen county, Anhui province, China. The maximum K solubilisation colony (the ratio of diameter halo/colony was 2.54) was identified as Burkholderia sp. (storage number: M2021105) by biochemistry and molecular analysis. Pot experiments (Laterite) showed that the inoculation of Burkholderia sp. significantly improved tea plant height (Zhongcha108, 1 year old) and total polyphenols content by 21.14% and 21.58% compared with the control, respectively. Higher polyphenol level promoted the formation of theaflavin in the fermentation experiments. Further experiments showed that tartaric acid and pryuvic acid produced by Burkholderia sp. are important components associated with K solubilisation in vitro. Burkholderia sp. significantly increased soil available K by 15.12%; however, there was no significant difference in available N and P, and Cu, Mg, Zn and Ca compared with the control. K content in inoculated tea roots and leaves was significantly higher (50% and 10%, respectively) than the control. Compared with the control, exogenous supply of 60 mg kg(-1) K significantly increased levels of polyphenol (53.97%), theaflavin (16.31%), theaflavin-3-gallate (20%), theaflavin 3'-gallic acid ester (32.24%) and theaflavin 3,3'-gallic acid ester (40.95%). Due to its ability to enable higher available soil K, ur study indicated that Burkholderia sp. have potential to increase total polyphenols content be a bio-inoculant for biofortification of tea.

AB  - The ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway is a critical protein-degradation pathway in plant growth and development as well as in nearly all biological and abiotic stress processes. Although as a member of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway, the E3 ubiquitin ligase family has been shown to be essential for the selective degradation of downstream target proteins, it has been rarely reported in tea plants (Camellia sinensis). In this study, through database searches and extensive manual deduplication, 335 RING finger family proteins were selected from the Tea Plant Information Archive. These proteins were divided into six categories by the difference of RING finger domain: RING-H2, RING-HCa, RING-HCb, RING-C2, RING-v, and RING-G. Stress-induced differential gene expression analysis showed that 53 proteins in RING finger family can respond to selected exogenous stress. In vitro ubiquitination assays indicated that TEA031033, which was named CsMIEL1, exhibited the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases. CsMIEL1-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were resistant to some exogenous abiotic stresses, such as salt and drought stress but sensitive to exogenous methyl jasmonate treatment. Furthermore, CsMIEL1 reduced the accumulation of anthocyanin in transgenic plants in response to low temperature treatment. The results of this article provide basic date for studying the role of ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway in tea plants response to stresses.

AB  - Tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is one of the most important economic crops with multiple mutants. Recently, we found a special tea germplasm that has an aberrant tissue on its branches. To figure out whether this aberrant tissue is associated with floral bud (FB) or dormant bud (DB), we performed tissue section, transcriptome sequencing, and metabolomic analysis of these tissues. Longitudinal sections indicated the aberrant tissue internal structure was more like a special bud (SB), but was similar to that of DB. Transcriptome data analysis showed that the number of heterozygous and homozygous SNPs was significantly different in the aberrant tissue compared with FB and DB. Further, by aligning the unmapped sequences of the aberrant tissue to the Non-Redundant Protein Sequences (NR) database, we observed that 36.13% of unmapped sequences were insect sequences, which suggested that the aberrant tissue might be a variation of dormant bud tissue influenced by the interaction of tea plants and insects or pathogens. Metabolomic analysis showed that the differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) between the aberrant tissue and DB were significantly enriched in the metabolic pathways of biosynthesis of plant hormones and biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids. Subsequently, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the above mentioned two tissues, and the results indicated that photosynthetic capacity in the aberrant tissue was reduced, whereas the ethylene, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signaling pathways were activated. We speculated that exogenous infection induced programmed cell death (PCD) and increased the lignin content in dormant buds of tea plants, leading to the formation of this aberrant tissue. This study advanced our understanding of the interaction between plants and insects or pathogens, providing important clues about biotic stress factors and key genes that lead to mutations and formation of the aberrant tissue.

AB  - Objective: Isolation of bacteria and fungi from porcine nasal microbiome and evaluation of antibioticproducing potential among them. Methods: Conventional isolation using Sabouraud and Mueller-Hinton nutrient media was carried out for collected samples. The isolated strains were subjected to antibiotic susceptibility testing and antimicrobial activity screening. Results and Discussion: Taxonomy positions of the 20 isolated strains (18 bacteria, 1 yeast, 1 fungus) were determined by phylogenetic analysis, morphological study and a substrate utilization assay. Pseudomonas aeruginosa SM-11 was found to produce 4 known antibacterial molecules (pyocyanine, pyochelin, pyoluteorin, monorhamnolipid). Production of pyocyanine was induced by cocultivation with test microorganisms. Conclusions: The mammal microbiota might serve as a valuable source of antimicrobialproducing strains, including those of rare taxa. Cocultivation techniques are a promising approach to exploring antimicrobials from silent biosynthetic gene clusters.

AB  - Phytoecdysteroids (PE) are plant-derived ecdysteroids known as insect molting hormones. Among them, 20hydroxyecdysone (20E) is the major PE that defends against herbivorous insects. However, unlike in insects, little is known about the biosynthetic genes of 20E in plants. This study aimed to identify oxidoreductase genes involved in biosynthesis of 20E in spinach (Spinacia oleracea), a plant that contains high levels of 20E. To achieve this, spinach samples with varying 20E contents were generated, namely, 20E-positive wild-type spinach (SWT), 20E-negative callus derived from spinach roots (SCA), spinach with an increased 20E content due to pds gene knockdown via the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system (SPD), and its control (STR), and then RNA sequencing-based comparative transcriptome analysis was performed. Among 8,679 differentially expressed genes, seven oxidoreductase genes were selected as candidate genes involved in 20E biosynthesis. The reliability of these genes was validated through qRT-PCR. Additionally, using the VIGS system, four oxidoreductase genes (two short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase genes and two cytochrome P450 genes) whose expression strongly correlated with the 20E content were identified. Protein-ligand docking analysis further supported these findings and showed strong interactions between the candidate proteins and 20E precursors, indicating their potential roles in 20E biosynthesis. This is the first report to identify oxidoreductase genes involved in 20E biosynthesis in spinach, providing valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying 20E biosynthesis.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles act as danger signals to prime defense responses in neighboring plants, yet in many cases the mechanism behind this priming is not known. Volatile signals may be recognized directly by receptors and/or converted into other active compounds. Here we investigate the metabolic fate of volatile indole, a known priming signal in maize (Zea mays), to determine if its conversion to other compounds could play a role in its priming of defenses. We identified benzoxazinoids as major products from volatile indole using heavy isotope-labeled volatile indole and Pathway of Origin Determination in Untargeted Metabolomics (PODIUM) analysis. We then used benzoxazinoid biosynthesis maize mutants to investigate their role in indole-mediated priming. Labeled volatile indole was converted into DIMBOA-glucoside in a bx2 (benzoxazinone synthesis2)-dependent manner. The bx2 mutant plants showed elevated green leaf volatile (GLV) production in response to wounding and Spodoptera frugiperda regurgitant irrespective of indole exposure. Thus, volatile indole is converted into benzoxazinoids, and part of its priming mechanism may be due to the enhanced production of these phytoanticipins. However, indole-mediated enhanced GLV production does not rely on the conversion of indole to benzoxazinoids, so indole also has other signaling functions.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the significant cash crops in China. As a leaf crop, nitrogen supply can not only increase the number of new shoots and leaves but also improve the tenderness of the former. However, a conundrum remains in science, which is the molecular mechanism of nitrogen use efficiency, especially long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). In this study, a total of 16,452 lncRNAs were identified through high-throughput sequencing analysis of lateral roots under nitrogen stress and control conditions, of which 9,451 were differentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs). To figure out the potential function of nitrogen-responsive lncRNAs, co-expression clustering was employed between lncRNAs and coding genes. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed nitrogen-responsive lncRNAs may involve in many biological processes such as plant hormone signal transduction, nitrogen metabolism and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. The expression abundance of 12 DE-lncRNAs were further verified by RT-PCR, and their expression trends were consistent with the results of RNA-seq. This study expands the research on lncRNAs in tea plants, provides a novel perspective for the potential regulation of lncRNAs on nitrogen stress, and valuable resources for further improving the nitrogen use efficiency of tea plants.

AB  - The production of defensive metabolites in plants can be induced by signaling chemicals released by neighboring plants. Induction is mainly known from volatile aboveground signals, with belowground signals and their underlying mechanisms largely unknown. We demonstrate that (-)-loliolide triggers defensive metabolite responses to competitors, herbivores, and pathogens in seven plant species. We further explore the transcriptional responses of defensive pathways to verify the signaling role of (-)-loliolide in wheat and rice models with well-known defensive metabolites and gene systems. In response to biotic and abiotic stressors, (-)-loliolide is produced and secreted by roots. This, in turn, induces the production of defensive compounds including phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, benzoxazinoids, and cyanogenic glycosides, regardless of plant species. (-)-Loliolide also triggers the expression of defense-related genes, accompanied by an increase in the concentration of jasmonic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Transcriptome profiling and inhibitor incubation indicate that (-)-loliolide-induced defense responses are regulated through pathways mediated by jasmonic acid, H2O2, and Ca (2+). These findings argue that (-)-loliolide functions as a common belowground signal mediating chemical defense in plants. Such perception-dependent plant chemical defenses will yield critical insights into belowground signaling interactions.

AB  - Crop plants encounter a variety of biotic challenges in the field and faces significant reduction in crop yield. In the current scenario of an ever increasing global population, there is an urgent need to protect plant health by using sustainable approach to maximize the crop productivity and to mitigate the food demands. Nowadays, we mostly rely on chemical crop protection techniques, which are causing a number of environmental and health difficulties. Defence priming is a chemical-free, eco-friendly, and sustainable strategy of crop protection, which is also called "green vaccination. In the present study, for the first time, we used Trichoderma as a priming agent to protect wheat crop from spot blotch disease. We have established Trichoderma-mediated defence priming in wheat against Bipolaris sorokiniana for sustainable crop improvement. We have characterised the morphological, disease phenotype, biochemical and yield parameters of Trichoderma-primed and non-primed wheat under disease pressure. Trichoderma-primed plants were found to be more protected against B. sorokiniana as compared to non-primed plants. Biochemical studies indicated that there is no direct defence response after priming stimulus but the defence response was activated only after triggering stimulus in terms of enhanced defence metabolites in primed plants as compared to non-primed plants. In the present study, since defence was activated only when required, that is under disease pressure, there was no unnecessary allocation of resources towards defence. Hence, no yield penalty was shown in primed plants as compared to control. We further evaluated the inheritance of primed state to the next generation and found that progeny of primed parents also performed better than progeny of non-primed parents under disease pressure in terms of protection from B. sorokiniana as well as yield performance. This strategy has the potential to protect crop without any yield penalty and causing environmental degradation. Our research findings indicate that Trichoderma-mediated defence priming could be an alternative approach for improving wheat productivity under biotic stress. To be our best knowledge, this is the first documented report for the Trichoderma-mediated defence priming and induced inheritance in wheat plant. This study will open new arenas in sustainable crop protection strategies for the exploitation of defence priming in crop plants.

AB  - The exposure to volatiles from damaged plants can increase the resistance of the neighboring plants to herbivores. Studies have demonstrated that the strength of this response depends on the level of relatedness between the interacting plants. Indeed, a field study with Phaseolus lunatus found that the responses to induced volatiles were population-specific; individuals exposed to damaged conspecifics from the 'local' population exhibited greater resistance to herbivores than those exposed to damaged conspecifics from 'foreign' populations. Here, we repeated this study in the laboratory by placing undamaged plants near damaged plants from either their local or a foreign population. The former plants experienced less herbivory than the latter after a subsequent challenge by a generalist herbivore. To understand the role of the volatiles underlying this observed specificity, we explored the variability in the constitutively released volatiles and volatiles released after mechanical or herbivore damage among the three tested populations of P. lunatus. The total volatile emissions were 5 x and 10 x higher from the mechanically and herbivore-damaged plants, respectively, compared to the undamaged plants. The populations differed in their relative ratios of dominant constitutive compounds, but no pattern was observed that could explain the differential responses to induced volatiles among the populations. Overall, this study confirms the population-specific volatile-mediated interactions in P. lunatus.

AB  - The pulp of Pouteria Ramiflora (Mart.) Radlk presents potential for developing a soluble tea due to its functional and organoleptic properties. This paper had the objective developed a soluble tea from the pulp of P. ramiflora fruit, as well as to optimize the process of obtaining tea using spray dryer through factorial planning. Besides, the chromatographic profile and antioxidant potential of the infusion from pulp were investigated. The chromatographic profile (HPLC/DAD) revealed gallic acid as the main component of the pulp. The aqueous extract of pulp had good antioxidant activity response by the phosphomolybdenum complex reduction method (116.3 mg of ascorbic acid equivalent per mL of sample). The influence of the independent variables air inlet temperature and maltodextrin concentration on the variable response yield (%), through a 22 full factorial design, was determined. The optimization of the process generated a mathematical equation that provided an approximation to the true system, with a strong correlation. The analysis of response surface indicated optimal conditions for the drying process. The results highlight the potential future of the soluble tea of P. ramiflora pulp with good acceptability and functional appeal. (c) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) constitute a large family of enzymes with a wide range of cellular functions. Recently, plant GSTs have gained a great deal of attention due to their involvement in the detoxification of electrophilic xenobiotics and peroxides under adverse environmental conditions, such as salt, cold, UV-B and drought stress. A previous study reported that a GST gene (CsGSTU8) in tea plant was distinctly induced in response to drought, suggesting this gene plays a critical role in the drought stress response. In this study, by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter lines, we further demonstrated that CsGSTU8 was upregulated in response to drought stress and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Overexpression of CsGSTU8 in Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced drought tolerance as indicated by the improved scavenging of excess amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under drought conditions. Furthermore, we found that CsWRKY48 acts as a transcriptional activator and that its expression is induced in response to drought stress and ABA treatment. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), dual-luciferase (LUC) assays and transient expression assays in tea plant leaves revealed that CsWRKY48 directly binds to the W-box elements in the promoter of CsGSTU8 and activates its expression. Taken together, our results provide additional knowledge of drought stress responses in tea plant.

AB  - Tribes Palicoureeae and Psychotrieae (Rubiaceae, Gentianales) are complex and speciose sister groups with a pantropical distribution. Since the initial studies on ipecacuanha more than two centuries ago, species of the group have been subject to numerous phytochemical studies yielding diverse specialized ("secondary") metabolites, most of them alkaloids. However, the generic limits within the tribes have long been unclear and only recently, monophyletic genera have been delimited and segregated from a once broadly circumscribed Psychotria. Thus, a phylogeny-based and taxonomically updated review of phytochemical literature was performed which allowed assigning the bulk of phytochemical data previously reported for Psychotria to various segregate genera such as Carapichea, Eumachia and Palicourea. This review not only challenges the common perception of Psychotria as a monoterpene-indole alkaloid-rich genus. It also highlights that each of its relatives differs by accumulating specific groups of alkaloids, which is of major importance for understanding animal-plant interactions such as herbivory, as well as for drug discovery. The alkaloid complement of each of these genera is here enumerated and discussed, which should provide a framework for future studies addressing the biosynthesis, evolution, ecological and pharmacological significance of specialized metabolite differentiation in this abundant, ecologically and ethnopharmacologically important group.

AB  - Accumulating evidence in adults has shown that curiosity and surprise enhance memory via activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and dopaminergic areas. Based on findings of how these brain areas and their inter-connections develop during childhood and adolescence, we discuss how the effects of curiosity and surprise on memory may develop during childhood and adolescence. We predict that the maturation of brain areas potentially related to curiosity elicitation (hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], prefrontal cortex) and protracted development of hippocampal-PFC and ACC-PFC connectivity lead to differential effects of curiosity and surprise on memory during childhood and adolescence. Our predictions are centred within the PACE (PredictionAppraisal-Curiosity-Exploration) Framework which proposes multiple levels of analyses of how curiosity is elicited and enhances memory.

AB  - Benzoxazinoids are important secondary metabolites in gramineae plants and have inhibitory and toxic effects against a wide range of herbivore pests. However, the relationship between benzoxazinoid level and plant resistance to aphids remains controversial. In this study, we investigated the relationship between benzoxazinoids composition and concentration in wheat leaves and the resistance to the grain aphid Sitobion avenae. Overall, six benzoxazinoids were detected and identified by mass spectrometry based metabolites profiling, including three lactams, two hydroxamic acids, and one methyl derivative. The constitutive levels of these benzoxazinoids were significantly different among the wheat varieties/lines. However, none of these benzoxazinoids exhibited considerable correlation with aphid resistance. S. avenae feeding elevated the level of 2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy-4,7-dimethoxy-(2H)-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (HDMBOA-Glc) and reduced the level of 2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyloxy-4-hydroxy-7-(2H)-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3(4H)-one (DIMBOA-Glc) in some of the wheat varieties/lines. Moreover, aphid-induced level of DIMBOA-Glc was positively related with callose deposition, which was closely associated with aphid resistance. Wheat leaves infiltrated with DIMBOA-Glc caused a noticeable increase of callose deposition and the effect was in a dose dependent manner. This study suggests that the constitutive level of benzoxazinoids has limited impact on S. avenae. Aphid feeding can affect the balance of benzoxazinoids metabolism and the dynamic level of benzoxazinoids can act as a signal of callose deposition for S. avenae resistance. This study will extend our understanding of aphid-wheat interaction and provides new insights in aphid-resistance wheat breeding.

AB  - Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with limited treatments. Schisandra total lignans (STL), the primary active component of Schisandra chinensis, shows potential in alleviating AD-related symptoms, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Purpose: Considering the promoting effect of neuronal ferroptosis on AD and the neuroprotective activity of STL, this study aimed to investigate the impact of STL on AD neuronal ferroptosis and elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Methods: This study used 3xTg-AD mice and SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing APPswe as models. UHPLC/Q-TOF-MS was applied for identifying components in STL extract and the plasma of 3xTg-AD mice, as well as to detect cellular endogenous metabolites for one-carbon metabolism analysis. Behavioral tests, including the Y maze, novel object recognition, Morris water maze, and open field, were conducted to assess the cognitive function and emotional state. Histopathological examinations were performed using immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, Nissl staining, and transmission electron microscopy. The GSH, GSSG, NAD(H), NADP(H), and MDA levels, as well as GPX and GR activity were measured using assay kits. ROS, Fe2+, and lipid peroxidation levels were detected with probes. Protein expression was evaluated by Western blot. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and cellular thermal shift assay were performed to analyze the STL-NADK interactions. Results: Behavioral tests indicated that STL alleviated cognitive impairments and anxiety in 3xTg-AD mice. Histological analysis showed that STL decreased hippocampal A beta levels, inhibited hippocampal neuronal ferroptosis, and mitigated synaptic damage. Cellular assays demonstrated that STL alleviated APPswe overexpression-induced ferroptosis and synaptic damage by activating the NADK/NADPH/GSH pathway, with NADK knockdown abolishing this neuroprotective effect of STL. Computational analysis and cellular thermal shift assay identified Gomisin D as the key STL component with strong affinity for NADK, driving its neuroprotective effects. Conclusion: NADK emerges as a novel potential therapeutic target for AD, with STL activating NADK, promoting NADPH and GSH production, thereby mitigating neuronal ferroptosis in AD.

AB  - Introduction Anthracnose poses a significant threat to the sustainable development of the Camellia oleifera industry. In this study, we aimed to assess the efficacy of melatonin-induced Bacillus tequilensis DZY6715 (MT-DZY 6715) in controlling C. oleifera anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum siamense.Methods The antifungal activity of MT-DZY6715 against C. siamense was systematically evaluated in vitro dual-culture assays and in planta infection trials. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of MT-DZY 6715 on the anatomical features of C. oleifera leaves using histological sectioning. Additionally, transcriptome and enzymatic assays were employed to assess the expression of secondary metabolism-related genes and the activity of cell wall-degrading enzymes.Results The application of MT-DZY 6715 effectively controls the growth of C. siamense, markedly reducing the incidence of C. oleifera anthracnose and delaying the spread of pathogens on the leaves. Furthermore, MT-DZY 6715 treatment enhanced leaf thickness, palisade mesophyll, as well as elevated the ratio of palisade mesophyll to spongy mesophyll (PS) and tissue compactness (CTR), while simultaneously decreasing tissue looseness (SR). Meanwhile, the leaf stomata undergo a reduction in size and a decrease in their openness. In addition, MT-DZY 6715 promoted the expression of secondary metabolism-related genes, such as PAL, CAL, Laccase, HCT, and CHI, and inhibited the activity of enzymes related to cell wall degradation (pectinase and cellulase), thereby coordinating and enhancing the accumulation of secondary metabolites and strengthening the mechanical properties of the cell wall.Discussion The results of this study demonstrate that MT-DZY 6715 enhances the resistance of C. oleifera to anthracnose by modulating leaf morphology, regulating stomatal function, and promoting the accumulation of secondary metabolites. These findings provides a scientific foundation for deploying MT-DZY6715 as an eco-friendly alternative to chemical fungicides in anthracnose management.

AB  - Cyantraniliprole, a second-generation anthranilic diamide, is widely used to manage lepidopteran pests, including the invasive tomato pinworm Tuta absoluta (Meyrick). However, cyantraniliprole's resistance mechanisms and associated fitness costs in T. absoluta remain underexplored. Here, we investigated the fitness costs and resistance mechanisms of cyantraniliprole-resistant strain (CyanRS) via nanocarrier-mediated RNA interference (RNAi). Results showed that the egg incubation period and developmental durations of larval and pupal stages were significantly prolonged in the CyanRS population of T. absoluta compared to the susceptible strain (SS). Further, the adult emergence, longevities of male and female, fecundity, and hatching rate were significantly reduced in CyanRS individuals. The mRNA expression levels of cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R) and cytochrome P450 (CYP9E2) were analyzed using RT-qPCR to explore their potential involvement in cyantraniliprole resistance in T. absoluta. Phylogenetic and motif analysis of CYB5R and CYP9E2 indicated their evolutionary and functional conservation with other insect species, especially Lepidopterans. Notably, nanocarrier-encapsulated dsRNA targeting CYB5R and CYP9E2 genes significantly reduced their expression levels. Further, the activity of cytochrome P450 was substantially decreased after the knockdown of the CYB5R and CYP92 genes. This increased susceptibility of the resistant population of T. absoluta to cyantraniliprole, leading to a higher mortality rate than the controls. These findings show that CYB5R and CYP9E2 might play a key role in cyantraniliprole resistance evolution in T. absoluta. The current study provides in-depth insights to understand the underlying mechanisms of cyantraniliprole resistance in this key invasive herbivore.

AB  - Camellia drupifera, a valuable woody oil crop, holds significant ecological, economic, and medicinal importance. Its seed maturation involves intricate physiological changes, particularly the interplay between oil biosynthesis and sugar metabolism. This study investigates sugar accumulation and the expression dynamics of sugar metabolism-related unigenes during three key developmental stages of C. drupifera fruit: the nutrient synthesis stage (NS), fat accumulation stage (FA), and maturation stage (MS). The findings reveal distinct differences in sugar content and regulatory mechanisms across the stages. The NS stage emerges as a critical period for sugar metabolism, characterized by peak levels of soluble sugars and fructose alongside a significantly elevated expression of sugar metabolism-related unigenes. The significant correlation between sucrose content and gene expression suggests a crucial role of carbohydrates in fruit maturation. Transcriptomic analysis identified key differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) in sugar metabolism pathways, which qRT-PCR further validated. These results offer novel insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating sugar metabolism during C. drupifera fruit development. At the same time, it provides a theoretical basis for the genetic improvement and effective utilization of other oil crops, supporting their broader agricultural and industrial applications.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is a perennial green plant, and its tender leaves are rich in secondary metabolites, such as theanine. Ethylamine (EA), a small amine, is an important prerequisite for theanine synthesis. However, beyond its involvement in theanine synthesis, the other physiological functions of EA in tea plants remain unknown. In vitro experiments indicate that EA may function as scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) to protect the plant against damage caused by osmotic stress. Additionally, a significant correlation between EA levels and osmotic tolerance has been observed in different tea varieties. From the results, alanine decarboxylase (CsAlaDC)-silenced tea leaves and overexpressed CsAlaDC Arabidopsis thaliana lines decreased and increased EA levels, respectively, and mediated ROS homeostasis, thus exhibiting a sensitive and tolerant phenotype. In addition, the transcription factor (TF) CsCBF4 was functionally identified, which can directly bind to the CsAlaDC promoter. CsCBF4-silenced tea leaves significantly reduced the expression levels of CsAlaDC and in turn EA content, resulting in excess ROS accumulation and an osmotic-sensitive phenotype. Taken together, these results established a new regulatory module consisting of CBF4-CsAlaDC responsible for EA accumulation and ROS homeostasis in response to osmotic stress.

AB  - Cold shock proteins (CSPs) are DNA/RNA binding proteins with crucial regulatory roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. In this study, we employed bioinformatics tools to identify and analyze the physicochemical properties, conserved domains, gene structure, phylogenetic relationships, cis-acting elements, subcellular localization, and expression patterns of the cotton CSP gene family. A total of 62 CSP proteins were identified across four cotton varieties (Gossypium arboreum, Gossypium raimondii, Gossypium barbadense, Gossypium hirsutum) and five plant varieties (Arabidopsis thaliana, Brassica chinensis, Camellia sinensis, Triticum aestivum, and Oryza sativa). Phylogenetic analysis categorized cotton CSP proteins into three evolutionary branches, revealing similar gene structures and motif distributions within each branch. Analysis of gene structural domains highlighted the conserved CSD and CCHC domains across all cotton CSP families. Subcellular localization predictions indicated predominant nuclear localization for CSPs. Examination of cis-elements in gene promoters revealed a variety of elements responsive to growth, development, light response, hormones, and abiotic stresses, suggesting the potential regulation of the cotton CSP family by different hormones and their involvement in diverse stress responses. RT-qPCR results suggested that GhCSP.A1, GhCSP.A2, GhCSP.A3, and GhCSP.A7 may play roles in cotton's response to low-temperature stress. In conclusion, our findings underscore the significant role of the CSP gene family in cotton's response to low-temperature stress, providing a foundational basis for further investigations into the functional aspects and molecular mechanisms of cotton's response to low temperatures.

AB  - Plant-plant interactions via herbivory-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) have been shown to trigger plant anti-herbivore defense responses. Such volatiles-regulated genes have been studied comprehensively in lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) and Arabidopsis thaliana at the transcriptional level, but not in soybean (Glycine max). The transcriptomes of soybean leaf tissues responding to aphid infestation and volatiles released from neighboring aphid-infested plants were studied by RNAseq. Soybean aphid infested plants exhibited 2413 up-regulated and 3905 down-regulated genes, while leaf exposure to volatiles resulted in 2153 up-regulated and 3572 down-regulated genes, which were endowed with a wide range of functions including 'hormone responses', 'pathogen-related', and 'oxidative stress' functions. The results ultimately demonstrated that aphid damage and volatiles exposure elicited drastic metabolic changes in soybean leaves. These results also emphasize that RNA-seq analysis of repressed genes should contribute to our understanding of signal transduction in aphid-infested leaves, as well as in leaves exposed to herbivory-induced volatiles.

AB  - The R2R3-MYB transcription factor (TF) family regulates metabolism of phenylpropanoids in various plant lineages. Species-expanded or specific MYB TFs may regulate species-specific metabolite biosynthesis including phenylpropanoid-derived bioactive products. Camellia sinensis produces an abundance of specialized metabolites, which makes it an excellent model for digging into the genetic regulation of plant-specific metabolite biosynthesis. The most abundant health-promoting metabolites in tea are galloylated catechins, and the most bioactive of the galloylated catechins, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), is specifically relative abundant in C. sinensis. However, the transcriptional regulation of galloylated catechin biosynthesis remains elusive. This study mined the R2R3-MYB TFs associated with galloylated catechin biosynthesis in C. sinensis. A total of 118 R2R3-MYB proteins, classified into 38 subgroups, were identified. R2R3-MYB subgroups specific to or expanded in C. sinensis were hypothesized to be essential to evolutionary diversification of tea-specialized metabolites. Notably, nine of these R2R3-MYB genes were expressed preferentially in apical buds (ABs) and young leaves, exactly where galloylated catechins accumulate. Three putative R2R3-MYB genes displayed strong correlation with key galloylated catechin biosynthesis genes, suggesting a role in regulating biosynthesis of epicatechin gallate (ECG) and EGCG. Overall, this study paves the way to reveal the transcriptional regulation of galloylated catechins in C. sinensis.

AB  - Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are amino alcohols, often esterified with mono- or dicarboxylic acids, found in several plant families, including the Asteraceae. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are used for plant defence against generalist invertebrate herbivores. However, specialist herbivores that are able to sequester PAs from the host plant species derive a number of benefits from these defence compounds. This study investigated alkaloids and PAs from the leaves and roots of the southern African biotype (SAB) of Chromolaena odorata in different regions and habitats in South Africa, with and without the specialist herbivore Pareuchaetes insulata. Alkaloid N-oxides were initially detected in leaf samples by Mayor's and Dragendorff's reagents and later by thin-layer chromatography on root samples with detection by successive treatment with acetic anhydride and Ehrlich's reagent. Two pyrrolizidine alkaloids, rinderine and the stereoisomer intermidine, were isolated from the reduced root extract of the SAB C. odorata and identified by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry. The structures and configuration of the compounds were confirmed by chemical and spectroscopic methods, especially one-dimensional H-1 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are known to be used by arctiine moths to find their host plant and are sequestered for mating purposes, and furthermore, these compounds render these lepidopterans unpalatable to predators. This study is the first to detect the presence of alkaloids and pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the SAB C. odorata. (C) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is a major root crop worldwide. Sweet potato weevils (SPWs) pose one of the most significant challenges to sweet potato production in tropical and subtropical regions, causing deleterious economic and environmental effects. Characterizing the mechanisms underlying natural resistance to SPWs is therefore crucial; however, the genetic basis of host SPW resistance (SPWR) remains unclear. Here we obtained two sweet potato germplasm with high SPWR and, by map-based cloning, revealed two major SPW-resistant genes-SPWR1 and SPWR2-that are important regulators of natural defence against SPWs. The SPW-induced WRKY transcriptional factor SPWR1 directly activates the expression of SPWR2, and SPWR2, the conserved dehydroquinate synthase, promotes the accumulation of quinate derivative metabolites that confer SPWR in sweet potato. Generally, our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism underlying sweet potato-SPW interactions and will aid future efforts to achieve eco-friendly SPW management.

AB  - Interest in fermented foods has grown due to potential health benefits, and kombucha, an ancient beverage originating in Asia, has been highlighted for its probiotic properties and unique flavor. Combining kombucha with spices has shown promising results in improving the flavor and nutritional properties of the fermented beverage. The study evaluated the composition of kombucha prepared with green tea (Camellia sinensis), both in the first and second fermentation, using homemade samples from consumers. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum), cloves (Syzygium aromaticum), and turmeric (Curcuma longa) were added to enrich kombucha with different aromas and health benefits. The results indicated increased levels of reducing sugars during fermentation and a constant concentration of antioxidant compounds in all samples kombucha fermented on the seventh day. Adding clove and cinnamon spices in the second fermentation increased the concentration of antioxidants, but the same effect was not observed with turmeric. Furthermore, fermentation also increases the presence of essential mineral compounds in the kombucha. (c) 2024 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction Camellia oleifera, a crucial woody oil crop in China, produces seeds with over 90% unsaturated fatty acids offering substantial nutritional value and exists predominantly as cultivated tetraploid varieties (2n=4x=60) due to its polyploid nature. The DNA-binding with one finger (Dof) transcription factor play multiple roles in plant growth, development, and abiotic stress response pathways. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Dof genes underlying fatty acids/lipids biosynthesis during seed morphogenesis in Camellia oleifera remain poorly characterized.Methods In this study, genome-wide identified a total of 40 members of the CoDof family with 116 alleles in tetraploid Camellia oleifera (COL-tetra).Results All members possess varying numbers of highly conserved C2-C2-type zinc finger domains. Phylogenetic analysis clustered CoDof genes into nine categories, and significant divergence was observed in the expression levels of all family members across different growth and development stages of COL-tetra seeds. After physiological data determination at various levels, differential expression analysis and correlation analysis of fatty acid/lipid synthesis genes revealed that CoDof30.1 is a typical candidate nuclear-localized transcription factor which significantly highly expressed in the middle period of seed development.Discussion Our findings not only comprehensively characterize the genomic organization of CoDof family but also propose a functional candidate for lipid biosynthesis regulation, thereby advancing molecular breeding strategies and elite cultivar selection in COL-tetra.

AB  - The green leaf volatiles (GLVs) (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate play important roles in plant defense, deterring insect herbivores and attracting their natural enemies, while also serving as airborne signaling molecules capable of enhancing defenses in undamaged plant tissues. Almost all plants produce GLVs after wounding, beginning with the formation of (Z)-3-hexenal, which is subsequently converted to (Z)-3-hexenol and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate can then be taken up by nearby plant tissues where it is predicted to be hydrolyzed to (Z)-3-hexenol, a process that is likely to be important in regulating the specific activities of these compounds. However, the enzyme(s) involved in this process and its role in plant defense are largely unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants rapidly take up (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate and convert it to (Z)-3-hexenol. Inhibitor and fractionation experiments identified the carboxylesterases Carboxylesterase 5 (AtCXE5) and Carboxylesterase 12 (AtCXE12) as likely contributors to the (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate esterase activity in Arabidopsis leaves. Heterologous expression of AtCXE5 and AtCXE12 in Escherichia coli revealed that both recombinant enzymes hydrolyze (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate to (Z)-3-hexenol. Furthermore, assays using T-DNA insertion mutants showed that AtCXE12 significantly contributes to (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate hydrolysis in Arabidopsis. Lastly, we found that leaves from several other plant species possess (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate esterase activity, suggesting a conserved mechanism for GLV metabolism among plants. Overall, our study provides a better understanding of the biosynthesis and conversion dynamics of GLVs, which is necessary for unraveling the potential functions of these compounds.
   A carboxylesterase hydrolyzes the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in Arabidopsis leaves, and similar activity in leaf extracts from several other plant species suggests a conserved mechanism for green leaf volatile metabolism.

AB  - Cold stress significantly limits the growth and yield of tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze), particularly in northern China, may lead to huge economic losses. Glycine betaine (GB), an osmotic regulator, is widely applied in crop resistance to abiotic stress. This study investigates the role of GB and its biosynthetic enzyme CsBADH in enhancing cold tolerance in tea plants. Two cultivars, 'Shuchazao' (cold-resistant) and 'Baiye 1' (cold-sensitive), were subjected to low temperature stress (0 degrees C). GB accumulation was measured, revealing that 'Shuchazao' exhibited 1.4-fold higher GB levels than 'Baiye 1 ', suggesting a link between higher GB accumulation and cold tolerance. Exogenous GB treatment improved cold resistance, especially in the cold-sensitive cultivar 'Baiye 1'. The CsBADH gene, a key enzyme in GB biosynthesis, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, confirming its activity. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, Nicotiana tabacum, and C. sinensis plants overexpressing CsBADH showed increased GB levels (1.5- to 2.4-fold), proline content, peroxidase (POD) activities, and enhanced cold tolerance, while silencing CsBADH decreased GB accumulation and cold resistance. These findings demonstrate that CsBADH plays a critical role in cold stress response by promoting GB accumulation, offering potential strategies for improving the resilience of tea and other leaf crops to cold stress.

AB  - Hippophae gyantsensis is a dioecious plant endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and is significant for ecological restoration and sand stabilization. Its fruit is rich in bioactive compounds that offer economic potential. However, the inability to distinguish sexes before flowering and prolonged maturation hinder breeding and cultivation. We performed whole-genome resequencing on male and female plants, identified large insertion/deletion (InDel) variants, and developed two sex-specific primers (Higy_04 and Higy_06). These primers enable rapid, accurate PCR-based sex identification. All sex-specific sites were located on chromosome 2, suggesting its potential role as the sex chromosome. Additionally, we found a 1:1 sex ratio among offspring from the same mother plant, consistent with Mendelian inheritance, indicating that sex segregation is mainly genetically controlled. This work lays the foundation for developing molecular markers applicable across the entire genus Hippophae and contributes to understanding sex chromosome formation and adaptive evolution within the genus.

AB  - Jasmonates (JAs) are important phytohormones that regulate plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and developmental processes. Distinct JAs in different plant lineages activate a conserved signaling pathway that mediates these responses: dinor-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (dn-OPDA) isomers in bryophytes and lycophytes, and JA-Ile in most vascular plants. In many cases, the final responses triggered by these phytohormones depend on the accumulation of specialized metabolites. To identify compounds regulated by the dn-OPDA pathway in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, untargeted metabolomic analyses were carried out in response to wounding, a stress that activates the dn-OPDA pathway. A previously unreported group of molecules was identified from these analyses: dn-OPDA-amino acid conjugates (dn-OPDA-aas). Their accumulation after wounding and herbivory was confirmed by targeted metabolic profiling in Marchantia and in all species in which we previously detected dn-iso-OPDA. Mutants in GRETCHEN-HAGEN 3A (MpGH3A) failed to accumulate dn-OPDA-aa conjugates and showed a constitutive activation of the OPDA pathway and increased resistance to herbivory. Our results show that dn-iso-OPDA bioactivity is reduced by amino acid conjugation. Therefore, JA conjugation in land plants plays dichotomous roles: jasmonic acid conjugation with isoleucine (Ile) produces the bioactive JA-Ile in tracheophytes, whereas conjugation of dn-iso-OPDA with different amino acids deactivates the phytohormone in bryophytes and lycophytes.

AB  - Flavonoids, including flavonol derivatives, are the main astringent compounds of tea and are beneficial to human health. Many researches have been conducted to comprehensively identify and characterize the phenolic compounds in the tea plant. However, the biological function of tea flavonoids is not yet understood, especially those accumulated in floral organs. In this study, the metabolic characteristics of phenolic compounds in different developmental stages of flower buds and various parts of the tea flower were investigated by using metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed varying accumulation patterns of different phenolic polyphenol compounds during flowering; moreover, the content of flavonol compounds gradually increased as the flowers opened. Petals and stamens were the main sites of flavone and flavonol accumulation. Compared with those of fertile flowers, the content of certain flavonols, such as kaempferol derivatives, in anthers of hybrid sterile flowers was significantly low. Transcriptomic analysis revealed different expression patterns of genes in the same gene family in tea flowers. The CsFLSb gene was significantly increased during flowering and was highly expressed in anthers. Compared with fertile flowers, CsFLSb was significantly downregulated in sterile flowers. Further functional verification of the three CsFLS genes indicated that CsFLSb caused an increase in flavonol content in transgenic tobacco flowers and that CsFLSa acted in leaves. Taken together, this study highlighted the metabolic properties of phenolic compounds in tea flowers and determined how the three CsFLS genes have different functions in the vegetative and reproductive organs of tea plants. Furthermore, CsFLSb could regulated flavonol biosynthesis in tea flowers, thus influencing fertility. This research is of great significance for balancing the reproductive growth and vegetative growth of tea plants.</p>

AB  - Despite the importance of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for plants, control mechanisms for their basal and stress-induced biosynthesis and release remain unclear. We sampled and characterized headspace and internal leaf volatile pools in rice (Oryza sativa), after a simulated herbivory treatment, which triggers an endogenous jasmonate burst. Certain volatiles, such as linalool, were strongly upregulated by simulated herbivory stress. In contrast, other volatiles, such as beta-caryophyllene, were constitutively emitted and fluctuated according to time of day. Transcripts of the linalool synthase gene transiently increased 1-3 h after exposure of rice to simulated herbivory, whereas transcripts of caryophyllene synthase peaked independently at dawn. Unexpectedly, although emission and accumulation patterns of rice inducible and constitutive VOCs were substantially different, both groups of volatiles were compromised in jasmonate-deficient hebiba mutants, which lack the allene oxide cyclase (AOC) gene. This suggests that rice employs at least two distinct oxylipin-dependent mechanisms downstream of AOC to control production of constitutive and herbivore-induced volatiles. Levels of the JA precursor, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), were correlated with constitutive volatile levels suggesting that OPDA or its derivatives could be involved in control of volatile emission in rice.

AB  - The aim of this study was to cover biopolymeric packaging films based on PLA/PHBV blend with a functional composite coating (to retain their ecological character) and to investigate their antimicrobial properties before and after UV irradiation. As an active coating, the carrier hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), as well as its modified form with Achillea millefolium L., Hippophae rhamnoides L., and Hypericum L. extract (E) and a combined system based on the extracts and nano-ZnO (EZ), was used to obtain active formulations. Additionally, film surface morphology (SEM, FTIR-ATR) and color (CIELab scale) analysis of the pre- and post-UV-treatment samples were performed. The results confirmed that the E and EZ-modified films exhibited antibacterial properties, but they were not effective against phage phi6. Q-SUN irradiation led to a decrease in the activity of E coating against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas syringae, and Candida albicans. In this case, the effectiveness of EZ against C. albicans at 24 h and 72 h UV irradiation decreased. However, the irradiation boosted the antiviral effectiveness of the EZ layer. SEM micrographs of the film surface showed that UV treatment did not significantly influence the native film morphology, but it had an impact on the coated film. FTIR analysis results showed that the coatings based on HPMC altered the IR absorption of the nonpolar groups of the biopolyester material. The applied coatings only marginally affected film color changes and increased their yellowness after UV irradiation, whereas a composite layer of nano-ZnO limited these changes.

AB  - The cancer epigenome has been studied in cells cultured in two-dimensional (2D) monolayers, but recent studies highlight the impact of the extracellular matrix and the three-dimensional (3D) environment on multiple cellular functions. Here, we report the physical, biochemical, and genomic differences between T47D breast cancer cells cultured in 2D and as 3D spheroids. Cells within 3D spheroids exhibit a rounder nucleus with less accessible, more compacted chromatin, as well as altered expression of similar to 2000 genes, the majority of which become repressed. Hi-C analysis reveals that cells in 3D are enriched for regions belonging to the B compartment, have decreased chromatin-bound CTCF and increased fusion of topologically associating domains (TADs). Upregulation of the Hippo pathway in 3D spheroids results in the activation of the LATS1 kinase, which promotes phosphorylation and displacement of CTCF from DNA, thereby likely causing the observed TAD fusions. 3D cells show higher chromatin binding of progesterone receptor (PR), leading to an increase in the number of hormone-regulated genes. This effect is in part mediated by LATS1 activation, which favors cytoplasmic retention of YAP and CTCF removal.

AB  - Key messageThis study screened scale insect-resistant camellia resources and revealed the associated transcription factors, metabolic pathways, and the insect resistance mechanisms of theCjPME28or CjPG1genes.AbstractCamellia japonica has been seriously infested with scale insects in recent years. Pectin participates in the plant's anti-insect. However, the functions of the genes related to pectin have not yet been revealed in C. japonica. The continuous observation for 5 years revealed different C. japonica exhibiting differences in resistance to scale insects. C. japonica with resistance to scale insects were different with susceptibilities in genotype by SCoT molecular marker. Meanwhile, the leaf structure was more compact, and the lignin content, ascorbic acid content, and antioxidant enzyme activity in leaf were more than that of susceptibilities. The scale insects were identified as Pseudaulacaspis cockerelli by the morphological identification. RNA sequencing was performed using C. japonica with resistance versus susceptibility. Transcription factors, such as MYBS3, bHLH3, NAC90, and WRKY40, were significantly upregulated in C. japonica with resistance. The pentose and glutathione metabolism pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway, ascorbate, aldarate metabolism pathway, and glutathione metabolism pathway were the main metabolic pathways emerged as the most significantly enriched for differentially expressed genes. The expression of pectin methylesterase gene (PME) or polygalacturonase gene (PG) was upregulated in the pentose and glutathione metabolism pathway, and their functions were further characterized. Overexpression of CjPME28 or CjPG1 in tobacco plants significantly improved resistance to the scale insects. Enhanced pectinase activity in the CjPME28 or CjPG1 transgenic tobacco lines led to increased lignin synthesis. In conclusion, this study screened a camellia resource with resistance to the scale insects and illustrated the resistance mechanism of scale insects in C. japonica.

AB  - Herbivore elicitors, most of which identified thus far are from the oral secretions (OS) of herbivores, are important in herbivore-induced plant defense. However, whether and how larval OS of the striped stem borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis, a devastating pest on rice, induce plant defenses remains largely unknown. We found that treating plants with SSB OS enhanced levels of phosphorylated OsMPK3/4/6, JA, JA-Ile, ethylene, and ABA in rice, which subsequently induced the production of defense compounds, such as trypsin protease inhibitors, and decreased the growth of SSB larvae. Digestion by proteinase K decreased the induction activity of SSB OS on rice defense, but it still activated OsMPK6, JA, ABA, and ethylene pathways, and enhanced plant SSB resistance. Treating plants with SSB OS fractions that did not contain fatty acid-amino acid conjugates (FACs) activated OsMPK3/4/6, JA, ABA, and ethylene pathways, whereas treating plants with other OS fractions containing FACs did not. Bioassays revealed that impairing the JA or ABA signaling pathway in rice decreased plant SSB resistance. These results demonstrate that both proteins/peptides and non-proteins/peptides-but not FACs-in SSB OS play a central role in inducing rice defenses by activating signaling pathways mediated by JA, ABA, and ethylene.

AB  - Aphids cause massive agricultural losses through direct damage or as pathogen vectors. Control often relies on insecticides, which are expensive and not selective. An interesting alternative is to use aphid sex pheromones nepetalactone (NON) and nepetalactol (NOL) to interfere with aphid mating or attract aphid predators. Here, we explore production of these compounds in plants, as their precursors can be derived from mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathways. By introducing six genes, including a major latex protein-like (MLPL) enzyme, we engineered a functional nepetalactol biosynthetic pathway into plants. Transient expression of these enzymes in N. benthamiana caused production of nepetalactone, without the need for external supplementation with substrates. Targeting all six enzymes into the chloroplast appeared to result in higher NON yields than just chloroplast-targeting the first two enzymes. We could not detect NOL, suggesting it is rapidly oxidised to NON. In addition, we produced NON in stably transformed Camelina sativa (Camelina) lines. Interestingly, the specific NON enantiomer was different in N. benthamiana compared to in Camelina, indicating the value of different platforms for producing specific isoforms. This opens possibilities for using plants as green factories of pheromones for baits or as pheromone dispensers that interfere with insect behaviour.

AB  - Numerous herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) play important roles in plant defense. In tea plants (Camellia sinensis), (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (3-HAC) has been characterized as associated with resistance to herbivores. To date, how tea plants biosynthesize and regulate 3-HAC to resist herbivores remain unclear. Based on transcriptomes assembled from Ectropis obliqua-fed leaves, a cDNA encoding BAHD acyltransferase, namely CsCHAT1, was highly induced in leaves fed with E. obliqua. Enzymatic assays showed that CsCHAT1 converted (Z)-3-hexenol into 3-HAC. Further suppression of CsCHAT1 expression reduced the accumulation of 3-HAC and lowered the resistance of tea plants to E. obliqua, while 3-HAC replenishment rescued the reduced resistance of CsCHAT1-silenced tea plants against E. obliqua. Two transcription factors (TFs), CsNAC30 and CsTCP11, were co-expressed with CsCHAT1. An integrative approach of biochemistry, DNA-protein interaction, gene silencing, and metabolic profiling revealed that the two TFs positively regulated the expression of CsCHAT1. The suppression of either one decreased the production of 3-HAC and eliminated the resistance of tea plants to E. obliqua. Notably, the suppression of either one considerably impaired JA-induced 3-HAC biosynthesis in tea plant. The proposed pathway can be targeted for innovative agro-biotechnologies protecting tea plants from damage by E. obliqua.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant defence responses share common components with plant responses to abiotic stresses. However, whether abiotic stress-responsive factors influence the resistance of plants to herbivores by regulating these components remains largely unknown. Here, we cloned a dehydration-responsive element-binding gene in rice, OsDREB1A, and investigated its role in the resistance of rice to the phloem-feeding herbivore, brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), under normal and low temperatures. We found that OsDREB1A localized to the nucleus, and its transcripts in rice were up-regulated in response to BPH infestation, low temperatures and treatment with methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid. Silencing OsDREB1A changed transcript levels of two defence-related WRKY and two PLD genes, enhanced levels of jasmonic acid (JA), JA-isoleucine and abscisic acid, and decreased the ethylene level in rice; these changes subsequently enhanced the resistance of plants to BPH, especially at 17 degrees C, by decreasing the hatching rate and delaying the development of BPH eggs. Moreover, silencing OsDREB1A increased the growth of rice plants. These findings suggest that OsDREB1A, which positively regulates the resistance of rice to abiotic stresses, negatively regulates the resistance of rice to BPH.

AB  - IntroductionCamellia is among the most ornamentally valuable flowers and plants worldwide. Flower abscission typically causes significant financial losses by the horticultural landscape. Previous research has revealed that phytohormones, transcription factors, and other genes involved in floral development regulate the maintenance and mortality of flowers MethodsIn this study, for the first time, the transcriptomes and targeted hormone metabolomics of three developmental stages of the receptacles of two distinct camellia strains (CF: abscission strain, CHF: nonabscission strain) were analyzed to determine their roles in regulating blossom abscission in camellia. ResultsABA content was shown to be considerably upregulated throughout all phases of CF development, as were the genes implicated in the ABA production pathway and their downstream counterparts. Highly expressed genes in CF were involved in galactose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, amino and nucleotide sugar metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and MAPK. Among others, highly expressed genes in CHF are associated with fructose and mannose metabolism, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, starch and sucrose metabolism, and cutin, suberin, and wax biosynthesis. A vast variety of stress response-related pathways and redox-related activities were also shown to be active in CHF. In contrast, CF dramatically activated pathways associated with lignin production, keratinogenesis, cell wall biogenesis, and ABA response. A comparative transcriptomic study of the CF and CHF pathways revealed that the downstream response pathways of hormones, including CTK, BR, IAA, ethylene, and GA, were very active in CF, indicating a significant amount of signal transduction and transcriptional regulation by CF. In addition, members of the transcription factor family, such as MYB, bHLH, MADS, and WD40, may regulate flower abscission. DiscussionA comparative transcriptome analysis of two distinct strains of camellia receptacles elucidates the molecular processes and regulatory characteristics of flower abscission and provides direction for the targeted improvement and breeding of camellia.

AB  - As a universal second messenger, calcium (Ca2+) transmits specific cellular signals via a spatiotemporal signature generated from its extracellular source and internal stores. Our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the generation of a Ca2+ signature is hampered by limited tools for simultaneously monitoring dynamic Ca2+ levels in multiple subcellular compartments. To overcome the limitation and to further improve spatiotemporal resolutions, we have assembled a molecular toolset (CamelliA lines) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) that enables simultaneous and high-resolution monitoring of Ca2+ dynamics in multiple subcellular compartments through imaging different single-colored genetically encoded calcium indicators. We uncovered several Ca2+ signatures in three types of Arabidopsis cells in response to internal and external cues, including rapid oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ and apical plasma membrane Ca2+ influx in fast-growing Arabidopsis pollen tubes, the spatiotemporal relationship of Ca2+ dynamics in four subcellular compartments of root epidermal cells challenged with salt, and a shockwave-like Ca2+ wave propagating in laser-wounded leaf epidermis. These observations serve as a testimony to the wide applicability of the CamelliA lines for elucidating the subcellular sources contributing to the Ca2+ signatures in plants.
   A toolset for simultaneous imaging of Ca2+ dynamics in subcellular compartments has uncovered unrecognized Ca2+ signatures in Arabidopsis cells in response to developmental and external cues.

AB  - Zinc (Zn) is a vital micronutrient from the perspective of biofortification and biotic stress endurance in pigeonpea. The ZIP transporters with domain (Pfam: PF02535) regulate uptake and transport of metal ions, including Zn, in consonance with plant metal homeostasis. Genome-wide analysis in pigeonpea identified 19 non-redundant members of ZIP family (CcZIP) that were analyzed for gene structure, conserved motifs and homology besides other structural and biochemical parameters. Intra-specific as well as the inter-specific phylogenetic relationships of these 19 CcZIPs were elucidated by comparison with ZIP proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, Phaseolus vulgaris and Glycine max. In addition to gene structure, the cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the promoter region were also identified. It revealed several stress responsive CREs that might be regulatory for differential expression of CcZIP proteins. Expression analysis showed that both CcZIP3 and CcZIP15, having zinc deficiency responsive element, up-regulated in the reproductive leaf tissues and down-regulated in matured green pods of the pod borer resistant genotypes with higher zinc content. Alternately, the expression of CcZIP6 and CcZIP13 was higher in matured green pods than reproductive leaves of the resistant genotypes. These findings on differential expression indicate the possible role of these CcZIPs on the mobilization of Zn from leaves to pods, phloem loading and unloading, and higher accumulation of seed zinc in pod borer resistant genotypes used in this study. Further functional characterization of CcZIP genes could shed light on their role in bio-fortification and genetic improvement to inhibit the pod borer herbivory in pigeonpea.

AB  - Mechanoperception, the ability to perceive and respond to mechanical stimuli, is a common and fundamental property of all forms of life. Vascular plants such as Mimosa pudica use this function to protect themselves against herbivory. The mechanical stimulus caused by a landing insect triggers a rapid closing of the leaflets that drives the potential pest away. While this thigmonastic movement is caused by ion fluxes accompanied by a rapid change of volume in the pulvini, the mechanism responsible for the detection of the mechanical stimulus remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the role of mechanosensitive ion channels in the first step of this evolutionarily conserved defense mechanism: the mechanically evoked closing of the leaflet. Our results demonstrate that the key site of mechanosensation in the Mimosa leaflets is the pulvinule, which expresses a stretch-activated chloride-permeable mechanosensitive ion channel. Blocking these channels partially prevents the closure of the leaflets following mechanical stimulation. These results demonstrate a direct relation between the activity of mechanosensitive ion channels and a central defense mechanism of M. pudica.

AB  - Phospholipase D (PLD) (EC 3.1.4.4) plays important roles in plants growth, development, and response to environmental stresses. Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is the most important non-alcoholic beverage in the world with health benefits, but tea production decreases in response to environmental stresses such as cold and drought. Therefore, a genome-wide analysis of the C. sinensis PLD gene family (CsPLDs) was carried out. In the current study, identification, evolutionary relationship, duplication, selection pressure, gene structure, promoter analysis, transcript-targeted miRNA, and simple sequence repeat markers prediction, RNA-seq data analysis, and three-dimensional structure of the CsPLDs have been investigated using bioinformatics tools. 15 PLDs were identified from the tea genome which belongs to five groups, including CsPLD alpha, CsPLD beta, CsPLD delta, CsPLD epsilon, and CsPLD zeta. Both segmental and tandem duplications have occurred in the CsPLD gene family. Ka/Ks ratio for the most duplicated pair genes was less than 1 which implies negative selection to conserve their function during the tea evolution. 68 cis-elements have been found in CsPLDs indicating the contribution of these genes in response to environmental stresses. Likewise, 72 SSR loci and 96 miRNA molecules in 14 and 15 CsPLDs have been detected. According to RNA-seq data, the highest expression in all tissues under various abiotic stresses was related to CsPLD alpha 1. Besides, a three-dimensional structure of the CsPLD alpha 1 was evaluated to better understand its biological activity. This research provides comprehensive information that could be useful in future studies to develop stress-tolerant tea.

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to monitor the postural activity of sows in farrowing pen using a millimeter-wave radar imaging system. Three-dimensional images of the scene are obtained from a 77 GHz Multiple-Input Multiple Output radar and the mechanical scanning of the radar beam. We show that the processing of radar images based on the Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate allows detecting the standing and lying postures of sows despite the electromagnetic clutter. The experimental study reported here is performed from the monitoring of 16 sows from the Large White breed for a total of 46 h. 3D positions of the sow are recorded and heatmaps of the sow locomotor activity are proposed. With few training radar data, we perform a classification of standing and laying postures with a mean balanced accuracy greater than 90%. The radar-based technique applied here in a cluttered environment inside farrowing pens may be extended to monitor pigs under other housing condition.

AB  - In the current study, the whale shark (ws; Rhincodon typus) melanocortin-2 receptor (MC2R) co-expressed with wsMRAP1 in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) Cells could be stimulated in a dose dependent manner by ACTH (1-24) with an EC50 of 2.6 x 10(-10) M +/- 9.7 x 10(-11). When the receptor was expressed alone, stimulation was only observed at [10(-6) M]. A comparable increase in sensitivity to stimulation by srDes-Ac-alpha MSH was also observed when the receptor was co-expressed with wsMRAP1. Furthermore, co-expression with wsMRAP1 significantly increased the trafficking of wsMC2R to the plasma membrane of CHO cells. Surprisingly, co-expression with wsMRAP2 also increased sensitivity to stimulation by ACTH(1-24) and srDes-Ac-alpha MSH, and increased trafficking of the receptor to the plasma membrane. These observations are in sharp contrast to the response of MC2R orthologs of bony vertebrates which have an obligate requirement for co-expression with MRAP1 for both trafficking to the plasma membrane and activation, whereas, co-expression with MRAP2 in-creases trafficking, but has minimal effects on activation. In addition, when comparing the activation features of wsMC2R with those of the elephant shark MC2R and red stingray MC2R orthologs, both similarities and differences are observed. The spectrum of features for cartilaginous fish MC2R orthologs will be discussed. A second objective of this study was to determine whether wsMC5R has features in common with wsMC2R in terms of ligand selectivity and interaction with wsMRAP paralogs. While wsMC5R can be activated by either srACTH (1-24) or srDes-Ac-alpha MSH, and co-expression with wsMRAP1 enhances this activation, wsMRAP1 had no effect on the trafficking of wsMC5R. In addition, co-expression with wsMRAP2 had no positive or negative effect on either ligand sensitivity or trafficking of wsMC5R.

AB  - Atherosclerotic renovascular disease (RVD) leads to hypertension, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and heart disease. Intrarenal delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) attenuate renal injury and suppress release of inflammatory cytokines in porcine RVD. We hypothesized that this strategy would also be useful for cardioprotection. Pigs with renovascular hypertension and metabolic syndrome were studied 4 weeks after treatment with a single intrarenal infusion of autologous MSCs, EVs, or vehicle. Cardiac structure and function were assessed in vivo, and myocardial remodeling and expression of the pro-fibrotic factor growth factor receptor-bound protein-2 (Grb2) were measured ex-vivo. Inflammatory cytokine levels were measured in the systemic circulation and myocardial tissue. Blood pressure was elevated in all RVD groups, but serum creatinine increased in RVD and decreased in both RVD + MSCs and RVD + EVs. RVD-induced diastolic dysfunction (lower E/A ratio) was normalized in both MSCs- and EVs- treated pigs. Intrarenal delivery of MSCs and EVs also attenuated RVD-induced myocardial fibrosis, collagen deposition, and Grb2 expression, yet EVs restored capillary density and inflammation more effectively than MSCs. These observations suggest that autologous EVs attenuate cardiac injury in experimental RVD more effectively than their parent MSCs.

AB  - Deltamethrin (DM) is the most powerful synthetic pyrethroid that has toxicity to the central nervous system and results in behavioral changes in both animals and humans. This effect is mediated by inducing alterations in the action of neurotransmitters and brain pathological changes. Nanocarrier encapsulated pesticides may decrease the toxicity of pesticides. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of an inorganic metal carrier (silica Nps) and polymeric capsule (chitosan Nps) of deltamethrin nano-formulations on antioxidant levels and oxidative stress in the brain and on behavior of the male albino rat. Sixty male albino rats were equally divided into four groups. Group I: control group; group II given DM liquefied in corn oil at 3.855 mg/kg BW; group III receiving silica-loaded deltamethrin (S/DM Nps) at 8.795 mg/kg BW; and group IV: given chitosan encapsulated deltamethrin (CS/DM Nps) at 30.44 mg/kg BW. All treatments were given orally for four weeks. Following this, behavioral tests were conducted to record locomotor activity, anxiety like behaviors, exploration, and the short memory of rats. In addition, brain antioxidant/oxidant, serum neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine esterase (AchE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO), JAK2 and STAT3 gene and proteins expression were measured. The DM group showed a highly significant elevation in malondialdehyde content, MAO, AchE, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels, and the expression level of neurogenic genes, JAK2 and STAT3, in comparison with the control group. Both S/DM Nps and CS/DM Nps significantly decreased MAO, AchE, and VEGF compared with the DM group. Moreover, both S/DM Nps and CS/DM Nps significantly decreased the gene and proteins expression of JAK2 and STAT3 compared with the DM group. These alterations were evidenced by the deficiency in memory and learning behaviors that were accompanied by histopathological findings of the hippocampus and the cortex. It was concluded that the nano formulations containing DM induced less neurobehavioral toxicity than free DM. Additionally, the use of nanocarriers reduced the damage to health and the environment.

AB  - Curiosity is a desire for information that is not motivated by strategic concerns. Latent learning is not driven by standard reinforcement processes. We propose that curiosity serves the purpose of motivating latent learning. While latent learning is often treated as a passive or incidental process, it normally reflects a strong evolved pressure to actively seek large amounts of information. That information in turn allows curious decision makers to represent the structure of their environment, that is, to form cognitive maps. These cognitive maps then drive adaptive flexible behavior. Based on recent data, we propose that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) play complementary roles in curiosity driven learning. Specifically, we propose that (1) OFC tracks intrinsic value of information and incorporates new information into a cognitive map; and (2) dACC tracks the environmental demands and information availability to then use the cognitive map from OFC to guide behavior.

AB  - Legumes are notorious for coevolutionary arms races where chemical defenses are employed to ward off herbivores-particularly insect seed predators. Locoweeds are legumes containing the toxic alkaloid swainsonine which can poison livestock, but its role as a deterrent for insects is unknown. Swainsonine is produced by the fungal endophyte Alternaria section Undifilum, and the chemical composition of the toxin has been well characterized. Despite this knowledge, the ecological roles and evolutionary drivers of swainsonine toxins in locoweeds remain uncertain. Here, we quantify swainsonine concentrations and herbivory levels in the hyper-diverse locoweed Astragalus lentiginosus to evaluate its role as an evolved chemical defense. We found that A. lentiginosus shows considerable variation in swainsonine concentrations according to variety, in particular showing presence/absence variation at both population and local geographic scales. Surprisingly, herbivory levels from presumed generalist insects emerging from fruits showed no correlation with swainsonine concentrations. Conversely, seed and fruit herbivory levels linked to specialist Acanthoscelides seed beetles increased with concentrations of swainsonine-suggesting a possible coevolutionary arms race. Our results highlight that variation in endophyte-produced toxin systems may not follow classical expectations for geographic variation and ecological roles of plant chemicals. We discuss the implications of these results on plant-endophytic toxin systems and coevolutionary dynamics more broadly, highlighting a considerable need for more research in these systems.

AB  - Cold stress is a widely distributed abiotic stress that severely limits the yield and quality of tea plants. Tryptophan (Trp) and downstream indole compounds play an important role in plant growth and stress response. However, beyond its involvement in indole compounds synthesis, the other physiological functions of Trp in tea plants remain unknown. In this study, anthranilate synthetase (ASA2) was a positive regulator to enhance cold stress tolerance in Camellia sinensis. The expression of CsASA2 was strongly induced by cold stress. Suppression of CsASA2 expression in C. sinensis reduced the accumulation of Trp, lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, and ultimately impaired cold stress tolerance. Heterologous overexpression of CsASA2 increased the endogenous Trp and melatonin content in response to cold stress and then showed the opposite cold resistance trend. Further study revealed that CsASA2 expression was positively regulated by the transcription factor CsERF21-l. Low temperature induced and kept CsERF21-l expression at a relatively high level. Suppression of CsERF21-l expression in tea plant reduced the accumulation of IAA and melatonin, increased the extent of cytoplasmic membrane damage, and weakened the cold tolerance of tea plant. Further, our study demonstrated that CsERF21-l enhanced cold tolerance in tea plants by promoting CsASA2 transcription. Overall, our results showed that the CsERF21-l-CsASA2 model balances the growth and cold tolerance in tea plants by regulating melatonin and IAA levels by recruiting Trp under cold stress.

AB  - Histone modification is a cellular process for transcriptional regulation. In herbivore-damaged plants, activation of genes involved in defence responses is required for antiherbivore properties, but little is known about how the chromatin remodelling system is involved. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants responding to Spodoptera litura larvae, HAC1 and HDA6, a histone acetyltransferase and a histone deacetylase, respectively, were found here to be involved in histone H3 (Lys9; H3K9) acetylation/deacetylation at the promoter region of the plant defensin gene PDF1.2 and the gene body of ethylene response factor 13 (ERF13) as early as 2 h after the onset of herbivore attack. The H3K9 acetylation was responsible for the robust upregulation of PDF1.2 later, at 24 h, and ERF13 even earlier, at 1 h. TOPLESS (TPL) and TOPLESS-related (TPR) corepressors interacted with HDA6 to deacetylate H3K9 at PDF1.2 and ERF13, while negatively regulating the expression of PDF1.2 but not ERF13. Furthermore, TPL also interacted with ERF13, resulting in ERF13-mediated regulation of PDF1.2. Taken together, these data suggest a model of promoter-restricted, TPL/TPR-directed histone deacetylation and transcription factor repression in healthy Arabidopsis plants for the feedback regulation of the antiherbivore response.

AB  - CRISPR/Cas9 is the most popular genome editing platform for investigating gene function or improving traits in plants. The specificity of gene editing has yet to be evaluated at a genome-wide scale in seed-propagated Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz (camelina) or clonally propagated Solanum tuberosum L. (potato). In this study, seven potato and nine camelina stable transgenic Cas9-edited plants were evaluated for on and off-target editing outcomes using 55x and 60x coverage whole genome shotgun sequencing data, respectively. For both potato and camelina, a prevalence of mosaic somatic edits from constitutive Cas9 expression was discovered as well as evidence of transgenerational editing in camelina. CRISPR/Cas9 editing provided negligible off-target activity compared to background variation in both species. The results from this study guide deployment and risk assessment of genome editing in commercially relevant traits in food crops.

AB  - Plants are attacked by various insect herbivores. Upon attack-triggered biosynthesis of the phytohormone jasmonates (JAs), the JA receptor CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 recruits the JA-ZIM domain (JAZ) repressors for ubiquitination, releases the MYC-MYB transcription factor (TF) complexes, and enhances glucosinolates (GSs) biosynthesis to promote defense against insects in Arabidopsis. However, the negative regulation of JA-regulated defense remains largely unclear. Here, we found that Arabidopsis IVa bHLH TFs bHLH19 and bHLH20 interacted with JAZs. The bhlh19/20 mutations enhanced defense against the insects Spodoptera frugiperda and S. exigua, while their overexpression inhibited defense. bHLH19/20 repressed defense via at least two layers of regulation: first, bHLH19/20 interacted with the members MYC2/3/4/5 and MYB34/51/122 of MYC-MYB complexes, and inhibited the interaction/transcription activity of MYC2-MYB34; second, bHLH19/20 activated the RNA level of nitrile-specifier protein 1, which converts GSs into the less toxic nitriles. bhlh19/20 exhibited no penalty in JA-regulated growth inhibition. Collectively, our findings reveal the molecular mechanism for negatively regulating JA-mediated defense against insects in Arabidopsis without growth penalty by the pair of bHLH19/20 TFs.

AB  - Insect pests are one of the major biotic stresses limiting yield in commercially important crops. The lepidopteran polyphagous spotted pod borer, Maruca vitrata causes significant economic losses in legumes including pigeonpea. RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene silencing has emerged as one of the potential biotechnological tools for crop improvement. We report in this paper, RNAi in M. vitrata through exogenous administration of dsRNA with sequence specificity to three functionally important genes, Alpha-amylase (alpha-amylase), Chymotrypsin-like serine protease (CTLP) and Tropomyosin (TPM) into the larval haemolymph and their host-delivered RNAi in pigeonpea. Significant decline in the expression of selected genes supported by over-expression of DICER and generation of siRNA indicated the occurrence of RNAi in the dsRNA-injected larvae. Additionally, the onset of RNAi in the herbivore was demonstrated in pigeonpea, one of the prominent hosts, by host-delivered dsRNA. Transgenics in pigeonpea (cv. Pusa 992), a highly recalcitrant crop, were developed through a shoot apical meristem-targeted in planta transformation strategy and evaluated. Plant level bioassays in transgenic events characterized and selected at molecular level showed mortality of M. vitrata larvae as well as reduced feeding when compared to wild-type. Furthermore, molecular evidence for down regulation of target genes in the insects that fed on transgenic plants authenticated RNAi. Considering the variability of gene silencing in lepidopteran pests, this study provided corroborative proof for the possibility of gene silencing in M. vitrata through both the strategies.

AB  - Herbivory-induced systemic signaling has been demonstrated in monocots and dicots, and is essential for plant defense against insects. However, the nature and evolution of herbivory-induced systemic signals remain unclear. Grafting is widely used for studying systemic signaling; however, grafting between dicot plants from different families is difficult, and grafting is impossible for monocots. In this study, we took advantage of dodder's extraordinary capability of parasitizing various plant species. Field dodder (Cuscuta campestris) was employed to connect pairs of species that are phylogenetically very distant, ranging from fern to monocot and dicot plants, and so determine whether interplant signaling occurs after simulated herbivory. It was found that simulated herbivory-induced systemic signals can be transferred by dodder between a monocot and a dicot plant and even between a fern and a dicot plant, and the plants that received the systemic signals all exhibited elevated defenses. Thus, we inferred that the herbivory-induced systemic signals are likely to be evolutionarily well conserved among vascular plants. Importantly, we also demonstrate that the jasmonate pathway is probably an ancient regulator of the biosynthesis and/or transport of systemic signals in vascular plants. These findings provide new insight into the nature and evolution of systemic signaling.

AB  - Plants possess various defense strategies to counter attacks from microorganisms or herbivores. For example, plants reduce the cell-wall-macerating activity of pathogen- or insect-derived polygalacturonases (PGs) by expressing PG-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs). PGs and PGIPs belong to multi-gene families believed to have been shaped by an evolutionary arms race. The mustard leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae expresses both active PGs and catalytically inactive PG pseudoenzymes. Previous studies demonstrated that (i) PGIPs target beetle PGs and (ii) the role of PG pseudoenzymes remains elusive, despite having been linked to the pectin degradation pathway. For further insight into the interaction between plant PGIPs and beetle PG family members, we combined affinity purification with proteomics and gene expression analyses, and identified novel inhibitors of beetle PGs from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis). A beetle PG pseudoenzyme was not targeted by PGIPs, but instead interacted with PGIP-like proteins. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that PGIP-like proteins clustered apart from "classical" PGIPs but together with proteins, which have been involved in developmental processes. Our results indicate that PGIP-like proteins represent not only interesting novel PG inhibitor candidates in addition to "classical" PGIPs, but also fascinating new players in the arms race between herbivorous beetles and plant defenses.

AB  - Chitinases are a diverse group of enzymes having the ability to degrade chitin. Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide on earth, predominantly found in insect exoskeletons and fungal cell walls. In this study, we performed a genome-wide search for chitinase genes and identified a total of 49 chitinases in tea. These genes were categorized into 5 classes, where an expansion of class V chitinases has been observed in comparison to other plant species. Extensive loss of introns in 46% of the GH18 chitinases indicates that an evolutionary pressure is acting upon these genes to lose introns for rapid gene expression. The promoter upstream regions in 65% of the predicted chitinases contain methyl-jasmonate, salicylic acid and defense responsive cis-acting elements, which may further illustrate the possible role of chitinases in tea plant's defense against various pests and pathogens. Differential expression analysis revealed that transcripts of two GH19 chitinases TEA028279 and TEA019397 got upregulated during three different fungal infections in tea. While GH19 chitinase TEA031377 showed an increase in transcript abundance in the two insect infested tea tissues. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that five GH19 chitinases viz. TEA018892, TEA031484, TEA28279, TEA033470 and TEA031277 showed significant increase in expression in the tea plants challenged with a biotrophic pathogen Exobasidium vexans. The study endeavours in highlighting biotic stress responsive defensive role of chitinase genes in tea.

AB  - Chlorophyll-deficient tea plant exhibits a significantly higher accumulation of free amino acids (FAAs) than normal tea plants. This study focused on the impact of leaf color and the developmental stage on FAAs in six tea germplasms while maintaining all other conditions. The total FAAs content initially increased as the leaf matured during the one-bud-two-leaves (1B2L) and one-bud-three-leaves (1B3L) stages in green germplasms, then decreased or stabilized in the one-bud-four-leaves (1B4L) stage. In contrast, chlorotic germplasms showed continuous FAAs' content increase from 1B2L to 1B4L, thus being significantly positively correlated with total chlorophyll content. Interestingly, ethylamine content decreased with leaf maturation in both chlorotic and green germplasms, thus showing a significant negative correlation with L-theanine content only in chlorotic germplasms. Comparative RNA-seq analysis linked FAAs accumulation in chlorotic germplasm's 1B3L to photosynthesis inhibition and in 1B4L to nitrogen assimilation promotion. Feeding experiments revealed higher L-theanine synthesis and degradation abilities in chlorotic shoots versus green shoots, with synthesis efficiency exceeding degradation efficiency. Overall, this study uncovers a developmental-specific FAAs accumulation pattern in chlorotic germplasms and offers novel insights into the precise regulation by leaf color and developmental stage.

AB  - Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are specialized metabolites that are produced by various plant families that act as defense compounds against herbivores. On the other hand, certain lepidopteran insects uptake and utilize these PAs as defense compounds against their predators and as precursors of their sex pheromones. Adult males of Parantica sita, a danaine butterfly, convert PAs into their sex pheromones. In early summer, P. sita swarms over the flowers of Myosotis scorpioides, which belongs to the family Boraginaceae. M. scorpioides produces PAs, but the organs in which PAs are produced and whether P. sita utilizes PAs in M. scorpioides are largely unknown. In the present study, we clarified that M. scorpioides accumulates retronecine-core PAs in N-oxide form in all organs, including flowers. We also identified two M. scorpioides genes encoding homospermidine synthase (HSS), a key enzyme in the PA biosynthetic pathway, and clarified that these genes are expressed in all organs where PAs accumulate. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two HSS genes were originated from gene duplication of deoxyhypusine synthase gene like other HSS genes in PA-producing plants. These results suggest that PAs are synthesized and accumulated in the flower of M. scorpioides and provide a possibility for a PA-mediated interaction between P. sita and M. scorpioides.

AB  - We investigated the mining mode of insect feeding, involving larval consumption of a plant's internal tissues, from the Middle Jurassic (165 million years ago) Daohugou locality of Northeastern China. Documentation of mining from the Jurassic Period is virtually unknown, and results from this time interval would address mining evolution during the temporal gap of mine-seed plant diversifications from the previous Late Triassic to the subsequent Early Cretaceous.Plant fossils were examined with standard microscopic procedures for herbivory and used the standard functional feeding group-damage-type system of categorizing damage. All fossil mines were photographed and databased.We examined 2014 plant specimens, of which 27 occurrences on 14 specimens resulted in eight, new, mine damage types (DTs) present on six genera of bennettitalean, ginkgoalean, and pinalean gymnosperms.Three conclusions emerge from this study. First, these mid-Mesozoic mines are morphologically conservative and track plant host anatomical structure rather than plant phylogeny. Second, likely insect fabricators of these mines were three basal lineages of polyphagan beetles, four basal lineages of monotrysian moths, and a basal lineage tenthredinoid sawflies. Third, the nutrition hypothesis, indicating that miners had greater access to nutritious, inner tissues of new plant lineages, best explains mine evolution during the mid-Mesozoic.

AB  - Due to our lack of understanding of the host-pathogen epidemiology and the absence of effective control measures, tea leaf spot, caused by the fungus Epicoccum sorghinum, continues to reduce the productivity and quality of tea leaves in plantations in Guizhou Province, southwestern China. Here, samples of tea (Camellia sinensis [L.] O Kuntze) leaves either infected or uninfected by E. sorghinum were used as the study model. The mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) sequences in tea leaves from the two treatments were determined using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platforms, respectively. In total, 33,932 genes or transcripts from tea leaves were annotated. In response to infection by E. sorghinum, 1,068 or 467 of the differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were up- or downregulated, respectively, and the DEmRNAs containing peroxidase 21 and LRR receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase ERECTA were enriched in terms of defense response. Meanwhile, 1,889 miRNAs were identified from infected or uninfected leaves. Nine or seven of the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were up- or downregulated, respectively. The DEmiRNAs MIR5303j-p5, MIR6173-p5, miR858-3p, and novel-miR0377-3p were predicted to bind to DEmRNAs. Fifteen DEmRNAs annotated into transcription factor proteins enriched with respect to the plant-pathogen interaction pathway were predicted to be bound by the DEmiRNA miR858-3p. The sequences and abundances of the mRNAs and miRNAs from tea leaves infected by E. nigrum, and the prediction of the interaction between DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs could contribute to our understanding of this plant-pathogen interaction.

AB  - The blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) have gained consumer interest worldwide for its anti-oxidant, neuroprotective, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and blood pressure reducing properties. The objective of our study was to characterize 10 blueberry cultivars for firmness, weight, caliber, macronutrient content, anthocyanins, titratable acidity, and soluble solids. Results indicated that the characterized fruit parameters varied between 12.89-18.68 degrees Brix for soluble solids, 0.57%- 0.79% for titratable acidity, 57.0-81.6 g mm-1for firmness, 1.74 and 2.80 g for average fruit weight, 14.7 and 17.9 mm for average fruit diameter, 1.80-15.55 mg L-1 for anthocyanins, and 14.4%-21.6% for dry matter content. Fruit nutrient concentration (mg 100 g-1 fresh fruit) ranged from 63.6 to 104.0 mg N 100 g-1, 7.0 to 12.2 mg P 100 g-1, 76.4 to 122.7 mg K 100 g-1, 4.5 to 9.8 mg Ca 100 g-1, 3.6 to 6.9 mg Mg 100 g-1, and 3.7 to 5.8 mg S 100 g-1. The cultivar with the highest overall values was 'Last Call', while the cultivars with the lowest values were 'Brigitta', 'Liberty', and 'Cargo'. There were positive and negative correlations between the characterization parameters, mainly 1) less firm cultivars, 'Legacy', ' Duke', and 'Camelia', were positively correlated for the K concentration, 2) nega-tive correlations between titratable acidity and the K concentration in 'Last Call', 'Cargo', 'Brigitta', and 'Liberty', and 3) positive correlations between the P concentration and soluble solid content in 'Last Call', 'Camelia', and 'Brigitta'.

AB  - The chemical composition of seedlings and adult plants of several Piper species were analyzed by H-1 NMR spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis (PCA) and HPLC-DAD, HPLC-HRESIMS and GC-MS data. The chromatographic profile of crude extracts from leaves of Piper species showed remarkable differences between seedlings and adult plants. Adult leaves of P. regnellii accumulate dihydrobenzofuran neolignans, P. solmsianum contain tetrahydrofuran lignans, and prenylated benzoic acids are found in adult leaves of P. hemmendorffii and P. caldense. Seedlings produced an entirely different collection of compounds. Piper gaudichaudianum and P. solmsianum seedlings contain the phenylpropanoid dillapiole. Piper regnellii and P. hemmendorffii produce another phenylpropanoid, apiol, while isoasarone is found in P. caldense. Piper richadiaefolium and P. permucronatum contain dibenzylbutyrolactones lignans or flavonoids in adult leaves. Seedlings of P. richardiaefolium produce multiple amides, while P. permucronatum seedlings contain a new long chain ester. Piper tuberculatum, P. reticulatum and P. amalago produce amides, and their chemistry changes less during ontogeny. The chemical variation we documented opens questions about changes in herbivore pressure across ontogeny.

AB  - During the course of evolution, higher plants have developed efficient strategies to cope with herbivory from arthropods. Upon perception of herbivore-derived cues, the jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway is activated and triggers the expression of defense genes. The first land plants that arose ca. 500 Mya were bryophytes, including liverworts, and fossil records indicate that they were also exposed to herbivore pressure. Interestingly, recent studies showed that the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha contains a functional JA pathway that protects against insect feeding. However, since the appearance of insects is estimated to have occurred several million years after that of bryophytes, we hypothesized that this pathway could have been used to fend off contemporaneous gastropod feeders. Here, we challenged M. polymorpha with the land snail Helix aspersa and found that neonates grew significantly bigger on Mpcoi1, a mutant in the JA pathway, than on wild-type plants. This finding demonstrates that JA-dependent defenses in a liverwort are effective against gastropod herbivory and suggests that this feeding group constitutes an additional selection pressure that may have arisen early during land plant evolution.

AB  - Hetertermes indicola Wasman (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) is a highly wood-destructive termite species in the urban settings of Pakistan. This study evaluated the biocidal action of Melia azedarach leaf extract in different solvents on H. indicola by conducting choice and no-choice feeding deterrence assays using impregnated palatable wood under field and laboratory conditions. Dose-dependent and time-dependent trends were observed in the leaf extracts of M. azedarach at different concentrations (500, 1000, and 1500 ppm) using solvent water and methanol with 80-100 % termite mortality after 6 days of exposure. A key outcome was the higher termiticidal efficacy of methanolic extract compared to aqueous extract under both field and laboratory conditions. The LC50 values of 358 ppm for methanol and 466 ppm for aqueous extract after 15 days in a laboratory no-choice experiment exhibit a quantitative measure of chinaberry leaf extract toxicity. A significant reduction in mean percent weight loss (8.26 %) of treated wood with 1500 ppm of M. azedarach leaf extract in methanol was observed under field conditions. In conclusion, triterpenoids and phytol present in methanolic leaf extract demonstrated higher efficacy in both lab and field conditions making a solid foundation for the further development of natural wood preservatives. Since they induced rapid lethargic conditions in termites and digestive toxicity which leads to minimum loss of treated wood. (c) 2024 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Plant herbivore interactions have long been recognized as a complex interplay influenced by various factors, including plant volatile emissions. Understanding the role of these volatiles in mediating plant predator interactions is crucial for developing sustainable pest management strategies. This study investigated the olfactory preferences of Chrysoperla externa larvae for volatiles emitted by Eucalyptus urograndis leaves, focusing on both seedlings and essential oils (EOs). We used Y-tube olfactometry to compare larval preferences between the clean air and various plant treatments, including undamaged and herbivore-damaged leaves. Chemical analysis of EOs revealed higher concentrations of oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in young and damaged leaves, particularly linalool, which has been implicated in insect attraction. Our results showed a significant preference for volatiles emitted by young damaged leaves over clean air for both seedlings (chi(2) = 11.03, p = 0.001) and EOs (chi(2) = 9.76, p = 0.002). Chrysoperla externa larvae are significantly attracted to specific volatiles from damaged E. urograndis leaves, suggesting these compounds could serve as cues for natural enemy foraging. Our findings enhance the understanding of plant-predator dynamics and suggest potential applications of eucalyptus plantations to sustain C. externa populations for biocontrol purposes.

AB  - Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the pine wood nematode (PWN), is the causal agent of pine wilt disease (PWD), which causes enormous economic loss annually. According to our previous research, fomepizole, as a selective inhibitor of PWN alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), has the potential to be a preferable lead compound for developing novel nematicides. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. The result of molecular docking showed that the stronger interactions between fomepizole and PWN ADH at the active site of ADH were attributed to hydrogen bonds. Low-dose fomepizole had a substantial negative impact on the egg hatchability, development, oviposition, and lifespan of PWN. Transcriptome analysis indicated that 2,124 upregulated genes and 490 downregulated genes in fomepizole-treated PWN were obtained. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes indicated that fomepizole could be involved in controlling PWN vitality mainly by regulating key signaling pathways, such as the ribosome, hippo signaling pathway, and lysosome. Remarkably, the results of RNA interference indicated that the downregulated serine/threonine-protein phosphatase gene (stpp) could reduce the egg hatchability, development, oviposition, and lifespan of PWN, which was closely similar to the consequences of nematodes with low-dose fomepizole treatment. In addition, the silencing of stpp resulted in weakness of PWN pathogenicity, which indicated that stpp could be a potential drug target to control PWN.

AB  - Glucosinolates (GSLs) are secondary metabolites providing defense against pathogens and herbivores in plants, and anti-carcinogenic activity against human cancer cells. Profiles of GSLs vary greatly among members of genus Brassica. In this study, we found that a reference line of Chinese cabbage (B. rapa ssp. pekinensis), 'Chiifu' contains significantly lower amounts of total GSLs than the oilseed-type B. rapa (B. rapa ssp. trilocularis) line 'LP08'. This study aimed to identify the key regulators of the high accumulation of GSLs in Brassica rapa plants using transcriptomic and linkage mapping approaches. Comparative transcriptome analysis showed that, in total, 8,276 and 9,878 genes were differentially expressed between 'Chiifu' and 'LP08' under light and dark conditions, respectively. Among 162 B. rapa GSL pathway genes, 79 were related to GSL metabolism under light conditions. We also performed QTL analysis using a single nucleotide polymorphism-based linkage map constructed using 151 F-5 individuals derived from a cross between the 'Chiifu' and 'LP08' inbred lines. Two major QTL peaks were successfully identified on chromosome 3 using high-performance liquid chromatography to obtain GSL profiles from 97 F-5 recombinant inbred lines. The MYB-domain transcription factor gene BrMYB28.1 (Bra012961) was found in the highest QTL peak region. The second highest peak was located near the 2-oxoacid-dependent dioxygenase gene BrGSL-OH.1 (Bra022920). This study identified major genes responsible for differing profiles of GSLs between 'Chiifu' and 'LP08'. Thus, our study provides molecular insights into differences in GSL profiles between vegetative- and oilseed-type B. rapa plants.

AB  - Background and aims - Podostemaceae is a family of strictly aquatic plants found in rapids and waterfalls. Despite a recent treatment in the Flore du Gabon, the family remained poorly known, with no major studies including Gabonese collections, and almost no targeted inventories since 1966. We present the first large-scale inventory of this family in Gabon, targeting Podostemaceae throughout the country, providing new additions to the flora of Gabon and many new records of poorly known species.
   Material and methods - Fieldwork was conducted in Gabon between 2017 and 2021. The collected specimens were primarily preserved in ethanol with associated silica gel-preserved material and photographs. Material available at BR, BRLU, LBV, MO, P, WAG, and Z/ZT was examined. For each species, information on distribution and ecology is presented, as well as a distribution map in Gabon.
   Key results - The 500 newly collected specimens represent 91.4% of all known collections of Podostemaceae from Gabon. Three taxa are newly recorded for the country, including one genus (Inversodicraea tenax, Ledermanniella schlechteri, and Saxicolella nana). New distribution records are also presented for 13 little-known species. Four taxa are excluded from the Gabonese flora (the genus Dicraeanthus, Inversodicraea ledermannii, Ledermanniella sanagaensis, and Macropodiella garrettii). To date, 20 species belonging to five different genera are known to occur in Gabon. A new combination is proposed for Ledermanniella nicolasii, and Inversodicraea tanzaniensis is now considered as a synonym of Inversodicraea tenax.

AB  - Stinging trichomes are rare in plants, occurring only in angiosperms, where they are reported for a few genera belonging to six families. Although there is no report of stinging trichomes in Apocynaceae, previous fieldwork collections of Fischeria and Matelea caused us a mild allergic reaction on the skin when we contacted the dense indumentum of the plants. This fact associated with the well-known presence of glandular trichomes with acute apex in both genera raised suspicions that stinging trichomes could be present in the family. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the likely occurrence of stinging trichomes in Fischeria and Matelea. We analyzed vegetative shoots and leaves of Fischeria stellata and Matelea denticulata through the usual procedures of light and scanning electron microscopy. We also performed several histochemical tests to investigate the chemical composition of trichome secretion. We detected that glandular trichomes occur throughout the surface of the leaf and stem. They are multicellular, uniseriate with an apical secretory cell, which has a dilated base and a needle-shaped apex. The secretion is compressed into the acuminate portion of the apical cell by a large vacuole, and crystals are deposited in the cell wall in a subapical position, providing a preferential site of rupture. The secretion, composed of amino acids and/or proteins, is released under mechanical action, causing skin irritation. Based on our detailed morphological and anatomical analyses, and in the functional aspects observed, we concluded that the glandular trichomes in Fischeria and Matelea can indeed be classified as stinging. Thus, Apocynaceae is the seventh family for which this type of trichome has been reported. We also compiled information on stinging trichomes in all families of angiosperms. Their phylogenetic distribution indicates that they have evolved at least 12 times during angiosperm evolution and may represent an evolutionary convergence of plant defense against herbivory.

AB  - Soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is one of the most destructive soybean pests worldwide. Unlike many diseases, SCN doesn't show above ground evidence of disease until several weeks after infestation. Knowledge of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) related to pests and pathogens of foliar tissue is extensive, however, information related to above ground VOCs in response to root damage is lacking. In temporal studies, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of VOCs from the foliar tissues of SCN infested plants yielded 107 VOCs, referred to as Common Plant Volatiles (CPVs), 33 with confirmed identities. Plants showed no significant stunting until 10 days after infestation. Total CPVs increased over time and were significantly higher from SCN infested plants compared to mock infested plants post 7 days after infestation (DAI). Hierarchical clustering analysis of expression ratios (SCN: Mock) across all time points revealed 5 groups, with the largest group containing VOCs elevated in response to SCN infestation. Linear projection of Principal Component Analysis clearly separated SCN infested from mock infested plants at time points 5, 7, 10 and 14 DAI. Elevated Styrene (CPV11), D-Limonene (CPV32), Tetradecane (CPV65), 2,6-Di-T-butyl-4-methylene-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1-one (CPV74), Butylated Hydroxytoluene (CPV76) and suppressed Ethylhexyl benzoate (CPV87) levels, were associated with SCN infestation prior to stunting. Our findings demonstrate that SCN infestation elevates the release of certain VOCs from foliage and that some are evident prior to symptom development. VOCs associated with SCN infestations prior to symptom development may be valuable for innovative diagnostic approaches.

AB  - Leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases (LRR-RLKs) represent the largest subgroup of receptor-like kinases (RLKs) in plants. While some LRR-RLK members play a role in regulating various plant growth processes related to morphogenesis, disease resistance, and stress response, the functions of most LRR-RLK genes remain unclear. In this study, we identified 397 LRR-RLK genes from the genome of Camellia sinensis and categorized them into 16 subfamilies. Approximately 62% of CsLRR-RLK genes are situated in regions resulting from segmental duplications, suggesting that the expansion of CsLRR-RLK genes is due to segmental duplications. Analysis of gene expression patterns revealed differential expression of CsLRR-RLK genes across different tissues and in response to stress. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CssEMS1 localizes to the cell membrane and can complement Arabidopsis ems1 mutant. This study is the initial in-depth evolutionary examination of LRR-RLKs in tea and provides a basis for future investigations into their functionality.

AB  - Myelocytomatosis (MYC) transcription factors (TFs) in plants are well-known regulators of plant defense against herbivores. However, the role and mechanism of MYC TFs in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) defense against cotton aphids (Aphis gossypii Glover) remain still elusive. Herein, on the basis of aphid-induced cotton transcriptome analysis, GhMYC1374, a cotton MYC2-like TF that was highly induced by cotton aphid attack, has been identified that confers cotton aphid resistance in cotton. GhMYC1374 was an intranuclear transcription factor with three domains: bHLH-MYC_N, RBR and bHLH_AtAIB_like. GhMYC1374 was induced under cotton aphid feeding, exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) treatments. GhMYC1374 transient overexpression in cotton plants enhanced cotton aphid-resistance, while GhMYC1374 silence through VIGS (virus induced gene silencing) decreased cotton aphid-resistance. GhMYC1374 transient overexpression of in cotton plants activated the phenylpropane pathway and promoted the synthesis of flavonoids, and resistance to thus enhanced the cotton resistance against aphids. In contrast, GhMYC1374 silence inhibited the biosynthesis of flavonoids. In addition, GhMYC1374 also positively activated the expression of the biosynthetic genes of free gossypol, leading to the high content of free gossypol. Taken together, our results suggest that GhMYC1374 is involved in the cotton defense response against cotton aphids by regulating the biosynthesis of flavonoids and free gossypol.

AB  - Tea plants (Camellia sinensis) show discrepancies in selenium accumulation and transportation, the molecular mechanisms of which are not well understood. Hence, we aimed to conduct a systematic investigation of selenium accumulation and transportation mechanisms in different tea cultivars via transcriptome analysis. The Na2SeO3 and Na2SeO4 treatments improved selenium contents in the roots and leaves of three tea cultivars. The high selenium-enrichment ability (HSe) tea cultivars accumulated higher selenium contents in the leaves than did the low selenium-enrichment ability (LSe) tea cultivars. Transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under the Na2SeO3 and Na2SeO4 treatments were enriched in flavonoid biosynthesis in leaves. DEGs under the Na2SeO3 treatment were enriched in glutathione metabolism in the HSe tea cultivar roots compared to those of the LSe tea cultivar. More transporters and transcription factors involved in improving selenium accumulation and transportation were identified in the HSe tea cultivars under the Na2SeO3 treatment than in the Na2SeO4 treatment. In the HSe tea cultivar roots, the expression of sulfate transporter 1;2 (SULTR1;2) and SULTR3;4 increased in response to Na2SeO4 exposure. In contrast, ATP-binding cassette transporter genes (ABCs), glutathione S-transferase genes (GSTs), phosphate transporter 1;3 (PHT1;3), nitrate transporter 1 (NRT1), and 34 transcription factors were upregulated in the presence of Na2SeO3. In the HSe tea cultivar leaves, ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11) and 14 transcription factors were upregulated under the Na2SeO3 treatment. Among them, WRKY75 was explored as a potential transcription factor that regulated the accumulation of Na2SeO3 in the roots of HSe tea cultivars. This study preliminary clarified the mechanism of selenium accumulation and transportation in tea cultivars, and the findings have important theoretical significance for the breeding and cultivation of selenium-enriched tea cultivars.

AB  - Brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal, BPH) is one of the most destructive pests of rice. Non-coding RNA plays an important regulatory role in various biological processes. However, comprehensive identification and characterization of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in BPH-infested rice have not been performed. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of lncRNAs and circRNAs in BPH6-transgenic (resistant, BPH6G) and Nipponbare (susceptible, NIP) rice plants before and after BPH feeding (early and late stage) via deep RNA-sequencing. A total of 310 lncRNAs and 129 circRNAs were found to be differentially expressed. To reveal the different responses of resistant and susceptible rice to BPH herbivory, the potential functions of these lncRNAs and circRNAs as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) were predicted and investigated using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. Dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR1846c and miR530 were targeted by the lncRNAs XLOC_042442 and XLOC_028297, respectively. In responsive to BPH infestation, 39 lncRNAs and 21 circRNAs were predicted to combine with 133 common miRNAs and compete for miRNA binding sites with 834 mRNAs. These mRNAs predictably participated in cell wall organization or biogenesis, developmental growth, single-organism cellular process, and the response to stress. This study comprehensively identified and characterized lncRNAs and circRNAs, and integrated their potential ceRNA functions, to reveal the rice BPH-resistance network. These results lay a foundation for further study on the functions of lncRNAs and circRNAs in the rice-BPH interaction, and enriched our understanding of the BPH-resistance response in rice.

AB  - MADS-box genes comprise a large family of transcription factors that play crucial roles in all aspects of plant growth and development. However, no detailed information on the evolutionary relationship and functional characterization of MADS-box genes is currently available for some representative lineages, such as the Camellia plant. In this study, 136 MADS-box genes were detected from a reference genome of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) by employing a 569 bp HMM (Hidden Markov Model) developed using nucleotide sequencing including 73 type I and 63 type II genes. An additional twenty-seven genes were identified, with five MIKC-type genes. Truncated and/or inaccurate gene models were manually verified and curated to improve their functional characterization. Subsequently, phylogenetic relationships, chromosome locations, conserved motifs, gene structures, and gene expression profiles were systematically investigated. Tea plant MIKC genes were divided into all 14 major eudicot subfamilies, and no gene was found in M beta. The expansion of MADS-box genes in the tea plant was mainly contributed by WGD/fragment and tandem duplications. The expression profiles of tea plant MADS-box genes in different tissues and seasons were analyzed, revealing widespread evolutionary conservation and genetic redundancy. The expression profiles linked to cold stress treatments suggested the wide involvement of MADS-box genes from the tea plant in response to low temperatures. Moreover, a floral 'ABCE' model was proposed in the tea plant and proved to be both conserved and ancient. Our analyses offer a detailed overview of MADS-box genes in the tea plant, allowing us to hypothesize the potential functions of unknown genes and providing a foundation for further functional characterizations.

AB  - The pathway mediated by jasmonic acid (JA), biosynthesized via 13-lipoxygenases (LOX), plays a central role in both plant development and defense. In rice, there are at least fourteen 13-LOXs. Yet, only two 13-LOXs have been known to be involved in the biosynthesis of JA and plant defenses in rice. Here we cloned a chloroplast-localized 13-LOX gene from rice, OsRCI-1, whose transcripts were upregulated following infestation by brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), one of the most important pests in rice. Overexpression of OsRCI-1 (oeRCI lines) increased levels of BPH-induced JA, jasmonate-isoleucine, trypsin protease inhibitors and three volatile compounds, 2-heptanone, 2-heptanol and alpha-thujene. BPHs showed a decreased colonization, fecundity and mass, and developed slowly on oeRCI plants compared with wild-type (WT) plants. Moreover, BPH-infested oeRCI plants were more attractive to the egg parasitoid of BPH, Anagrus nilaparvatae than equally treated WT plants. The decreased attractiveness to BPH and enhanced attractiveness to the parasitoid of oeRCI plants correlated with higher levels of BPH-induced 2-heptanone and 2-heptanol, and 2-heptanone, respectively. Compared with oeRCI plants, WT plants had higher plant height and 1000-grain weight. These results indicate that OsRCI-1 is involved in herbivore-induced JA bursts and plays a role in plant defense and growth.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is a thermophilic cash crop and contains a highly duplicated and repeat-rich genome. It is still unclear how DNA methylation regulates the evolution of duplicated genes and chilling stress in tea plants. We therefore generated a single-base-resolution DNA methylation map of tea plants under chilling stress. We found that, compared with other plants, the tea plant genome is highly methylated in all three sequence contexts, including CG, CHG and CHH (where H = A, T, or C), which is further proven to be correlated with its repeat content and genome size. We show that DNA methylation in the gene body negatively regulates the gene expression of tea plants, whereas non-CG methylation in the flanking region enables a positive regulation of gene expression. We demonstrate that transposable element-mediated methylation dynamics significantly drives the expression divergence of duplicated genes in tea plants. The DNA methylation and expression divergence of duplicated genes in the tea plant increases with evolutionary age and selective pressure. Moreover, we detect thousands of differentially methylated genes, some of which are functionally associated with chilling stress. We also experimentally reveal that DNA methyltransferase genes of tea plants are significantly downregulated, whereas demethylase genes are upregulated at the initial stage of chilling stress, which is in line with the significant loss of DNA methylation of three well-known cold-responsive genes at their promoter and gene body regions. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of DNA methylation regulation and offer new insights into duplicated gene evolution and chilling tolerance in tea plants.

AB  - Introduction The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families in plants, extensively involved in plant growth, organ development, and stress responses. However, limited studies of this family are available in sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides).Methods In this study, we identified 144 bHLH genes in H. rhamnoides (HrbHLH) through a genome-wide search method, then explored their DNA and protein sequences and physicochemical properties.Results and discussion According to the sequence similarities, we classified them into 15 groups with specific motif structures. To explore their expressions, we performed gene expression profiling using RNA-Seq and identified 122 HrbHLH mRNAs were highly expressed, while the remaining 22 HrbHLH genes were expressed at very low levels in all 21 samples. Among these HrbHLH genes, HrbHLH47, HrbHLH74, HrbHLH90, HrbHLH131 showed the highest expression level in the root nodule, root, leaf, stem and fruit tissues. Furthermore, eleven HrbHLH genes displayed increased expressions during the fruit development process of sea buckthorn. Finally, we validated the expression patterns of HrbHLH genes using reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR). This comprehensive analysis provides a useful esource that enables further investigation of the physiological roles and molecular functions of the HrbHLH TFs.

AB  - Camellia (Camellia japonica) is a semi-shaded plant that is highly vulnerable to heat stress. To investigate the mechanisms underlying heat stress in C. japonica, two C. japonica cultivars, "Xiaotaohong" and "Zhuapolian", which exhibit significant differences in heat tolerance, were selected from four common cultivars. The selection methods included phenotypic observations and physiological index detection, including relative electric conductivity (REC), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity, relative water content (RWC), and chlorophyll content. RNA-seq analysis yielded 980 million reads and identified 68,455 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the two C. japonica cultivars during heat stress compared to the control samples. Totals of 12,565 and 16,046 DEGs were differentially expressed at 16 h and 32 h, respectively, in "Xiaotaohong" during heat stress. In "Zhuapolian", 40,280 and 37,539 DEGs were found at 16 h and 32 h, respectively. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that both cultivars were enriched in the "plant hormone signal transduction" and "circadian rhythm" pathways at two stages, indicating the critical role these pathways play in the heat stress response. The differences in the tolerance between the two cultivars are likely linked to pathways such as "plant hormone signal transduction", "photosynthesis", and "circadian rhythm". Some members of heat shock proteins (HSPs) are associated with the heat stress response. It is speculated that transcription factor families contributing to the tolerance differences include AP2/ERF, C3H, bHLH, bZIP, and MYB-related with a small number of heat shock factors (HSFs) also induced by the stress. In conclusion, these results reveal the changes in the physiological indices and molecular networks of two C. japonica cultivars under heat stress. This study lays the foundation for the breeding of superior heat-resistant C. japonica cultivars and for further molecular research.

AB  - Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is a model species for studying fruit development, wounding, herbivory, and pathogen attack. Despite tomato's world-wide economic importance and the role of chloroplasts as metabolic hubs and integrators of environmental cues, little is known about the stromal proteome of tomato. Using a high-yielding protocol for chloroplast and stromal protein isolation, MudPIT nano-LC-MS/MS analyses, a robust in-house protein database (the Atlas) for predicting the plastid localization of tomato proteins, and rigorous selection criteria for inclusion/exclusion in the stromal proteome, we identified 1,278 proteins of the tomato stromal proteome. We provide one of the most robust stromal proteomes available to date with empirical evidence for 545 and 92 proteins not previously described for tomato plastids and the Arabidopsis stroma, respectively. The relative abundance of tomato stromal proteins was determined using the exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI). Comparison of the abundance of tomato and Arabidopsis stromal proteomes provided evidence for the species-specific nature of stromal protein homeostasis. The manual curation of the tomato stromal proteome classified proteins into ten functional categories resulting in an accessible compendium of tomato chloroplast proteins. After curation, only 91 proteins remained as unknown, uncharacterized or as enzymes with unknown functions. The curation of the tomato stromal proteins also indicated that tomato has a number of paralogous proteins, not present in Arabidopsis, which accumulated to different levels in chloroplasts. As some of these proteins function in key metabolic pathways or in perceiving or transmitting signals critical for plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress, these data suggest that tomato may modulate the bidirectional communication between chloroplasts and nuclei in a novel manner. The stromal proteome provides a fertile ground for future mechanistic studies in the field of tomato chloroplast-nuclear signaling and are foundational for our goal of elucidating the dynamics of the stromal proteome controlled by the solanaceous-specific, stromal, and wound-inducible leucine aminopeptidase A of tomato.

AB  - Key messageSequestering microRNA396 by overexpression of MIM396 enhanced alfalfa resistance to Spodoptera litura larvae, which may be due to increased lignin content and enhanced low-molecular weight flavonoids and glucosinolates biosynthesis.Alfalfa (Medicago sativa), the most important leguminous forage crop, suffers from the outbreak of defoliator insects, especially Spodoptera litura, resulting in heavy losses in yield and forage quality. Here, we found that the expression of alfalfa microRNA396 (miR396) precursor genes and mature miR396 was significantly up-regulated in wounding treatment that simulates feeding injury by defoliator insects. To verify the function of miR396 in alfalfa resistance to insect, we generated MIM396 transgenic alfalfa plants with significantly down-regulated miR396 expression by Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. The MIM396 transgenic alfalfa plants exhibited improved resistance to Spodoptera litura larvae with increased lignin content but decreased JA accumulation. Most of the miR396 putative target GRF genes were up-regulated in MIM396 transgenic lines, and responded to the wounding treatment. By RNA sequencing analysis, we found that the differentially expressed genes related to insect resistance between WT and MIM396 transgenic plants mainly clustered in biosynthesis pathways in lignin, flavonoids and glucosinolates. In addition to the phenotype of enhanced insect resistance, MIM396 transgenic plants also displayed reduced biomass yield and forage quality. Our results broaden the function of miR396 in alfalfa and provide genetic resources for studying alfalfa insect resistance.

AB  - Plants undergo dynamic metabolic changes at the cellular level upon insect infestation to better defend themselves. Phenylpropanoids, a hub of secondary plant metabolites, encompass a wide range of compounds that can contribute to insect resistance. Here, the role of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) phenylpropanoids in providing defense against the chewing herbivore, fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda, was explored. We screened a panel of nested association mapping (NAM) founder lines against FAW and identified SC1345 and Ajabsido as most resistant and susceptible lines to FAW, respectively, compared to reference parent, RTx430. Gene expression and metabolomic studies suggested that FAW feeding suppressed the expression level of genes involved in monolignol biosynthetic pathway and their associated phenolic intermediates at 10 days post infestation. Further, SC1345 genotype displayed elevated levels of flavonoid compounds after FAW feeding for 10 days, suggesting a diversion of precursors from lignin biosynthesis to the flavonoid pathway. Additionally, bioassays with sorghum lines having altered levels of flavonoids provided genetic evidence that flavonoids are crucial in providing resistance against FAW. Finally, the application of FAW regurgitant elevated the expression of genes associated with the flavonoid pathway in the FAW-resistant SC1345 genotype. Overall, our study indicates that a dynamic regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway in sorghum plants imparts resistance against FAW.

AB  - N6-methyladenosine (m6A), one of the internal modifications of RNA molecules, can directly influence RNA abundance and function without altering the nucleotide sequence, and plays a pivotal role in response to diverse environmental stresses. The precise m6A regulatory mechanism comprises three types of components, namely, m6A writers, erasers, and readers. To date, the research focusing on m6A regulatory genes in plant kingdom is still in its infancy. Here, a total of 34 m6A regulatory genes were identified from the chromosome-scale genome of tea plants. The expansion of m6A regulatory genes was driven mainly by whole-genome duplication (WGD) and segmental duplication, and the duplicated gene pairs evolved through purifying selection. Gene structure analysis revealed that the sequence variation contributed to the functional diversification of m6A regulatory genes. Expression pattern analysis showed that most m6A regulatory genes were differentially expressed under environmental stresses and tea-withering stage. These observations indicated that m6A regulatory genes play essential roles in response to environmental stresses and tea-withering stage. We also found that RNA methylation and DNA methylation formed a negative feedback by interacting with each other's methylation regulatory genes. This study provided a foundation for understanding the m6A-mediated regulatory mechanism in tea plants under environmental stresses and tea-withering stage.

AB  - Phytophagous mites are herbivores that feed on various economically important plants, such as soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merril]. Thus, our objective is to evaluate the oxidative stress stage of soybean plants infested by Tetranychus ludeni Zacher. Leaflets from three trifoliate leaves were pooled to form composite samples for each exposure time and evaluated at the following evaluation times: 0 h, 20 min, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. In the initial phase of infestation (20 min), an oxidative burst was observed, represented by prominent hydrogen peroxide accumulation rather than superoxide radicals. This oxidative burst occurred in parallel to a strong increase in the antioxidant activities of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase, but not in that of superoxide dismutase. These changes likely reflected an enhanced activation of signaling pathways involved in the oxidative stress response. After this initial phase, from 20 min to 6 h, a prominent decrease occurred in catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferases activities, despite the hydrogen peroxide levels remaining significantly elevated, along with a marked but transient increase in the reduced glutathione content and proline. Interestingly, superoxide dismutase activity increased significantly after 6 h in parallel to lipid peroxidation, whereas the content of hydrogen peroxide remained elevated until 12 h of infestation. By the final evaluation, after 48 h of infestation, some redox indicators remained altered in relation to control plants, but in a state of moderate redox stress. Thus, in an unprecedented way, our data suggest that T. ludeni infestation triggered a moderate oxidative stress response in soybean plants. These findings highlight that proper monitoring and management can reduce economic losses without resorting to aggressive chemical interventions.

AB  - Plants are constantly exposed to different kinds of biotic stress, such as herbivore attack and wounding. To deal with these stresses, plants have evolved sophisticated defence mechanisms to protect themselves. Previously, we found that EIJ1 (EDS1-interacting J protein 1) plays a negative regulatory role in plant disease resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Follow-up studies revealed that EIJ1 specifically responds to wounding and herbivore stresses. The expression of EIJ1 was specifically induced by wounding or herbivore stress, as demonstrated by similar results in EIJ1 protein assay. Interestingly, GUS staining found that the promoter of EIJ1 is not involved in the induction of expression under wounding stress. Instead, we identified the first intron of EIJ1 as a key factor in response to wounding stress. Deleting the first intron of EIJ1 resulted in a loss of response to wounding stress in plants. Our results broaden the role of EIJ1 in plant resistance to biotic stress and provide new insights into plant responses to biotic stress.

AB  - Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is an important tuber crop, but also target of numerous insect pests. Intriguingly, the abundant storage protein in tubers, sporamin, has intrinsic trypsin protease inhibitory activity. In leaves, sporamin is induced by wounding or a volatile homoterpene and enhances insect resistance. While the signalling pathway leading to sporamin synthesis is partially established, the initial event, perception of a stress-related signal is still unknown. Here, we identified an IbLRR-RK1 that is induced upon wounding and herbivory, and related to peptide-elicitor receptors (PEPRs) from tomato and Arabidopsis. We also identified a gene encoding a precursor protein comprising a peptide ligand (IbPep1) for IbLRR-RK1. IbPep1 represents a distinct signal in sweet potato, which might work in a complementary and/or parallel pathway to the previously described hydroxyproline-rich systemin (HypSys) peptides to strengthen insect resistance. Notably, an interfamily compatibility in the Pep/PEPR system from Convolvulaceae and Solanaceae was identified.

AB  - Plants show sequential immune responses, pattern-triggered immunity (PTI), followed by effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The long-lasting MAPK activity during ETI triggers activation of robust ROS burst mediated by an NADPH oxidase in plasma membrane, also in chloroplasts. Mining of hydrogen peroxide receptors, ROS sensor proteins seems important to elucidate the ROS-dependent cellular events. We also introduce live-imaging system of MAPK activity by producing FRET-based biosensor at the single cell and organelle levels. The obser-vation of spatiotemporal MAPK activities in response to pathogen and herbivore attacks will provide new insights into the positioning of MAPK and ROS in the plant immunity.

AB  - Species of the genus Aesculus are very attractive woody ornamentals. Their organs contain numerous health-promoting phytochemicals. The most valuable of them-aescin-is used in commercial preparations for the treatment of venous insufficiency. The industrial source of aescin is horse chestnut seeds because the zygotic embryos are the main site of its accumulation. Horse chestnut somatic and zygotic embryos contain similar amount of aescin, hence somatic embryos could be exploited as an alternative source of aescin. Somatic embryogenesis, androgenesis and de novo shoot organogenesis were successfully achieved in several Aesculus species, as well as secondary somatic embryogenesis and shoot organogenesis, which enables mass production of embryos and shoots. In addition, an efficient method for cryopreservation of embryogenic tissue was established, assuring constant availability of the plant material. The developed methods are suitable for clonal propagation of elite specimens selected as the best aescin producers, the most attractive ornamentals or plants resistant to pests and diseases. These methods are also useful for molecular breeding purposes. Thus, in this review, the medicinal uses and a comprehensive survey of in vitro propagation methods established for Aesculus species, as well as the feasibility of in vitro production of aescin, are presented and discussed.

AB  - The desulfurization behavior of 316L stainless steel (STS316L) melt with the CaO-SiO2-CaF2-Al2O3-MgO slag was investigated with different CaO/SiO2 (=C/S) ratio and CaF2 content at 1873 K. As the C/S ratio increased, the sulfide capacity increased, whereas the sulfide capacity of the high C/S (=1.7) slag was not affected by CaF2 content. The overall mass transfer coefficient (k(O)) increased with C/S ratio, but was constant above a critical C/S value, and it was also constant across varied CaF2 content at relatively high C/S (=1.7) condition. Since the metal condition of the present study was constant, the change in k(O) was caused by slag phase mass transfer coefficient (k(s)) and sulfur distribution ratio (LS), which were affected by the physicochemical properties of the slag. Since desulfurization reaction requires consideration of both kinetic and thermodynamic factors, the 'log CS2- -log h' (where C(S2-& nbsp;)is sulfide capacity and h is viscosity), was proposed as a meaningful physicochemical parameter. If the slag basicity is relatively high, at which the k(O) is equivalent regardless of slag compositions, the desulfurization reaction is controlled by metal phase mass transfer. However, if the slag basicity becomes lower, at which the k(O) significantly decreases, the desulfurization reaction is assumed to be controlled by slag phase mass transfer and/or mixed controlled process.

AB  - Grafting serves as a crucial propagation technique for superior Camellia oleifera varieties, where rootstock-scion compatibility significantly determines survival and growth performance. To systematically evaluate grafting compatibility in this economically important woody oil crop, we examined 15 rootstock-scion combinations using 'Xianglin 210' as the scion, assessing growth traits and conducting physiological assays (enzymatic activities of SOD and POD and levels of ROS and IAA) at multiple timepoints (0-32 days post-grafting). The results demonstrated that Comb. 4 (Xianglin 27 rootstock) exhibited superior compatibility, characterized by systemic antioxidant activation (peaking at 4-8 DPG), rapid auxin accumulation (4 DPG), and efficient sugar allocation. Transcriptome sequencing and WGCNA analysis identified 3781 differentially expressed genes, with notable enrichment in stress response pathways (Hsp70, DnaJ) and auxin biosynthesis (YUCCA), while also revealing key hub genes (FKBP19) associated with graft-healing efficiency. These findings establish that successful grafting in C. oleifera depends on coordinated rapid redox regulation, auxin-mediated cell proliferation, and metabolic reprogramming, with Comb. 4 emerging as the optimal rootstock choice. The identified molecular markers not only advance our understanding of grafting mechanisms in woody plants but also provide valuable targets for future breeding programs aimed at improving grafting success rates in this important oil crop.

AB  - BackgroundCamellia chekiangoleosa is the most widely planted red-flowered and large-fruited oil-camellia species, with high value in edible oil production and landscaping. To better understand the weak scion development and slow graft-union healing underlying grafting propagation challenges in C. chekiangoleosa, we conducted temporal RNA-seq on current-year shoots with five time points determined according to changes in cell wall composition, aiming to reveal dynamic developmental regulation.ResultsAnalysis of temporal expression characteristics of genome-wide genes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed that genes differentially patterned between stem and apical bud were enriched in functions related to cell division and differentiation, hormone responses, and vascular or flower development. Coexpression network analysis revealed that red/far-red light and gibberellin (GA) signaling were closely correlated with flowering development in C. chekiangoleosa shoots. We further analyzed a unique module showing a negative correlation between the module and traits (cell wall composition, i.e., lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose content). Genes in the top-scored sub-cluster of this module were enriched in shoot development-related processes, including cell wall dynamics, xylem development, secondary cell wall biogenesis, lignin biosynthesis, and procambium histogenesis. WOX4 and PXY, known markers of cambium cells, were identified as key hub genes, along with the actin-binding protein WLIM1. These coexpressed hub genes associated with vascular system development peaked in June in stems and were validated by qRT-PCR, suggesting that June may be an optimal grafting season for C. chekiangoleosa.ConclusionsIntegrating transcriptomics and physiology defined the dynamic signature of changes in composition of cell wall and gene activity during the development of current-year shoots in C. chekiangoleosa. Our findings provide insights into a potential molecular strategy for breeders, targeting key regulators specific to cambium differentiation, and physiological strategy for hormone or light supplied artificially to enhance grafting productivity of C. chekiangoleosa.

AB  - Hsp70s, a group of heat shock proteins, are ancient proteins that play a crucial part in maintaining the stability of cells when faced with various internal and external stresses. In this research, there are 72 CsHSP70 genes present and verified in Camelina sativa, all of which exhibit a wide range of physicochemical characteristics. Through evolutionary analysis, the Hsp70 family was categorized into five primary groups, and numerous segmental duplications were anticipated among the CsHSP70 genes. The GO enrichment analysis of co-expression network elements revealed a significant association between key signaling terms, such as phosphorelay signal transduction, and MAPK cascade with the function of CsHsp70. An analysis of transcriptome data exposed to cold, drought, salinity, and cadmium stress demonstrated the varied expression profiles of CsHsp70 genes. The expression levels of CsHSP70 genes varied across various organs and stages of development in camelina, although some of them illustrated tissue-specific expression. qRT-PCR analysis further disclosed that CsHsp70-60, -52, and -13 were up-regulated and CsHsp70-03, -58, and -09 showed down-regulation in response to salinity. Furthermore, CsHsp70 genes are categorized as late-responsive elements to salinity stress. Through docking analysis, the current research revealed that CsHsp70 proteins interacted with ABA, BR, and MeJA.

AB  - The microRNA156 (miR156) family, one of the first miRNA families discovered in plants, plays various important roles in plant growth and resistance to various abiotic stresses. Previously, miR156s were shown to respond to drought stress, but miR156s in tea plants (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) have not been comprehensively identified and analyzed. Herein, we identify 47 mature sequences and 28 precursor sequences in tea plants. Our evolutionary analysis and multiple sequence alignment revealed that csn-miR156s were highly conserved during evolution and that the rates of the csn-miR156 members' evolution were different. The precursor sequences formed typical and stable stem-loop structures. The prediction of cis-acting elements in the CsMIR156s promoter region showed that the CsMIR156s had diverse cis-acting elements; of these, 12 CsMIR156s were found to be drought-responsive elements. The results of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) testing showed that csn-miR156 family members respond to drought and demonstrate different expression patterns under the conditions of drought stress. This suggests that csn-miR156 family members may be significantly involved in the response of tea plants to drought stress. Csn-miR156f-2-5p knockdown significantly reduced the Fv/Fm value and chlorophyll content and led to the accumulation of more-reactive oxygen species and proline compared with the control. The results of target gene prediction showed that csn-miR156f-2-5p targeted SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like (SPL) genes. Further analyses showed that CsSPL14 was targeted by csn-miR156f-2-5p, as confirmed through RT-qPCR, 5 ' RLM-RACE, and antisense oligonucleotide validation. Our results demonstrate that csn-miR156f-2-5p and CsSPL14 are involved in drought response and represent a new strategy for increasing drought tolerance via the breeding of tea plants.

AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB), spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), is a widespread, devastating disease that causes significant losses in citrus production. Therefore, controlling the ACP infestation and HLB infection is very important for citrus production. The aim of our study was to identify any citrus volatile which could be used as a repellent or less attractant towards ACP, and to envisage the potential of this strategy to control HLB spread. The present study identified a terpene synthase (TPS)-encoding gene CsTPS21 in citrus plants, and this gene was predicted to encode a monoterpene synthase and had an amino acid sequence similar to beta-ocimene synthase. CsTPS21 was significantly upregulated by ACP infestation and methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) treatment but downregulated by salicylic acid (SA). Further heterologous gene expression studies in yeast cells and tobacco plants indicated that the protein catalyzed the formation of beta-ocimene, which acted as an ACP repellent. Detailed analysis of tobacco overexpressing CsTPS21 showed that CsTPS21 synthesizing beta-ocimene regulated jasmonic acid (JA)-associated pathways by increasing the JA accumulation and inducing the JA biosynthetic gene expression to defend against insect infestation. These findings provide a basis to plan strategies to manage HLB in the field using beta-ocimene and CsTPS21 as candidates.

AB  - The selection and breeding of deep rooting and drought-tolerant varieties has become a promising approach for improving the yield and adaptability of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) in arid and semiarid areas. Therefore, the discovery of root-development-related genes and drought tolerance signaling pathways in potato is important. In this study, we used deep-rooting (C119) and shallow-rooting (C16) potato genotypes, with different levels of drought tolerance, to achieve this objective. Both genotypes were treated with 150 mM mannitol for 0 h (T0), 2 h (T2), 6 h (T6), 12 h (T12), and 24 h (T24), and their root tissues were subjected to comparative transcriptome analysis. A total of 531, 1571, 1247, and 3540 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in C16 and 1531, 1108, 674, and 4850 DEGs in C119 were identified in T2 vs. T0, T6 vs. T2, T12 vs. T6, and T24 vs. T12 comparisons, respectively. Gene expression analysis indicated that a delay in the onset of drought-induced transcriptional changes in C16 compared with C119. Functional enrichment analysis revealed genotype-specific biological processes involved in drought stress tolerance. The metabolic pathways of plant hormone transduction and MAPK signaling were heavily involved in the resistance of C16 and C119 to drought, while abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and salicylic acid signal transduction pathways likely played more important roles in C119 stress responses. Furthermore, genes involved in root cell elongation and division showed differential expression between the two genotypes under drought stress. Overall, this study provides important information for the marker-assisted selection and breeding of drought-tolerant potato genotypes.

AB  - The nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related (NPR) gene family is well known to play a crucial role in transactivation of TGA transcription factors for salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes, including pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1), during plants' immune response after pathogen attack in the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. However, little is known about NPR gene functions in monocots. We therefore explored the functions of NPRs in SA signaling in the model monocot Brachypodium distachyon. BdNPR1 and BdNPR2/3 share structural similarities with A. thaliana AtNPR1/2 and AtNPR3/4 subfamilies, respectively. The transcript level of BdNPR2 but not BdNPR1/3 appeared to be positively regulated in leaves in response to methyl salicylate. Reporter assays in protoplasts showed that BdNPR2 positively regulated BdTGA1-mediated activation of PR1. This transactivation occurred in an SA-dependent manner through SA binding at Arg468 of BdNPR2. In contrast, BdNPR1 functioned as a suppressor of BdNPR2/BdTGA1-mediated transcription of PR1. Collectively, our findings reveal that the TGA-promoted transcription of SA-inducible PR1 is orchestrated by the activator BdNPR2 and the repressor BdNPR1, which function competitively in B. distachyon.

AB  - Plant immune response following pathogenic infection is regulated by plant hormones, and salicylic acid (SA) and its sugar conjugates play important roles in establishing basal resistance. Here, the important pathogen Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis (Pcs) was isolated from tea gray blight, one of the most destructive diseases in tea plantations. Transcriptomic analysis led to the discovery of the putative Camellia sinensis UDP-glucosyltransferase CsUGT87E7 whose expression was significantly induced by SA application and Pcs infection. Recombinant CsUGT87E7 glucosylates SA with a K-m value of 12 mu M to form SA glucose ester (SGE). Downregulation reduced the accumulation of SGE, and CsUGT87E7-silenced tea plants exhibited greater susceptibility to pathogen infection than control plants. Similarly, CsUGT87E7-silenced tea leaves accumulated significantly less SA after infection and showed reduced expression of pathogenesis-related genes. These results suggest that CsUGT87E7 is an SA carboxyl glucosyltransferase that plays a positive role in plant disease resistance by modulating SA homeostasis through a mechanism distinct from that described in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). This study provides insight into the mechanisms of SA metabolism and highlights the role of SGE in the modulation of plant disease resistance.
   The glucosyltransferase UGT87E7 from Camellia sinensis specifically forms a salicylic acid glucose ester and plays a positive role in plant disease resistance by modulating salicylic acid homeostasis.

AB  - Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinases (MAPKKKs/MAP3Ks) are widespread signal transduction module of MAPK cascades and show significant role in growth, development and defense/tolerance responses to environmental stresses. However, MAPKKKs are not yet identified and characterized in the sequenced Cicer arietinum genome and their control on plant defense response against herbivory is still poorly understood. Therefore, a comprehensive investigation of chickpea genome was performed, which identified 52 MAPKKKs (CaMAPKKKs). The phylogenetic study of MAPKKKs from chickpea, Arabidopsis and rice, categorized them into three subclasses, namely MEKK, RAF and ZIK. Presence of respective conserved sequences in each CaMAPKKKs strongly supported their identity as members of the three subfamilies. Physical mapping of these genes revealed their wider distribution on all the eight chromosomes. The three-dimensional structure prediction and potential active sites identification of selected MAPKKK proteins revealed the presence of phosphotransferase domain, which is required for its catalytic activity and participation in the MAPK cascade. The relative expression level of 29 CaMAPKKKs transcripts exhibited differential expression in diverse tissue types, but others showed no/very low expression. Further, in order to figure out their involvement in plant defense response, the expression patterns of CaMAPKKK genes was evaluated during Helicoverpa armigera -feeding by qPCR, which revealed their differential expression during herbivory. This study on identification and characterization of CaMAP3K gene family provided insights into evolution and divergence of CaMAPKKKs and their significance in plant defense against herbivores, which can be further utilized to decipher MAPK pathway involved in plant defense in chickpea and also for pest management.

AB  - The study assessed the impact of four equine semen processing techniques on sperm quality and microbial load immediately post-processing and after 48 h of refrigeration. The aim was to explore the potential reduction of prophylactic antibiotic usage in semen extenders. Semen from ten adult stallions was collected and processed under a strict hygiene protocol and divided into four aliquots: Simple Centrifugation with antibiotics (SC+), Simple Centrifugation (SC-), Single-Layer Colloidal Centrifugation (CC-), and Filtration (with SpermFilter (R)) (F-), all in extenders without antibiotics. Sperm motility, viability, and microbial load on three culture media were assessed. No significant differences were observed in the main in the sperm quality parameters among the four protocols post-processing and at 48 h (p < 0.05 or p < 0.1). Microbial loads in Columbia 5% Sheep Blood Agar and Schaedler vitamin K1 5% Sheep Blood Agar mediums were significantly higher (p < 0.10) for raw semen than for CS+, CC-, and F- post-processing. For Sabouraud Dextrose Agar medium, the microbial load was significantly higher (p < 0.10) in raw semen compared to CS+ and F-. No significant differences (p < 0.10) were found in 48 h chilled samples. Regardless of antibiotic presence, the evaluated processing methods, when combined with rigorous hygiene measures, maintained semen quality and reduced microbial load to the same extent as a traditional protocol using antibiotics.

AB  - BackgroundTea [Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze] is a type of evergreen shrub that belongs to the family Theaceae. The widespread consumption of this crop is attributed to its refreshing taste, pleasant aroma, stimulating properties, numerous health benefits and therapeutic uses because it is the richest source of secondary metabolites, especially catechin derivatives, caffeine, polyphenols, theanine, tannins, etc. As such, the present study aimed to evaluate the genome-wide associated significant loci to identify potential candidate genes for flavour-related traits of indigenous tea germplasm maintained at Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat, India.ResultsA total of 401,865 filtered SNPs were used for the genotyping of 160 tea germplasms. Chromosome 1 had the highest number of detected SNPs, with 40,154, whereas chromosome 14 had the lowest number, with 15,646 SNPs. Significant variation was observed between the metabolites, and among them, the EGCG content was notably the highest. A total of 162 loci were commonly identified as significant QTNs for all 13 traits via the MLM and FarmCPU models through the GAPIT and rMVP approaches. However, certain loci are commonly associated with multiple traits. From these significant QTNs, more than 100 candidate genes associated with flavour-related traits were identified at different marker positions and the expression analysis of gene viz. CsbHLH, chalcone flavonone, serine carboxylase etc. showed higher expression.ConclusionThis GWAS identified several genes that could be linked to flavour-related traits in tea plants. While some of these genes are not directly involved in biosynthetic pathways, their influence on metabolism under stress highlights their importance in the broader metabolic network and plant adaptability. The identified SNPs and candidate genes can be leveraged for marker-assisted selection, accelerating the breeding of tea plants with desirable traits. This information offers key insights into the genetic mechanisms behind flavour profiles and stress response, opening new avenues for future genetic enhancement and breeding approaches in tea cultivation.

AB  - Background and Aims The tropical shrub Coelospermum decipiens (Rubiaceae) is an extreme selenium (Se) hyperaccumulator, reported to accumulate up to 1140 mu g Se g(-1) when found growing on soils with levels of Se below the limit of detection (i.e. <0.01 mg Se kg(-1)) leading to a bioconcentration factor of >100 000. Methods Coelospermum decipiens plants were sampled from different populations in far north Queensland and analysed for Se concentrations. Plant material was subjected to synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) and synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) investigations to gain insights into the elemental distribution and chemical speciation of Se. Results The foliar Se concentrations ranged from 100 to 1000 mu g Se g(-1), except for the seeds, which had up to 28 000 mu g Se g(-1). The soils from the Hope Vale area were locally Se-enriched up to 48 mg Se kg(-1), but there was no relationship between soil and plant Se concentrations. Synchrotron XFM analysis revealed that Se was localized in the blade margin tissue of the younger leaves, whilst the XAS analysis determined that Se occurs as an organo-Se compound. Conclusions We report the occurrence of seleniferous soils in the Cape York Peninsula soils for the first time, which may partly explain the evolution of Se hyperaccumulation in C. decipiens. The extremely high concentrations of Se in the seeds is suggestive of a herbivory protection function. The capacity of this species to accumulate and hyperaccumulate Se from non-seleniferous soils is akin to that of other 'seed'-based accumulators, such as some members of the Lecythidaceae family.

AB  - The cyanogenic glucoside, dhurrin, present in Sorghum bicolor is thought to have multiple functions, including in defence against herbivory. The hormone methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is also induced by herbivory and is key to instigating defence processes in plants.
   To investigate whether dhurrin is induced in response to herbivore attack and also to the associated presence of MeJA, sorghum plants were either wounded or exogenous MeJA was applied.
   We show that specific wounding (pin board and perforation) and the application of MeJA increases dhurrin concentration in leaves and sheath tissue 12 h after treatment.
   Quantitative PCR shows that the expression of two genes, SbCYP79A1 and SbUGT85B1, involved in the synthesis of dhurrin are significantly induced by exogenous MeJA and by wounding. Analysis of 2 kb of sequence upstream of the start codon of SbCYP79A1 identifies several cis-acting elements that have been linked to MeJA induction. A promoter deletion series, coupled to GFP, and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana suggests that there are potentially three sequence motifs (similar to-925 to -976) involved in the binding of transcription factors that result in increased expression of SbCYP79A1 and the synthesis of dhurrin in response to MeJA.

AB  - Background: Seed Myco-priming based on consortium of entomopathogenic fungi is very effective seed treatment against Ostrinia furnacalis herbivory. Maize regulates defense responses against herbivory by the production of defense-related enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, phytohormones, and their corresponding genes. Jasmonic acid (JA) plays a key role in plant-entomopathogenic fungi-herbivore interaction. Results: To understand how a consortium of the entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Trichoderma asperellum induce changes in the response of maize to herbivory and increase the crop yield, 2-year field experiment, antioxidant enzymes, leaf transcriptome, and phytohormone were performed. Fungal inoculation enhanced the production of antioxidant enzymes and JA signaling pathway more than the normal herbivory. The comparison between single inoculated, consortium inoculated, and non-inoculated plants resulted in distinct transcriptome profiles representing a considerable difference in expression of antioxidant- and JA- responsive genes identified through Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and expression analysis, respectively. Seed priming with a consortium of B. bassiana and T. asperellum significantly enhanced the expression of genes involved in antioxidants production and JA biosynthesis cascade, with the highest expression recorded at 24-h post O. furnacalis larval infestation. They reduced the larval nutritional indices and survival up to 87% and enhancing crop yield and gross return up to 82-96% over the year 2018 and 2019. Conclusion: From our results we suggest that a consortium of B. bassiana and T. asperellum can be used synergistically against O. furnacalis in maize under field condition and can mediate antioxidants- and JA- associated maize defense response by boosting up the expression of their responsive genes, thereby enhancing crop yield.

AB  - Jasmonates (JAs) are phytohormones that induce plant defense responses against pathogens and herbivores. However, JAs often cause plant growth inhibition. Thus, JAs have not been practically useful for crop protection to date. In this study, we demonstrate that N-[5-(Trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]benzenesulfonamide (TPBS) can upregulate JA-inducible defense genes in Nicotiana benthamiana plants without severe growth inhibition. Using a promoter-luciferase-based high-throughput system (HTS) in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, TPBS was found to be an agonist of methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-dependent responses, although TPBS has no structural similarity to MeJA. MeJA strongly upregulates the expression of many secondary metabolite-related genes involved in five major secondary metabolic pathways: the alkaloid, terpenoid, phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, and anthocyanin pathways. TPBS application significantly upregulated only some of these genes in the roots, mainly those involved in the alkaloid biosynthesis pathways. The biological activity of TPBS was tested according to its ability to increase the accumulation of nicotine, a well-known JA-inducible alkaloid involved in defense responses. TPBS led to accumulation of nicotine as much as MeJA in N. benthamiana leaves. We found that 10 mu M TPBS led to nicotine accumulation (9.7-fold) without growth inhibition (104%), indicating that TPBS can uncouple defense responses from growth inhibition. These features make TPBS a strong candidate for use in crop protection, as demonstrated by increased nicotine content in tobacco.

AB  - Exposure of plants to stress conditions or to certain chemical elicitors can establish a primed state, whereby responses to future stress encounters are enhanced. Stress priming can be long-lasting and likely involves epigenetic regulation of stress-responsive gene expression. However, the molecular events underlying priming are not well understood. Here, we characterise epigenetic changes in tomato plants primed for pathogen resistance by treatment with beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA). We used whole genome bisulphite sequencing to construct tomato methylomes from control plants and plants treated with BABA at the seedling stage, and a parallel transcriptome analysis to identify genes primed for the response to inoculation by the fungal pathogen, Botrytis cinerea. Genomes of plants treated with BABA showed a significant reduction in global cytosine methylation, especially in CHH sequence contexts. Analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) revealed that CHH DMRs were almost exclusively hypomethylated and were enriched in gene promoters and in DNA transposons located in the chromosome arms. Genes overlapping CHH DMRs were enriched for a small number of stress response-related gene ontology terms. In addition, there was significant enrichment of DMRs in the promoters of genes that are differentially expressed in response to infection with B. cinerea. However, the majority of genes that demonstrated priming did not contain DMRs, and nor was the overall distribution of methylated cytosines in primed genes altered by BABA treatment. Hence, we conclude that whilst BABA treatment of tomato seedlings results in characteristic changes in genome-wide DNA methylation, CHH hypomethylation appears only to target a minority of genes showing primed responses to pathogen infection. Instead, methylation may confer priming via in-trans regulation, acting at a distance from defence genes, and/or by targeting a smaller group of regulatory genes controlling stress responses.

AB  - Main conclusion Genome-wide identification, expression analysis of the MYC family in Camellia sinensis, and potential functional characterization of CsMYC2.1 have laid a solid foundation for further research on CsMYC2.1 in jasmonate (JA)-mediated response. Myelocytomatosis (MYC) of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) plays a major role in JA-mediated plant growth and developmental processes through specifically binding to the G-box in the promoters of their target genes. In Camellia sinensis, studies on the MYC gene family are limited. Here, we identified 14 C. sinensis MYC (CsMYC) genes, and further analyzed the evolutionary relationship, gene structure, and motif pattern among them. The expression patterns of these CsMYC genes in different tissues suggested their important roles in diverse function in tea plant. Four MYC transcription factors with the highest homology to MYC2 in Arabidopsis were localized in the nucleus. Two of them, named CsMYC2.1 and CsMYC2.2, exhibited transcriptional self-activating activity, and, therefore, could significantly activate the promoter containing G-box motif, whereas CsJAM1.1 and CsJAM1.2 lack the transcriptional self-activating activity, indirectly mediating the JA pathway through interacting with CsMYC2.1 and CsMYC2.2. Furthermore, Yeast Two-Hybrid (Y2H) and Bimolecular Fluorescent Complimentary (BiFC) assays showed that CsMYC2.1 could interact with CsJAZ3/7/8 proteins. Genetically, the complementation of CsMYC2.1 in myc2 mutants conferred the ability to restore the sensitivity to JA signals. The results provide a comprehensive characterization of the 14 CsMYCs in C. sinensis, establishing a solid foundation for further research on CsMYCs in JA-mediated response.

AB  - Wool has distinctive biological, physical, and chemical properties that contribute to its value both for the sheep and in global fibre and textile markets. Its fibres are primarily composed of proteins, principally keratin and keratin-associated proteins (KAPs). To better comprehend the genes that underpin key wool traits, this study examined the keratin-associated protein 36-1 gene (KRTAP36-1) in Chinese Tan lambs. We identified three previously reported alleles of the gene (named A, B and C) that were present in the lambs studied, with genotype frequencies as follows: 2.0% (n = 5; AA), 6.9% (n = 17; AB), 13.8% (n = 34; AC), 8.9% (n = 22; BB), 33.4% (n = 82; BC) and 35.0% (n = 86; CC). The frequencies of the individual alleles in the Chinese Tan lambs were 12.4%, 29.1% and 58.5% for alleles A, B and C, respectively. The three alleles were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. In an association analysis, it was revealed that allele C was associated with variation in the mean fibre curvature of the fine wool of the Chinese Tan lambs, but this association was not observed in their heterotypic hair fibres. This finding suggests that KRTAP36-1 might be differentially expressed in the wool follicles that produce the two fibre types, and that along with other KRTAP genes, it may be involved in determining fibre curvature and the distinctive curly coat of the lambs.

AB  - The global concern over trace and heavy metal contamination in aquatic environments necessitates the development of effective remediation strategies. Using aquatic plants for heavy metal removal is a relatively economical and sustainable technology worldwide. This study involved collecting sediment and aquatic plant samples (Acanthus ilicifolius, Typha elephantina, and Cynodon dactylon) from a highly urbanized estuary to analyze metal concentrations in sediment, assess ecological risks, and explore the phytoremediation potential. Trace and heavy metals were detected using Energy Dispersive X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (EDXRF). The sediment metal concentrations were found in decreasing order of Fe, Ti, Mn, Rb, Zr, Zn, Sr, Cu, Co, and As. Fe, Sr, and As concentrations were below certified values, whereas Cu, Zn, and Rb exceeded them. Cumulatively, the pollution load index (PLI) values were close to 1 (0.845), indicating that the study area is likely experiencing metal pollution. The Contamination Factor (CF) values, ranging from 1 to 3, indicated a moderate degree of sediment pollution for Ti, Mn, Cu, Zn, and Rb. The Enrichment Factor (EF) values similarly showed moderate enrichment for these metals, with Cu exhibiting the highest degree of enrichment. Ecological risk assessment highlighted the only metal, Cu, as posing the greatest risk among the studied metals. In terms of phytoremediation potential, the bioconcentration factor (BCF) followed the decreasing order of C. dactylon > A. ilicifolius > T. elephantina for most metals, with low BCF values (<1) indicating low accumulator potential. However, the translocation factor (TF) values for Zn (1.464) and Rb (1.299) in A. ilicifolius species were greater than 1, indicating low accumulation potential but hyper-metabolizing capabilities, allowing the plant to accumulate metals in its aerial parts, making it effective for phytostabilization.

AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provide the basis for lifelong male fertility through self-renewal and differentiation. Prepubertal male cancer patients may be rendered infertile by gonadotoxic chemotherapy and, unlike sexually mature men, cannot store sperm. Alternatively, testicular biopsies taken prior to treatment may be used to restore fertility in adulthood. Testicular SSC populations are limited, and in vitro culture systems are required to increase numbers of SSCs for treatment, demanding culture systems for SSC propagation. Using the pig as a non-rodent model, we developed culture systems to expand spermatogonia from immature testis tissue, comparing different feeders (Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells (PMCs) and pig fetal fibroblasts (PFFs)). Spermatogonia co-cultured with Sertoli cells, PMCs and PFFs had comparable rates of proliferation and apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism behind the beneficial nature of feeder layers, we investigated the role of extracellular vesicles in crosstalk between spermatogonia and feeder cells. Sertoli cell-released exosomes are incorporated by spermatogonia, and inhibition of exosomal release reduces spermatogonial proliferation. Together, these results show that PMCs, PFFs and Sertoli cells promote spermatogonial proliferation in co-culture, with exosomal exchange representing one possible mechanism. Further characterization of exosomal cargo may ultimately allow the development of feeder-free culture systems for clinical use.

AB  - Few studies have explored the phenotypic plasticity of nectar production on plant attractiveness to ants. Here, we investigate the role of extrafloral nectary (EFN) size on the productivity of extrafloral nectar in three sympatric legume species. We hypothesized that plant species with larger EFNs (i) have higher induced nectar secretion after herbivory events, and (ii) are more likely to interact with more protective (i.e. dominant) ant partners. We target 90 plants of three Chamaecrista species in the field. We estimated EFN size and conducted field experiments to evaluate any differences in nectar traits before and after leaf damage to investigate the phenotypic plasticity of nectar production across species. We conducted multiple censuses of ant species feeding on EFNs over time. Plant species increased nectar descriptors after leaf damage, but in different ways. Supporting our hypothesis, C. duckeana, with the largest EFN size, increased all nectar descriptors, with most intense post-herbivory-induced response, taking its place as the most attractive to ants, including dominant species. EFN size variation was an excellent indicator of nectar productivity across species. The higher control over reward production in plants with larger sized EFNs reflects an induction mechanism under damage that reduces costs and increases the potential benefits of indirect biotic defences.
   Plant species with larger extrafloral nectaries were more productive, had higher induced extrafloral nectar secretion after herbivory, and interacted more with many more protective ant species.

AB  - Tea plant is susceptible to low temperature, while the cold injury recovery mechanisms of tea leaves are still unclear. Windbreak has an effective and gradient range of protecting tea plants. Tea plants with increasing cold damage degree have varying recovery status accordingly, which are the ideal objects for investigating the cold injury recovery mechanisms of tea leaves. Here, we investigated the transcriptome and phytohormone profiles of tea leaves with different cold injury degrees in recovery (adjacent to the windbreak), and the levels of chlorophylls, malondialdehyde, major phytohormones as well as the activities of peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were also measured. The results showed the content of total chlorophylls and the activity of POD in mature tea leaves gradually decreased with the distance to windbreak, while SOD showed the opposite. The major phytohormones were highly accumulated in the moderately cold-injured tea leaves. The biosynthesis of abscisic acid (ABA) was enhanced in the moderate cold damaged tea leaves, suggesting that ABA plays an important role in the cold response and resistance of tea plants. The transcriptomic result showed that the samples in different rows were well discriminated, and the pathways of plant-pathogen interaction and flavonoid biosynthesis were enriched based on KEGG analysis. WRKY, GRAS and NAC were the top classes of transcription factors differentially expressed in the different cold-injured tea leaves. Thus, windbreak is effective to protect adjacent tea plants from cold wave, and phytohormones importantly participate in the cold injury recovery of tea leaves.

AB  - IntroductionThe leaf-chewing pest Heortia vitessoides severely threatens the growth and development of Aquilaria sinensis. In our previous study, we found that mechanical damage (MD) to stem enhanced A. sinensis sapling resistance to H. vitessoides larvae. MethodsTo reveal the defense mechanisms underlying this observation, we analyzed the types and contents of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), phytohormone contents, and expression of phytohormone-related genes in response to MD and herbivory wounding(HW). ResultsHere, we identified several VOCs, such as the pesticides fenobucarb and 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, in mature leaf (ML) of MD-treated plants. Compared with salicylic acid (SA) or the ethylene (ET) pathway, jasmonic acid (JA) content and JA-related genes were more strongly upregulated. Interestingly, we found a dramatic difference between JA-related upstream and downstream genes expression in YL and ML, which confirmed that JA-Ile accumulation in MD-ML and HW-ML could be derived from local damaged site. DiscussionTaken together, we provide evidence that the JA pathway plays a dominant role in the A. sinensis response to MD and HW.

AB  - IntroductionLow temperatures and drought are two main environmental constraints reducing the yield and geographical distribution of horticultural crops worldwide. Understanding the genetic crosstalk between stress responses has potential importance for crop improvement. MethodsIn this study, Illumina RNA-seq and Pac-Bio genome resequencing were used to annotate genes and analyze transcriptome dynamics in tea plants under long-term cold, freezing, and drought. ResultsThe highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified under long-term cold (7,896) and freezing (7,915), with 3,532 and 3,780 upregulated genes, respectively. The lowest number of DEGs was observed under 3-day drought (47) and 9-day drought (220), with five and 112 genes upregulated, respectively. The recovery after the cold had 6.5 times greater DEG numbers as compared to the drought recovery. Only 17.9% of cold-induced genes were upregulated by drought. In total, 1,492 transcription factor genes related to 57 families were identified. However, only 20 transcription factor genes were commonly upregulated by cold, freezing, and drought. Among the 232 common upregulated DEGs, most were related to signal transduction, cell wall remodeling, and lipid metabolism. Co-expression analysis and network reconstruction showed 19 genes with the highest co-expression connectivity: seven genes are related to cell wall remodeling (GATL7, UXS4, PRP-F1, 4CL, UEL-1, UDP-Arap, and TBL32), four genes are related to calcium-signaling (PXL1, Strap, CRT, and CIPK6), three genes are related to photo-perception (GIL1, CHUP1, and DnaJ11), two genes are related to hormone signaling (TTL3 and GID1C-like), two genes are involved in ROS signaling (ERO1 and CXE11), and one gene is related to the phenylpropanoid pathway (GALT6). DiscussionBased on our results, several important overlapping mechanisms of long-term stress responses include cell wall remodeling through lignin biosynthesis, o-acetylation of polysaccharides, pectin biosynthesis and branching, and xyloglucan and arabinogalactan biosynthesis. This study provides new insight into long-term stress responses in woody crops, and a set of new target candidate genes were identified for molecular breeding aimed at tolerance to abiotic stresses.

AB  - While studying aromas produced by the edible flowers of Tulbaghia violacea, we noticed a different production of (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate (a green-leaf volatile, GLV) by purple (var. 'Violacea') and white (var. 'Alba') flowers. The white Tulbaghia flowers constantly emits (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate, which is instead produced in a lower amount by the purple-flowered variety. Thus, we moved to analyze the production of (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate by whole plants of the two varieties by keeping them confined under a glass bell for 5 h together with a SPME (Solid Phase Micro Extraction) fiber. Results show that six main volatile compounds are emitted by T. violacea plants: (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, nonanal, decanal, (Z)-3-Hexenyl-alpha-methylbutyrate, and one unknown compound. By cutting at half-height of the leaves, the (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate is emitted in high quantities from both varieties, while the production of (Z)-3-Hexenyl-alpha-methylbutyrate increases. (Z)-3-Hexenyl acetate is a GLV capable of stimulating plant defenses, attracting herbivores and their natural enemies, and it is also involved in plant-to-plant communication and defense priming. Thus, T. violacea could represent a useful model for the study of GLVs production and a 'signal' plant capable of stimulating natural defenses in the neighboring plants.

AB  - Herbivore-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) enable plants to recognize herbivores and may help plants adjust their defense responses. Here, we report on herbivore-induced changes in a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) widely distributed across arthropods. PDI from the spider mite Tetranychus evansi (TePDI), a mesophyll-feeding agricultural pest worldwide, triggered immunity in multiple Solanaceae plants. TePDI-mediated cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana required the plant signaling proteins SGT1 (suppressor of the G2 allele of skp1) and HSP90 (heat shock protein 90), but was suppressed by spider mite effectors Te28 and Te84. Moreover, PDIs from phylogenetically distinct herbivorous and nonherbivorous arthropods triggered plant immunity. Finally, although PDI-induced plant defenses impaired the performance of spider mites on plants, RNAi experiments revealed that PDI genes are essential for the survival of mites and whiteflies. Our findings indicate that plants recognize evolutionarily conserved HAMPs to activate plant defense and resist pest damage, pointing to opportunities for broad-spectrum pest management.
   Plants recognize protein disulfide isomerase to activate defense responses and resist pest damage.

AB  - Pathogens and pests secrete proteins (effectors) to interfere with plant immunity through modification of host target functions and disruption of immune signalling networks. The extent of convergence between pathogen and herbivorous insect virulence strategies is largely unexplored. We found that effectors from the oomycete pathogen, Phytophthora capsici, and the major aphid pest, Myzus persicae target the host immune regulator SIZ1, an E3 SUMO ligase. We used transient expression assays in Nicotiana benthamiana as well as Arabidopsis mutants to further characterize biological role of effector-SIZ1 interactions in planta. We show that the oomycete and aphid effector, which both contribute to virulence, feature different activities towards SIZ1. While M. persicae effector Mp64 increases SIZ1 protein levels in transient assays, P. capsici effector CRN83_152 enhances SIZ1-E3 SUMO ligase activity in vivo. SIZ1 contributes to host susceptibility to aphids and an oomycete pathogen. Knockout of SIZ1 in Arabidopsis decreased susceptibility to aphids, independent of SNC1, PAD4 and EDS1. Similarly SIZ1 knockdown in N. benthamiana led to reduced P. capsici infection. Our results suggest convergence of distinct pathogen and pest virulence strategies on an E3 SUMO ligase to enhance host susceptibility.

AB  - Extracellular ATP (eATP) is now held to be a constitutive damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that is released by wounding, herbivory or pathogen attack. The concentration of eATP must be tightly regulated as either depletion or overload leads to cell death. In Arabidopsis thaliana, sensing of eATP is by two plasma membrane legume-like lectin serine-threonine receptor kinases (P2K1 and P2K2), although other receptors are postulated. The transcriptional response to eATP is dominated by wound- and defense-response genes. Wounding and pathogen attack can involve the cyclic nucleotides cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP) which, in common with eATP, can increase cytosolic-free Ca2+ as a second messenger. This perspective on DAMP signaling by eATP considers the possibility that the eATP pathway involves production of cyclic nucleotides to promote opening of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and so elevates cytosolic-free Ca2+. In silico analysis of P2K1 and P2K2 reveals putative adenylyl and guanylyl kinase sequences that are the hallmarks of "moonlighting" receptors capable of cAMP and cGMP production. Further, an Arabidopsis loss of function cngc mutant was found to have an impaired increase in cytosolic-free Ca2+ in response to eATP. A link between eATP, cyclic nucleotides, and Ca2+ signaling therefore appears credible.

AB  - The phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) plays a core role in plant defence against herbivores. When attacked by herbivores, JA and its bioactive derivatives are accumulated at the damage site, and subsequently perceived by the jasmonate co-receptors COI1 and JAZ proteins. The (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-L-isoleucine (JA-Ile) is known to be the main active JA derivative controlling vascular plant responses to herbivores as well as other JA-regulated processes. However, whether other endogenous JA-amino acid conjugates (JA-AAs) are involved in herbivore-induced defence responses remain unknown. Here, we investigated the role of herbivore-elicited JA-AAs in the crop plant rice. The levels of five JA-AAs were significantly increased under the armyworm, leaf folder and brown planthopper attack. Of the elicited JA derivatives, JA-Ile, JA-Val and JA-Leu could serve as ligands to promote the interaction between rice COI1 and JAZs, inducing OsJAZ4 degradation in vivo. JA-Val or JA-Leu treatment increased the expression of JA- and defence-related pathway genes but not JA-Ile levels, suggesting that these JA-AAs may directly function in JA signalling. Furthermore, the application of JA-Val or JA-Leu resulted in JA-mediated plant growth inhibition, while enhancing plant resistance to herbivore attack. This study uncovers that JA-Val and JA-Leu also play a role in rice defence against herbivores.

AB  - In order to select excellent blueberry cultivars suitable for substrate cultivation in China's Yangze River Valley, ten blueberry cultivars that can be cultivated in the open field were used as test materials. The changes in growth, physiological, and fruit quality indexes of the participating cultivars under substrate cultivation were investigated. The results showed that traits varied greatly among cultivars. The correlation analysis showed strong correlation between growth indicators (plant height, crown width, and stem thickness) and physiological indicators of blueberry leaves, such as SPAD, N, Chl a/Chl b, AsA, GSH, and soluble protein. Fruit weight, transverse diameter, soluble solids, total acid, solidity-acid ratio, total phenol, anthocyanin, T-AOC, AsA and GSH indexes all had highly significant positive relationships. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that 'Brightwell', 'Plolific', 'Biggold', 'Camellia' and 'Misty' ranked in the top five in terms of composite scores and performed better overall. This research can be used to guide the selection of blueberry cultivars for substrate growing in China.

AB  - Cold stress declines the quality and yield of tea, yet the molecular basis underlying cold tolerance of tea plants (Camellia sinensis) remains largely unknown. Here, we identified a circadian rhythm component LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) that potentially regulates cold tolerance of tea plants through a genome-wide association study and transcriptomic analysis. The expression of CsLUX phased with sunrise and sunset and was strongly induced by cold stress. Genetic assays indicated that CsLUX is a positive regulator of freezing tolerance in tea plants. CsLUX was directly activated by CsCBF1 and repressed the expression level of CsLOX2, which regulates the cold tolerance of tea plants through dynamically modulating jasmonic acid content. Furthermore, we showed that the CsLUX-CsJAZ1 complex attenuated the physical interaction of CsJAZ1 with CsICE1, liberating CsICE1 with transcriptional activities to withstand cold stress. Notably, a single-nucleotide variation of C-to-A in the coding region of CsLUX was functionally validated as the potential elite haplotype for cold response, which provided valuable molecular markers for future cold resistance breeding in tea plants.
   The core circadian component LUX ARRHYTHMO regulates cold tolerance of tea plants by integrating CBF pathway and jasmonic acid metabolism.

AB  - The current study was conducted to assess the impact of powdery mildew (Oidium neolycopersici) on plant-non-vector herbivore-parasitoid interactions, e.g. tomato plants, whiteflies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum) and parasitoid (Encarsia formosa). Encarsia females were significantly less attracted to powdery mildew infected tomato plants (PM) than healthy plants (Con.). Thus parasitism rates of whiteflies (WF) were significantly lower on powdery mildew (PM) plants as compared to Con. plants (17.5:41.5%). These differences disappeared when E. formosa females were forced to parasitize whiteflies on either PM or Con. The performance of the parasitoid was not significantly influenced when developing on whiteflies feeding on powdery mildew infected plants. In olfactometer bioassays, either naive or experienced parasitoids significantly preferred healthy plants colonised by whiteflies as compared to powdery mildew infected plants colonised by whitefly (PMWF) (30.0:10.0% for naive parasitoids; 41.4:15.2% for experienced parasitoids). In wind tunnel bioassays, volatiles emitting from WFs significantly increased upwind oriented flight and landing in Encarsia targets as compared to any other treatments. Volatiles from Con, PM, PMWF and WF were collected and analyzed by GC and GC-MS, revealing that both qualities and quantities of volatile compounds differed to a large extend. Plants significantly increased volatile emission after being attacked by whiteflies (275.3 mol h(-1)) or infected by powdery mildew (267.58 mol h(-1)). However, plants significantly reduced volatile emissions in PMWF co-existing systems (80.58 mol h(-1)). Our results demonstrate that volatiles released by either herbivore damaged plants, pathogen diseased plants or combinations of these agents, respectively, may influence the foraging behavior of the parasitoids while searching for their hosts, resulting in reduced efficacies of parasitoids. This, in turn, may impact the outcome of biological control systems, especially in greenhouse conditions.

AB  - TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factors TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF have been suggested to control the cell growth and proliferation in meristems and lateral organs. A total of 37 CsTCP genes were identified and divided into two classes, class I (PCF, group 1) and class II (CIN CYC/TB1, groups 2, and 3). The residues of TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF of Camellia sinensis (Tea plant) (CsTCP) proteins between class I and class II were definitely different in the loop, helix I, and helix II regions; however, eighteen conserved tandem was found in bHLH. There are a large number of CsTCP homologous gene pairs in three groups. Additionally, most CsTCP proteins have obvious differences in motif composition. The results illuminated that CsTCP proteins in different groups are supposed to have complementary functions, whereas those in the same class seem to display function redundancies. There is no relationship between the number of CsTCP gene members and genome size, and the CsTCP gene family has only expanded since the divergence of monocots and eudicots. WGD/segmental duplication played a vital role in the expansion of the CsTCP gene family in tea plant, and the CsTCP gene family has expanded a lot. Most CsTCP genes of group 1 are more widely and non-specifically expressed, and the CsTCP genes of group 2 are mainly expressed in buds, flowers, and leaves. Most genes of group 1 and some genes of group 2 were up-/downregulated in varying degrees under different stress, CsTCP genes of group 3 basically do not respond to stress. TCP genes involved in abiotic stress response mostly belong to PCF group. Some CsTCP genes may have the same function as the homologous genes in Arabidopsis, but there is functional differentiation.

AB  - Glucosinolates are antiherbivory chemical defense compounds in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Specialist herbivores that feed on brassicaceous plants have evolved various mechanisms aimed at preventing the formation of toxic isothiocyanates. In contrast, generalist herbivores typically detoxify isothiocyanates through glutathione conjugation upon exposure. Here, we examined the response of an extreme generalist herbivore, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae (Koch), to indole glucosinolates. Tetranychus urticae is a composite generalist whose individual populations have a restricted host range but have an ability to rapidly adapt to initially unfavorable plant hosts. Through comparative transcriptomic analysis of mite populations that have differential susceptibilities to Arabidopsis defenses, we identified beta-cyanoalanine synthase of T. urticae (TuCAS), which encodes an enzyme with dual cysteine and beta-cyanoalanine synthase activities. We combined Arabidopsis genetics, chemical complementation and mite reverse genetics to show that TuCAS is required for mite adaptation to Arabidopsis through its beta-cyanoalanine synthase activity. Consistent with the beta-cyanoalanine synthase role in detoxification of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), we discovered that upon mite herbivory, Arabidopsis plants release HCN. We further demonstrated that indole glucosinolates are sufficient for cyanide formation. Overall, our study uncovered Arabidopsis defenses that rely on indole glucosinolate-dependent cyanide for protection against mite herbivory. In response, Arabidopsis-adapted mites utilize the beta-cyanoalanine synthase activity of TuCAS to counter cyanide toxicity, highlighting the mite's ability to activate resistant traits that enable this extreme polyphagous herbivore to exploit cyanogenic host plants.
   Indole glucosinolate-dependent cyanides deter mite herbivory on Arabidopsis plants; in response, mites utilize beta-cyanoalanine synthase activity to counter cyanide toxicity.

AB  - Background: Pesticide residue and its poor utilization remains problematic in agricultural development. To address the issue, a nano-pesticide has been developed by incorporating pesticide acetamiprid in porous silica nanoparticles.
   Results: This nano-pesticide had an acetamiprid loading content of 354.01 mg g(-1). Testing LC50 value against tea aphids of the commercial preparation was three times that of the nano-pesticide. In tea seedlings (Camellia sinensis L.), acetamiprid was transported upward from the stem to the young leaves. On day 30, the average retained concentrations in tea leaves treated with the commercial preparation were about 1.3 times of that in the nano-pesticide preparation. The residual concentrations of dimethyl-acetamiprid in leaves for plants treated with the commercial preparation were about 1.1 times of that in the nano-pesticide preparation. Untargeted metabolomics of by LC-MS on the young leaves of tea seedlings under nano-pesticide and commercial pesticide treatments showed significant numbers of differentially expressed metabolites (P < 0.05 and VIP > 1). Between the nano-pesticide treatment group and the commercial preparation treatment group there were 196 differentially expressed metabolites 2 h after treatment, 200 (7th day), 207 (21st day), and 201 (30th day) in negative ion mode, and 294 (2nd h), 356 (7th day), and 286 (30th day) in positive ion mode. Preliminary identification showed that the major differentially expressed metabolites were glutamic acid, salicylic acid, p-coumaric acid, ribonic acid, glutamine, naringenin diglucoside, sanguiin H4, PG (34:2) and epiafzelechin.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrated that our nano-pesticide outperformed the conventional pesticide acetamiprid in terms of insecticidal activity and pesticide residue, and the absorption, transportation and metabolism of nano-pesticide in tea plant were different, which pave a new pathway for pest control in agricultural sector.

AB  - The natural resistant-associated macrophage protein (NRAMP) is a kind of integral membrane transporter which could function on a wide range of divalent metal ions in plants. Little is known about the NRAMP family in Camellia sinensis. In this study, 11 NRAMP genes were identified from the tea plant genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 11 CsNRAMP proteins were split into two groups. The proteins of group 1 contained the conserved motif 6 (GQSSTxTG), while most proteins in group 2 (excepting CsNRAMP7 and CsNRAMP10) contained the conserved residues of motif 6 and motif 2 (GQFIMxGFLxLxxKKW). The number of amino acids in coding regions of 11 CsNRAMP genes ranged from 279-1373, and they contained 3-12 transmembrane domains. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that G1 genes, CsNRAMP3, CsNRAMP4, and CsNRAMP5, were extraordinarily expressed in roots, while G2 genes showed higher expression levels in the stems and leaves. The expression levels of CsNRAMPs in roots and leaves were detected to assess their responses to Pb treatment. The results indicated that CsNRAMPs were differentially regulated, and they might play a role in Pb transportation of tea plant. Subcellular localization assay demonstrated that CsNRAMP2 and CsNRAMP5 fused proteins were localized in the plasma membrane. Overall, this systematic analysis of the CsNRAMP family could provide primary information for further studies on the functional roles of CsNRAMPs in divalent metal transportation in tea plants.

AB  - Purpose This study analysed the longitudinal associations of physical fitness and affect with depression, anxiety and life satisfaction at 2- and 5-year follow-up. Methods In 312 adult women with fibromyalgia, physical fitness was measured by performance-based tests and affect, depression, anxiety and life satisfaction were self-reported using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Beck Depression Inventory-second edition (BDI-II), State Trait Anxiety Inventory-I (STAI) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), respectively. We conducted sequential linear regression analyses adjusted for baseline levels of depression, anxiety, life satisfaction, age, body fat percentage and education. Results At the 2-year follow-up, all the associations under study were significant. At the 5-year follow-up, a number of associations remained significant. First, lowering negative affect was independently associated with lower depression, anxiety and higher life satisfaction (beta's from 0.14 to 0.31). Second, favourable changes in positive affect were independently associated with lower anxiety (beta = 0.21) and higher life satisfaction (beta = 0.28). Third, enhancing physical fitness was related to higher life satisfaction (beta = 0.16). Conclusion Reductions in negative affect were associated with more favourable depression, anxiety and life satisfaction at the 2- and 5-year follow-up. Improvements in positive affect were associated with more favourable anxiety and life satisfaction and enhancements in physical fitness were associated with higher life satisfaction. If corroborated in clinical-experimental research, these findings may guide the development of interventions that are tailored to the levels of physical fitness, affect and the outcome of interest (i.e. depression, anxiety or life satisfaction) in women with fibromyalgia.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke and poses a major global health challenge due to its high mortality and lasting disability impact. The onset and progression of ischemic stroke are largely linked to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. Alpinetin, a natural flavonoid found in the ginger family, exhibits various pharmacological properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, the neuroprotective potential of alpinetin in attenuating oxidative stress and inflammation against cerebral ischemic stroke was evaluated. Ninety male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to the sham operation group, the Rt.MCAO group, the Rt.MCAO+piracetam group, and the Rt.MCAO+alpinetin groups (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg BW). Cerebral infarction size, neuronal density, and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were measured. Three days of treatment with alpinetin markedly reduced the infarct volume by 30% compared to the Rt.MCAO+vehicle-treated group. Additionally, rats treated with alpinetin exhibited a significant increase in neuronal density in the cortex, as well as in the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. Furthermore, treatment with alpinetin ameliorated both the Rt.MCAO-induced increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) activity and the Rt.MCAO-induced decrease in catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, COX-2 and IL-6 protein levels were assessed using western blotting. The results showed that treatment with alpinetin (100 mg/kg BW) significantly reduced the expression levels of COX-2 and IL-6 in both the cortex and hippocampus. Our findings suggest that alpinetin significantly mitigates the effects of cerebral ischemia-induced brain damage through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and could potentially be developed as a therapeutic agent for stroke treatment.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a globally important cash crop, with a variety of kinds depending on colors and constituents. Temperatures influence leaf color and secondary metabolite accumulation in tea plants and thus it is worth investigating global metabolic and transcriptomic changes in different tea cultivars under different temperature regimes. In this study, the dynamic changes in key genes and secondary metabolites were analyzed in the purple-leaf tea cultivar 'Zijuan' (ZJ) and the green-leaf cultivar 'Longjing 43' (LJ) under four temperature conditions (15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C), employing RNA-sequencing and targeted metabolomics (UPLC-GC/ MS). Results showed that anthocyanin content in ZJ was significantly higher at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C than at 25 degrees C and 35 degrees C, suggesting that low temperatures strongly enhance anthocyanin synthesis. In contrast, LJ exhibited greater catechin accumulation at lower temperatures, especially at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees C, where the relative content of key compounds was significantly higher than at 25 degrees C. Low temperatures enhanced the expression of ANTHOCYANIDIN SYNTHASE (ANS) in ZJ while inhibiting the expression of ANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE (ANR) and LEUCOANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE (LAR). Nonetheless, all three genes were suppressed by high temperatures in ZJ. In LJ, the expression of ANS, ANR, and LAR showed similar trends under both low and high temperatures, suggesting that the metabolic responses to temperature changes are more consistent in LJ. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified key transcription factors that are significantly positively correlated with catechin and anthocyanin accumulation, including bHLH (CSS0002807), NAC (CSS0035736), AP2/ERF (CSS0000647), MYB (CSS0000220), MYB (CSS0002706), and WRKY (CSS0024910). Overall, this study provides novel insights into the secondary metabolite response mechanisms of tea plants under different temperatures and offers theoretical support for the breeding and selection of new tea cultivars.

AB  - Cold and drought stress are the most critical stresses encountered by crops and occur simultaneously under field conditions. However, it is unclear whether volatiles contribute to both cold and drought tolerance, and if so, by what mechanisms they act. Here, we show that airborne eugenol can be taken up by the tea (Camellia sinensis) plant and metabolized into glycosides, thus enhancing cold and drought tolerance of tea plants. A uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucosyltransferase, UGT71A59, was discovered, whose expression is strongly induced by multiple abiotic stresses. UGT71A59 specifically catalyzes glucosylation of eugenol glucoside in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of UGT71A59 expression in tea reduced the accumulation of eugenol glucoside, lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging capacity, and ultimately impaired cold and drought stress tolerance. Exposure to airborne eugenol triggered a marked increase in UGT71A59 expression, eugenol glucoside accumulation, and cold tolerance by modulating ROS accumulation and CBF1 expression. It also promoted drought tolerance by altering abscisic acid homeostasis and stomatal closure. CBF1 and CBF3 play positive roles in eugenol-induced cold tolerance and CBF2 may be a negative regulator of eugenol-induced cold tolerance in tea plants. These results provide evidence that eugenol functions as a signal in cold and drought tolerance regulation and shed new light on the biological functions of volatiles in the response to multiple abiotic stresses in plants.

AB  - Adventitious root (AR) formation is essential for the successful propagation of Camellia sinensis. Endogenous phytohormones play an important role in this process, which is strongly dependent on genotype. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this varietal difference is not clearly understood. Here, we combined metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of new shoots and mature leaves among three cultivars with different rooting abilities and then performed WGCNA to mine key regulators during AR formation. Hormone analysis showed that the easy-to-root cultivar BHZ had a higher indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid, abscisic acid, and jasmonic acids content in new shoots than the other cultivars. A crosstalk regulatory network including 14 coexpression modules was successfully constructed. Among them, a key module which had a highly positive correlation with IAA was identified. The KEGG analysis showed that related genes were enriched in "Plant hormone signal transduction". Finally, the auxin influx carrier AUX1/LAX family was considered a hub gene in AR formation. Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of CsLAXs was higher in BHZ than other cultivars, and response to different abiotic stresses.

AB  - Vitellogenin (Vg) is a well-known nutritious protein involved in reproduction in nearly all oviparous animals, including insects. Recently, Vg has been detected in saliva proteomes of several piercing-sucking herbivorous arthropods, including the small brown planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus, SBPH). Its function, however, remains unexplored. We investigated the molecular mechanism underlying SBPH orally secreted Vg-mediated manipulation of plant-insect interaction by RNA interference, phytohormone and H2O2 profiling, protein-protein interaction studies and herbivore bioassays. A C-terminal polypeptide of Vg (VgC) in SBPH, when secreted into rice plants, acted as a novel effector to attenuate host rice defenses, which in turn improved insect feeding performance. Silencing Vg reduced insect feeding and survival on rice. Vg-silenced SBPH nymphs consistently elicited higher H2O2 production, a well-established defense mechanism in rice, whereas expression of VgC in planta significantly hindered hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) accumulation and promoted insect performance. VgC interacted directly with the rice transcription factor OsWRKY71, a protein which is involved in induction of H2O2 accumulation and plant resistance to SBPH. These findings indicate a novel effector function of Vg: when secreted into host rice plants, this protein effectively weakened H2O2-mediated plant defense through its association with a plant immunity regulator.

AB  - Introduction Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are products of plant secondary metabolism with the potential for signalling early stress response. This pilot study investigated the potential of VOCs as markers for drought stress in potato. We hypothesised that differences in VOC emissions between cultivars may reflect genotypes with greater adaptive efficiency to drought stress.Methods Using thermal desorption collection and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques, we profiled the VOCs emitted by two potato cultivars, Maris Piper and D & eacute;sir & eacute;e, under well-watered and drought conditions, across a four-week period (n = 3 per cultivar, treatment, and time-point).Results We identified 23 compounds, and tentatively identified another 49 compounds, including sesquiterpenes, alkanes, monoterpenes, and methylbenzenes. Statistical analysis revealed that seven compounds showed significant differences between cultivars and drought/well-watered treatments. Two farnesene isomers, a xylene isomer, 2,6-dimethyldecane, decahydronaphthalene, and 2-methyldecalin were identified as tentative markers of drought stress.Discussion Our findings suggest that VOCs could be used for detection of drought stress in potato plants, contributing to improved irrigation management and the breeding of more drought-tolerant varieties. Further research is needed to validate these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - The whitefly Bemisia tabaci is a piercing-sucking herbivore that reduces the yields of crops both by feeding on plants and transmitting plant viruses. Like most plant feeders, B. tabaci has evolved ways to avoid plant defence responses. For example, B. tabaci is known to secrete salivary effectors to suppress host defences. However, the nature of B. tabaci effectors is not completely understood. In this study, we used B. tabaci genomic and salivary gland transcriptomic data and an overexpression system to identify a previously unknown B. tabaci salivary effector, BtE3. BtE3 is specifically expressed in the head (containing primary salivary glands) and is secreted into hosts during B. tabaci feeding. In planta overexpression of BtE3 blocked Burkholderia glumae-induced hypersensitive response (HR) in both Nicotiana benthamiana and Solanum lycopersicum. Silencing of BtE3 by plant-mediated RNAi prevented B. tabaci from continuously ingesting phloem sap, and reduced B. tabaci survival and fecundity. Moreover, overexpression of BtE3 in planta up-regulated the salicylic acid- (SA-) signalling pathway, but suppressed the downstream jasmonic acid- (JA-) mediated defences. Taken together, these results indicate that BtE3 is a B. tabaci-specific novel effector involved in B. tabaci-plant interactions. These findings increase our understanding of B. tabaci effectors and suggest novel strategies for B. tabaci pest management.
   A novel whitefly salivary effector, BtE3, interferes with plant hormone pathways and improves whitefly performance on host plants.

AB  - Gray blight (GB) is one of the most destructive diseases of tea plants, causing considerable damage and productivity losses; however, the dynamic roles of defense genes during pathogen infection remain largely unclear. To explore the numerous molecular interactions associated with GB stress in tea plants, we employed transcriptome, sRNAome and degradome sequencing from 1 to 13 days post-inoculation (dpi) at 3-day intervals. The transcriptomics results showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to flavonoid synthesis, such as chalcone synthase (CHS) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), were particularly induced at 4 dpi. Consistent with this, the contents of catechins (especially gallocatechin), which are the dominant flavonoids in tea plants, also increased in the leaves of tea plants infected with GB. Combined analysis of the sRNAome and degradome revealed that microRNAs could mediate tea plant immunity by regulating DEG expression at the post-transcriptional level. Co-expression network analysis demonstrated that miR530b-ethylene responsive factor 96 (ERF96) and miRn211-thaumatin-like protein (TLP) play crucial roles in the response to GB. Accordingly, gene-specific antisense oligonucleotide assays suggested that suppressing ERF96 decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas suppressing TLP increased the levels of ROS. Furthermore, ERF96 was induced, but TLP was suppressed, in susceptible tea cultivars. Our results collectively demonstrate that ERF96 is a negative regulator and TLP is a positive regulator in the response of tea plants to GB. Taken together, our comprehensive integrated analysis reveals a dynamic regulatory network linked to GB stress in tea plants and provides candidate genes for improvement of tea plants.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, activity of vasculature-specific Clade 3 glutamate receptor-like (GLR) channels is required for the transmission of electrical signals and cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+](cyt)) waves from wounded leaves to distal tissues, triggering activation of oxylipin-dependent defences. center dot Whether nonvascular plants mount systemic responses upon wounding remains unknown. To explore the evolution of systemic defence responses, we investigated electrical and calcium signalling in the nonvascular plant Marchantia polymorpha.<br /> center dot We found that electrical signals and [Ca2+](cyt) waves are generated in response to mechanical wounding and propagated to nondamaged distal tissues in M. polymorpha. Functional analysis of MpGLR, the only GLR encoded in the genome of M. polymorpha, indicates that its activity is necessary for the systemic transmission of wound-induced electrical signals and [Ca2+](cyt) waves, similar to vascular plants. However, spread of these signals is neither coupled to systemic accumulation of oxylipins nor to a transcriptional defence response in the distal tissues of wounded M. polymorpha plants.<br /> center dot Our results suggest that lack of vasculature prevents translocation of additional signalling factors that, together with electrical signals and [Ca2+](cyt) waves, contribute to systemic activation of defences in tracheophytes.

AB  - The jasmonates (JA) play key roles in defending mechanical wounding, herbivore attack and various stresses in plants. Lipoxygenase (LOX) is one of the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of JA which also catalyzes the green leafy volatiles synthesis at the first step. Wounding and herbivore attack can induce the expression of LOXs. To investigate the molecular mechanism regulating the LOX genes in tobacco, we isolated and identified the LOX3 gene promoter from Nicotiana tabacum. Analysis from transgenic plants and GUS activity fluorimetric assay revealed that 1847bp of NtLOX3 promoter sequence was sufficient for wounding and methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA) induction. For wounding and MeJA induction, the deletion analysis identified the minimal effective regions which were located in -546bp to -199bp. And this region contained the cis-acting elements of CATG-box (CATG), W-box (C/TTGACY) and a T/G-box (AACGTG), which were thought to play a key role in wounding and MeJA elicitation. These results may provide information for further transcriptional regulation studies of LOX genes.

AB  - Key messageOsSPL10 is a negative regulator of rice defense against BPH, knockout of OsSPL10 enhances BPH resistance through upregulation of defense-related genes and accumulation of secondary metabolites.Abstract Rice (Oryza sativa L.), one of the most important staple foods worldwide, is frequently attacked by various herbivores, including brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens). BPH is a typical monophagous, phloem-sucking herbivore that has been a substantial threat to rice production and global food security. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of defense responses to BPH is essential for improving BPH resistance in rice. In this study, a SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 10 (OsSPL10) transcription factor was found to play a negative role in the defenses of rice against BPH. To gain insights into the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of OsSPL10, we performed combined analyses of transcriptome and metabolome, and revealed that knockout of OsSPL10 gene improved rice resistance against BPH by enhancing the direct and indirect defenses. Genes involved in plant hormone signal transduction, MAPK signaling pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and plant-pathogen interaction pathway were significantly upregulated in spl10 mutant. Moreover, spl10 mutant exhibited increased accumulation of defense-related secondary metabolites in the phenylpropanoid and terpenoid pathways. Our findings reveal a novel role for OsSPL10 gene in regulating the rice defense responses, which can be used as a potential target for genetic improvement of BPH resistance in rice.

AB  - Cold and drought stresses severely limit crop production and can occur simultaneously. Although some transcription factors and hormones have been characterized in plants subjected each stress, the role of metabolites, especially volatiles, in response to cold and drought stress exposure is rarely studied due to lack of suitable models. Here, we established a model for studying the role of volatiles in tea (Camellia sinensis) plants experiencing cold and drought stresses simultaneously. Using this model, we showed that volatiles induced by cold stress promote drought tolerance in tea plants by mediating reactive oxygen species and stomatal conductance. Needle trap microextraction combined with GC-MS identified the volatiles involved in the crosstalk and showed that cold-induced (Z)-3-hexenol improved the drought tolerance of tea plants. In addition, silencing C. sinensis alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (CsADH2) led to reduced (Z)-3-hexenol production and significantly reduced drought tolerance in response to simultaneous cold and drought stress. Transcriptome and metabolite analyses, together with plant hormone comparison and abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis pathway inhibition experiments, further confirmed the roles of ABA in (Z)-3-hexenol-induced drought tolerance of tea plants. (Z)-3-Hexenol application and gene silencing results supported the hypothesis that (Z)-3-hexenol plays a role in the integration of cold and drought tolerance by stimulating the dual-function glucosyltransferase UGT85A53, thereby altering ABA homeostasis in tea plants. Overall, we present a model for studying the roles of metabolites in plants under multiple stresses and reveal the roles of volatiles in integrating cold and drought stresses in plants.

AB  - Botanical insecticides are promising pest control agents. This research investigated the novel pesticidal efficacy of Araucaria heterophylla and Commiphora molmol extracts against four ectoparasites through treated envelopes. Seven days post-treatment (PT) with 25 mg/mL of C. molmol and A. heterophylla, complete mortality of the camel tick, Hyalomma dromedarii and cattle tick, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus were reached. Against H. dromedarii, the median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of the methanol extracts were 1.13 and 1.04 mg/mL and those of the hexane extracts were 1.47 and 1.38 mg/mL, respectively. The LC50 values of methanol and hexane extracts against R. annulatus were 1.09 and 1.41 plus 1.55 and 1.08 mg/ mL, respectively. Seven days PT with 12.5 mg/mL, extracts completely controlled Haematopinus eurysternus and Hippobosca maculata; LC50 of Ha. eurysternus were 0.56 and 0.62 mg/mL for methanol extracts and 0.55 and 1.00 mg/mL for hexane extracts, respectively, whereas those of Hi. maculata were 0.67 and 0.78 mg/ mL for methanol extract and 0.68 and 0.32 mg/mL, respectively, for hexane extracts. C. molmol extracts contained sesquiterpene, fatty acid esters and phenols, whereas those of A. heterophylla possessed monoterpene, sesquiterpene, terpene alcohols, fatty acid, and phenols. Consequently, methanol extracts of C. molmol and A. heterophylla were recommended as ecofriendly pesticides.

AB  - Background Plant metabolites play vital roles in regulating the behavior of herbivore insects. Virus infection can universally alter plant metabolites to manipulate the orientation and feeding behaviors of insect vector, to favor the transmission of virus. Thus, determining the differentially accumulated metabolites of plant upon virus infection could provide insights into understanding how the triple interactions among plant, virus and insect vector happens. Our previous studies have found that vector whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius, Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) showed different orientation behavior and performance on CCYV-infected and healthy cucumber plants. Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) is exclusively transmitted by B. tabaci in a semi-persistent mode. In this study, we take the CCYV, B. tabaci and cucumber as a research system to explore the functions of phyto-metabolites in the triple interactions. Results A total of 612 metabolites changed upon CCYV infection were monitored. Metabolites mainly enriched in flavonoids, lipids, nucleotides and their derivatives. At 7 days post CCYV inoculation (dpi), the contents of lipids, terpenoids and flavonoids remarkably decreased, while amino acids, nucleotides and their derivatives notably up-accumulated. At 15 dpi, the accumulation of flavonoids were still significantly reduced upon CCYV infection, while lipids, amino acids, nucleotides and derivatives were remarkably enhanced. Most of significantly increased metabolites were lipids (lysophosphatidylethanolamine, LPE; lysophosphatidylcholine, LPC and their isomers). Also, the number of significantly changed metabolites increased with the infection period. However, only a few organic acids and phenolic acids showed difference between CCYV-infected and healthy cucumber plants. Conclusions CCYV infection repressed the defensive flavonoids, terpeneoids metabolism but triggered the lipids, amino acids and nucleotides metabolism with the inoculation period. This result suggests that CCYV-infection makes cucumber plants more susceptible for whiteflies attack and CCYV infection. The reduction of defensive comounds and the increase of amino acids may be partially responsible for enhancing feeding preference of whiteflies to CCYV-infected hosts. CCYV may hijacked lipid metabolism for virus replication and assembly.

AB  - In briefFerroptosis and mitochondrial hyperpolarization, both linked to oxidative stress, critically compromise embryo development during in vitro culture. This study demonstrates that GRK5 inhibition induces ferroptosis and mitochondrial hyperpolarization, leading to impaired developmental capacity in porcine embryos.AbstractG-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) regulates cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. This study explored the effects of double-stranded RNA microinjection and inhibitor treatment (5 and 10 mu M) to suppress GRK5 expression on porcine embryo development. GRK5 inhibition impaired blastocyst development and quality, elevated p53 expression, and induced ferroptosis by reducing solute carrier family 7 member 11 and glutathione peroxidase 4. It also promoted apoptosis by downregulating B-cell lymphoma extra-large and upregulating Bcl-2 associated X. Moreover, GRK5 inhibition enhanced glutaminolysis, leading to increased adenosine triphosphate levels, mitochondrial membrane potential, and superoxide accumulation. Collectively, GRK5 inhibition increased p53 expression, induced apoptosis and ferroptosis, and promoted glutaminolysis, leading to mitochondrial hyperpolarization and impaired developmental capacity of porcine embryos.

AB  - Simple Summary Recognition is crucial for many aspects of an animal's life and directly affects its fitness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether greater horseshoe bats can recognize a conspecific's sex and individual identity from its echolocation call alone. Through playback experiments, we demonstrated that greater horseshoe bats can recognize the sex and individual identity of conspecifics from their echolocation calls, which indicates that the echolocation calls of greater horseshoe bats may have potential communication functions. The results of this study improve our understanding of the communication function of the echolocation calls of bats. The echolocation calls of bats are mainly used for navigation and foraging; however, they may also contain social information about the emitter and facilitate social interactions. In this study, we recorded the echolocation calls of greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) and analyzed the acoustic parameter differences between the sexes and among individuals. Then, we performed habituation-discrimination playback experiments to test whether greater horseshoe bats could recognize the sex and individual identity of conspecifics from their echolocation calls. The results showed that there were significant differences in the echolocation call parameters between sexes and among individuals. When we switched playback files from a habituated stimuli to a dishabituated stimuli, the tested bats exhibited obvious behavioral responses, including nodding, ear or body movement, and echolocation emission. The results showed that R. ferrumequinum can recognize the sex and individual identity of conspecifics from their echolocation calls alone, which indicates that the echolocation calls of R. ferrumequinum may have potential communication functions. The results of this study improve our understanding of the communication function of the echolocation calls of bats.

AB  - Isolated sulfite oxidase (ISOD) and molybdenum cofactor (MoCD) deficiencies are genetic diseases biochemically characterized by the toxic accumulation of sulfite in the tissues of patients, including the brain. Neurological dysfunction and brain abnormalities are commonly observed soon after birth, and some patients also have neuropathological alterations in the prenatal period (in utero). Thus, we investigated the effects of sulfite on redox and mitochondrial homeostasis, as well as signaling proteins in the cerebral cortex of rat pups. One-day-old Wistar rats received an intracerebroventricular administration of sulfite (0.5 mu mol/g) or vehicle and were euthanized 30 min after injection. Sulfite administration decreased glutathione levels and glutathione S-transferase activity, and increased heme oxygenase-1 content in vivo in the cerebral cortex. Sulfite also reduced the activities of succinate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, and respiratory chain complexes II and II-III. Furthermore, sulfite increased the cortical content of ERK1/2 and p38. These findings suggest that redox imbalance and bioenergetic impairment induced by sulfite in the brain are pathomechanisms that may contribute to the neuropathology of newborns with ISOD and MoCD.

AB  - Background: Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the most lethal breast cancer subtypes. Due to a lack of effective therapeutic targets, chemotherapy is still the main medical treatment for TNBC patients. Thus, it is important and necessary to find new therapeutic targets for TNBC. Recent genomic studies implicated the Hippo / Yap signal is over activated in TNBC, manifesting it plays a key role in TNBC carcinogenesis and cancer progression. RBCK1 was firstly identified as an important component for linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC) and facilitates NFKB signaling in immune response. Further studies showed RBCK1 also facilitated luminal type breast cancer growth and endocrine resistance via trans-activation estrogen receptor alpha.
   Methods: RBCK1 and YAP protein expression levels were measured by western blotting, while the mRNA levels of YAP target genes were measured by RT-PCR. RNA sequencing data were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Identification of Hippo signaling activity was accomplished with luciferase assays, RT-PCR and western blotting. Protein stability assays and ubiquitin assays were used to detect YAP protein degradation. Ubiquitin-based immuno-precipitation assays were used to detect the specific ubiquitination modification on the YAP protein.
   Results: In our current study, our data revealed an opposite function for RBCK1 in TNBC progression. RBCK1 overexpression inhibited TNBC cell progression in vitro and in vivo, while RBCK1 depletion promoted TNBC cell invasion. The whole genomic expression profiling showed that RBCK1 depletion activated Hippo/YAP axis. RBCK1 depletion increased YAP protein level and Hippo target gene expression in TNBC. The molecular biology studies confirmed that RBCK1 could bind to YAP protein and enhance the stability of YAP protein by promoting YAP K48-linked poly-ubiquitination at several YAP lysine sites (K76, K204 and K321).
   Conclusion: Our study revealed the multi-faced RBCK1 function in different subtypes of breast cancer patients and a promising therapeutic target for TNBC treatment.

AB  - Pork is an essential source of protein in Taiwan and many other countries globally, and to meet increasing demand, maintaining the weaning rate of piglets is essential. Newborn piglets are relatively fragile and require more attention; however, manual observation is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This study aimed to develop an automated approach to recognize the lactating frequencies of sows, localize piglets, track individual piglets, and quantify their movements in videos. Embedded systems integrated with cameras were developed to capture bird's-eye-view videos of sows and piglets in a farrowing house, which were then transmitted to a cloud server and converted to images. A combination of EfficientNet and long short-term memory (LSTM) was trained to recognize the lactation behavior from the videos, and a refined rotation RetinaNet (R(3)Det) model was trained to localize the piglets. Subsequently, the simple online and real-time tracking (SORT) algorithm was applied to track individual piglets and quantify their movements. The combination of EfficientNet and LSTM achieved an overall accuracy of 97.67% in lactation behavior recognition within a test time of 7.7 ms per 1-min video by using a GPU. The trained R(3)Det model achieved an overall mean average precision of 87.90%, precision of 93.52%, recall of 88.52%, and processing speed of 10.2 fps using a GPU. The piglet tracking using SORT achieved an overall multiple object tracking accuracy of 97.35%, multiple object tracking precision of 96.97%, IDF1 of 98.30%, and processing speed of 171.6 fps using a CPU. Thus, the feasibility of the proposed approaches to be used in typical pig farms was proven.

AB  - The main symptoms of schizophrenia are categorized as positive, negative, and cognitive. Cognitive impairments do not generally respond to antipsychotics. Cariprazine is a novel antipsychotic conceived with the idea that high affinity for D3 receptors may elicit a favorable response in the management of cognitive deficits. We evaluated the pro-cognitive properties of 14-day long pre-treatment with cariprazine (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg b.w. intraperitoneally) in experimental rodent models with scopolamine-induced memory impairment employing novel object recognition test (NORT), T-maze, Y-maze, and passive avoidance tasks (step-through and step-down). Statistical analysis was performed with One Way ANOVA. In NORT cariprazine increased the recognition index. In T-maze and Y-maze cariprazine increased the working memory index as well as the percentage of spontaneous alternation. Cariprazine improved learning and memory in both short-term and long-term memory retention tests in step-down and step-through tasks. Cariprazine improves learning, recognition, and spatial memory in rats with scopolamine-induced memory impairment. Cariprazine's beneficial effect on cognition is likely due to its affinity for D3 receptors, as well as agonism at 5-HT1A receptors. Most probably, the cognitive-enhancing properties of cariprazine are the result of integrated modulation in the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex.

AB  - The production of organic meat and dairy products relies on limited organic protein meal supplies. Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) may sustainably increase organic protein meal supplies. Using grain production trial data, research literature, and camelina feeding trial results, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and fossil energy impacts were modeled for inclusion of 10% camelina meal in swine finishing diets using life cycle analysis (LCA). Two key grain production scenarios were examined: field trial relay (FTR) camelina and a higher yielding as expected relay (AER) camelina, with a baseline monocrop soybean (MCS). At the grain production stage, the FTR, AER, and MCS scenarios emitted 0.65, 0.43, and 0.13 kg of CO2 eq./kg DM grain harvested, respectively. At the meal production stage, 0.61, 0.40, and 0.15 kg of CO2 eq. were emitted per kg of protein meal from the FTR, AER, and MCS scenarios, respectively. GHG emissions from the finishing phase of pork production were 1.43, 1.38, and 1.31 kg CO2 eq./kg live weight pigs produced for the FTR, AER, and MCS scenarios, respectively. Findings were similar for fossil energy use. The higher environmental burdens from camelina grain production due to reduced yields of both camelina and soybean resulted in negative environmental performance in camelina-amended diets.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway plays a critical role in cardiovascular development and stem cell differentiation. Using microarray profiling, we found that the Hippo pathway components vestigial-like family member 4 (VGLL4) and TEA domain transcription factor 1 (TEAD1) were upregulated during vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from H1 ESCs (H1 embryonic stem cells). To further explore the role and molecular mechanisms of VGLL4 in regulating VSMC differentiation, we generated a VGLL4-knockdown H1 ESC line (heterozygous knockout) using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and found that VGLL4 knockdown inhibited VSMC specification. In contrast, overexpression of VGLL4 using the PiggyBac transposon system facilitated VSMC differentiation. We confirmed that this effect was mediated via TEAD1 and VGLL4 interaction. In addition, bioinformatics analysis revealed that Ten-eleven-translocation 2 (TET2), a DNA dioxygenase, is a target of TEAD1, and a luciferase assay further verified that TET2 is the target of the VGLL4-TEAD1 complex. Indeed, TET2 overexpression promoted VSMC marker gene expression and countered the VGLL4 knockdown-mediated inhibitory effects on VSMC differentiation. In summary, we revealed a novel role of VGLL4 in promoting VSMC differentiation from hESCs and identified TET2 as a new target of the VGLL4-TEAD1 complex, which may demethylate VSMC marker genes and facilitate VSMC differentiation. This study provides new insights into the VGLL4-TEAD1-TET2 axis in VSMC differentiation and vascular development.

AB  - There is an association between noise exposure and cognitive impairment, and noise may have a more severe impact on patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment; however, the mechanisms need further investigation. This study used the classic AD animal model APP/PS1 mice to simulate the AD population, and C57BL/6J mice to simulate the normal population. We compared their cognitive abilities after noise exposure, analyzed changes in Cluster of Differentiation (CD) between the two types of mice using transcriptomics, identified the differential CD molecule: CD36 in APP/PS1 after noise exposure, and used its pharmacological inhibitor to intervene to explore the mechanism by which CD36 affects APP/PS1 cognitive abilities. Our study shows that noise exposure has a more severe impact on the cognitive abilities of APP/PS1 mice, and that the expression trends of differentiation cluster molecules differ significantly between C57BL/6J and APP/ PS1 mice. Transcriptomic analysis showed that the expression of CD36 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice increased by 2.45-fold after noise exposure (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, Western Blot results from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex indicated that CD36 protein levels increased by approximately 1.5-fold (p < 0.001) and 1.3-fold (p <0.05) respectively, after noise exposure in APP/PS1 mice. The changes in CD36 expression elevated oxidative stress levels in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, leading to a decrease in PI3K/AKT phosphorylation, which in turn increased M1-type microglia and A1-type astrocytes while reducing the numbers of M2-type microglia and A2-type astrocytes. This increased neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, causing synaptic and neuronal damage in APP/PS1 mice, ultimately exacerbating cognitive impairment. These findings may provide new insights into the relationship between noise exposure and cognitive impairment, especially given the different expression trends of CD molecules in the two types of mice, which warrants further research.

AB  - The myelocytomatosis (MYC) transcription factors are crucial regulators of plant growth, development, and stress responses. In this study, we identified and characterized the CoMYC gene from Camellia oleifera Abel. and investigated its functional roles through heterologous expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the 31 CoMYC genes are unevenly distributed across chromosomes, with CoMYC clustered in phylogenetic Group 6 and CoMYC2-like showing high homology to CsMYC5.4 from tea plants. Conserved motif and promoter analyses indicated that CoMYC contains hormone- and stress-responsive cis-elements, suggesting its involvement in developmental and environmental adaptation processes. Subcellular localization confirmed the nuclear targeting of CoMYC2-like, with tissue-specific expression peaks in roots and stems. Overexpression of CoMYC2-like in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in enhanced lignification, thicker stems, elongated siliques, and increased seed number, accompanied by elevated lignin content and xylem development. Under drought and salt stresses, transgenic lines exhibited reduced root growth inhibition, lower superoxide anion and MDA (malondialdehyde) accumulation, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (CAT (catalase), POD (peroxidase), SOD (superoxide dismutase)), the proline content was increased, the expression of antioxidant-related genes was increased, indicating improved stress tolerance. Notably, CoMYC2-like-overexpressing plants showed greater sensitivity to salt than drought, highlighting its differential regulatory roles in stress adaptation. Our findings demonstrate that CoMYC2-like modulates lignin biosynthesis and stress resilience, providing insights into MYCmediated mechanisms in woody plants and potential targets for crop improvement.

AB  - Anthracnose is one of the most destructive diseases and is widely prevalent in world. Due to the limited understanding of the resistance mechanisms, the insufficient of tea anthracnose control cause yield and quality losses. This study established a lesion coefficient calculation model using ImageJ software and identified a resistant variety (Camellia. sinensis var. laochashan) and a susceptible variety (Camellia. sinensis var. zhe-nong402). Using time-resolved dual RNA-seq technology, the differential expression genes (DEGs) of two tea varieties and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides during the infection period (0 h, 12 h, 30 h, 72 h, and 120 h) were figured. Genes associated with appressorium formation, enzymes, mycotoxins, and common fungal extracellular membrane (CFEM) effector proteins may be involved in the infection process of anthracnose. Conversely, the DEGs related to the cell wall components, phytohormones, signal transduction, transcription factors, secondary metabolites, and pathogenesis-related proteins (PRs) may function in the disease resistance of tea plants. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) revealed modules of positively/negatively correlated genes that may contribute to defense in resistant variety. Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM) quantification of representative PRs (PR1, CHIT, TLP, and PAL) clarified their potential roles in the defense response of tea plants. The findings of this study provide foundational insights into tea plant anthracnose resistance mechanisms and innovative disease management approaches.

AB  - CONSTANS-Like genes play critical roles in plant responses to both biotic and abiotic stresses, but their functions in Rosa chinensis remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide investigation of COL genes in R. chinensis, identifying 18 genes, designated from RcCOL_1 to RcCOL_18. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were unevenly distributed across three subfamilies (RcCOL_I to RcCOL_III), with RcCOL_III containing the most members. Interspecies evolutionary analysis of 14 Rosaceae species showed that COL genes presented across all these species, though the number of genes varied. Cis-acting element analysis indicated that the RcCOL genes mainly contained elements related to biotic and abiotic stress, light response, as well as growth and development, with RcCOL_4/_13/_14/_15, RcCOL_8/_17/_18, and RcCOL_5/_6/_16 showing highly consistent element distributions. Expression pattern analysis under red spider (Tetranychus urticae) attack revealed that subfamilies I and II of the COL gene family play a primary role in the regulation of plant response. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) verification showed that nearly all RcCOL genes were highly expressed following red spider infestation; however, these over-expressed genes were suppressed after introducing predatory mite (Neoseiulus californicus). This indicates that the RcCOL genes may play significant roles in the biotic stress response in R. chinensis. Correlation analysis of RcCOL genes with secondary metabolites demonstrated strong associations. For instance, RcCOL_1 and RcCOL_2 were highly correlated with geranylacetone, periplogenin, and syringetin, while RcCOL_3 and RcCOL_12 showed strong correlations with Nacetyltryptamine, uridine 5 '-monophosphate, and isorhamnetin. Additionally, RcCOL_7 was highly correlated with L-serine and 3-methylxanthine, and RcCOL_10 with byakangelicin, hippuric acid, and nicotineamide. RcCOL_14 and RcCOL_15 were strongly correlated with metabolites such as pidotimod, vinorelbine tartrate, and okadaic acid. These findings suggest that RcCOL genes modulate secondary metabolite production and play critical roles in the biotic stress response of plants.

AB  - Endophytic feeding behaviors, including stem borings and galling, have been observed in the fossil record from as early as the Devonian and involve the consumption of a variety of plant (and fungal) tissues. Historically, the exploitation of internal stem tissues through galling has been well documented as emerging during the Pennsylvanian (c. 323-299 million years ago (Ma)), replaced during the Permian by galling of foliar tissues. However, leaf mining, a foliar endophytic behavior that today is exhibited exclusively by members of the four hyperdiverse holometabolous insect orders, has been more sparsely documented, with confirmed examples dating back only to the Early Triassic (c. 252-250 Ma).Here, we describe a trace fossil on seed-fern foliage from the Rhode Island Formation of Massachusetts, USA, representing the earliest indication of a general, endophytic type of feeding damage and dating from the Middle Pennsylvanian (c. 312 Ma).Although lacking the full features of Mesozoic leaf mines, this specimen provides evidence of how endophytic mining behavior may have originated.It sheds light on the evolutionary transition to true foliar endophagy, contributes to our understanding of the behaviors of early holometabolous insects, and enhances our knowledge of macroevolutionary patterns of plant-insect interactions.

AB  - To establish persistent infections in host plants, herbivorous invaders, such as root-knot nematodes, must rely on effectors for suppressing damage-induced jasmonate-dependent host defenses. However, at present, the effector mechanisms targeting the biosynthesis of biologically active jasmonates to avoid adverse host responses are unknown. Using yeast two-hybrid, in planta co-immunoprecipitation, and mutant analyses, we identified 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 2 (OPR2) as an important host target of the stylet-secreted effector MiMSP32 of the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. MiMSP32 has no informative sequence similarities with other functionally annotated genes but was selected for the discovery of novel effector mechanisms based on evidence of positive, diversifying selection. OPR2 catalyzes the conversion of a derivative of 12-oxophytodienoate to jasmonic acid (JA) and operates parallel to 12-oxophytodienoate reductase 3 (OPR3), which controls the main pathway in the biosynthesis of jasmonates. We show that MiMSP32 targets OPR2 to promote parasitism of M. incognita in host plants independent of OPR3-mediated JA biosynthesis. Artificially manipulating the conversion of the 12-oxophytodienoate by OPRs increases susceptibility to multiple unrelated plant invaders. Our study is the first to shed light on a novel effector mechanism targeting this process to regulate the susceptibility of host plants.

AB  - Much has been learned about the cognitive and neural mechanisms by which humans and other animals navigate to reach their goals. However, most studies have involved a single, well-learned environment. By contrast, real-world wayfinding often occurs in unfamiliar settings, requiring people to combine memories of landmark locations with on-the-fly information about transitions between adjacent states. Here, we studied the strategies that support human navigation in wholly novel environments. We found that during goal-directed navigation, people use a mix of strategies, adaptively deploying both associations between proximal states (state transitions) and directions between distal landmarks (vectors) at stereotyped points on a journey. Deep neural networks meta-trained with reinforcement learning to find the shortest path to goal exhibited near-identical strategies, and in doing so, developed units specialized for the implementation of vector- and state transition-based strategies. These units exhibited response patterns and representational geometries that resemble those previously found in mammalian navigational systems. Overall, our results suggest that effective navigation in novel environments relies on an adaptive mix of state transition- and vector-based strategies, supported by different modes of representing the environment in the brain.

AB  - Volatiles are important for plant root stress resistance. The diseases in tea root are serious, causing major losses. The volatile composition in tea root and whether it can resist diseases remain unclear. In this study, the volatile composition in different tea tissues was revealed. The vanillin content was higher in the root (mainly in root cortex) than in aerial parts. The antifungal effects of vanillin on pathogenic fungi in tea root were equal to or greater than those of other metabolites. O-methyltransferase (CsOMT), a key enzyme in one of two biosynthetic pathways of vanillin, converted protocatechualdehyde to vanillin in vitro. Furthermore, its characteristics and kinetic parameters were studied. In Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts, the transiently expressed CsOMT was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. These findings have clarified the formation and bioactivities of volatiles in tea roots and provided a theoretical basis for understanding how tea plants resist root diseases.

AB  - Background: Hemorrhagic transformation (HT) seriously affects the clinical application of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA). The main strategy for combating HT is to keep the blood-brain barrier (BBB) stable. Escin is the active ingredient of Aesculus hippocastanum and a natural mixture of triterpene saponins, and may play a part in mitigation of HT.
   Purpose: This study sought to investigate the effect of Escin in improving rt-PA-induced HT, explore possible mechanisms, and provide new ideas for the treatment of clinical HT.
   Study design and methods: In in vivo experiments, transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was undertaken in 6-week-old and 12-month-old mice, and rt-PA was administered to induce HT injury. The inhibitory effect of Escin on HT and its protective effect on neurobehavior, the BBB, and cerebrovascular endothelial cells was determined. In in vitro experiments, bEnd.3 cells were injured by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) and rt-PA. The protective effect of Escin was measured by the CCK8 assay, release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins. In mechanistic studies, the effect of Escin on the adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase / caveolin-1 / matrix metalloprotease-9 (AMPK/Cav-1/MMP-9) pathway was investigated by employing AMPK inhibitor and Cav-1 siRNA.
   Results: In mice suffering from ischemia, rt-PA caused HT as well as damage to the BBB and cerebrovascular endothelial cells. Escin reduced the infarct volume, cerebral hemorrhage, improved neurobehavioral deficits, and maintained BBB integrity in rt-PA-treated tMCAO mice while attenuating bEnd.3 cells damage caused by rt-PA and OGD/R injury. Under physiological and pathological conditions, Escin increased the expression of p-AMPK and Cav-1, leading to decreased expression of MMP-9, which further attenuated damage to cerebrovascular endothelial cells, and these effects were verified with AMPK inhibitor and Cav-1 siRNA.
   Conclusion: We revealed important details of how Escin protects cerebrovascular endothelial cells from HT, these effects were associated with the AMPK/Cav-1/MMP-9 pathway. This study provides experimental foundation for the development of new drugs to mitigate rt-PA-induced HT and the discovery of new clinical application for Escin.

AB  - Captive African elephants are continuously exposed to tourism, which can lead to chronic stress, and subsequently negatively impact an animals' health, welfare, and fitness. However, the COVID-19 pandemic led to global closures of animal tourism venues, and thus a sudden and prolonged absence of tourists. We examined the impact of this abrupt, unique scenario on 10 semi-captive African elephants (8 F, 2 M; aged 12-30 yrs) maintained at the Knysna Elephant Park, South Africa, which offers close human-elephant interactions. We monitored rates of self-directed behaviours (SDBs), a novel indicator of anxiety in this species, to observe differences before, during, and after lockdown. SDBs were recorded as they occurred, along with the number of tourists present during sampling. Additionally, we recorded general behaviours to calculate activity budgets, and monitored the elephants' movement patterns and spatial use. The data examined represented 3 x 2-month periods; Pre (February 2020-March 2020), where tourist pressure was normal, During (March 2020-April 2020), where tourism was non-existent, and Post (November 2020-January 2021), where tourism had returned. Pre was set as the reference category to compare against the normative baseline. Results revealed SDB rates were significantly lower During (p < 0.001), and significantly higher Post (p = 0.033), demonstrating a reduction in anxiety-related behaviour due to the absence of tourists, and that the return of tourists perhaps invoked higher levels of anxiousness than before lockdown implementation. Similarly, both Low (p < 0.001) and High (p < 0.001) numbers of tourists significantly correlated with elevated SDBs, providing evidence that elephants perceived tourist presence alone as stressful. Activity budget analyses revealed a decrease in locomotion (p < 0.001), resting (p < 0.001), and comfort (p = 0.005) During, and an increase in feeding and time spent out of sight (both p < 0.001). Post resulted in an increase in locomotion (p = 0.004) and feeding behaviours (p = 0.007), and a decrease in comfort behaviour (p < 0.001) and time spent out of sight (p = 0.040). Lastly, elephants' movement patterns varied between lockdown phases, with mean distance travelled (meters) significantly less During (p < 0.001) than Pre and Post. A preference for off-exhibit zones was observed During (p < 0.001) as opposed to Pre and Post. Together, these findings provide further evidence of the stressful effect of tourism, and how the presence of unfamiliar humans and human-animal interactions alters both the behaviour and movement of captive animals.

AB  - We synthesized a series of novel indole compounds containing aroylhydrazone moieties and evaluated them in mice to check their anticonvulsant activity. In the present study the most potent C3-modified derivative 3e, containing 2-furyl fragment was evaluated in kainate (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) and the consequences on oxidative stress and inflammation in the hippocampus in mice were explored. Melatonin was used as positive control while the melatonin receptor antagonist Luzindol was studied alone or in combination with melatonin or 3e, respectively. After intraperitoneal (i.p.) pre-treatment with melatonin 3e, Luzindol + melatonin and Luzindol + 3e for 7 days (melatonin and 3e-30 mg kg(-1) or 60 mg kg(-1), Luzindol 10 mg kg(-1)) the animals were i.p. injected with KA (30 mg kg(-1), i.p.). The 3e decreased the SE-induced seizure intensity while melatonin suppressed seizures at the higher dose of 60 mg kg(-1). Luzindol blocked the anticonvulsant effect of both Mel and 3e. The dose-dependent antioxidant effect of 3e measured by reduced glutathione (GSH) and total GSH in the hippocampus, was comparable to the effect of melatonin. Luzindol fully blocked the effect of melatonin but affected partially the antioxidant activity of 3e. The KA-induced increased amplifier of neuroinflammation high-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) was neither alleviated by melatonin, nor by 3e. The activation by this DNA-binding protein receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was not affected by SE, melatonin and 3e pre-treatment. Our results suggest that the novel indole derivate 3e, containing 2-furyl fragment, might be clinically useful as an adjunct therapy against SE and concomitant oxidative stress.

AB  - Natural plants which are effective in Alzheimer's disease (AD) management are of pharmacological importance, though there is little or no scientific proof for most of their claims. This study sought to evaluate the effect of Hog plum (Spondias mombin) and Ogbo (Parquetina nigrescens) leaves extracts on antioxidant levels and activities of key enzymes linked to cognitive function in scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunctioned rats. Rats were pretreated with S. mombin (SM) and P. nigrescens (PN) leaves extracts (50 and 100 mg/kg), donepezil (5 mg/kg) for 2 weeks via oral administration before induction of memory impairment via single i.p. administration of scopolamine (3 mg/kg body weight). Experimental rats were subjected to behavioral tests to check for cognitive performance before experiment termination. The activities of hippocampal key enzymes linked to cognitive function were determined. Results showed that pretreatment with SM and PN prevented the cognitive impairment induced by scopolamine. Furthermore, increased cholinesterases, adenosine deaminase (ADA), ATP hydrolysis, monoamine oxidase (MAO), and arginase activities induced by scopolamine were significantly reduced in rats treated with SM and PN leaves extract. Additionally, elevated malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels observed in scopolamine-induced rats were reduced significantly in SM- and PN- pretreated rats. Decreased AMP hydrolysis, and nitric oxide and antioxidant level induced by scopolamine were prevented in pretreated rats. This study concluded that SM and PN leave extract effectiveness in cognitive management may be due to their high antioxidant activities and neuromodulatory effects on key enzymes linked to AD. Practical applications The use of natural products in the treatment and management of neurodegenerative diseases in Africa is becoming pertinent as the continent is blessed with medicinal plants while the price of synthetic drugs has been observed to be an economic burden on the continent. Parquetina nigrescens and Spondias mombin are examples of such medicinal plants that have been explored in folklore for the management of neurodegenerative diseases but there is a dearth of scientific validation for their use while there is no present data to evaluate possible mechanisms of action employed by these medicinal plants to mediate the therapeutic potential observed in folklore. Therefore, the present study seeks to validate the therapeutic use of P. nigrescens and S. mombin as observed in folklore as well as explore the possible mechanism of actions the plants may employ in mediating the proposed therapeutic potentials in neurodegenerative disease conditions while considering its toxicological effects in experimental animals.

AB  - Blasting vibration is a major adverse effect in rock blasting excavation, and accurately predicting its peak particle velocity (PPV) is vital for ensuring engineering safety and risk management. This study proposes an innovative IHO-VMD-CatBoost model that integrates variational mode decomposition (VMD) and the CatBoost algorithm, with hyperparameters globally optimized using the improved hippopotamus optimization (IHO) algorithm. Compared to existing models, the proposed method improves feature extraction from vibration signals and significantly enhances prediction accuracy, especially in complex geological conditions. Using measured data from open-pit mine blasting, the model extracts key features such as maximum section charge, total charge, and horizontal distance, achieving superior performance compared to 13 traditional models. It reports a root mean square error of 0.28 cm/s, a mean absolute error of 0.17 cm/s, an index of agreement of 0.993, and a variance accounted for value of 97.28%, demonstrating superior prediction accuracy, a high degree of fit with observed data, and overall robustness in PPV prediction. Additionally, analyses based on the SHapley Additive Explanations framework provide insights into the complex nonlinear relationships between factors like horizontal distance and maximum section charge, improving the model's interpretability. The model demonstrates robustness, stability, and applicability in various tests, confirming its reliability in complex engineering scenarios, and offering a valuable solution for safe mining and optimized blasting design.

AB  - Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alpha herpes virus that causes pseudorabies. Pigs are the only natural hosts of the virus. This disease has caused considerable economic losses to the global pig industry. Since 2011, the effectiveness of vaccines has decreased greatly because of the emergence of various PRV varieties. Additionally, some people are infected with PRV. Therefore, the development of new anti-PRV agents is highly important. Lysimachia christinae is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that has favorable effects on urine, detoxification, and swelling. In this study, the in vitro and in vivo anti-PRV activities of Lysimachia christinae polysaccharide (LCP) were investigated. Our results revealed that 200 mu g/mL LCP significantly attenuated the infection of PK-15 B6 cells by PRV XJ5 and that 100 mg/kg LCP significantly reduced PRV XJ5 infection in mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that the main target of the anti-PRV effect of LCP was in the virus adsorption stage. In addition, our study revealed that LCP can reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in PRV XJ5-infected PK-15 B6 cells and increase the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD). These results showed that LCP can reduce the oxidative stress caused by PRV infection. In summary, LCP may be used as an antiviral drug to fight new PRV mutant strains.

AB  - The hippocampus is crucial for associative fear learning when the anticipation of threat requires temporal or contextual binding of predictive stimuli as in trace and contextual fear conditioning. Compared with the dorsal hippocampus, far less is known about the contribution of the ventral hippocampus to fear learning. The ventral hippocampus, which is highly interconnected with defensive and emotional networks, has a prominent role in both innate and learned affective behaviors including anxiety, fear, and reward. Lesions or temporary inactivation of the ventral hippocampus impair both cued and contextual fear learning, but whether the ventral hippocampal role in learning is driven by affective processing, associative encoding, or both is not clear. Here, we used trace fear conditioning in mixed sex cohorts to assess the contribution of shock-encoding to the acquisition of cued and contextual fear memories. Trace conditioning requires subjects to associate an auditory conditional stimulus (CS) with a shock unconditional stimulus (UCS) that are separated in time by a 20-s trace interval. We first recorded neuronal activity in the ventral hippocampus during trace fear conditioning and found that ventral CA1 predominantly encoded the shock reinforcer. Potentiated firing to the CS was evident at testing, but no encoding of the trace interval was observed. We then tested the necessity of shock encoding for conditional fear acquisition by optogenetically silencing ventral hippocampal activity during the UCS on each trial of training. Contrary to our predictions, preventing hippocampal shock-evoked firing did not impair associative fear. Instead, it led to a more prolonged expression of CS freezing across test trials, an effect observed in males, but not females. Contextual fear learning was largely intact, although a subset of animals in each sex were differentially affected by shock-silencing. Taken together, the results show that shock encoding in the ventral hippocampus modulates the expression of learned fear in a sex-specific manner.

AB  - Simple Summary Ovine footrot is a painful contagious disease of the hoof. Caused by the bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus, there is mounting evidence that other bacteria play an important role in the initiation of the lesions. We had previously established Mycoplasma fermentans as being highly associated with the disease and wanted to understand the immune-dampening effects on the local immune response to other bacteria associated with footrot. We created primary cell cultures of ovine skin cells from healthy foot biopsies collected at an abattoir. The initial cells were naturally infected with Mycoplasma fermentans, which, after isolation, were treated with antibiotics to create a Mycoplasma-free line. The different cultures were stimulated with different bacteria, and the mRNA and protein release were assessed under both conditions. The stimulation resulted in an increased expression of key immune indicators in the M. fermentans-free cells; however, this did not correspond to a protein release. The skin cells naturally infected with M. fermentans showed little response to stimulation. Therefore, we conclude Ovine skin cells infected with M. fermentans have a reduced response to stimulation dampening the immune response to other bacteria. This provides an important insight into the impact of multiple pathogens on the host response to footrot. Ovine footrot is a complex multifactorial infectious disease, causing lameness in sheep with major welfare and economic consequences. Dichelobacter nodosus is the main causative bacterium; however, footrot is a polymicrobial disease with Fusobacterium necrophorum, Mycoplasma fermentans and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica also associated. There is limited understanding of the host response involved. The proinflammatory mediators, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 8 (CXCL8), have been shown to play a role in the early response to D. nodosus in dermal fibroblasts and interdigital skin explant models. To further understand the response of ovine skin to bacterial stimulation, and to build an understanding of the role of the cytokines and chemokines identified, primary ovine interdigital fibroblasts and keratinocytes were isolated, cultured and stimulated. The expression of mRNA and protein release of CXCL8 and IL-1 beta were measured after stimulation with LPS, D. nodosus or F. necrophorum, which resulted in increased transcript levels of IL-1 beta and CXCL8 in the M. fermentans-free cells. However, only an increase in the CXCL8 protein release was observed. No IL-1 beta protein release was detected, despite increases in IL-1 beta mRNA, suggesting the signal for intracellular pre-IL-1 beta processing may be lacking when culturing primary cells in isolation. The keratinocytes and fibroblasts naturally infected with M. fermentans showed little response to the LPS, a range of D. nodosus preparations or heat-inactivated F. necrophorum. Primary single cell culture models complement ex vivo organ culture models to study different aspects of the host response to D. nodosus. The ovine keratinocytes and fibroblasts infected with M. fermentans had a reduced response to the experimental bacterial stimulation. However, in the case of footrot where Mycoplasma spp. are associated with diseased feet, this natural infection gives important insights into the impact of multiple pathogens on the host response.

AB  - Evidence suggests that prolonged blue-light exposure can impact vision; however, less is known about its impact on non-visual higher-order functions in the brain, such as learning and memory. Blue-light-blocking lenses (BBLs) claim to reduce these potential impacts. Hence, we assessed structural and functional hippocampal alterations following blue-light exposure and the protective efficacy of BBLs. Male Wistar rats were divided into (n = 6 in each group) normal control (NC), blue-light exposure (LE), and blue-light with BBLs (Crizal Prevencia, CP and DuraVision Blue, DB) groups. After 28 days of light exposure (12:12 light: dark cycle), rats were trained for the Morris water maze memory retention test, and brain tissues were sectioned for hippocampal neuronal analysis using Golgi and Cresyl violet stains. The memory retention test was significantly delayed (p < 0.05) in LE compared with DB groups on day 1 of training. Comparison of Golgi-stained neurons showed significant structural alterations, particularly in the basal dendrites of hippocampal neurons in the LE group, with BBLs significantly mitigating these structural changes (p < 0.05). Comparison of Cresyl-violet-stained neurons revealed significantly (p < 0.001) increased degenerated hippocampal neurons in LE rats, with fewer degenerated neurons in the CP lens group for CA1 neurons (p < 0.05), and for both CP and DB groups (p < 0.05) for CA3 neurons. Thus, in addition to documented effects on visual centers, high-level blue-light exposure also results in degeneration in hippocampal neurons with associated behavioral deficits. These changes can be partially ameliorated with blue-light-blocking lenses.

AB  - Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) has been widely reported to influence ovarian follicular development, and miRNAs play a significant role in mammalian follicular development by regulating their target genes. Therefore, it is of interest to explore the roles of miRNAs in sheep follicular development during FSH stimulation. In the current study, we constructed miRNA expression profiles of small follicles (SFs, prerecruitment stage), medium follicles (MFs, dominance stage), and large follicles (LFs, maturation stage). Three and 50 significant differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified in the MF vs. SF and LF vs. SF comparisons, respectively, and none were identified in the LF vs. MF comparison. Oar-miR10a was significantly downregulated in MFs compared with SFs. In LFs compared with SFs, miR-212-3p, miR-212-5p and miR-202-5p were significantly upregulated, and miR-27a-3p, miR-181a-5p, miR-204-5p, and miR-182-5p were significantly downregulated. Furthermore, we predicted the target genes of significant DEMs and performed functional enrichment analyses of these target genes. Analyses of KEGG pathways and GO terms showed that the putative target genes were significantly enriched in ovarian steroidogenesis, glutathione metabolism, positive regulation of cell differentiation, positive regulation of cell development, and cellular response to oxygen-containing compounds. Analyses of miRNA-gene regulatory networks suggested that miR-181a-5p-CYP11A1, (miR-27a-3p and miR-129-5p)-LDLR, (miR-212-3p and miR-212-5p)-EFNA5, (miR-181a-5p, miR-182-5p, and miR-27a-3p)-INHBA, and miR182-5p-SOD2 might be involved in follicular development. The present study provides basic data and suggests research directions for further exploration of the roles of miRNAs in sheep follicular development under FSH stimulation.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Tea (Camellia sinensis) is a favorite drink worldwide. Tea extracts and green tea main component (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) are recommended for various vascular diseases. Anji white tea is a very popular green tea. Its vascular effect profile, the mechanisms, and the contribution of EGCG to its integrated effect need elucidation. Aim: To characterize the vasomotion effects of Anji white tea and EGCG, and to explore possible involvement of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) and voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels in their vasomotion effects. Materials and methods: Anji white tea water soaking solution (AJWT) was prepared as daily tea-making process and concentrated to a concentration amounting to 200 mg/ml of dry tea leaves. The tension of rat arteries including aorta, coronary artery (RCA), cerebral basilar artery (CBA), intrarenal artery (IRA), intrapulmonary artery (IPA) and mesenteric artery (MA) was recorded with myographs. In arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) freshly isolated from RCA, the levels of intracellular Ca2+ were measured with Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probe fluo 4-AM, and Kv currents were recorded with patch clamp. The expressions of VGCCs and Kv channels were assayed with RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining. Results: At 0.4-12.8 mg/ml of dry tea leaves, AJWT profoundly relaxed all tested arteries precontracted with various vasoconstrictors about half with a small transient potentiation on the precontractions before the relaxation. KCl-induced precontraction was less sensitive than precontractions induced by phenylephrine (PE), U46619 and serotonin (5-HT). IPA was less sensitive to the relaxation compared with other arteries. AJWT pretreatment for 1 h, 24 h and 72 h time-dependently inhibited the contractile responses of RCAs. In sharp contrast, at equivalent concentrations according to its content in AJWT, EGCG intensified the precontractions in most small arteries, except that it induced relaxation in PE-precontracted aorta and MA, U46619-precontracted aorta and CBA. EGCG pretreatment for 1 h and 24 h did not significantly affect RCA contractile responses. In RCA ASMCs, AJWT reduced, while EGCG enhanced, intracellular Ca2+ elevation induced by depolarization which activates VGCCs. Patch clamp study showed that both AJWT and EGCG reduced Kv currents. RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that both AJWT and EGCG reduced the expressions of VGCCs and Kv channels. Conclusion: AJWT, but not EGCG, consistently induces vasorelaxation. The vasomotion effects of either AJWT or EGCG vary with arterial beds and vasoconstrictors. Modulation of VGCCs, but not Kv channels, contributes to AJWT-induced vasorelaxation. It is suggested that Anji white tea water extract instead of EGCG may be a promising food supplement for vasospastic diseases.

AB  - Optoelectronic biointerfaces offer a wireless and nongenetic neurostimulation pathway with high spatiotemporal resolution. Fabrication of low-cost and flexible optoelectronic biointerfaces that have high photogenerated charge injection densities and clinically usable cell stimulation mechanism is critical for rendering this technology useful for ubiquitous biomedical applications. Here, supercapacitor technology is combined with flexible organic optoelectronics by integrating RuO2 into a donor-acceptor photovoltaic device architecture that facilitates efficient and safe photostimulation of neurons. Remarkably, high interfacial capacitance of RuO2 resulting from reversible redox reactions leads to more than an order-of-magnitude increase in the safe stimulation mechanism of capacitive charge transfer. The RuO2-enhanced photoelectrical response activates voltage-gated sodium channels of hippocampal neurons and elicits repetitive, low-light intensity, and high-success rate firing of action potentials. Double-layer capacitance together with RuO2-induced reversible faradaic reactions provide a safe stimulation pathway, which is verified via intracellular oxidative stress measurements. All-solution-processed RuO2-based biointerfaces are flexible, biocompatible, and robust under harsh aging conditions, showing great promise for building safe and highly light-sensitive next-generation neural interfaces.

AB  - Evidence suggests that exposure to organophosphate pesticides increases the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, but the mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of malathion on Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like symptoms at environmentally relevant concentrations using wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 transgenic mouse models. Results showed that malathion exposure induced AD-like cognitive impairment, amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation, and neuroinflammation in WT mice, with worsened symptoms in APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that malathion induced AD-like gut microbiota dysbiosis (reduced Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, and increased Dubosiella), causing gut barrier impairment and tryptophan metabolism disruptions. This resulted in a significant increase in indole derivatives and activation of the colonic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), promoting the kynurenine (KYN) pathway while inhibiting the serotonin (5-HT) pathway. Increased neurotoxic KYN metabolites (3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid) triggered gut and systemic inflammation, upregulating hippocampal IL-6 and IL-1 beta mRNA levels and thereby causing neuroinflammation. Gut tryptophan metabolism disruptions caused hippocampal neurotransmitter imbalances, reducing the levels of 5-HT and its derivatives. These effects promoted AD progression in both WT and APP/PS1 mice. This study highlights the crucial role of the microbiota-gut-brain axis in AD-like cognitive impairment induced by malathion exposure, providing insights into the neurodegenerative disease risks posed by organophosphate pesticides.

AB  - Multiple paradigms indicate that the physical environment can influence spontaneous and learned behavior. In rodents, context-dependent behavior is putatively supported by the prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobe. A preponderance of the literature has targeted the role of the hippocampus. In addition to the hippocampus proper, the medial temporal lobe also comprises parahippocampal areas, including the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices. These parahippocampal areas directly connect with multiple regions in the prefrontal cortex. The function of these connections, however, is not well understood. This article first reviews the involvement of the perirhinal, postrhinal, and prefrontal cortices in context-dependent behavior in rodents. Then, based on functional and anatomical evidence, we suggest that perirhinal and postrhinal contributions to context-dependent behavior go beyond supporting context representation in the hippocampus. Specifically, we propose that the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices act as a contextual-support network that directly provides contextual and spatial information to the prefrontal cortex. In turn, the perirhinal and postrhinal cortices modulate prefrontal input to the hippocampus in the service of context-guided behavior.

AB  - C. sinensis is an economically important crop for tea production that experiences increasing demand and good export potential. Therefore, crops need to be expanded, and high-quality planting material is required. Vegetative propagation by cuttings is the prevalent method; therefore, this paper explored its optimization potential modeled on cultivar 'Jiukengzao'. This study wanted to deeply explore blue-light-induced adventitious root formation and development of tea cuttings, so we conducted short-term (0 h, 8 h, and 16 h) and long-term (30 d, 60 d, and 90 d) time-course analyses on tea cutting seedlings. Short-term, full-length transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of genes related to plant hormone signal transduction and auxin transport was highest at 16 h. Sixteen hours of light was considered as suitable for adventitious root growth and development of tea cuttings. Long-term phytohormone analysis showed that the trend of indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA) change was: 60 d > 90 d > 30 d. Long-term, full-length transcriptome analysis showed that the gene expression trends in K2, K5, K6, and K8 clusters were: 90 d > 60 d > 30 d, and the opposite was observed in K1, K4, and K11 clusters. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that most of the genes in these seven clusters are involved in "plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075)". This includes auxin early responsive protein AUX/IAA, auxin response factor ARF, auxin-responsive protein SAUR, etc. In addition, genes related to auxin transport and synthesis were identified as PIN1, 3, 4, PILS2, 6, 7, flavin-containing monooxygenase YUC9, and YUC10, and the expression trend of these genes was mostly consistent with the change trend of ICA content. This study further explained the molecular mechanism of blue-light-induced adventitious root formation and development of tea cuttings. It is recommended that blue light can be used to promote the adventitious root growth and development of tea cuttings in practical production.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is characterized by skeletal and brain structural malformations, cognitive impairment, altered hippocampal metabolite concentration and gene expression imbalance. These alterations were usually investigated separately, and the potential rescuing effects of green tea extracts enriched in epigallocatechin-3-gallate (GTE-EGCG) provided disparate results due to different experimental conditions. We overcame these limitations by conducting the first longitudinal controlled experiment evaluating genotype and GTE-EGCG prenatal chronic treatment effects before and after treatment discontinuation. Our findings revealed that the Ts65Dn mouse model reflected the pleiotropic nature of DS, exhibiting brachycephalic skull, ventriculomegaly, neurodevelopmental delay, hyperactivity, and impaired memory robustness with altered hippocampal metabolite concentration and gene expression. GTE-EGCG treatment modulated most systems simultaneously but did not rescue DS phenotypes. On the contrary, the treatment exacerbated trisomic phenotypes including body weight, tibia microarchitecture, neurodevelopment, adult cognition, and metabolite concentration, not supporting the therapeutic use of GTE-EGCG as a prenatal chronic treatment. Our results highlight the importance of longitudinal experiments assessing the co-modulation of multiple systems throughout development when characterizing preclinical models in complex disorders and evaluating the pleiotropic effects and general safety of pharmacological treatments.

AB  - Soybean is attacked by various herbivorous insect pest species during the whole course of its life cycle in the field. It is important for soybean production to improve insect resistance by identifying and utilizing soybean endogenous insect-resistant genes. The ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF) plays a significant role in plant biotic and abiotic stresses; however, few studies focus on its role in insect resistance in soybean. Here, based on our previous common cutworm (CCW)-induced soybean transcriptome data, a soybean ERF gene GmERF54 was cloned, which responded to CCW feeding. Transcriptional analysis revealed that GmERF54 was ubiquitous in all soybean tissues and was expressed differently in insect-resistant and insect-susceptible soybean cultivars. RNA interference of GmERF54 increased the resistance to CCW, while the overexpression of GmERF54 decreased the resistance to CCW in transgenic soybean hairy roots compared with their controls. GmERF54 was localized to the nucleus, had transcriptional activation activity, and interacted with AP2/ERF GmPLT2. Several putative hormone response elements were predicted in the promoter sequence of GmERF54. Four putative elements were only found in the GmERF54 promoter sequence of insect-resistant cultivar Wanxianbaidongdou (WX), but not in the insect-susceptible cultivar Nannong 99-10 (99-10). GmERF54 promoter sequences of WX and 99-10 were cloned into the pCAMBIA1381z vector containing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene to generate GmERF54(WX):GUS and GmERF54(99-10):GUS recombinant vectors, respectively. GUS staining of soybean hairy roots containing GmERF54(WX):GUS and GmERF54(99-10):GUS showed that GmERF54 was induced by CCW attack and both MeJA (methyl jasmonate) and IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) treatments. Alleles in insect-resistant and insect-sensitive cultivars responded to these inductions differently. Overall, our results reveal that GmERF54 may be involved in the regulation of soybean resistance to CCW.

AB  - Despite epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a pivotal oncogene for several cancers, including lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), how it senses extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity remain elusive in the context of the increasing role of tissue rigidity on various hallmarks of cancer development. Here it is shown that EGFR dictates tumorigenic agrin expression in lung cancer cell lines, genetically engineered EGFR-driven mouse models, and human specimens. Agrin expression confers substrate stiffness-dependent oncogenic attributes to EGFR-reliant cancer cells. Mechanistically, agrin mechanoactivates EGFR through epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent and independent modes, thereby sensitizing its activity toward localized cancer cell-ECM adherence and bulk rigidity by fostering interactions with integrin beta 1. Notably, a feed-forward loop linking agrin-EGFR rigidity response to YAP-TEAD mechanosensing is essential for tumorigenesis. Together, the combined inhibition of EGFR-YAP/TEAD may offer a strategy to reduce lung tumorigenesis by disrupting agrin-EGFR mechanotransduction, uncovering a therapeutic vulnerability for EGFR-addicted lung cancers.

AB  - Plants have evolved a series of inducible or constitutive defense mechanisms in response to herbivore attack. Constitutive plant defenses are morphological and biochemical traits of the plants themselves, regardless of the presence of herbivores. We bred an alfalfa variety (Caoyuan No.4) with high thrips resistance, but the mechanisms underlying Caoyuan No.4 resistance to thrips are not well understood. To explore the constitutive defense of Caoyuan No.4, the morphological and biochemical traits associated with constitutive defense to thrips in alfalfa were analyzed using a thrips-susceptible alfalfa accession (Caoyuan No.2) as a control. The results showed that Caoyuan No.4 had thicker palisade tissue and parenchyma tissue, wider collenchyma, phloem, cambium and lignin layer, and smaller epidermal cells and stomatal aperture compared to Caoyuan No.2. Moreover, Caoyuan No.4 showed more non-glandular trichomes in both leaves and stems, but less glandular trichomes and more wax in stems. In addition, the results of the widely targeted metabolomics analysis showed that metabolites related to flavonoid, isoflavonoid, flavone and flavonol biosynthesis, as well as cysteine and methionine metabolism, differed between CaoyuanNo.2 and Caoyuan No.4. These findings shed new light on the constitutive insect defense of plants associated with physical or biochemical traits and may provide convenient markers for breeding thrips-resistant alfalfa cultivars.

AB  - Plants produce considerable amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with several biological functions, including protection against biotic agents such as viruses and their vectors. In citrus species, these metabolites can be related with their different susceptibility/tolerance toward the Tristeza virus (CTV), one of the main biotic constraints for the citrus industry. The objective of this study was to compare the VOCs pattern from the leaves of a CTV-susceptible citrus variety such as Citrus aurantium and from three CTV-tolerant varieties: Citrus volkameriana, Carrizo citrange, and Forner-Alcaide no. 5. The VOCs emitted were analyzed via the headspace SPME method, while plant metabolites sequestered in the leaves were analyzed by heptane extraction followed by GC-MS. The results indicated that the majority of the VOCs emitted and sequestered in the leaves of the varieties tolerant and susceptible to CTV are constituted mainly by volatile terpenes (VTs) that exhibit strong qualitative/quantitative differences among the profiles of the four citrus species. In detail, the VOC emission indicated different patterns between C. aurantium and C. volkameriana and from both of them in comparison with Forner-Alcaide no. 5 and Carrizo citrange that exhibited more similarities, with the last two characterized by a higher presence of sesquiterpenes. The data obtained from the analysis of the VOCs sequestered in leaf tissues of the CTV-tolerant varieties indicated a higher presence of monoterpenes such as limonene, alpha-pinene, and p-cymene, known to be the main components of several plant extracts showing deterrent properties toward viruses and insect vectors. As VOC evaluation is a fast and noninvasive measure of phenotypic dynamics, allowing the association of plant phenotypes in accordance to plant disease resistance and/or stress tolerance, the possible implications of such differences in terms of tolerance grade to CTV and/or its related vectors are discussed.

AB  - In recent years, the development of solid-state lighting devices has increasingly shifted towards high-power laser illumination, making it imperative to develop fluorescent conversion materials with exceptional thermal stability and luminous quality. In this study, we introduced a highly reflective TiO2 substrate in combination with a high thermal conductivity AlN substrate to design a Ce:YAG-PiG-TiO2-AlN Film (Ce:YAG PTAF) color converter with outstanding photothermal performance. Remarkably, the thermal conductivity of this material reaches 48.28 W m(-1) K-1. Notably, the optimized PTAF can withstand a high-power output of up to 12.14 W in a static environment, with a maximum luminous flux (LFmax) of 2284.6 lm and maximum luminous efficacy (LEmax) of 222.35 lm W-1, showcasing its excellent optical properties. Furthermore, the fabricated Ce:YAG-PiG-TiO2-AlN-Wheel (Ce:YAG PTAW), equipped with a motor operating at 7200 r/min, emits an extraordinary brightness of 4404 lm under 88 W of ultra-high laser irradiation, with stability surpassing that of commercial silicone color wheels, thanks to its superior Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 (LAS) glass system. Interestingly, we designed an innovative spatially separated two-color segmented wheel structure, effectively mitigating the photon reabsorption phenomenon caused by the overlap of the fluorescent powder absorption peaks. When the ratio of Ce:YAG to Ce:GdYAG is 240:120, it yields white light with a color rendering index (CRI) of 80.2, and luminous flux remaining at 3317.8 lm. When encapsulated in a reflective module, it accurately reflects the true color states of objects. These results collectively indicate that both Ce:YAG PTAF and PTAW possess significant application potential in the realm of high-power laser illumination.

AB  - Vermicomposts and composts prepared from sewage sludge digestate and additives (spent mushroom compost, straw, biochar) after 43 days pre-composting followed by 90 days vermicomposting with Eisenia fetida or by compost maturing were investigated regarding the potentially toxic element (PTE) As, Co, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Pb and Zn contents. The average increment in the total PTE concentration for the entire process was ten times higher (104 %) compared to the increment solely in the composting or vermicomposting (9.3 and 9.5 %, respectively) after pretreatment. Compared to the untreated digestate the As and Co concentrations in the final mixtures were 26 and 51 % higher, respectively while for the other PTEs 26 +/- 9 % average decrease was observed. Total PTE content was the same in composts and vermicomposts. Average PTE bioavailability (water soluble/total concentration) was statistically the same in vermicomposts (2.5) and composts (2.7), but lower in mixtures with biochar (2.5) than without it (2.8).

AB  - Simple Summary: This study addresses the lack of information available for southern white rhinoceros circulating fatty acids that is important for the health, management, and conservation of the species. The objectives of this research were to provide novel fatty acid percentage profiles for managed healthy southern white rhinoceroses, as well as to provide comparisons between two zoos with differences in diet and climate during two distinct pasture growth periods. Noteworthy results were the higher levels of a-linolenic acid and total omega-3 fatty acids, and lower linoleic acid, total omega-6 fatty acids, and the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio found in Busch Gardens Tampa Bay in both growth periods when compared to the North Carolina Zoo. These data provide novel fatty acid percentages for southern white rhinoceroses and describe how fatty acids may differ between housing locations due to pasture growth periods and diet.
   Southern white rhinoceroses (Ceratotherium simum simum) are African megaherbivores that are considered near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. The fatty acid circulating values of these animals have not been thoroughly investigated. Fatty acids are critical for immune, heart, skin, and reproductive health, and may have a significant impact on the management and conservation of this species. Published data on fatty acids in this species is limited to incomplete profiles with very few animals in managed environments. The objectives of this research were to provide novel fatty acid percentage profiles for managed healthy southern white rhinoceroses, as well as to provide comparisons between two zoological institutions with differences in diet and climate during two distinct pasture growth periods. Whole blood samples were collected as dried blood spots from six rhinoceroses at the North Carolina Zoo (NC Zoo) and five rhinoceroses at Busch Gardens Tampa (BGT) in the low growth period (February to April) of 2019 and during the high growth period (July to September) of 2020. Fatty acid results indicated numerous differences when comparing the institutions within the same growth period and when comparing the same institution between its two growth periods. Most noteworthy were the higher levels of a-linolenic acid (18:3w3) and total omega-3 fatty acids and the lower linoleic acid (18:2w6), total omega-6 fatty acids, and omega-6 to omega-3 ratio found in the BGT population in both growth periods. This study provides novel percentages of fatty acids in managed southern white rhinoceroses and data on how fatty acid profiles may be altered between two housing locations via dietary differences in hay type and quantity, pasture availability via season, and pellet inclusion levels.

AB  - Over-generalized fear is a maladaptive response to harmless stimuli or situations characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. The dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) contains engram cells that play a crucial role in accurate memory retrieval. However, the coordination mechanism of neuronal subpopulations within the dDG network during fear generalization is not well understood. Here, with the Tet-off system combined with immunostaining and two-photon calcium imaging, we report that dDG fear engram cells labeled in the conditioned context constitutes a significantly higher proportion of dDG neurons activated in a similar context where mice show generalized fear. The activation of these dDG fear engram cells encoding the conditioned context is both sufficient and necessary for inducing fear generalization in the similar context. Activities of mossy cells in the ventral dentate gyrus (vMCs) are significantly suppressed in mice showing fear generalization in a similar context, and activating the vMCs-dDG pathway suppresses generalized but not conditioned fear. Finally, modifying fear memory engrams in the dDG with "safety" signals effectively rescues fear generalization. These findings reveal that the competitive advantage of dDG engram cells underlies fear generalization, which can be rescued by activating the vMCs-dDG pathway or modifying fear memory engrams, and provide novel insights into the dDG network as the neuronal basis of fear generalization.
   Fear generalization is a maladaptive response to harmless stimuli or situations that is characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder and other anxiety disorders. This study shows that competition between engram and non-engram cells in the dentate gyrus determines whether fear generalization occurs.

AB  - Domestic pigs have become increasingly popular as a model for human diseases such as neurological diseases. Drug discovery platforms have increasingly been used to identify novel compounds that combat neurodegeneration. Currently, bioactive molecules such as melatonin have been demonstrated to offer a neuroprotective effect in several studies. However, a neurodegenerative platform to study novel compounds in a porcine model has not been fully established. In this study, characterized porcine induced neural stem cells (iNSCs) were used for evaluation of the protective effect of melatonin against chemical and pathogenic stimulation. First, the effects of different concentrations of melatonin on the proliferation of porcine iNSCs were studied. Second, porcine iNSCs were treated with the appropriate concentration of melatonin prior to induced degeneration with dimethyl sulfoxide or Zika virus (ZIKV). The results demonstrated that the percentages of Ki67 expression in porcine iNSCs cultured in 0.1, 1, and 10 nM melatonin were not significantly different from that in the control groups. Melatonin at 1 nM protected porcine iNSCs from DMSO-induced degeneration, as confirmed by a dead cell exclusion assay and mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi m) analysis. In addition, pretreatment with melatonin reduced the percentage of dead porcine iNSCs after ZIKV infection. Melatonin increased the Delta psi m, resulting in a decrease in cell degeneration. However, pretreatment with melatonin was unable to suppress ZIKV replication in porcine iNSCs. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the anti-degenerative effect of melatonin against DMSO- and ZIKV-induced degeneration in porcine iNSCs.

AB  - The purpose of this work was to evaluate the groundwater quality and the health hazards related to noncarcinogenic elements present in the Complex Terminal (CT) Ouargla city. Thirty (30) samples were taken and physico-chemically analyzed collected from deep boreholes located in study area. Fluoride concentrations ranged between 1.07 and 3.7 mg/l, with 54% of samples having a value >1.5 mg/l as per potability limit. According to the fluoride pollution index (FPI), 63.67% of the boreholes were severely contaminated with F-. However, nitrate pollution index (NPI) revealed that approximately 71% of the samples showed no contamination. The pollution index of groundwater (PIG) ranging from 1.34 to 2.85 indicate the majorit of groundwater samples in the search zone was contaminated for human consumption. Based on the entropy water quality index (EWQI), 30% of samples had poor quality, while 70% were unfit for drinking. According to the statistical analysis used in this study, the dissolution of fluoride-rich carbonate rocks under high HCO3- contents enables the liberation of F- from fluorine-bearing minerals like calcite and fluorite. Regarding non-carcinogenic risks, the Hazard quotient (HQ) fluoride was obtained with a huge difference in exposure dose in children (0.89 - 3.08), women (0.62 - 2.13) and men (0.54 - 1.85), respectively. HQ nitrate values ranged from 0.08 to 1.40, 0.06 - 0.97 and 0.05 - 0.84 for men, women and children, correspondingly. The total hazard index (THI) clearly show that fluoride presents a higher health risk than nitrate, revealing that 53.3%, 66.7%, and 100% of the samples show that men, women and children, at risk respectively. It has been proven to be more susceptible to health hazards since it may be exposed to non -carcinogenic elements, and to avoid a further worsening of the health situation, those responsible and decision -makers will have to treat the water appropriately, identify the affected people and provide them with the necessary medical care.

AB  - Simple Summary The pre-weaning piglet mortality percentage is a commonly reported metric on commercial pig farms. The mortality percentage tells us how many piglets died, but not what their welfare status was as it relates to their cause of death. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the likely experience of piglets that died, following confirmation of the cause of death via postmortem investigation. The Five Domains Model was then used to collate scientific evidence of the likely experience of these piglets before death from acute disease, starvation, crushing, savaging and euthanasia, to understand the impact of different causes on their welfare. The resulting findings raised the question of differentiating 'smothering' as a cause of death from 'crushing,', and that co-morbidities (such as hypothermia) may alter the welfare experience due to their influence on consciousness before death. This pilot study aimed to assess the welfare impacts of different causes of pre-weaning deaths in piglets. Piglets that died between 0-7 days after birth (n = 106) were collected from two commercial pig farms and subject to post-mortem examination to confirm their cause of death as well as any contributing factors. Using the Five Domains Model, the most likely affective experiences associated with the pathological findings were carefully inferred to better understand affective experience as it related to known causes of liveborn piglet mortality. The most common causes of liveborn piglet mortality were starvation (23%), crushing (23%) and non-viable (21%). Thirty one piglets had evidence of starvation, but it was only considered the primary cause of death in 15 piglets, as cofactors such as poor viability (n = 13) were also present in many piglets with evidence of starvation. All 15 piglets that were crushed died within 24 h after birth and most had evidence of thoracic and/or abdominal internal bleeding. This study found that common causes of liveborn piglet death were associated with compromises in Domains 1 (Nutrition/hydration), 3 (Health/function), and4 (Behavioural interactions), with the most likely resulting affective states described in Domain 5 (Mental state). This highlights the interaction between physical/functional and situation-related (behavioural) aspects that influence an animals' welfare status.

AB  - Ventral subiculum (vSUB) is integral to the regulation of stress and reward; however, the intrinsic connectivity and synaptic properties of the inhibitory local circuit are poorly understood. Neurexin-3 (Nrxn3) is highly expressed in hippocampal inhibitory neurons, but its function at inhibitory synapses has remained elusive. Using slice electrophysiology, imaging, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify multiple roles for Nrxn3 at GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) interneuron synapses made onto vSUB regular-spiking (RS) and burst-spiking (BS) principal neurons. Surprisingly, we find that intrinsic connectivity of vSUB and synaptic function of Nrxn3 in vSUB are sexually dimorphic. We reveal that PVs make preferential contact with RS neurons in male mice, but BS neurons in female mice. Furthermore, we determine that despite comparable Nrxn3 isoform expression in male and female PV neurons, Nrxn3 knockout impairs synapse density, postsynaptic strength, and inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) amplitude at PV-RS synapses in males, but enhances presynaptic release and IPSC amplitude in females.

AB  - Straw waste has a large amount of lignocellulose, which shows a strong resistance to biodegradation in the composting process and hinders the formation of humic substances. Therefore, the effects of pH adjustment and inoculation of degradation bacteria on the composting process, lignocellulose degradation and humus formation in secondary fermentation were explored through aerobic composting experiments. The experiment was designed with four treatment groups: CK (conventional composting), T1 (adjusting pH), T2 (inoculating P. chrysosporium), and T3 (adjusting pH and inoculating P. chrysosporium), respectively. Results showed that except for treatment CK, all other treatments met the maturation standards at the end of composting. Adjustment of the pH value and the inoculation of Phanerochaete chrysosporium (P. chrysosporium) can significantly shorten the fermentation time. Among them, the lignin content of treatment T3 was reduced significantly by 14.28% compared to treatment T2; the content of humic acid in T3 increased significantly by 51.32% and 14.04% compared with T1 (adjusting pH) and T2 (p < 0.05), respectively. In terms of key enzyme activity and precursor substance changes, the pH adjustment treatment was superior to other treatments after composting. This study confirmed that the change of pH conditions is an important environmental factor for microorganisms to enhance the humification process; degrading enzymes were used as a "bridge" to enhance the continuous degradation of lignocellulose by microorganisms and increase the supplementation of precursors and the synthesis of humic acid, which is the mechanism to enhance the humification process. Our findings provided a new method to enhance the humification process, which is a valuable and economical technical approach to improve organic fertilizer quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological data link traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) to increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Preclinical data corroborating this association are largely from studies of male animals exposed acutely or subchronically to high levels of isolated fractions of TRAP. What remains unclear is whether chronic exposure to ambient TRAP modifies AD risk and the influence of sex on this interaction.
   OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess effects of chronic exposure to ambient TRAP on the time to onset and severity of AD phenotypes in a pre clinical model and to determine whether sex or genetic susceptibility influences outcomes.
   METHODS: Male and female TgF344-AD rats that express human AD risk genes and wildtype littermates were housed in a vivarium adjacent to a heavily trafficked tunnel in Northern California and exposed for up to 14 months to filtered air (FA) or TRAP drawn from the tunnel and delivered to animals unchanged in real time. Refractive particles in the brain and AD phenotypes were quantified in 3-, 6-, 10-, and 15-month-old animals using hyperspectral imaging, behavioral testing, and neuropathologic measures.
   RESULTS: Particulate matter (PM) concentrations in TRAP exposure chambers fluctuated with traffic flow but remained below 24-h PM with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to 2.5 micrometers (PM2:5) U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards limits. Ultrafine PM was a predominant component of TRAP. Nano-sized refractive particles were detected in the hippocampus of TRAP animals. TRAP-exposed animals had more amyloid plaque deposition, higher hyperphosphorylated tau levels, more neuronal cell loss, and greater cognitive deficits in an age-, genotype-, and sex dependent manner. TRAP-exposed animals also had more microglial cell activation, but not astrogliosis.
   DISCUSSION: These data demonstrate that chronic exposure to ambient TRAP promoted AD phenotypes in wildtype and genetically susceptible rats. TRAP effects varied according to age, sex, and genotype, suggesting that AD progression depends on complex interactions between environment and genetics. These findings suggest current PM2:5 regulations are insufficient to protect the aging brain.

AB  - In premature infants, glutathione deficiency impairs the capacity to detoxify the peroxides resulting from O-2 metabolism and those contaminating the parenteral nutrition (PN) leading to increased oxidative stress, which is a major contributor to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) development. In animals, the supplementation of PN with glutathione prevented the induction of pulmonary oxidative stress and hypoalveolarization (characteristic of BPD). Hypothesis: the dose of glutathione that corrects the plasma glutathione deficiency is sufficient to prevent oxidative stress and preserve pulmonary integrity. Three-day-old guinea pigs received a PN, supplemented or not with GSSG (up to 1300 mu g/kg/d), the stable form of glutathione in PN. Animals with no handling other than being orally fed constituted the control group. After 4 days, lungs were removed to determine the GSH, GSSG, redox potential and the alveolarization index. Total plasma glutathione was quantified. The effective dose to improve pulmonary GSH and prevent the loss of alveoli was 330 mu g/kg/d. A 750 mu g/kg/d dose corrected the low-plasma glutathione, high-pulmonary GSSG and oxidized redox potential. Therefore, the results suggest that, in a clinical setting, the dose that improves low-plasma glutathione could be effective in preventing BPD development.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Acceleration of neurite outgrowth and halting neurodegeneration are the most critical factors that are negatively regulated in various neurodegenerative diseases or injuries in the central nervous system (CNS). Functional foods or nutrients are considered alternative sources of bioactive components to alleviate various CNS injuries by promoting neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis, while their exact molecular mechanism remains unexplored.Aim of the study: Coriandrum sativum L. (CS) is one of the popular herbs in the Apiaceae family, of which CNS modulating action is a well-documented traditionally but detailed study on memory boosting function yet re-mains unexplored. Consequently, this study aims to analyze the neurogenic and synaptogenic modulation of CS aqueous ethanol (CSAE) extract in the primary hippocampal neurons.Materials and methods: Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured and allowed to incubate with CSAE or vehicle.To observe the early neuronal differentiation, axonal and dendritic arborization, and synapse formation, neurons were immune-stained against indicated antibodies or stained directly with a lipophilic dye (1, 1 '-dioctadecyl-3, 3, 3 ', 3 '-tetramethyl indocarbocyanine perchlorate, DiL). Meanwhile, western blot was used to validate the synaptogenesis effect of CSAE compared to vehicle. Additionally, molecular docking and system pharmacology approaches were applied to confirm the possible secondary metabolites and pathways by which CSAE promotes neuritogenesis.Results: Results show that CSAE can induce neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis at 30 mu g/mL concentration. The treatment impacts early neuronal polarization, axonal and dendritic arborization, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity via NMDARs expressions in primary neurons. In silico network pharmacology of CS metabolites show that the CSAE-mediated neurogenic effect is likely dependent on the NTRK2 (TrkB) mediated neurotrophin signaling pathway. Indeed, the observed neurogenic activity of CSAE is markedly reduced upon the co-treatment with a TrkB-specific inhibitor. Furthermore, molecular docking following binding energy calculation shows that one of the CS metabolites, scoparone, has a high affinity to bind in the BDNF mimetic binding site of TrkB, suggesting its role in TrkB activation. Scoparone was found to enhance neuritogenesis, but not to the same extent as CSAE. Moreover, the expression of TrkB signaling-related proteins (BCL2, CASP3, GSK3, and BDNF), which was found to be modulated by scoparone, was significantly affected by the co-treatment of TrkB inhibitor (ANA-12). These results further suggest that the modulation of neuritogenesis by scoparone is TrkB-dependent.Conclusions: This study provides deeper insights into the molecular mechanism of CS in boosting neuronal growth and memory function, which might implicate the prevention of many neurological disorders.

AB  - To ensure global food security under the changing climate, there is a strong need for developing 'climate resilient crops' that can thrive and produce better yields under extreme environmental conditions such as drought, salinity, and high temperature. To enhance plant productivity under the adverse conditions, we constitutively overexpressed a bifunctional wax synthase/acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WSD1) gene, which plays a critical role in wax ester synthesis in Arabidopsis stem and leaf tissues. The qRT-PCR analysis showed a strong upregulation of WSD1 transcripts by mannitol, NaCl, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments, particularly in Arabidopsis thaliana shoots. Gas chromatography and electron microscopy analyses of Arabidopsis seedlings overexpressing WSD1 showed higher deposition of epicuticular wax crystals and increased leaf and stem wax loading in WSD1 transgenics compared to wildtype (WT) plants. WSD1 transgenics exhibited enhanced tolerance to ABA, mannitol, drought and salinity, which suggested new physiological roles for WSD1 in stress response aside from its wax synthase activity. Transgenic plants were able to recover from drought and salinity better than the WT plants. Furthermore, transgenics showed reduced cuticular transpirational rates and cuticle permeability, as well as less chlorophyll leaching than the WT. The knowledge from Arabidopsis was translated to the oilseed crop Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz. Similar to Arabidopsis, transgenic Camelina lines overexpressing WSD1 also showed enhanced tolerance to drought stress. Our results clearly show that the manipulation of cuticular waxes will be advantageous for enhancing plant productivity under a changing climate.

AB  - Huanglongbing (HLB) is a devastating disease that has led to an acute crisis for growers of citrus, one of the world's most important fruit crops. The phloem-feeding Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri, is the main pest at the new shoot stage and is the only natural vector of HLB pathogenic bacteria. Little is known about how plants perceive and defend themselves from this destructive pest. Here, we characterized changes in the expression of various genes in citrus plants that were continuously infested by D. citri for different durations (12, 24, and 48 h). A total of 5 219 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 643 common DEGs were identified across all time points. Several pathways related to defense were activated, such as peroxisome, alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and phenylpropanoid and terpenoid biosynthesis, and some pathways related to growth and signal transduction were suppressed in response to D. citri infestation. The expression of genes including kinases (CML44, CIPK6, and XTH6), phytohormones (SAMT, LOX6, and NPR3), transcription factors (bHLH162, WRKY70, and WRKY40), and sec-ondary metabolite synthesis-related genes (PAL, 4CL2, UGT74B1 and CYP82G1) was significantly altered in response to D. citri infestation. The findings of this study greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the defense response of citrus plants to D. citri infestation at the molecular level. Functional characterization of the candidate defense-related genes identified in this study will aid the molecular breeding of insect-resistant citrus varieties.

AB  - Guanosine is a purine nucleoside that has been shown to exhibit antidepressant effects, but the mechanisms underlying its effect are not well established. We investigated if the antidepressant-like effect induced by guanosine in the tail suspension test (TST) in mice involves the modulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) pathway. We also evaluated if the antidepressant-like effect of guanosine is accompanied by an acute increase in hippocampal and prefrontocortical BDNF levels. Additionally, we investigated if the ability of guanosine to elicit a fast behavioral response in the novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) test is associated with morphological changes related to hippocampal synaptogenesis. The antidepressant-like effect of guanosine (0.05 mg/kg, p.o.) in the TST was prevented by DNQX (AMPA receptor antagonist), verapamil (VDCC blocker), K-252a (TrkBantagonist), or BDNF antibody. Increased P70S6K phosphorylation and higher synapsin I immunocontent in the hippocampus, but not in the prefrontal cortex, were observed 1 h after guanosine administration. Guanosine exerted an antidepressant-like effect 1, 6, and 24 h after its administration, an effect accompanied by increased hippocampal BDNF level. In the prefrontal cortex, BDNF level was increased only 1 h after guanosine treatment. Finally, guanosine was effective in the NSF test (after 1 h) but caused no alterations in dendritic spine density and remodeling in the ventral dentate gyrus (DG). Altogether, the results indicate that guanosine modulates targets known to be implicated in fast antidepressant behavioral responses (AMPA receptor, VDCC, and TrkB/BDNF pathway).

AB  - The Liriomyza trifolii is a highly invasive polyphagia pest. Understanding the physiological functions of odorant binding proteins (OBPs) in the chemical communication of L. trifolii can lead to effective pest management strategies. Seven full-length OBPs were identified by transcriptome screening of L. trifolii adults. Bioinformatics analyses classified the seven OBPs into two subfamilies (six classic OBPs, one minus-C OBP). The analysis of their expression in different development stages revealed that LtriOBP5 was highly expressed in the larval stage, LtriOBP4 in the pupa stage, and LtriOBP1, 2, 3, 6, 7 in the adult stage; the expression levels were higher in male adults than in females. The analysis of different tissues showed high expression of LtriOBP1, 3, 6, 7 in the antennae, which were selected for in vitro purification. To explore the ligand compounds of OBPs, fluorescence competitive binding experiments were performed. Immunofluorescence localization revealed that LtriOBP1, 3, 6, 7 showed strong binding abilities to plant volatiles and were located in the antennae, implying that LtriOBP1, 3, 6, 7 may play key roles in olfaction, such as host location. LtriOBP6 and LtriOBP7 had strong binding abilities to specific herbivore-induced plant volatiles, suggesting LtriOBP6 and LtriOBP7 may also play critical roles in chemoreception. This study provides preliminary exploration of the olfactory perception mechanism of L. trifolii, which can be used as a basis to design insect behavior regulators and develop highly effective insecticides using mixture of ligands and known pesticides.

The results demonstrated that 60% inclusion of alfalfa in the alfalfa-sweet sorghum mixed silage appeared to be the best in improving serum antioxidant capacity, dry matter intake, rumen fermentation and cellulolytic bacteria abundance of Karakul lambs. The result of this study is useful for understanding and promoting the utilization of suitable mixtures of alfalfa-sweet sorghum silage in animal production. The study investigated the effects of feeding mixtures of alfalfa (AF) and sweet sorghum (SS) at different ratios of silages in terms of the physiological status of blood and rumen, and rumen microbiota in lambs. A total of 30 four-month-old male Karakul lambs with 25.5 +/- 1.4 kg mean initial body weight were randomly allocated to five groups, with six lambs in each group. Five experimental diets containing 40% of one of the five AF-SS mixed silages (containing 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% AF on a fresh weight basis, respectively) and 60% of other ingredients were formulated. Overall, the results showed that the mixed silage with more AF tended to increase serum antioxidant capacity, dry matter (DM) intake, and rumen fermentation metabolites. The AF-SS mixed silages containing AF at 60% and 80% caused a significant linear increase (p < 0.05) in the activity of total antioxidant capacity. The superoxide dismutase in the Karakul lamb responded with significant linear and quadratic increases (p < 0.01) as the ratio of AF was increased in the AF-SS mixed silages. Feeding diets with AF in silage mixtures at the ratio of 60% significantly increased (p < 0.05) the concentration of ruminal total volatile fatty acids (tVFA), acetate, and ammonia-N. However, no statistical significance (p > 0.05) was found in the alpha diversity of rumen microbes among the tested groups (p > 0.05). Principal coordinates analysis could clearly discriminate the differences between the five groups (p = 0.001). The relative abundance of Firmicutes in the rumen were significantly higher with AF at 40% in the AF-SS silage-based diet than those with AF at 0%, and 20% ratios. The abundance of Ruminococcus_albus had a significant linear increase (p < 0.05), as the ratio of AF in the AF-SS mixed silages was increased. In conclusion, the best beneficial effect on the physiological status of the blood and rumen, DM intake, and rumen microbiota in lambs came from those that consumed the diet containing the AF-SS mixed silage with 60% AF.

AB  - Antler ossified tissue has been widely used for the extraction of bioactive peptides. In this study, collagen was prepared from antler ossified tissue via acetic acid and pepsin. Five different proteases were used to hydrolyze the collagen and the hydrolysate treated by neutrase (collagen peptide named ACP) showed the highest DPPH radical clearance rate. The extraction process of ACP was optimized by response surface methodology, and the optimal conditions were as follows: a temperature of 52 degree celsius, a pH of 6.1, and an enzyme concentration of 3200 U/g, which resulted in the maximum DPPH clearance rate of 74.41 +/- 0.48%. The peptides (ACP-3) with the strongest antioxidant activity were obtained after isolation and purification, and its DPPH free radical clearance rate was 90.58 +/- 1.27%; at the same time, it exhibited good scavenging activity for ABTS, hydroxyl radical, and superoxide anion radical. The study investigated the protective effect of ACP-3 on oxidative damage in HaCaT cells. The findings revealed that all groups that received ACP-3 pretreatment exhibited increased activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT compared to the model group. Furthermore, ACP-3 pretreatment reduced the levels of ROS and MDA in HaCaT cells subjected to H2O2-induced oxidative damage. These results suggest that collagen peptides derived from deer antler ossified tissue can effectively mitigate the oxidative damage caused by H2O2 in HaCaT cells, thereby providing a foundation for the utilization of collagen peptides in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.

AB  - The extracellular space (ECS) and its constituents play a crucial role in brain development, plasticity, circa-dian rhythm, and behavior, as well as brain diseases. Yet, since this compartment has an intricate geometry and nanoscale dimensions, its detailed exploration in live tissue has remained an unmet challenge. Here, we used a combination of single-nanoparticle tracking and super-resolution microscopy approaches to map the nanoscale dimensions of the ECS across the rodent hippocampus. We report that these dimensions are heterogeneous between hippocampal areas. Notably, stratum radiatum CA1 and CA3 ECS differ in several characteristics, a difference that gets abolished after digestion of the extracellular matrix. The dynamics of extracellular immunoglobulins vary within these areas, consistent with their distinct ECS characteristics. Altogether, we demonstrate that ECS nanoscale anatomy and diffusion properties are widely heterogeneous across hippocampal areas, impacting the dynamics and distribution of extracellular molecules.

AB  - Marine sponges are well known as prolific producers of structurally diverse molecules with valuable pharmacological potential. As part of our ongoing program to discover bioactive compounds from marine sponges collected from the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea, a chemical study on the specimens of Hippospongia lachne was conducted. As a result, eight undescribed compounds, including four zwitterionic alkylpyridinium salts, hippospondines A -D (1-4), and four 3-alkylpyridine alkaloids, hippospondines E (5), F (6), and (+/-)-hippospondine G (7), were isolated from the marine sponge H. lachne, together with one known 3-alkylpyridine alkaloid (8). The undescribed structures were elucidated by HRESIMS, NMR, DP4+ and CP3 probability analysis, and the Snatzke's method. Hippospondines A -D (1-4) represent the rare example of inner salt type alkylpyridinium alkaloid with a farnesyl moiety. Compounds 1-3 and 8 were subjected to cytotoxic and lymphocyte proliferation assays. Compound 3 exhibited a weak promotion effect on the ConA-induced T lymphocyte proliferation.

AB  - Microbial contamination deteriorates source water quality, posing a severe problem for drinking water suppliers worldwide and addressed by the Water Safety Plan framework to ensure high-quality and reliable drinking water. Microbial source tracking (MST) is used to examine different microbial pollution sources via host-specific intestinal markers for humans and different types of animals. However, the application of MST in tropical surface water catchments that provide raw water for drinking water supplies is limited. We analyzed a set of MST markers, namely, three cultivable bacteriophages and four molecular PCR and qPCR assays, together with 17 microbial and physicochemical parameters, to identify fecal pollution from general, human-, swine-, and cattle-specific sources. Seventy-two river water samples at six sampling sites were collected over 12 sampling events during wet and dry sea-sons. We found persistent fecal contamination via the general fecal marker GenBac3 (100 % detection; 2.10-5.42 log10 copies/100 mL), with humans (crAssphage; 74 % detection; 1.62-3.81 log10 copies/100 mL) and swine (Pig-2-Bac; 25 % detection; 1.92-2.91 log10 copies/100 mL). Higher contamination levels were observed during the wet season (p < 0.05). The conventional PCR screening used for the general and human markers showed 94.4 % and 69.8 % agree-ment with the respective qPCR results. Specifically, in the studied watershed, coliphage could be a screening param-eter for the crAssphage marker (90.6 % and 73.7 % positive and negative predictive values; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.66; p < 0.001). The likelihood of detecting the crAssphage marker significantly increased when total and fecal coliforms exceeded 20,000 and 4000 MPN/100 mL, respectively, as Thailand Surface Water Qual-ity Standards, with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of 15.75 (4.43-55.98) and 5.65 (1.39-23.05). Our study confirms the potential benefits of incorporating MST monitoring into water safety plans, supporting the use of this ap-proach to ensure high-quality drinking water supplies worldwide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-surgical artificial insemination techniques for sheep may benefit from larger numbers of sperm in the insemination dose because the ewe's cervix is convoluted and often cannot be traversed with an insemination gun resulting in deposition of the sperm at the os cervix. OBJECTIVE: To compare a range of sperm concentrations when cryopreserving semen from Santa Ines rams and determine the effects of this on post-thaw quality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One ejaculate from each ram (n = 10) was diluted to four sperm concentrations to obtain the following groups: G-400, G-800, G-1200, and G-1600 x 106 sperm/mL. The semen samples were packaged in 0.25 mL straws, cooled to 5 degrees C, cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen vapor, thawed in a water bath (40 degrees C/20 s), and were analyzed for computerized kinetics, capacitation and acrosome integrity, and plasma membrane integrity of sperm. RESULTS: The G-400 treatment resulted in samples with the highest linearity and progressive motion (P < 0.05) and had significantly greater plasma membrane integrity, and lower capacitation and acrosome reaction rates compared to G-1600 (P < 0.05). Overall, use of the G-400 treatment resulted in better kinetics, less plasma membrane damage and less early capacitation. However, despite reducing the ejaculate yield and increasing the costs of the semen freezing process, the G-800 and G-1200 treatments make a greater absolute number of sperm with good kinetics, plasma membrane integrity and capacitation status available. CONCLUSION: Ram sperm concentration impacts cryopreservation, and higher concentrations may be advantageous if a single artificial insemination protocol is desirable.

AB  - Chronic lead (Pb) exposure affects the circadian physiological processes regulated by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which is synchronized (entrainment) by light. Disorders in the entrainment capacity of an organism alter its performance to interact with the environment, thus affecting its health status. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate whether chronic early Pb exposure affects the entrainment of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity by light and to explore the possible mechanisms involved. Adult male Wistar rats, control and chronically exposed to Pb (320 ppm) in drinking water from gestation to adult age, were used. Assessment of the metal level showed a significant increase of Pb in the blood, hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex of the experimental rats. Continuous registrations of locomotor activity (12 h:12 h light-dark cycle) depicted that Pb induces important delay of this activity when the light was turned off. The Pb exposed animals entrained faster with a photoperiod delay of 6 h, (lights on at 13:00 h), and maintained the significant delay in the onset of activity at lights out. In continuous darkness, the animals were exposed to a light pulse at circadian time 23. This resulted in a significant decrease of photo-stimulated neurons (immunoreactivity to c-Fos) in the SCN of the metal-exposed animals. These results show that chronic early Pb exposure alters the photic entrainment of the rhythm of locomotor activity, which is evidenced by a significant decrease in both the number of photo-stimulated neurons and neuronal population (Nissl stain) of the SCN.

AB  - Purpose Fluoride level, due to its narrow therapeutical range, must be constantly monitored in beverages, especially in daily-consumed plant infusions. Fluoride is important for prevention of tooth decay and osteoporosis, but its excess leads to fluorosis. Since tea can selectively absorb fluorides from soils, the question arises if a long-term consumption can pose an adverse effect on human health. Methods Infusions of 33 popular teas (black, green, white, earl grey, pu-erh), tea-like products (rooibos, yerba mate) and herbs (chamomile, mint, nettle, purges, yarrow) available in the Polish market were analyzed with respect to a fluoride level by means of a validated ion-selective electrode method, which is proven to be fast and reliable. Results Significantly different fluoride concentrations in infusions were observed, with black tea on top, where extraction of fluoride is the highest (average 2.65 mg F-/L, range 0.718-6.029 mg/L). Two-fold higher fluoride contents were measured in infusions made from black tea bags than from leaves (average 3.398 mg/L and 1.529 mg/L, respectively). Green teas released comparable amounts of fluoride as black teas, while in herbal extracts the fluoride content was negligible. Conclusions The rank with respect to the fluoride concentration in an infusion is as follows: black tea > green tea > earl grey > pu-erh > white tea>>>rooibos, yerba mate, herbal products. Increasing of brewing time results in an increased fluoride content, but the overall content of fluoride in the analyzed infusions of teas and herbs was not high enough to cause a risk of fluorosis, even if left to brew up to 15 min.

AB  - Diabetes, the cause of colossal economic and disease burden, is a key area of research in drug discovery programs. Elevated blood glucose levels in diabetes lead to several adverse consequences due to the formation of advanced glycation end products and free radicals. Vitamin C, a potent antioxidant, protects the body's cells and tissues from oxidative damage and dysfunctions. Glucose is the precursor of Vitamin C synthesis in plants and some mammals. L-gulono lactone oxidase (GULO) is the rate-limiting enzyme in producing Vitamin C. However, it is not synthesized in bats, primates, humans, and guinea pigs because of the pseudogene. Several phytomolecules having antioxidant properties are hypothesized to be promising and selective activators of GULO. Therefore, the present study focused on screening agonists of GULO from phytomolecules as an effective augmentor for Vitamin C synthesis, thereby suppressing the sequela of diabetic events. The 3D structure of GULO was generated by the ab-initio method. Subsequently, molecular docking explored the possible binding patterns of GULO protein with different plant phenolic compounds, followed by supplementation of the potent phytomolecules to diabetic guinea pigs. It is noteworthy that Resveratrol and Hydroxytyrosol showed better binding affinity. The molecular simulation also confirmed that Resveratrol is an activator of the GULO enzyme. Interestingly, it was also established that Vitamin C levels were improved in diabetic guinea pigs supplemented with the phytomolecules and comparatively Resveratrol modulates the concentration of glucose and Vitamin C levels substantially, thereby alleviating hyperglycemia. However, further studies are warranted to study the mechanisms.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB  - BACE1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for & beta;-amyloid (A & beta;) production and therefore is considered a prime drug target for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the BACE1 inhibitors failed in clinical trials, even exhibiting cognitive worsening, implying that BACE1 may function in regulating cognition-relevant neural circuits. Here, we found that parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons (PV INs) in hippocampal CA1 express BACE1 at a high level. We designed and developed a mouse strain with conditional knockout of BACE1 in PV neurons. The CA1 fast-spiking PV INs with BACE1 deletion exhibited an enhanced response of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to local stimulation on CA1 oriens, with average intrinsic electrical properties and fidelity in synaptic integration. Intriguingly, the BACE1 deletion reorganized the CA1 recurrent inhibitory motif assembled by the heterogeneous pyramidal neurons (PNs) and the adjacent fast-spiking PV INs from the superficial to the deep layer. Moreover, the conditional BACE1 deletion impaired the AMPARs-mediated excitatory transmission of deep CA1 PNs. Further rescue experiments confirmed that these phenotypes require the enzymatic activity of BACE1. Above all, the BACE1 deletion resets the priming of the fear memory extinction. Our findings suggest a neuron-specific working model of BACE1 in regulating learning and memory circuits. The study may provide a potential path of targeting BACE1 and NMDAR together to circumvent cognitive worsening due to a single application of BACE1 inhibitor in AD patients.

AB  - Producing biogas from agricultural waste by using a household biogas digester has a critical role in increasing energy supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in rural areas. However, only a few studies have analyzed the type of animal husbandry and planting that influence household biogas. This paper analyzes the spatialtemporal distribution of household biogas and its proportion in the total biogas produced in rural China from 2009 to 2018. The correlation between household biogas in rural China and animal husbandry and planting from 2009 to 2018 is also examined. The types of animal husbandry and planting that influence household biogas are then respectively determined via ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression. Results show that the spatial-temporal distributions of household biogas with maximum and minimum values of 1.384 x 1010 m3 in 2011 and 0.8420 x 1010 m3 in 2018, respectively and its proportion with maximum and minimum values of 94.83% in 2009 and 75.07% in 2018, respectively significantly vary and show a declining trend from 2009 to 2018. The number of cattle and pigs is identified as the main animal husbandry factor that influences household biogas, whereas the planting areas of vegetables, fiber, and tobacco were identified to be the main planting factors. Considering fitting effects, R2 and adjusted R2 values of 0.8620 and 0.8100 obtained by geographically weighted regression respectively, were higher than those of ordinary least squares (0.6480 and 0.6220, respectively), respectively in animal husbandry factors, whereas R2 and adjusted R2 values of 0.8400 and 0.7990 obtained by geographically weighted regression, respectively, were higher than those of ordinary least squares (0.7190 and 0.6880, respectively) in planting factors. These results provide a reference for planning the production of biogas and the utilization of agricultural waste.

AB  - The medial-lateral habenula (LHbM)'s role in anxiety and depression behaviors in female mice remains unclear. Here, we used neonatal maternal deprivation (MD) and post-weaning environmental enrichment (EE) to treat female BALB/c offspring and checked anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors as well as the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), oxytocin receptor (OTR), estrogen receptor-beta (ER0) levels in their LHbM at adulthood. We found that MD enhanced state anxiety-like behaviors in the elevated plus-maze test, and EE caused trait anxiety-like behaviors in the open field test and depression-like behaviors in the tail suspension test. The immunochemistry showed that MD reduced OT immunoreactive neuron numbers in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus but increased OTR levels in the LHbM; EE increased CRH levels in the LHbM but decreased OTR levels in the LHbM. The additive effects of EE and MD maintained the behavioral parameters, OT-ir neuronal numbers, CRH levels, and OTR levels similar to the additive of non-MD and non-EE. The correlation analysis showed that CRH levels correlated with synaptic connection levels, OTR levels correlated with nucleus densities, and ER0 levels correlated with Nissl body levels and body weights in female mice. Neither MD nor EE affected ER0 levels in the LHbM. Together, the study revealed the relationships between behaviors and neuro-endocrine and neuronal alterations in female LHbM and the effects of experiences including MD and EE on them.

AB  - Simple Summary: Sow parturition, the process of giving birth to piglets, is a highly stressful process, with outcomes affecting farm economics as well as sow and piglet welfare. Protocols that assist with the identification of abnormal parturition are required for optimal production outcomes. The eye is an easily accessible and anatomically consistent body region, often used to aid medical diagnoses. A novel three-level ocular scoring system was devised and used to investigate the relationship between changes in ocular appearance and farrowing kinetics. It was determined that ocular appearance scoring can be used at farrowing to aid identification of sows experiencing an abnormal parturition, as changes are associated with increased straining and extended farrowing durations. This is a first step in developing a scale that may aid in predicting an extended parturition (>300 min), identifying sows that require assistance and so aiding staff management, sow welfare, and piglet survival. Protocols that enable prompt identification of sows in need of assistance during farrowing are important for optimal production outcomes. Change in the colour and appearance of the sclera of the eye can indicate increased stress. This warrants investigation into its use for the identification of sows in need of assistance at the time of parturition. To this end, a three-level ocular scoring system for the pig was devised and subsequently used in a preliminary investigation into the relationship between farrowing kinetics and visual changes in the sclera at farrowing. Data were collected and analysed from twenty randomly selected Large White x Landrace crossbred sows during farrowing. It was determined that sows with a severe ocular score were more likely to experience a prolonged farrowing duration (p = 0.013) and incur increased parturient straining of either total straining time (p = 0.011) or straining per piglet (p = 0.025). There was a significant association between ocular score and litter size (p = 0.043). Ocular score was not associated with sow parity (p = 0.728) and inter-piglet interval (p = 0.075). The proposed three-level scoring system successfully identified sows experiencing an abnormal parturition as defined by a prolonged farrowing duration and increased straining time. Findings from this study suggest the potential application of this simple ocular scoring tool for identifying sows experiencing an abnormal farrowing via in-person application or integration into remote monitoring systems in the future.

AB  - Simple Summary Colostrum quality and quantity can influence the growth, health, and survival of sow offspring, and can therefore influence sow productive performance. Colostrum quality can be affected by a multitude of factors; of these, the breed of the sows and its parity were investigated in the present study. The aim of the study was to identify the influence of sow breed and parity on colostrum components and to associate these with the survival, growth, and occurrence of diarrhoea of their litters. The results revealed that a more robust breed, such as Duroc, could have more colostral immunoglobulins (Igs) than the Large White and Landrace breeds. Gilts are characterised by a higher fat % and number of somatic cells (SCs), which are positively correlated to each other. Piglet survivability until weaning can increase with an increased quantity of IgA and SCs in the colostrum; piglet diarrhoea can decrease with an increased quantity of IgA. Increasing knowledge regarding swine colostrum composition and its relation to litter performance can help in designing new intervention strategies to improve the welfare and economic sustainability of pig rearing systems. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of breed and parity on colostrum components, and to associate sow breed, parity, and colostrum components with survival, growth, and the occurrence of diarrhoea of their litters. In Experiment 1, 64 sows (Duroc = 13; Landrace = 17 and Large White = 34) were included. In Experiment 2, 71 sows with different parities (1 = 10; 2 = 16; 3 = 13; 4 = 12; >= 5 = 20) were included. The number (N) of live piglets, litter body weight (Experiment 1), and the occurrence of diarrhoea (Experiment 1) were recorded at farrowing, at 2-3 days of age, and at weaning. Colostrum was analysed for proximate composition, immunoglobulins (Igs), and somatic cell count (SCC). Stepwise regressions and ANOVA models were used to associate breed, parity, and colostrum components with litter performance. The Duroc breed had the highest IgG and IgA (p < 0.005). Gilts had a higher fat% and SCC (p< 0.0001); these compounds were positively correlated (r = 0.45). Increased IgA tended to increase the N of weaned piglets (p = 0.058) and reduce litter diarrhoea (p = 0.021). The SCC increased the N of weaned piglets (p = 0.031). Overall, this study confirmed that breed and parity can influence the colostrum composition and highlighted the key role of Igs and somatic cells in piglet health.

AB  - Simple Summary Biosecurity measures are necessary to the development of a family alpine farming system. In this study, good practices and areas of improvement have been investigated. In particular, practices related to quarantine, cleaning, waste milk feeding to calves, immunization, and diagnostics could be improved to implement optimal biosecurity measures. Farmers confirm that they are willing to adopt effective preventive measures under the recommendation of the veterinarian, and this attitude may be crucial to designing multisectoral participatory activities and strategies. Further investigations and the development of customized applications and digital toolkits are now required to better understand farmers' drivers toward biosecurity and to provide support.Abstract Background: Biosecurity measures are essential to improve animal health and welfare, tackle antimicrobial resistance (AMR), minimize the burden of infectious diseases, and enhance the safety, security, and quality of sustainable agricultural products. However, the implementation of these measures in small mountain farms can be influenced by several factors, which probably differ from the main variables that affect intensive farming systems. Methods: This study investigated the awareness among farmers regarding the implementation of biosecurity measures at the local level in small dairy farms located in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano/Bozen (Italy). In order to determine to what extent these measures are in line with the recommendations, a questionnaire was conceptualized and sent by post to a representative group of local farmers. The initiative was voluntary and anonymous. Results: A total of 50 farmers responded to the questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 27.5%. This study confirms that most of the farmers are familiar with biosecurity, and 38% of them know its comprehensive definition. The results indicate that 77% of respondents are willing to implement preventive measures to reduce the use of antimicrobials, and 76% of them acknowledge that they would follow the recommendations provided by veterinarians. In agreement with other studies, the role of the veterinarian as a person of trust among farmers is confirmed. Conclusions: Main strengths and areas of improvement have been identified. Additional data and effective tools are needed to better investigate drivers toward biosecurity and to implement impactful and practical measures for mountain farming.

AB  - Maternal intake of omega-3 (n-3 PUFAs) and omega-6 (n-6 PUFAs) polyunsaturated fatty acids impacts hippocampal neurogenesis during development, an effect that may extend to adulthood by altering adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN). The n-3 PUFAs and n-6 PUFAs are precursors of inflammatory regulators that potentially affect AHN and glia. Additionally, n-3 PUFA dietary supplementation may present a sexually dimorphic action in the brain. Therefore, we postulated that dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA balance shapes the adult DG in a sex-dependent manner influencing AHN and glia. We test our hypothesis by feeding adult female and male mice with n-3 PUFA balanced or deficient diets. To analyze the immunomodulatory potential of the diets, we injected mice with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS reduced neuroblast number, and its effect was exacerbated by the n-3 PUFA-deficient diet. The n-3 PUFA-deficient diet reduced the DG volume, AHN, microglia number, and surveilled volume. The diet effect on most mature neuroblasts was exclusively significant in female mice. Colocalization and multivariate analysis revealed an association between microglia and AHN, as well as the sexual dimorphic effect of diet. Our study reveals that female mice are more susceptible than males to the effect of dietary n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio on AHN and microglia.

AB  - Spontaneous reversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to normal cognition (NC) is little known. Based on the data of the Genetics of Personality Consortium and MCI participants from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the authors investigate the effect of polygenic scores (PGS) for personality traits on the reversion of MCI to NC and its underlying neurobiology. PGS analysis reveals that PGS for conscientiousness (PGS-C) is a protective factor that supports the reversion from MCI to NC. Gene ontology enrichment analysis and tissue-specific enrichment analysis indicate that the protective effect of PGS-C may be attributed to affecting the glutamatergic synapses of subcortical structures, such as hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and caudate nucleus. The structural covariance network (SCN) analysis suggests that the left whole hippocampus and its subfields, and the left whole amygdala and its subnuclei show significantly stronger covariance with several high-cognition relevant brain regions in the MCI reverters compared to the stable MCI participants, which may help illustrate the underlying neural mechanism of the protective effect of PGS-C.

AB  - Recent events concerning jet fuel contamination of drinking water have shown that we need a better understanding of the effects of ingested jet fuel. To this end, a reproductive study with ingested jet fuel in rats was undertaken with relatively high concentrations of Jet Propellant (JP)-5 along with a human estrogen receptor activation in vitro assay using JP-5, JP-8, and an alternative jet fuel derived from the camelina plant referred to as HydroRenewable Jet (HRJ) fuel, to help evaluate potential effects of ingested jet fuel. The results of the in vivo study provide evidence that JP-5 can act as an endocrine disruptor, with specific observations including altered hormone levels with JP-5 exposure (significantly lower estradiol levels in male rats and significantly increased Dehydroepiandrosterone levels in females), and a decreased male/female offspring ratio. The in vitro hormone receptor activation assay indicated that JP-5 and JP-8 are capable of upregulating human estrogen receptor (ER) activity, while HRJ was not active in the ER assay. The jet fuels were not able to activate androgen or glucocorticoid receptors in further in vitro assays. These results infer potential endocrine disruption associated with JP-5, with activation of the estrogen receptor as one potential mechanism of action.

AB  - Repeated exposure to tobacco smoke causes neuroinflammation and neuroplasticity, which correlates with smoking withdrawal-induced anxiety. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anticipated involvement of antioxidant-rich nanoparticles (NPs) prepared by oxidation-triggered polymerization of green tea catechins in impacting these effects in a rat model of tobacco smoke exposure. Exposure to tobacco smoke was carried out for 2 h a day, 5 days a week, for a total of 36 days. Weekly behavioral tests were conducted prior to recommencing the exposure. Following a 20-day exposure period, rats were administered either distilled water or green tea (GT) NPs (20 mg/kg, orally) for an additional 16 days. Our findings revealed that tobacco smoke exposure induced anxiety-like behavior indicative of withdrawal, and this effect was alleviated by GT NPs. Tobacco smoke exposure caused a marked increase in the relative mRNA and protein expression of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and reduced the relative mRNA and protein expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus (HIP) and hypothalamus (HYP) brain subregions. The intervention of GT NPs effectively inhibited these effects. Our findings demonstrate the potent protective role of GT NPs in reducing withdrawal-induced anxiety-like behavior, neuroinflammation, and neuroplasticity triggered by tobacco smoke exposure.

AB  - The Blasius's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus blasii) shows a fragmented distribution in the European part of its range, and its populations are threatened by many human-induced factors. The status and distribution of the species in Romania are largely unknown. In recent years, regular bat surveys and monitoring have confirmed the presence of the species in north-western Romania, in Galaseni Cave, Padurea Craiului Mountains, representing the northernmost distribution point of R. blasii in Europe. In our study we investigated whether this northernmost colony is genetically isolated from, or related to, larger populations in south-western Romania. A combined analysis of two mitochondrial (12S, HVII) and two nuclear (RAG2, DBY7) genetic markers was used in order to reveal possible relationships between these populations. The small number of haplotypes, the presence of shared haplotypes and overall low population structure suggest that the south-western and north-western Romanian populations are related through yet unidentified colonies of R. blasii, with continuous migration between them. Our results also indicate that the R. blasii colony from Galaseni Cave was established by female individuals migrating not far from their birthplace. To preserve this marginal population in a long term, conservation measures need to be strengthened and properly enforced, in parallel with the search for new R. blasii colonies in the region. To our knowledge, the present work represents the only molecular study of R. blasii in Europe.

AB  - Background: We have previously identified auto-antibody (Ab) to collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2) in patients with encephalitis. The present study aims to evaluate the pathogenic effects of anti-CRMP2 Ab. Methods: Recombinant CRMP2 protein was injected subcutaneously into mice to establish an active immune mouse model with anti-CRMP2 Ab. Behavioral assessments, histopathological staining, and electrophysiological testing were performed to identify any pathogenic changes. Results: The mice exhibited signs of impaired motor coordination four weeks post-immunization of CRMP2 protein. Moreover, CRMP2 immunized mice for eight weeks showed anxiety-like behaviors indicating by tests of open field and the elevated plus maze. After incubating the CA1 region of hippocampal brain section with the sera from CRMP2 immunized mice, the whole-cell path-clamp recordings showed increased excitability of pyramidal neurons. However, no obvious inflammation and infiltration of immune cells were observed by histopathological analysis. Western blot showed that the phosphorylation levels of CRMP2-Thr514 and -Ser522 were not affected. Conclusion: In an active immunization model with CRMP2 protein, impaired coordination and anxiety-like behaviors were observed. Also, anti-CRMP2 Abs containing sera heightened the excitability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in vitro, which imply the pathogenic effects of anti-CRMP2 Ab.

AB  - Anxiety Disorders (ANX) such as panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and phobias, are highly prevalent conditions that are moderately heritable. Evidence suggests that DNA methylation may play a role, as it is involved in critical adaptations to changing environments. Applying an enrichment-based sequencing approach covering nearly 28 million autosomal CpG sites, we conducted a methylome-wide association study (MWAS) of lifetime ANX in 1132 participants (618 cases/514 controls) from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety. Using epigenomic deconvolution, we performed MWAS for the main cell types in blood: granulocytes, T-cells, B-cells and monocytes. Cell-type specific analyses identified 280 and 82 methylome-wide significant associations (q-value < 0.1) in monocytes and granulocytes, respectively. Our top finding in monocytes was located in ZNF823 on chromosome 19 (p = 1.38 x 10(-10)) previously associated with schizophrenia. We observed significant overlap (p < 1 x 10(-06)) with the same direction of effect in monocytes (210 sites), T-cells (135 sites), and B-cells (727 sites) between this Discovery MWAS signal and a comparable replication dataset from the Great Smoky Mountains Study (N = 433). Overlapping Discovery-Replication MWAS signal was enriched for findings from published GWAS of ANX, major depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In monocytes, two specific sites in the FZR1 gene showed significant replication after Bonferroni correction with an additional 15 nominally replicated sites in monocytes and 4 in T-cells. FZR1 regulates neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and its knockout leads to impairments in associative fear memory and long-term potentiation in mice. In the largest and most extensive methylome-wide study of ANX, we identified replicable methylation sites located in genes of potential relevance for brain mechanisms of psychiatric conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Acetate has been shown to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. It is oxi-dized by astrocytes and can thus provide auxiliary energy to the brain in addition to glucose. Therefore, we hypothesized that it may protect against seizures, which is investigated here by feeding glyceryl triacetate (GTA), to provide high amounts of acetate without raising sodium or acid levels.Method: CD1 male mice were fed controlled diets with or without GTA for up to three weeks. Body weights, blood glucose levels, plasma short-chain fatty acid levels, and other hematological parameters were monitored. Seizure thresholds were determined in 6 Hz and maximal electroshock seizure thresh-old (MEST) tests. Antioxidant capacities were evaluated in the cerebral cortex and plasma using a ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay.Results: Body weight gain was similar with both diets with and without GTA in two experiments. Glyceryl triacetate-fed groups showed 2-3-and 1.6-fold increased acetate and propionate levels in plasma, respectively. Glucose levels were unaltered in blood collected from the tail tip but increased in trunk blood. No differences were found in the activity of cerebral cortex acetyl-CoA synthetase. In the 6 Hz threshold test, seizure thresholds were lower by 3 mA and 2.4 mA after 8 and 14 days, respectively, in the GTA compared to the control diet-fed group, but showed no difference on day 16, showing that GTA has small, but inconsistent proconvulsant effects in this model. In MEST tests, a slightly increased seizure threshold (1 mA) was found on day 19 in the GTA-fed group, but not in another experiment on day 21. There were no differences in antioxidant capacity in plasma or cortex between the two groups. Conclusion: Glyceryl triacetate feeding showed no antioxidant effects nor beneficial changes in acute electrical seizure threshold mouse models, despite its ability to increase plasma acetate levels.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ambient temperature has a crucial effect on livestock production performance, behaviors and welfare. In ostrich, previous research primarily focused on survival and reproductive performance during the climatic shifts. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of seasonal variation on behavioral differences of male and female ostrich (Struthio camelus) breeders, reared in farm environment. The individual behaviors related to digestion, locomotor activities, resting, comfort and thermoregulation, reproduction, and aggressive behaviors were recorded. The higher sitting and sleeping behavior were observed in summer season (P <= 0.01 and P <= 0.001, respectively). The thermoregulation behaviors were observed only in summer season (P <= 0.0001). The higher foraging, alertness and spot pecking behaviors were observed in females (P <= 0.01, P <= 0.05, and P <= 0.05, respectively). The boom behavior was only observed in males (P <= 0.05). The higher walking behavior was observed in the afternoon and morning (P <= 0.05). The higher sleeping, dust bathing, grooming and thermoregulation behaviors were observed at noon (P <= 0.001, P <= 0.001, P <= 0.0001 and P <= 0.0001, respectively). There was a significant interaction between season and sex for displace behavior, a sign of aggressive behavior (P=0.006). There was a significant interaction between season and time of day for drinking and defecation related to digestive behaviors (P <= 0.05 and P <= 0.05, respectively); sleeping described as a resting behavior (P=0.0001); dust bathing and grooming which is related to comfort behaviors (P <= 0.0001 and P <= 0.0001); thermoregulation (P <= 0.0001); copulation described as a reproductive behavior (P=0.003); displace and escape behaviors mostly a sign of aggressive behavior (P <= 0.05 and P <= 0.05). Ostriches are diurnal animals with a nomadic lifestyle and have higher activity during the early and late times of the day. Identification of the seasonal, sexual and time of day differences on behavior types of ostriches, provides important information for ostrich management and their welfare.

AB  - It has recently been demonstrated that aromatic bromination at C(2) abolishes all typical psychomotor, and some key prosocial effects of the entactogen MDMA in rats. Nevertheless, the influence of aromatic bromination on MDMA-like effects on higher cognitive functions remains unexplored. In the present work, the effects of MDMA and its brominated analog 2Br-4,5-MDMA (1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.p. each) on visuospatial learning, using a radial, octagonal Olton maze (4 x 4) which may discriminate between short-term and long-term memory, were compared with their influence on in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) in the prefrontal cortex in rats. The results obtained indicate that MDMA diminishes both short- and long-term visuospatial memory but increases LTP. In contrast, 2Br-4,5-MDMA preserves long-term visuospatial memory and slightly accelerates the occurrence of short-term memory compared to controls, but increases LTP, like MDMA. Taken together, these data are consistent with the notion that the modulatory effects induced by the aromatic bromination of the MDMA template, which abolishes typical entactogenic-like responses, might be extended to those effects affecting higher cognitive functions, such as visuospatial learning. This effect seems not to be associated with the increase of LTP in the prefrontal cortex.

AB  - Newly learned information undergoes a process of awake reactivation shortly after the learning offset and we recently demonstrated that this effect can be observed as early as area V1. However, reactivating all experiences can be wasteful and unnecessary, especially for familiar stimuli. Therefore, here we tested whether awake reactivation occurs differentially for new and familiar stimuli. Subjects completed a brief visual task on a stimulus that was either novel or highly familiar due to extensive prior training on it. Replicating our previous results, we found that awake reactivation occurred in V1 for the novel stimulus. On the other hand, brief exposure to the familiar stimulus led to 'awake suppression' such that neural activity patterns immediately after exposure to the familiar stimulus diverged from the patterns associated with that stimulus. Further, awake reactivation was observed selectively in V1, whereas awake suppression had similar strength across areas V1-V3. These results are consistent with the presence of a competition between local awake reactivation and top-down awake suppression, with suppression becoming dominant for familiar stimuli. Bang & Rahnev tested whether awake reactivation occurs differentially for new and familiar stimuli, given that reactivating all experiences can be wasteful. They expose participants to brief visual tasks in which the stimulus was either novel or familiar. They observed that whilst novel stimuli were associated with reactivation of cortical area V1, familiar stimuli led to 'awake suppression' in which neural activity diverged from patterns previously associated with that stimulus. The results support the existence of competition between local awake reactivation and top-down awake suppression, with suppression being dominant for familiar stimuli.

AB  - Simple Summary: Studies have revealed a rapid global and continental loss of genetic resources for native sheep breeds that is more critical in Europe and the Caucasus region. Therefore, an urgent step is needed to halt this negative trend. Viable and functional epididymal spermatozoa could be retrieved from castrated, slaughtered, or accidentally dead animals with good pregnancy outcomes; however, many factors reported to affect the quality and cryo-tolerance of artificial vagina-collected, as well as electro-ejaculated, ram spermatozoa have not been extensively studied in ram epididymal spermatozoa despite being a cheap alternative for gene conservation. Given the context mentioned above, we assessed the effects of three different commercial soy lecithin-based semen extenders (AndroMed (R), BioXcell (R), and OviXcell (R)) and two spermatozoa concentrations (200 x 10(6)/mL vs. 400 x 10(6)/mL) on the freezability of ram epididymal spermatozoa. BioXcell (R) and OviXcell (R) produced significantly higher post-thaw specific kinematics and better protected the ram epididymal spermatozoa head membrane compared to AndroMed (R). In contrast, the normal tail morphology is better maintained in AndroMed (R). The 400 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL concentration better preserved the ram epididymal spermatozoa head membrane integrity. The ideal concentration for cryopreserving ram epididymal spermatozoa is 400 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL. However, the extenders must be optimized for more effective ram epididymal spermatozoa freezing. There are limited studies on the factors affecting the success of ram epididymal spermatozoa (REPS) cryopreservation. On this note, the current study assessed the influence of three commercial soy lecithin-based semen extenders, AndroMed (R) (AND), BioXcell (R) (BIO), and OviXcell (R) (OVI), and two concentrations (400 x 10(6) vs. 200 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL) on the pre-freeze and post-thaw quality of REPS. The REPS were retrieved from nine adult rams' testes and diluted with each of the three extenders to both concentrations. Straws were frozen manually. Standard motility (SMP) and kinematic parameters (KPs) were assessed via a CASA, while spermatozoa viability, morphology, and acrosomal integrity were assessed via the Kov & aacute;cs-Foote staining technique. The concentration did not significantly affect the pre-freeze and post-thaw SMP and KPs of REPS. BIO and OVI had significantly higher pre-freeze and post-thaw BCFs, post-thaw VAP, and the percentage of all intact heads than AND. In contrast, AND had a significantly lower percentage of REPS with tail defects than BIO and OVI. The 400 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL concentration resulted in a significantly higher percentage of all intact heads than the 200 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL concentration. Freezing significantly increased tail defects and decreased the percentage of REPS with distal cytoplasmic droplets. The cryopreservation of REPS at the 400 x 10(6) spermatozoa/mL concentration is recommended. All three extenders must be optimized to preserve the viability, membrane integrity, and better normal morphology of REPS; the reason for increased tail abnormality after the freezing/thawing process needs to be studied.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) have been associated with plant-plant-herbivorous-natural enemies communication and an enhanced response to the subsequent attack. Spodoptera litura is a serious cosmopolitan pest that has developed a high level of resistance to many insecticides. However, the underlying molecular and biochemical mechanism by which HIPV priming reduces S. litura larval sensitivity to insecticides remains largely unknown. This study was conducted to explore the potential of volatile from undamaged, or artificially damaged, or S. litura-damaged tomato plants on the susceptibility of S. litura to the insecticides beta-cypermethrin indoxacarb and chlorpyrifos. We found that larvae exposed to volatile from S. litura-damaged or artificially damaged tomato plants were significantly less susceptible to the three insecticides than those exposed to volatile from undamaged tomato plants. Elevated activities of detoxifying enzymes [cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), and esterases (ESTs)], were expressed in S. litura larvae exposed to volatile from S. litura-damaged tomato plants than those exposed to volatile from undamaged tomato plants. Similarly, seven detoxification-related genes [GSTs (SlGSTe1, SlGSTo1, and SlGSTe3) and P450s (CYP6B48, CYP9A40, CYP321A7, and CYP321B1)] in the midgut and fat body of larvae were up-regulated under exposure to volatile from S. litura-damaged tomato plants. Increased volatile organic compounds emissions were detected in the headspace of tomato plants damaged by S. litura compared to the undamaged plants. Collectively, these findings suggest that HIPVs can considerably reduce caterpillar susceptibility to insecticides, possibly through induction-enhanced detoxification mechanisms, and provide valuable information for implementing an effective integrated pest management strategy.

AB  - Fungi can remarkably sense and adapt to various extracellular stimuli and stress conditions. Oxidative stress, which results from an imbalance between reactive oxygen species production and antioxidant defenses, leads to cellular damage and death. In Trichophyton rubrum, oxidative stress is managed by a complex antioxidant system, including thioredoxins, glutathione, catalases, peroxidases, and superoxide dismutase, with glutathione playing a crucial role. The fungus also responds to oxidative stress through critical pathways such as the glycerol high-osmolarity pathway, activator protein 1 transcription factor, and responsive regulator SKN7. To better understand the role of the transcription factor StuA in regulating oxidative stress-related genes within these pathways, we conducted gene expression studies in Delta stuA mutant and wild-type strains of T. rubrum cultivated in keratin and under oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. Our results revealed significant downregulation of essential antioxidant genes, including glutathione transferases and catalases, in the Delta stuA mutant. Moreover, catalase and glutathione S-transferase activities were impaired in the mutants under stress conditions, highlighting the impact of this mutation. These findings underscore the critical role of StuA in the oxidative stress response and fungal pathogenesis and provide new insights into T. rubrum's adaptive mechanisms.

AB  - Background: Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizures in children. While in most children the outcome is favorable, children with febrile status epilepticus may exhibit modest cognitive impairment. Whether children with other forms of complex febrile seizure, such as repetitive febrile seizures within the same illness are at risk of cognitive deficits is not known. In this study, we used a well established model of experimental febrile seizures in rat pups to compare the effects of febrile status epilepticus and recurrent febrile seizures on subsequent spatial cognition and anxiety. Methods: Male and female rat pups were subjected to hyperthermic seizures at postnatal day 10 and were divided into groups of rats with continuous seizures for >40 min or recurrent febrile seizures. They were then tested as adults in the active avoidance and spatial accuracy tests to assess spatial learning and memory and the elevated plus maze to measure anxiety. Results: Febrile status epilepticus rats demonstrated impaired spatial cognition in active avoidance and spatial accuracy and exhibited reduced anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze. Rats with recurrent febrile seizures did not differ significantly from the controls on any measures. There were also significant sex-related differences with females with FSE performing far better than males with FSE in active avoidance but demonstrating a navigational learning impairment relative to CTL females in spatial accuracy. However, once learned, females with FSE performed the spatial accuracy task as well as CTL females. Conclusion: There is a duration-dependent effect of febrile seizures on subsequent cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Febrile status epilepticus resulted in spatial cognitive deficits and reduced anxiety related behaviors whereas rats with recurrent febrile seizures did not differ from controls. Sex had a remarkable effect on spatial cognitive outcome where males with FSE fared worse than females with FSE. The results demonstrate that sex should be considered as a biological variable in studies evaluating the effects of seizures on the developing brain. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Breast cancer resistance protein/ATP-binding cassette subfamily G2 (BCRP/ABCG2) is an ATP-binding cassette efflux (ABC) transporter expressed in the apical membrane of cells in tissues, such as the liver, intestine, kidney, testis, brain, and mammary gland. It is involved in xenobiotic pharmacokinetics, potentially affecting the efficacy and toxicity of many drugs. In this study, the role of ABCG2 in parasiticide monepantel (MNP) and its primary metabolite, monepantel sulfone (MNPSO2)'s systemic distribution and excretion in milk, was tested using female and male wild-type and Abcg2-/- mice. Liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometer (LCMS/MS) was used for the analysis in a 10-min run time using positive-mode atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization (ESI+) and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scanning. For the primary metabolite tested, milk concentrations were 1.8-fold higher in wild-type mice than Abcg2-/- female lactating mice (P = 0.042) after intravenous administration of MNP. Finally, despite the lack of a difference between groups, we investigated potential differences in MNP and MNPSO2's plasma and tissue accumulation levels between wild-type and Abcg2-/- male mice. In this study, we demonstrated that MNPSO2 milk levels were affected by Abcg2, with potential pharmacological and toxicological consequences, contributing to the undesirable xenobiotic residues in milk.

AB  - Simple Summary: Perinatal twin lamb mortality reduces productivity and reproductive efficiency in Australian sheep meat and wool enterprises. This study investigated whether supplementing 4 g of betaine into the diets of twin-bearing Merino ewes during late pregnancy would improve lamb viability measures and survival to weaning under field conditions. The results indicated that dietary supplementation with betaine increased plasma creatine concentrations in ewes at day 130 of gestation and lamb rectal temperature within 4-24 h following birth. While the findings of this study provide some new, promising results, more research in the field is required before supplementation with betaine during late gestation can be used as an on-farm strategy to improve lamb viability and survival.
   Twin lamb mortality is a significant economic problem impacting the Australian sheep industry. Maternal betaine supplementation improved lamb vigour and early post-natal survival when ewes and lambs were housed indoors, suggesting that betaine may be beneficial to feed under extensive pasture systems. This study investigated whether maternal betaine supplementation during late gestation would improve Merino twin lamb live weight, thermoregulation, vigour and survival to weaning under field conditions. Ewes received dietary betaine at either 0 g/day (CTL; n = 115) or 4 g/day from day 110 of gestation (dG 110) until similar to 49 days post-partum (pp) (BET; n = 115). Measures indicative of lamb viability and survival were collected within 4-24 h of birth and at similar to 49 days pp and similar to 93 days pp. BET ewes had higher creatine and creatinine concentrations at dG 130 than CTL ewes (p < 0.05). BET lambs had a higher rectal temperature within 4-24 h following birth than CTL lambs (p < 0.05). CTL lambs were heavier at similar to 49 days pp and grew faster from birth to similar to 49 days pp than BET lambs (both p < 0.05). The time taken after release from the researcher to first suckling was quicker in the CTL lambs than BET lambs (p < 0.05). This study demonstrated that supplementing betaine increased creatine concentration in twin-bearing ewes and thermoregulatory capacity in neonatal lambs under extensive grazing systems.

AB  - The heart of the date palm is a nutrient-rich vegetable found at the center of palm trees, abundant in protein and dietary fiber, primarily made up of carbohydrates. Preliminary studies indicate that the heart of the date palm possesses healing properties, exhibiting potent cytotoxic effects against HepG2 cells, suggesting its potential in cancer treatment. A low-fat ice cream was created using camel milk, enriched with varying amounts of heart of date palm-4 %, 8 %, and 12% of the mix-as a source of bioactive compounds, protein, and carbohydrates. The effect of the heart of date palm on the physicochemical and biological characteristics of the low-fat ice cream was examined over 28 days of frozen storage. The total bacterial count showed a slight increase in the low-fat ice cream with the heart of date palm added. Additionally, no coliforms were detected in any samples throughout the storage period. The findings revealed that camel milk can yield high-quality, functional low-fat ice cream, demonstrating good flavor, body & texture, appearance, and color when supplemented with up to 12 % heart of date palm as a functional ingredient stored at-18 degrees C.

AB  - MicroRNA-142-5p (miR-142-5p) has been found to be dysregulated in several neurodegenerative disorders. However, little is known about the involvement of miR-142-5p in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain angiogenesis inhibitor 3 (BAI3), which belongs to the adhesion-G protein-coupled receptor subgroup, contributes to a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite its very high expression in neurons, the role of BAI3 in AD remains elusive, and its mechanism at the cellular and molecular levels needs to be further elucidated. The current study sought to investigate whether miR-142-5p influenced BAI3 expression and neuronal synaptotoxicity induced by A beta, both in APP/PS1 transgenic mice and a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease. Altered expression of miR-142-5p was found in the hippocampus of AD mice. Inhibition of miR-142 could upregulate BAI3 expression, enhance neuronal viability and prevent neurons from undergoing apoptosis. In addition, the reduction of phosphorylation of Synapsin I and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), as well as the expression of PSD-95 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice, were significantly restored by inhibiting miR-142. Meanwhile, the levels of A beta 1-42, beta-APP, BACE-1 and PS-1 in cultured neurons were detected, and the effects of inhibiting miR-142 on spatial learning and memory were also observed. Interestingly, we found that BAI3, an important regulator of excitatory synapses, was a potential target gene of miR-142-5p. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-142 inhibition can alleviate the impairment of spatial learning and memory, reduce the level of apoptosis, and upregulate the expression of pCaMKII and BAI3 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice; thus, appropriate interference of miR-142 may provide a potential therapeutic approach to rescue cognitive dysfunction in AD patients.

AB  - Metastasis is the major culprit of treatment failure in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like 2 (ARNTL2), a core circadian gene, plays a crucial role in the development of various tumors. Nevertheless, the biological role and mechanism of ARNTL2 are not fully elucidated in NPC. In this study, ARNTL2 expression was significantly upregulated in NPC tissues and cells. Overexpression of ARNTL2 facilitated NPC cell migration and invasion abilities, while inhibition of ARNTL2 in similarly treated cells blunted migration and invasion abilities in vitro. Consistently, in vivo xenograft tumor models revealed that ARNTL2 silencing reduced nude mice inguinal lymph node and lung metastases, as well as tumor growth. Mechanistically, ARNTL2 negatively regulated the transcription expression of AMOTL2 by directly binding to the AMOTL2 promoter, thus reducing the recruitment and stabilization of AMOTL2 to LATS1/2 kinases, which strengthened YAP nuclear translocation by suppressing LATS-dependent YAP phosphorylation. Inhibition of AMOTL2 counteracted the effects of ARNTL2 knockdown on NPC cell migration and invasion abilities. These findings suggest that ARNTL2 may be a promising therapeutic target to combat NPC metastasis and further supports the crucial roles of circadian genes in cancer development.

AB  - Simple Summary It is known that the death rate amongst giraffes during immobilisation, capture and transportation is high. However, during this study period (2011 to 2021), 75 giraffes were captured for the collection of various samples and purposes and none of these individuals died. General experiences and lessons learned during these captures are described. Data on the knockdown times on 43 occasions of giraffe immobilisation were recorded and analysed. We hope that this shared information could help in shaping future standard operating procedures to increase the success of handling giraffes and ultimately contribute to the conservation of the species. One of the highest occurrences of mortalities among giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) takes place during immobilisations, captures and translocations. Common mistakes, human error, unforeseen risks, the awkward anatomy and the sheer size of the animal are leading factors for giraffes' mortalities during these operations. Many risks can be circumvented but some risks are unpreventable, often due to terrain characteristics (rivers, deep ditches, holes and rocky terrain). From 2011 to 2021, seventy-five giraffes were successfully immobilised and captured to collect biological and physiological data from eight different study areas across South Africa. A 0% mortality and injury rate was achieved and, therefore, the techniques described in this paper are testimony to the advances and improvements of capture techniques and drugs. Biological information and capture experiences were noted for 75 immobilised giraffes, of which, knockdown time data were recorded for 43 individuals. Effective and safe immobilisation requires a competent team, proper planning, skill and knowledge. In this manuscript, we address procedures, techniques, ethical compliance, welfare and safety of the study animals. General experiences and lessons learned are also shared and should benefit future captures and immobilisations by limiting the risks involved. The sharing of experiences and information could influence and improve critical assessments of different capture techniques and can likely contribute to the success rate of immobilisation and translocation success for giraffes in the future.

AB  - Background: Calorie restriction (CR) is suggested to activate protective mechanisms in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Despite existing literature highlighting the protective role of Sirtuin (SIRT) proteins against agerelated neurodegeneration (ND), no study has explored the total levels of SIRT 1, 3, and 6 proteins simultaneously in brain homogenates by ELISA following intermittent calorie restriction. Applying CR protocols in mice to induce stress, we aimed to determine whether ND would be more pronounced with ad libitum (AL) or with CR. Methods: Mice were randomly assigned to ad libitum (AL), Chronic CR (CCR), or Intermittent CR (ICR) groups at 10 weeks of baseline age (BL). SIRT 1, 3, and 6 protein levels were measured in the homogenized whole-brain supernatants of 49/50 weeks old mice by the ELISA method. Neuronal morphology was evaluated by the cresyl violet on the hippocampus. Neurodegeneration (ND) was assessed by the fluoro-jade and ImageJ was used for quantifications. Results: In the ICR group, SIRT1 levels were elevated compared to both the AL and BL groups. Similarly, the CCR group exhibited higher SIRT1 values compared to the AL and BL groups. While SIRT3 levels were higher in both the ICR and CCR groups compared to the AL and BL groups, this disparity did not reach statistical significance. SIRT6 levels were also higher in the ICR group compared to both the BL and AL groups, with the CCR group showing higher values compared to the BL and AL groups as well. Image quantification demonstrated significant neurodegeneration in the AL group compared to the CCR and ICR group, with no observed alterations in nerve cell morphology and number. Conclusion: This study revealed that the levels of SIRT 1, SIRT 3, and SIRT 6 in brain tissue were notably elevated, and there was less evidence of ND at the 50-week mark in groups undergoing continuous calorie restriction and intermittent calorie restriction compared to baseline and ad libitum groups. Our findings illustrate that CR promotes increased SIRT expression in the mouse brain, thereby potentially mitigating neurodegeneration.

AB  - Phagocytosis by macrophages dates back to a long history in science, this present study deals with new approaches that have been analyzed and standardized towards the interesting aspects of primary and secondary macrophages. The distinct morphological differences in primary and secondary phagocytic cells were observed and the phagocytic response of secondary macrophages under the influence of 7-ketocholesterol and lipopolysaccharide was analyzed. The primary peritoneal and secondary IC-21 cells unveiled explicit differences in nuclear numbers shapes and sizes of the granules present within the cytoplasmic region. Further, potent inducers 7KCh and LPS influenced an effective activation of IC-21 macrophages and resulted in ROS generation, irregulated protein expressions of CD86, CD68, and CD206 with enhanced phagocytic responses towards goat, cow, and human RBC targets with significant phagocytic rate and index were observed. Moreover, a remarkable observation of target specificity and aggregations with IC-21 phagocytic macrophages revealed the notion that specific membrane receptors and secretory molecules (lysosomes) are primarily involved in their phagocytic mechanism.Research Highlights IC-21 macrophages are peritoneal origin from mice but the primary peritoneal macrophages and cell line show distinct differences. IC-21 macrophages express target-specific phagocytosis. Phagocytosis in IC-21 macrophages is regulated by CD markers (68, 86, and 206).
   Morphological differences between the mice primary peritoneal macrophages and IC-21 secondary macrophage cell line which serve as M2 phenotypic subset. IC-21 macrophages upon activation with optimal 7KCh and LPS expressed M1 characteristics through increased phagocytosis and ROS generation with dysregulated scavenging receptors (CD68, 86, and 206). image

AB  - Identification of novel drugs for anti-African swine fever (ASF) applications is of utmost urgency, as it negatively affects pig farming and no effective vaccine or treatment is currently available. African swine fever virus (ASFV) encoded pS273R is a cysteine protease that plays an important role in virus replication. E64, acting as an inhibitor of cysteine protease, has been established as exerting an inhibitory effect on pS273R. In order to obtain a better understanding of the interaction between E64 and pS273R, common docking, restriction docking, and covalent docking were employed to analyze the optimal bonding position between pS273R-E64 and its bonding strength. Additionally, three sets of 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to examine the conformational dynamics of pS273R and the dynamic interaction of pS273R-E64, based on a variety of analytical methods including root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), free energy of ligand (FEL), principal component analysis (PCA), and molecular mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) analysis. The results show that E64 and pS273R exhibited close binding degrees at the activity center of ASFV pS273R protease. The data of these simulations indicate that binding of E64 to pS273R results in a reduction in flexibility, particularly in the ARM region, and a change in the conformational space of pS273R. Additionally, the ability of E64 to interact with polar amino acids such as ASN158, SER192, and GLN229, as well as charged amino acids such as LYS167 and HIS168, seems to be an important factor in its inhibitory effect. Finally, Octet biostratigraphy confirmed the binding of E64 and pS273R with a KD value of 903 uM. Overall, these findings could potentially be utilized in the development of novel inhibitors of pS273R to address the challenges posed by ASFV.

AB  - Several studies have indicated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) can lead to detrusor overactivity (DO), but the underlying mechanisms are not known. Hydrogen dioxide (H2O2) is used commonly to investigate the effects of ROS. In present study, we investigated the effects of H2O2 on phasic spontaneous bladder contractions (SBCs) of isolated human-bladder strips (iHBSs) and the underlying mechanisms. Samples of bladder tissue were obtained from 26 patients undergoing cystectomy owing to bladder cancer. SBCs of iHBSs were recorded in organ-bath experiments. H2O2 (1 mu M-10mM) concentration-dependently increased the SBCs of iHBSs. These enhancing ef-fects could be mimicked by an agonist of transient receptor potential (TRP)A1 channels (allyl isothiocyanate) and blocked with an antagonist of TRPA1 channels (HC030031; 10 mu M). H2O2 induced enhancing effects also could be attenuated by desensitizing sensory afferents with capsaicin (10 mu M), blocking nerve firing with TTX (1 mu M), blocking neurokinin effects with NK2 receptor antagonist (SR48968, 10 mu M), and blocking PGE2 synthesis with indomethacin (10 mu M), respectively. Our study: (i) suggests activation of TRPA1 channels on bladder sensory afferents, and then release of substance P or PGE2 from sensory nerve terminals, contribute to the H2O2-induced enhancing effects on SBCs of iHBSs; (ii) provides insights for the mechanisms underlying ROS leading to DO; (iii) indicates that targeting TRPA1 channels might be the promising strategy against overactive bladder in conditions associated with excessive production of ROS.

AB  - There are few existing publications that describe transvaginal ultrasound -guided Ovum Pick -Up (OPU) in sows, and the impacts of the procedure for the welfare of the animals are unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of OPU, performed following restraint in a claw -trimming chute, on the animal welfare and reproductive health of second parity hybrid sows. The study utilized a generalized randomized block design at a commercial sow pool. We assessed salivary cortisol levels before, during, and after the procedure to compare the physiological stress response between OPU and restraint chute procedures (control group). We found a significant increase in salivary cortisol caused by the physical restraint procedure, and that the salivary cortisol level at the end of the procedure did not differ between OPU and control groups (p = 0.51). Furthermore, we conducted a novel approach -aversion test for sows, designed to assess if a feed reward would motivate the animals to willingly participate in the OPU-procedure. The animals were trained daily to enter the chute to access a feed reward. Ten animals in each group failed to complete the training period and did not voluntarily enter the restraint chute on the experimental day. This indicates that even the short daily restraint procedure during the four -day long training period was aversive to some animals. There was no difference in aversion towards the restraint chute between OPU and control groups one day after the procedure. The reproductive performance of the animals was subsequently evaluated through oestrus synchronization and insemination of the sows after the experiment. There was no observed difference in the farrowing rate (p = 0.72) and total number of born piglets (p = 0.84) between OPU and control sows. On average, we retrieved 9.0 +/- 5.9 oocytes during the OPU-sessions (N = 26). Our results show that a majority of the sows prioritize the motivation for feed over their aversion to the OPU procedure. However, the physical restraint procedure is unpleasant for the animals and elicits a temporary stress response. We suggest that transvaginal OPU may be used for the recovery of oocytes from live sows, but refinements are needed to avoid stress during the lifting procedure. Such modifications could also potentially reduce the observed inter -individual variations in oocyte recovery outcomes.

AB  - Background: Although a growing body of research has indicated a strong link between oxidative stress and epilepsy, the exact nature of their interaction remains elusive. To elucidate this intricate relationship, we conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis employing two independent datasets. Methods: A two-sample MR analysis was performed using instrumental variables derived from genome-wide association study summary statistics of oxidative stress injury biomarkers (OSIB) and epilepsy. The OSIBs were selected from eight primary metabolic pathways associated with oxidative stress. Additionally, seven distinct epilepsy phenotypes were considered, which encompassed all epilepsy, generalized epilepsy, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, focal epilepsy, focal epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (focal HS), focal epilepsy with lesions other than HS (focal NHS), and lesion-negative focal epilepsy. Causal estimates were computed using the inverse-variance weighted method or the Wald ratio method, and the robustness of causality was assessed through sensitivity analyses. Results: For OSIB and epilepsy, 520 and 23 genetic variants, respectively, were selectively extracted as instrumental variants. Genetically predicted higher kynurenine level was associated with a decreased risk of focal epilepsy (odds ratio [OR] 1.950, 95% CI 1.373-2.528, p = .023) and focal NHS (OR 1.276, 95% CI 1.100-1.453, p = .006). For reverse analysis, there was a suggestive effect of focal NHS on urate (OR 1.19 x 10(15), 95% CI 11.19 x 10(15) to 1.19 x 10(15), p = .0000746) and total bilirubin (Tb) (OR 4.98, 95% CI 3.423-6.543, p = .044). In addition, genetic predisposition to focal HS was associated with higher Tb levels (OR 9.83, 95% CI 7.77-11.888, p = .034). Conclusion: This MR study provides compelling evidence of a robust association between oxidative stress and epilepsy, with a notable emphasis on a causal relationship between oxidative stress and focal epilepsy. Additional research is warranted to confirm the connection between oxidative stress and the risk of epilepsy and to unravel the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Age-related neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are associated with the aggregation and propagation of specific pathogenic protein species (e.g., Ab, a-synuclein). However, whether disruption of synaptic homeo-stasis results from protein misfolding per se rather than accumulation of a specific rogue protein is an unex-plored question. Here, we show that error-prone translation, with its frequent outcome of random protein misfolding, is sufficient to recapitulate many early features of NDDs, including perturbed Ca2+ signaling, neuronal hyperexcitability, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Mice expressing the ribosomal ambiguity muta-tion Rps9 D95N exhibited disrupted synaptic homeostasis resulting in behavioral changes reminiscent of early Alzheimer disease (AD), such as learning and memory deficits, maladaptive emotional responses, epileptiform discharges, suppressed circadian rhythmicity, and sleep fragmentation, accompanied by hippo-campal NPY expression and cerebral glucose hypometabolism. Collectively, our findings suggest that random protein misfolding may contribute to the pathogenesis of age-related NDDs, providing an alternative framework for understanding the initiation of AD.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) signifies a major cause of death and disability. TBI causes central nervous system (CNS) damage under a variety of mechanisms, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Astrocytes and microglia, cells of the CNS, are considered the key players in initiating an inflammatory response after injury. Several evidence suggests that activation of astrocytes/microglia and ROS/LPO have the potential to cause more harmful effects in the pathological processes following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Previous studies have established that lupeol provides neuroprotection through modulation of inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in A beta and LPS model and neurodegenerative disease. However, the effects of lupeol on apoptosis caused by inflammation and oxidative stress in TBI have not yet been investigated. Therefore, we explored the role of Lupeol on antiapoptosis, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative stress and its potential mechanism following TBI. In these experiments, adult male mice were randomly divided into four groups: control, TBI, TBI+ Lupeol, and Sham group. Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and ROS/LPO assays were performed to investigate the role of lupeol against neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Lupeol treatment reversed TBI-induced behavioral and memory disturbances. Lupeol attenuated TBI-induced generation of reactive oxygen species/lipid per oxidation (ROS/LPO) and improved the antioxidant protein level, such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1) in the mouse brain. Similarly, our results indicated that lupeol treatment inhibited glial cell activation, p-NF-kappa B, and downstream signaling molecules, such as TNF-alpha, COX-2, and IL-1 beta, in the mouse cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, lupeol treatment also inhibited mitochondrial apoptotic signaling molecules, such as caspase-3, Bax, cytochrome-C, and reversed deregulated Bcl2 in TBI-treated mice. Overall, our study demonstrated that lupeol inhibits the activation of astrocytes/microglia and ROS/LPO that lead to oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis followed by TBI.

AB  - The flavoprotein kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is localised to the outer mitochondrial membrane and catalyses the synthesis of 3-hydroxykynurenine from L-kynurenine, a key step in the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation. Perturbation of KP metabolism due to inflammation has long been associated with the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD)-which is caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine stretch in the huntingtin (HTT) protein. While HTT is primarily localised to the cytoplasm, it also associates with mitochondria, where it may physically interact with KMO. In order to test this hypothesis, we employed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and found that KMO physically interacts with soluble HTT exon 1 protein fragment in living cells. Notably, expansion of the disease-causing polyglutamine tract in HTT leads to the formation of proteinaceous intracellular inclusions that disrupt this interaction with KMO, markedly decreasing BiFC efficiency. Using confocal microscopy and ultrastructural analysis, we determined KMO and HTT localisation within the cell and found that the KMO-HTT interaction is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. These data suggest that KMO may interact with a pool of HTT at the mitochondrial membrane, highlighting a possible physiological role for mitochondrial HTT. The KMO-HTT interaction is abrogated upon polyglutamine expansion, which may indicate a heretofore unrecognized relevance in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

AB  - Background: Early life stress can cause cognitive impairment in aged offspring. Environmental enrichment (EE) is considered to be an effective non-pharmacological treatment for improving cognitive decline. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of EE, on cognitive impairment in aged offspring induced by maternal sleep deprivation (MSD) and the underlying mechanisms involved to investigate its potential value in clinical practice. Methods: CD-1 damns were subjected or not to sleep deprivation during late gestation. Twenty-one days after birth, the offspring were assigned to standard or EE cages. At 18 months-old, the learning and memory function of the offspring mice was evaluated using Morris water maze. The hippocampal and prefrontal cortical levels of protein, gene, proinflammation cytokines, and oxidative stress indicators was examined by Western blot, realtime polymerase chain reaction, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and biochemical assays. Results: Offspring in MSD group exhibited declined learning and memory abilities compared with control animals. Moreover, the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical levels of Sirtuin1 (Sirt1), peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha), postsynaptic density protein-95, and synaptophysin were lower and those of proinflammation cytokines higher in the MSD group; meanwhile, the superoxide dismutase content was higher and the malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species contents were lower. However, these deleterious changes were ameliorated by exposure to EE. Conclusions: EE attenuates MSD-induced cognitive impairment, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation and reverses the reduction in synaptic protein levels in aged offspring mice via the Sirt1/PGC-1 alpha pathway.

AB  - PurposeCervical cancer (CC), a significant global health threat, necessitates comprehensive understanding for improved therapeutic interventions. Many research indicates that dysregulation of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway leads to uncontrolled proliferation and invasion of tumor cells, promoting the progression of various cancers. This article aims to elucidate the role of RNF6 in CC and its regulation of the Hippo-YAP1 signaling pathway.MethodsThe public tumor dataset analyses, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting were used to explore the expression of RNF6 in CC. Gain- and loss-of-function assays were conducted to elucidate the role of RNF6 in the proliferation and invasion of CC cells. Transcriptome sequencing was used to explore RNF6's role in cervical cancer, with validation of its regulation of the Hippo-YAP1 pathway through western blotting and RT-qPCR. Co-transfection of YAP overexpression plasmids into RNF6-silenced CC cells were preformed to confirm YAP1's pivotal role in RNF6-mediated CC progression. Animal experiments were preformed to further validate RNF6 interference's inhibitory effect on CC proliferation in vivo.ResultsClinical samples and bioinformatics analysis revealed high expression of RNF6 in CC, and closely associated with advanced FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage, larger tumor size, and poor prognosis. Cellular functional experiments demonstrate that RNF6 promotes the proliferation, invasion, and migration of CC cells, while knockdown of RNF6 yields the opposite effect. Transcriptome sequencing further reveals that RNF6 may promote CC progression through the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Western blotting and RT-qPCR further unveil that RNF6 enhances the upregulation of YAP1 protein levels, thereby activating downstream oncogenes CTGF and CYR61 transcription. Additionally, exogenous overexpression of YAP1 reverses the inhibitory effect of RNF6 silencing on CC proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, RNF6 interference significantly attenuates tumor growth in vivo experiments.ConclusionOur research reveals that RNF6 is highly expressed in CC, driving malignant progression by upregulating YAP1 protein expression and enhancing the transcription of downstream target genes CTGF and CYR61, offering potential therapeutic targets for CC treatment.

AB  - Mitochondrial Ca2+ transport is essential for regulating cell bioenergetics, Ca2+ signaling and cell death. Mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ via the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), whereas Ca2+ is extruded by the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ (mtNCX) and H+/Ca2+ exchangers. The balance between these processes is essential for preventing toxic mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. Recent work demonstrated that MCU activity varies significantly among tissues, likely reflecting tissue-specific Ca2+ signaling and energy needs. It is less clear whether this diversity in MCU activity is matched by tissue-specific diversity in mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion. Here we compared properties of mitochondrial Ca2+ extrusion in three tissues with prominent mitochondria function: brain, heart and liver. At the transcript level, expression of the Na+/Ca2+/Li+ exchanger (NCLX), which has been proposed to mediate mtNCX transport, was significantly greater in liver than in brain or heart. At the functional level, Na+ robustly activated Ca2+ efflux from brain and heart mitochondria, but not from liver mitochondria. The mtNCX inhibitor CGP37157 blocked Ca2+ efflux from brain and heart mitochondria but had no effect in liver mitochondria. Replacement of Na+ with Li+ to test the involvement of NCLX, resulted in a slowing of mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux by similar to 70 %. Collectively, our findings suggest that mtNCX is responsible for Ca2+ extrusion from the mitochondria of the brain and heart, but plays only a small, if any, role in mitochondria of the liver. They also reveal that Li+ is significantly less effective than Na+ in driving mitochondrial Ca2+ efflux.

AB  - Phosphor-converted white laser diode (pc-wLD) technology requires high-color-quality white light, which involves the development of an efficient red-emitting phosphor color converter. With regard to this, we have developed a new kind of orange-yellow-emitting Lu2-xMg2Al2-yGaySi2O12:xCe(3+) (LMAGS:Ce3+) solid-solution phosphor, which shows the desired abundant red-emissive components and nanosecond-range luminescent decay. LMAGS:Ce3+ is further compounded into an all-inorganic phosphor-in-glass (PiG) composite tightly bonded to a high-thermal-conductivity sapphire plate (SP) in the form of a film. There is no obvious interfacial reaction between phosphor and glass during co-sintering, which ensures good luminescent properties are retained. A comparative study was conducted to reveal the microstructure-property relationship and the key influencing factors of luminescence saturation upon being driven by a blue laser. "One-dimensional photonic crystal film" and "phosphor wheel" designs were adopted to further enhance the luminescent performance, successfully improving the luminous flux of the generated white light to 393.8 lm @ 5 W mm(-2) under static-transmissive excitation mode and 1080 lm @ 20 W mm(-2) under rotatory-reflective excitation mode. Probing into the luminescence saturation mechanism, the effects of thermal saturation and optical saturation were demonstrated, accounting for 44.0% and 56.0% contributions, respectively. A fabricated prototype neutral/warm-white LD lighting source based on LMAGS:Ce3+ PiG film-on-SP shows high light collimation and comfortable visual perception, demonstrating the bright application potentials of the developed composite material.

AB  - In dense, energy-demanding urban areas, the effective utilization of solar energy resources, encompassing building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems and solar water heating (SWH) systems inside buildings, holds paramount importance for addressing concerns related to carbon emission reduction and the balance of energy supply and demand. This study aimed to examine the interplay between urban residential blocks and their solar energy potential, with the objective of promoting environmentally sustainable development within urban residential areas. The primary focus of this study was the hot summer and cold winter zone of China, which serves as a representative case study. Methodologically, we employed Rhinoceros and Grasshopper (GH) software version GH6.0 tools to simulate the solar radiation potential within residential blocks and translated this information into the potential utilization of BIPV and SWH systems. Subsequently, our focus was directed towards identifying optimal locations for mounting BIPV modules and water heaters on roofs and building facades. The study results revealed the following: (1) The floor area ratio (FAR), building density (BD), average building height (ABH), and space layout (SL) exerted substantial influences on the solar potential of a residential block, with correlations of up to 75%, 71%, 78%, and 50%, respectively, concerning the overall solar potential of the entire plot. (2) It is essential to emphasize that, with regard to the BIPV installation potential, facades account for 80% of the overall residential block potential, whereas rooftops contribute only 20%. Both south- and west-facing facades exhibited a BIPV installation ratio of approximately 34%. (3) In the realm of solar water heating, the potential for installations on building facades accounted for 77% of the total living area of the residential blocks, 23% on the rooftops, and 35% on the south-facing facades. This study furnishes practical guidelines for harnessing the potential of BIPV and SWH systems within residential blocks, thereby contributing to the advancement of sustainable urban development practices.

AB  - The ablative laser processing with ultrashort pulsed laser beams may cause secondary emission of hazardous X-rays. While the effect has recently been proven to be considered in working safety regulations when processing technical materials, such as metals, the X-ray emission rates during the ablative processing of biological tissue materials are widely unexplored yet. Therefore, biological materials like water, isotonic saline solution, pig eyes, and human teeth were ablated with ultrashort laser pulses of 1030 nm wavelength, 600 fs pulse duration and 5 kHz pulse repetition rate, aiming to mimic typical surgery situations. Simultaneously, in-situ X-ray dose rate measurements were performed at a short distance from the plasma to display potential X-ray emission. For all four studied biological materials, our measurements prove the secondary emission of laser-induced X-rays.

AB  - -Parkinson's disease is associated with neuronal loss in the midbrain and the resulting development of dopamine-deficient states. At the later stages of the disease, increased neuronal death is also observed in other parts of the brain. We hypothesized that dopamine may function as a glutamate antagonist, and dopamine deficiency may increase glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Using rat hippocampal primary culture and fluorescence microscopy, we show that dopamine reduces the amplitude of calcium response evoked by the activation of NMDA receptors but does not affect calcium signals mediated by AMPA and KA receptors. Voltage-gated calcium channels are also unaffected by dopamine. It was shown that the effect of dopamine depends not only on NMDA receptors, but also on D2-type dopamine receptors and on GABA(A) receptor. Dopamine reduced glutamate-induced mitochondrial depolarization and improved neuronal survival in the presence of toxic levels of glutamate. The data presented suggest a protective role of dopamine against glutamate toxicity.

AB  - Neurotransmission at synapses is mediated by the fusion and subsequent endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membranes. Actin has been suggested to be required for presynaptic endocytosis but the mechanisms that control actin polymerization and its mode of action within presynaptic nerve terminals remain poorly understood. We combine optical recordings of presynaptic membrane dynamics and ultrastructural analysis with genetic and pharmacological manipulations to demonstrate that presynaptic endocytosis is controlled by actin regulatory diaphanous-related formins mDia1/3 and Rho family GTPase signaling in mouse hippocampal neurons. We show that impaired presynaptic actin assembly in the near absence of mDia1/3 and reduced RhoA activity is partly compensated by hyperactivation of Rac1. Inhibition of Rac1 signaling further aggravates impaired presynaptic endocytosis elicited by loss of mDia1/3. Our data suggest that interdependent mDia1/3-Rho and Rac1 signaling pathways cooperatively act to facilitate synaptic vesicle endocytosis by controlling presynaptic F-actin.

AB  - IntroductionEpisodic memory formation requires the binding of multiple associations to a coherent episodic representation, with rich detail of times, places, and contextual information. During postnatal development, the ability to recall episodic memories emerges later than other types of memory such as object recognition. However, the precise developmental trajectory of episodic memory, from weaning to adulthood has not yet been established in rats. Spontaneous object exploration tasks do not require training, and allow repeated testing of subjects, provided novel objects are used on each trial. Therefore, these tasks are ideally suited for the study of the ontogeny of episodic memory and its constituents (e.g., object, spatial, and contextual memory). MethodsIn the present study, we used four spontaneous short-term object exploration tasks over two days: object (OR), object-context (OCR), object-place (OPR), and object-place-context (OPCR) recognition to characterise the ontogeny of episodic-like memory and its components in three commonly used outbred rat strains (Lister Hooded, Long Evans Hooded, and Sprague Dawley). ResultsIn longitudinal studies starting at 3-4 weeks of age, we observed that short term memory for objects was already present at the earliest time point we tested, indicating that it is established before the end of the third week of life (consistent with several other reports). Object-context memory developed during the fifth week of life, while both object-in-place and the episodic-like object-place-context memory developed around the seventh postnatal week. To control for the effects of previous experience in the development of associative memory, we confirmed these developmental trajectories using a cross-sectional protocol. DiscussionOur work provides robust evidence for different developmental trajectories of recognition memory in rats depending on the content and/or complexity of the associations and emphasises the utility of spontaneous object exploration tasks to assess the ontogeny of memory systems with high temporal resolution.

AB  - Evaluation of sperm motility is well-established in farm animals for quickly selecting ejaculates for semen processing into insemination doses and for evaluating the quality of preserved semen. Likewise, sperm motility is a fundamental parameter used by spermatologists in basic and applied science. Motility is commonly assessed using computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). Recent increases in computational power, as well as utilization of mobile CASA systems and open-source CASA programs, broaden the possibilities for motility evaluation. Despite this technological progress, the potential of computer-generated motility data to assess male fertility remains challenging and may be limited. Relevance for fertility assessment could be improved if mea-surement conditions would more closely mimic the in vivo situation. Hence, this review is focused on the current trends of automated semen assessment in livestock and explores perspectives for future use with respect to the physiological and physical conditions encountered by sperm in the female reproductive tract. Validation of current CASA systems with more complex, microfluidic-based devices mimicking the female reproductive tract environment could improve the value of sperm kinematic data for assessing the fertilizing capacity of semen samples, not only for application in livestock but also for use in conducting assisted reproduction techniques in other species.

AB  - Background: Mnemonic discrimination (MD) involves distinguishing new stimuli from highly similar memories; it is impaired in the elderly and individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and may also probe hippocampal dentate gyrus function. Measuring MD is, therefore, highly relevant; however, the gold-standard MD test, the mnemonic similarity task (MST), is rarely used in clinical research. Thus, it would be useful to develop a novel MD index applicable to recognition memory tasks that are commonly used in clinical research. The present study develops such a measure and demonstrates its convergent validity with the gold-standard MD index from the MST. Methods: We derived participant-level indices of MD (lambda) and overall recognition memory performance (Delta) by fitting a logistic function to the relationship between stimulus interference and the probability of classifying a stimulus as novel. We then applied these novel measures to two independent MST datasets (N = 18; N = 67) and to simulated MST data. We used linear mixed-effects model to test whether (1) lambda predicts the MST's MD measure, the lure discrimination index (LDI), and (2) Delta predicts the MST's overall recognition memory index (REC). Results: lambda predicted LDI (beta = 0.76, 95% CI [0.62, 0.91], p < 0.001) but not REC (beta = 0.06, 95% CI [-0.03, 0.15], p = 0.197), while Delta predicted REC (beta = 0.93, 95% CI [0.83, 1.02], p < 0.001) but not LDI (beta = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.20, 0.09], p = 0.438). The lambda and Delta indices were statistically independent, although simulations with synthetic data suggest that MD measurement may be compromised if overall recognition memory performance is impaired. Conclusion: We have developed a novel measure of MD applicable to two-choice recognition memory tasks that use stimuli with continuously varying degrees of similarity. Future studies should further validate this measure using large clinical datasets that include both MD and other recognition memory tasks.

AB  - In recent years, many scientists have studied the effects of polymer micro- and nanostructures on living organisms. As it turns out, plastic can be a component of the blood of livestock, eaten by humans around the globe. Thus, it seems important to investigate possible changes in the physicochemical parameters and morphology of the cell membranes of blood morphotic elements (red blood cells and platelets) under the influence of polymer particles. The article presents research in which cell membranes were exposed to plain polystyrene (PS) and amino-functionalized polystyrene (PS-NH2) of two different sizes. The polymers were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and dynamic light-scattering methods. To analyze possible changes caused by polymer exposure in the structure of the membranes, their zeta potentials were measured using the electrophoretic light-scattering technique. The concentration of the polymers, as well as the exposure time, were also taken into the consideration during the research. Based on the obtained results, we concluded that 100 and 200 nm PS, as well as 100 nm PS-NH2, internalize into the cells. On the contrary, 200 nm PS-NH2 particles attach to cell membranes. Our study clearly shows that particle size and surface chemistry determine the interaction with biological membranes.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is associated with neuronal loss in the midbrain and the resulting development of dopamine-deficient states. At the later stages of the disease, increased neuronal death is also observed in other parts of the brain. We hypothesized that dopamine may function as a glutamate antagonist, and dopamine deficiency may increase glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Using rat hippocampal primary culture and fluorescence microscopy, we show that dopamine reduces the amplitude of calcium response evoked by the activation of NMDA receptors but does not affect calcium signals mediated by AMPA and KA receptors. Voltage-gated calcium channels are also unaffected by dopamine. It was shown that the effect of dopamine depends not only on NMDA receptors, but also on D2-type dopamine receptors and on the GABAA receptor. Dopamine reduced glutamate-induced mitochondrial depolarization and improved neuronal survival in the presence of toxic levels of glutamate. The data presented suggest a protective role of dopamine against glutamate toxicity.

AB  - Simple Summary: Our study aimed to understand how melatonin affects reproductive parameters in Bafra rams during the non-breeding season. One group of rams received melatonin implants, while another served as the control. We measured testicular volume, blood flow, and semen quality over several weeks. The results showed that melatonin increased testicular size and blood flow. This suggests that providing melatonin implants before the non-breeding season may improve reproductive capacity. Our objectives were to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin on testicular volume (TV), testicular blood flow (TBF), and semen quality in Bafra rams during the non-breeding season. One group of rams (MEL, n = 5) received a 36 mg melatonin implant twice, with 30 days in between, while the other group (CON, n = 5) served as the control. TBF, TV, and semen quality parameters were determined at three-week intervals starting three weeks before until twelve weeks after the first melatonin implant. Testicular blood flow was determined in the supratesticular (STA) and marginal testicular artery (MA) using color Doppler ultrasound. Semen was collected and evaluated, and the total oxidative status (TOS) and total antioxidative status (TAS) was determined using an ELISA. The MEL group had increased (p < 0.05) TV between the sixth and twelfth week after the start of treatment. Overall, the MEL group had lower resistance and pulsatility indexes (p < 0.05) between the third and ninth week, although there was no difference (p > 0.05) between the two groups in most semen quality parameters. However, TAS concentrations increased (p < 0.05) in the MEL group compared with the CON. The results of this study show that exogenous melatonin in the non-breeding season significantly increased both TBF and TV in Bafra rams. Therefore, giving rams implants with 36 mg melatonin twice at least one month prior to the non-breeding season is expected to improve testicular size and function and reproductive capacity.

AB  - Context. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and glutathione peroxidase 5 (GPX5) are biomarkers of oxidative stress and stress in temperate, tropical environments, which are crucial for male reproduction. Their expression and distribution patterns in the testis and epididymis of Bactrian camels are still unknown. Aims. This study aims to investigate the HSP70 and GPX5 expression and localisation in 3-and 6-year-old Bactrian camel testis and epididymis. Methods. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect HSP70 in the testis and epididymis (caput, corpus and cauda) and GPX5 in the epididymis at two developmental stages (3-year-old puberty group and 6-year-old adult group). Key results. HSP70 was upregulated in the testis. Immunohistochemistry results indicated the HSP70 protein was mainly detected in spermatids and Leydig cells of testicular tissue. In the epididymis, HSP70 was located at the luminal spermatozoa, the epithelium lining the epididymal and the epididymal interstitium. GPX5 expression was significantly higher in the caput epididymis than in the corpus and cauda epididymis. GPX5 protein was observed in the epithelium lining the epididymal, interstitium and luminal spermatozoa in the epididymis by immunohistochemistry. Conclusions. Bactrian camel HSP70 and GPX5 exhibited spatiotemporal expression specificity. Implications. HSP70 and GPX5 may be essential for germ cell development and reproductive success after sexual maturation in Sonid Bactrian camels.

AB  - Steroid sulphatase (STS) cleaves sulphate groups from steroid hormones, and steroid (sulphate) levels correlate with mood and age-related cognitive decline. In animals, STS inhibition or deletion of the associated gene, enhances memory/neuroprotection and alters hippocampal neurochemistry. Little is known about the consequences of constitutive STS deficiency on memory-related processes in humans. We investigated self-reported memory performance (Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire), word-picture recall and recent mood (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, K10) in adult males with STS deficiency diagnosed with the dermatological condition X-linked ichthyosis (XLI; n = 41) and in adult female carriers of XLI-associated genetic variants (n = 79); we compared results to those obtained from matched control subjects [diagnosed with ichthyosis vulgaris (IV, n = 98) or recruited from the general population (n = 250)]. Using the UK Biobank, we compared mood/memory-related neuroanatomy in carriers of genetic deletions encompassing STS (n = 28) and non-carriers (n = 34,522). We found poorer word-picture recall and lower perceived memory abilities in males with XLI and female carriers compared with control groups. XLI-associated variant carriers and individuals with IV reported more adverse mood symptoms, reduced memory contentment and greater use of memory aids, compared with general population controls. Mood and memory findings appeared largely independent. Neuroanatomical analysis only indicated a nominally-significantly larger molecular layer in the right hippocampal body of deletion carriers relative to non-carriers. In humans, constitutive STS deficiency appears associated with mood-independent impairments in memory but not with large effects on underlying brain structure; the mediating psychobiological mechanisms might be explored further in individuals with XLI and in new mammalian models lacking STS developmentally.
   Animals in which the steroid sulphatase protein is absent or non-functional show evidence for enhanced memory and longevity. Here we show that, in contrast, humans carrying deletions of the STS gene show poorer memory performance (and more adverse mood symptoms) than non-carriers, but no differences from controls regarding associated neuroanatomy. image

AB  - Introduction Epigenetic modifications have emerged as key contributors to the enduring behavioral, molecular and epigenetic neuroadaptations during withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. The present study investigated the long-term consequences of chronic alcohol exposure on spatial working memory (WM) and associated changes of transcriptionally repressive histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).Methods Male C57BL/6 mice were allowed free access to either 12% (v/v) ethanol for 5 months followed by a 3-week abstinence period or water. Spatial WM was assessed through the spontaneous alternation T-maze test. Alcoholic and water mice received daily injections of GABAB agonist baclofen or saline during alcohol fading and early withdrawal. Global levels of histone modifications were determined by immunohistochemistry.Results Withdrawal mice displayed WM impairments along with reduced prefrontal H3K9me2 levels, compared to water-drinking mice. The withdrawal-induced decrease of H3K9me2 occurred concomitantly with increased level of permissive H3K9 acetylation (H3K9ac) in the PFC. Baclofen treatment rescued withdrawal-related WM deficits and fully restored prefrontal H3K9me2 and H3K9ac. Alcohol withdrawal induced brain region-specific changes of H3K9me2 and H3K9ac after testing, with significant decreases of both histone marks in the dorsal hippocampus and no changes in the amygdala and dorsal striatum. Furthermore, the magnitude of H3K9me2 in the PFC, but not the hippocampus, significantly and positively correlated with individual WM performances. No correlation was observed between H3K9ac and behavioral performance. Results also indicate that pre-testing intraperitoneal injection of UNC0642, a selective inhibitor of histone methyltransferase G9a responsible for H3K9me2, led to WM impairments in water-drinking and withdrawal-baclofen mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that alcohol withdrawal induced brain-region specific alterations of H3K9me2 and H3K9ac, an effect that persisted for at least three weeks after cessation of chronic alcohol intake.Conclusion The findings suggest a role for long-lasting decreased H3K9me2 specifically in the PFC in the persistent WM impairments related to alcohol withdrawal.

AB  - The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the majority of drugs from crossing into the brain and reaching neurons. To overcome this challenge, safe and non-invasive technologies targeting receptor-mediated pathways have been developed. In this study, three single-domain antibodies (sdAbs; IGF1R3, IGF1R4, and IGF1R5) targeting the extracellular domain of the human insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), generated by llama immunization, showed enhanced transmigration across the rat BBB model (SV-ARBEC) in vitro. The rate of brain uptake of these sdAbs fused to mouse Fc (sdAb-mFc) in vivo was estimated using the fluorescent in situ brain perfusion (ISBP) technique followed by optical brain imaging and distribution volume evaluation. Compared to the brains perfused with the negative control A20.1-mFc, the brains perfused with anti-IGF1R sdAbs showed a significant increase of the total fluorescence intensity (similar to 2-fold, p < .01) and the distribution volume (similar to 4-fold, p < .01). The concentration curve for IGF1R4-mFc demonstrated a linear accumulation plateauing at approximately 400 mu g (similar to 1 mu M), suggesting a saturable mechanism of transport. Capillary depletion and mass spectrometry analyses of brain parenchyma post-ISBP confirmed the IGF1R4-mFc brain uptake with similar to 25% of the total amount being accumulated in the parenchymal fraction in contrast to undetectable levels of A20.1-mFc after a 5-min perfusion protocol. Systemic administration of IGF1R4-mFc fused with the non-BBB crossing analgesic peptide galanin (2 and 5 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent suppression of thermal hyperalgesia in the Hargreaves pain model. In conclusion, novel anti-IGF1R sdAbs showed receptor-mediated brain uptake with pharmacologically effective parenchymal delivery of non-permeable neuroactive peptides.

AB  - Targeted mutagenesis in model organisms is key for gene functional annotation and biomedical research. Despite technological advances in gene editing by the CRISPR-Cas9 systems, rapid and efficient introduction of site-directed mutations remains a challenge in large animal models. Here, we developed a robust and flexible insertional mutagenesis strategy, homology-independent targeted trapping (HIT-trapping), which is generic and can efficiently target-trap an endogenous gene of interest independent of homology arm and embryonic stem cells. Further optimization and equipping the HIT-trap donor with a site-specific DNA inversion mechanism enabled one-step generation of reversible and conditional alleles in a single experiment. As a proof of concept, we successfully created mutant alleles for 21 disease-related genes in primary porcine fibroblasts with an average knock-in frequency of 53.2%, a great improvement over previous approaches. The versatile HIT-trapping strategy presented here is expected to simplify the targeted generation of mutant alleles and facilitate large-scale mutagenesis in large mammals such as pigs.

AB  - Filamin A (FLNA) cross-links actin filaments and mediates mechanotransduction by force-induced conformational changes of its domains. FLNA's mechanosensitive immunoglobulin-like repeats (R) interact with each other to create cryptic binding sites, which can be exposed by physiologically relevant mechanical forces. Using the FLNA mechanosensing domains as an affinity ligand followed by stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics, we recently identified smoothelin and fimbacin as FLNA mechanobinding proteins. Here, using the mechanosensing domain as an affinity ligand and two labeled amino acids, we identify salvador homologue 1 (SAV1), a component of the Hippo pathway kinase cascade, as a new FLNA mechanobinding partner. We demonstrate that SAV1 specifically interacts with the cryptic C-D cleft of FLNA R21 and map the FLNA-binding site on SAV1. We show that point mutations on the R21 C strand block the SAV1 interaction and find that SAV1 contains a FLNA-binding motif in the central region (116Phe-124Val). Point mutations F116A and T118A (FT/AA) disrupt the interaction. A proximity ligation assay reveals that their interaction occurs in the cytosol in an actin polymerization-dependent manner. Although SAV1 is typically found in the cytosol, disrupting the interaction between SAV1 and FLNA causes SAV1 to diffuse to the nucleus and YAP1 to diffuse to the cytosol in an inverse relationship. These results suggest that FLNA mediates regulation of the Hippo pathway through actin polymerization dependent interaction with SAV1.

AB  - Objective Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients have highlighted the important role of deep gray matter structures. Less work has however focused on subcortical shape in OCD patients. Methods Here we pooled brain MRI scans from 412 OCD patients and 368 controls to perform a meta-analysis utilizing the ENIGMA-Shape protocol. In addition, we investigated modulating effects of medication status, comorbid anxiety or depression, and disease duration on subcortical shape. Results There was no significant difference in shape thickness or surface area between OCD patients and healthy controls. For the subgroup analyses, OCD patients with comorbid depression or anxiety had lower thickness of the hippocampus and caudate nucleus and higher thickness of the putamen and pallidum compared to controls. OCD patients with comorbid depression had lower shape surface area in the thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens and higher shape surface area in the pallidum. OCD patients with comorbid anxiety had lower shape surface area in the putamen and the left caudate nucleus and higher shape surface area in the pallidum and the right caudate nucleus. Further, OCD patients on medication had lower shape thickness of the putamen, thalamus, and hippocampus and higher thickness of the pallidum and caudate nucleus, as well as lower shape surface area in the hippocampus and amygdala and higher surface area in the putamen, pallidum, and caudate nucleus compared to controls. There were no significant differences between OCD patients without co-morbid anxiety and/or depression and healthy controls on shape measures. In addition, there were also no significant differences between OCD patients not using medication and healthy controls. Conclusions The findings here are partly consistent with prior work on brain volumes in OCD, insofar as they emphasize that alterations in subcortical brain morphology are associated with comorbidity and medication status. Further work is needed to understand the biological processes contributing to subcortical shape.

AB  - Liquid storage is an important tool used to prolong fresh semen shelf-life while protecting spermatozoa from damage, conserving their overall functionality, and ensuring better fertility than frozen semen from sheep. The increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during sperm storage leads to a decline in sperm quality, particularly with regard to sperm nuclear DNA damage and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). This study evaluated the effect of storing Sarda ram semen at 15 degrees C for 7 h on its redox status, motility, morphology, acrosome integrity, ATP content, mitochondrial potential membrane, and in vivo fertility after artificial insemination. Two different extenders were compared: a lab-made skimmed milk (SM)-based extender and a commercial extender (OviXcell (R), IMV-Technologies, France). Lower ROS levels in the SM (p < 0.001) indicated that its oxidative status was better maintained compared to the commercial extender (CE). Antioxidant defenses (total antioxidant capacity, TEAC; superoxide dismutase, SOD; total thiols) were higher in the SM (p < 0.01) than in the CE. SM also had higher MMP (p < 0.05), acrosome integrity (p < 0.05), ATP content (p < 0.01), and in vivo fertilizing capacity (p < 0.05) compared to the CE, which indicated higher semen quality. In conclusion, the SM extender, while maintaining a better oxidative/antioxidant balance, ensured higher semen quality after 7 h of storage at 15 degrees C in vitro compared to the CE.

AB  - The ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of oil has received immense importance nowadays because of the enormous benefits the process offers. However, the literature evaluating this process is scarce for sea buckthorn oil. Furthermore, to date, to the best of our knowledge, a study evaluating the combined use of enzymes and UAE for this oil is lacking. In this study, oil from freeze-dried sea buckthorn berries was extracted using ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction (UAEE) and the effect of variables (time, enzyme concentration, and solvent to sample ratio) was evaluated on oil yield and its physiochemical properties (acid value, peroxide value, iodine value, density, and color). The optimum conditions were determined using the response surface methodology. The optimum conditions established were 5.08 mL/g, 14.65 min, and 3.13 U/g for a solvent to sample ratio, ultra-sonication time, and enzyme units, respectively. The oil yield was 18.32%. Physicochemical parameters were found better in UAEE oil than in the Soxhlet-extracted oil. Gas chromatography detected relatively higher levels of fatty acids, including palmitic, palmitoleic, and oleic acids in UAEE oil. The optimum conditions were also verified for adequacy by validation and results were matched with predicted values with 0.8 to 1.5 error %, which states that the model can be utilized to predict oil yield percentage.

AB  - MADS-box genes are classified into five categories: ABCDE, including SEP1, SEP2, SEP3, SEP4, and other homologous genes, which play important roles in floral organ development. In this study, the cDNA sequence of the HrSEP1 gene was cloned by RT-PCR and confirmed that this gene belongs to the MADS-box gene family. In addition, subcellular localization experiments showed that the HrSEP1 protein was localized in the nucleus. We verified the interaction of HrSEP1 with HrSOC1, HrSVP, and HrAP1 using yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. These genes jointly regulate the growth and development of floral organs. We also found a strong synergy between HrSEP1 and AP1 genes in sepals, petals, and stamens by transgenic methods and fluorescence quantitative PCR, suggesting that HrSEP1 and AP1 may co-regulate the development of these structures. In conclusion, the expression of HrSEP1 has a certain effect on the development of floral organs, and these findings lay the foundation for further research on the biological functions of MADS transcription factors in Hippophae rhamnoides.

AB  - Purpose: Insufficient sleep and insomnia are common issues associated with modern lifestyles that often contribute to the development of mental health disorders. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel antagonist, is commonly used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). It has been shown to improve nerve conduction velocity, strengthen myelin, and increase axonal area after injury. In addition, 4-AP has been reported to reduce behavioral disorders, including depression. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 4-AP on anxiety-like behavior in mice subjected to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation. Methods: Fifty male mice were randomly divided into five groups: control, normal saline (NS) (receiving normal saline via gavage), AP-0.25, AP-0.5, and AP-1 (receiving daily doses of 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg of 4-AP, respectively by gavage). All groups except the control group underwent SD for five consecutive days. The animals' locomotion and anxiety-like behavior were assessed using the open field and elevated plus maze tests. After behavioral testing, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPA-R), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) were measured by western blotting, and also malondialdehyde (MDA) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were analyzed by ELISA in the hippocampus. FindingAP-1 significantly reduced the levels of anxiety-like behavior compared to the NS group in both tests. In AP-1, a significant decrease in the levels of NMDA-R, AMPA-R, TNF-alpha, and MDA was observed. While these levels were increased in the NS group. In addition, AP-1 showed a higher level of TAC compared to the NS group, indicating an increase in antioxidant levels. Conclusion: 4-AP may be effective in reducing anxiety-like behavior in sleep-deprived mice by modifying the levels of NMDA-R, AMPA-R, and TNF-alpha, while simultaneously reducing oxidative stress induced by sleep deprivation in the hippocampus.

AB  - Inflammasomes play pivotal roles in inflammatory responses. However, their activity must be tightly controlled to prevent overactivation and subsequent inflammatory diseases. Negative feedback loops represent a general mechanism to maintain signaling homeostasis, yet the mechanisms by which inflammasomes employ this process to prevent overactivation remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a negative feedback loop mediated by the Hippo pathway kinase mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1) that prevents hyperactivation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Mechanistically, NLRP3 inflammasome activation induces cas-pase-1-dependent cleavage of MST1 on its inhibitory linker region, resulting in enhanced kinase activity. The enhanced MST1 phosphorylates the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC at serine 58, disrupting ASC oligomerization and thereby attenuating inflammasome assembly. Notably, staurosporine (STS), a chemical inducer of MST1 cleavage, mitigates inflammation and tissue damage in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis mouse model. These findings reveal a negative feedback mechanism for maintaining inflammatory homeostasis and highlight MST1 cleavage as a potential therapeutic target for controlling inflammation.

AB  - Simple Summary Few studies reported the effects of NAC on the lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and gastrocnemius muscles of PEDV-infected piglets. Therefore, it is very meaningful to investigate whether PEDV infection will cause adverse effects on the lung, liver, spleen, lymph node, and gastrocnemius muscle during intestinal infection of piglets, and the effects of NAC on the lung, liver, spleen, lymph node, and gastrocnemius muscle of PEDV-infected piglets. The results showed that PEDV infection has the most obvious effects on the redox and functional gene expression levels in the spleens of piglets. NAC administration ameliorated abnormal changes in measured variables in the spleens and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the mesenteric lymph nodes and gastrocnemius muscles of PEDV-infected piglets, suggesting that NAC administration improved the redox and functional gene expression levels in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and gastrocnemius muscle in PEDV-infected piglets. This study will provide theoretical basis and technical support for the application of NAC in the prevention of PEDV infection in piglets. Our previous study reported that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) administration improved the function of intestinal absorption in piglets infected with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). However, the effects of NAC administration on the functions of other tissues and organs in PEDV-infected piglets have not been reported. In this study, the effects of NAC on the liver, spleen, lung, lymph node, and gastrocnemius muscle in PEDV-infected piglets were investigated. Thirty-two 7-day-old piglets with similar body weights were randomly divided into one of four groups: Control group, NAC group, PEDV group, and PEDV+NAC group (eight replicates per group and one pig per replicate). The trial had a 2 x 2 factorial design consisting of oral administration of 0 or 25 mg/kg body weight NAC and oral administration of 0 or 1.0 x 10(4.5) TCID50 PEDV. The trial lasted 12 days. All piglets were fed a milk replacer. On days 5-9 of the trial, piglets in the NAC and PEDV + NAC groups were orally administered NAC once a day; piglets in the control and PEDV groups were orally administered the same volume of saline. On day 9 of trial, piglets in the PEDV and PEDV+NAC groups were orally administrated 1.0 x 10(4.5) TCID50 PEDV, and the piglets in the control and NAC groups were orally administrated the same volume of saline. On day 12 of trial, samples, including of the liver, spleen, lung, lymph node, and gastrocnemius muscle, were collected. PEDV infection significantly increased catalase activity but significantly decreased the mRNA levels of Keap1, Nrf2, HMOX2, IFN-alpha, MX1, IL-10, TNF-alpha, S100A12, MMP3, MMP13, TGF-beta, and GJA1 in the spleens of piglets. NAC administration ameliorated abnormal changes in measured variables in the spleens of PEDV-infected piglets. In addition, NAC administration also enhanced the antioxidant capacity of the mesenteric lymph nodes and gastrocnemius muscles in PEDV-infected piglets. Collectively, these novel results revealed that NAC administration improved the redox and functional gene expression levels in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and gastrocnemius muscle in PEDV-infected piglets.

AB  - To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to determine the effect of ginseng as an antioxidant supplement in freezing extenders on the quality of cryopreserved rooster semen. Semen samples were collected from 40 Thai native roosters (Pradu Hang Dum) using the dorso-abdominal massage method and then pooled and divided into five groups according to the concentrations of ginseng supplementation (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1 mg/mL) in a freezing extender. The semen suspensions were loaded into a medium straw and cryopreserved using the liquid nitrogen vapor method. The post-thaw semen was evaluated for sperm quality (sperm motility and membrane integrity), seminal plasma characteristics (lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase [SOD], catalase [CAT], and glutathione peroxidase [GPx]), and fertility. The results showed that ginseng extract supplementation at 0.25 mg/mL yielded the highest total motility, progressive motility, and membrane integrity (59.47%, 30.82%, and 48.30%, respectively; p < 0.05) in cryopreserved rooster semen. Higher malondialdehyde concentrations were observed in the control group than in the other groups (p < 0.05). SOD, CAT, and GPx increased compared with those in the control group (p < 0.05). The results showed that the fertility rate with 0.25 mg/mL of ginseng was higher than that of the control group (62.80% vs. 46.28%: p < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation with 0.25 mg/mL of ginseng is recommended as an alternative component to the freezing extender to improve rooster semen cryopreservation.

AB  - Massive bleeding and wound infection are the major problems often observed during severe trauma, and achieving rapid hemostasis in cases of high-dose bleeding in arteries and viscera remains an acute clinical demand. Herein, a mussel- and barnacle cement proteins-inspired dual-bionic hydrogel is first proposed. Benefiting from abundant phenolic hydroxyl groups, a tough dissipative matrix, removal of interfacial water, as well as dynamic redox balance of phenol-quinone, the multinetwork hydrogel achieves repeatable robust wet-tissue adhesiveness (151.40 +/- 1.50 kPa), a fast multimodal self-healing ability, and excellent antibacterial property against both Gram-positive/negative bacteria. For rabbit/pig models of cardiac penetration holes and femoral artery injuries, the dual-bionic bioadhesive shows better hemostatic efficiency than commercial gauze due to the synergistic effect of strong wound sealing capability, excellent red blood cell capturing property, and activation of hemostatic barrier membrane. More interestingly, the hydrogel combined with commercial hemostatic sponge presents accelerated wound healing as well as great potential for treating deep-wound hemorrhage in a battlefield environment. Overall, owing to these unique advantages, the novel tissue-adhesive hemostat opens up a new avenue to rapid sealing hemostasis and wound healing applications.

AB  - Despite the fact that the current situation with COVID-19 incidence is not an emergency, new strains of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus continue to appear in the world, some of them with higher virulence compared to the original virus. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) had a high risk of severe COVID-19, but the molecular and cellular mechanism of this predisposition is not fully elucidated. In this study, we developed a cellular model of the initial stage of COVID-19 on primary hippocampal culture of 5xFAD mice, a model of the familial AD, using the specific ACE2 receptor inhibitor MLN-4760. This model is based on the experimentally proven decrease in ACE2 receptor activity observed in COVID-19 patients due to internalization of the receptor inside the cell after binding to coronavirus. Using immunochemical staining with specific antibodies for detection of neurons (marker MAP2) and astroglia (marker GFAP) it was found that 24 h after addition of MLN-4760 (0.2 nmol per 1 mL of medium) to the culture medium there was a decrease in the density of astrocytes and neurons, a change in their morphology with a sharp reduction in the length and density of neurites, which led to the death of the cell culture. The transgenic culture turned out to be more sensitive to the effect of the inhibitor compared to the control hippocampal culture of native mice. In the second part of the study the possibilities of preventing the destructive effect of MLN-4760 on the hippocampal culture were studied. It was shown that administration of YB-1, an endogenous multifunctional stress protein, promoted restoration of cell culture structure and resulted in stimulation of neurite growth and astroglia activation. Introduction of multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MMSCs) after ACE2 blockade was also accompanied by improved culture survival, restoration of cell morphology, and increased density of astrocytes and neurons. These results suggest that YB-1 and cell therapy using MMSCs are promising options for the development of new effective methods to prevent the pathologic effects of the virus on brain tissue, which is an important link in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.

AB  - Background: Apoptotic cells' phosphoserine (PS) groups have a significant immunosuppressive effect. They inhibit proinflammatory signals by interacting with various immune cells, including macrophages, dendritic cells, and CD4+ cells. Previously, we synthesized PS-group-immobilized polymers and verified their immunomodulatory effects. Despite its confirmed immunomodulatory potential, the PS group has not been considered as a payload for antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in a targeted anti-inflammatory approach. Aim: We conducted this research to introduce an apoptotic-cell-inspired antibody-drug conjugate for effective immunomodulation. Method: Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-co-2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylserine) (p(HEMA-co-MPS)) was synthesized as a payload using RAFT polymerization, and goat anti-mouse IgG was selected as a model antibody, which was conjugated with the synthesized p(HEMA-co-MPS) via 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-Hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) reaction. The antibody-binding affinity, anti-inflammatory potential, and cytotoxicity measurements were evaluated. Results: We successfully synthesized ADCs with a significant anti-inflammatory effect and optimized the antibody-polymer ratio to achieve the highest antibody-binding affinity. Conclusion: We successfully introduced p(HEMA-co-MPS) to IgG without decreasing the anti-inflammatory potential of the polymer while maintaining its targeting ability. We suggest that the antibody-polymer ratio be appropriately adjusted for effective therapy. In the future, this technology can be applied to therapeutic antibodies, such as Tocilizumab or Abatacept.

AB  - To better understand adult neurogenesis, the biomolecular specificity of the subgranular zone should be investigated in comparison to other layers of the hippocampus. Adult neurogenesis occurs at a reduced rate in adulthood compared to the period of development, but it can be increased with exposure to an enriched environment (EE). This can be used to investigate the regulatory role of molecules present in the extracellular matrix, such as tenascin C (TnC). This study, using Synchrotron radiation Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (SR-FTIR), shows that the differences between the hippocampal layers in adolescence are maintained as subtle and significant in adulthood. The main difference in FTIR spectra was observed for nucleic acid and carbohydrate and for the comparison of the subgranular zone (SGZ) with hippocampal CA3. Moreover, we have detected changes in the protein and nucleic acid content of the SGZ that accompany the process of neurogenesis under the influence of an enriched environment. The latter effects are, however, lacking in mice with a gene ablation for tenascin C. Overall, these results show that observed discrete biomolecular differences in hippocampal layers follow the rate of neurogenesis that is enhanced by EE and dependent on TnC.

AB  - The capacity of temporal interference (TI) stimulation to target deep brain regions without affecting nearby surface electrodes remains uncertain. Using artifact-free optical recording, we compare excitation patterns and thresholds in hippocampal neurons stimulated by "pure" and amplitude-modulated sine waves, representing TI waveforms near electrodes and at the target, respectively. We show that pure 2-and 20-kHz sine waves induce repetitive firing at rates that increase up to 60-90 Hz with stronger electric fields. Beyond this limit, action potentials merge into sustained depolarization, resulting in an excitation block. Modulating the sine waves at 20 Hz aligns firing with amplitude "beats" and prevents the excitation block but does not lower excitation thresholds. Thus, off-target TI effects appear unavoidable, though the patterns of neuronal excitation and downstream effects may differ from those at the target. We further analyze membrane charging and relaxation kinetics at nanoscale resolution and confirm an excitation mechanism independent of envelope extraction.

AB  - Membrane penetration by non-enveloped viruses is diverse and generally not well understood. Enteroviruses, one of the largest groups of non-enveloped viruses, cause diseases ranging from the common cold to life-threatening encephalitis. Enteroviruses enter cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, how enterovirus particles or RNA genomes cross the endosome membrane into the cytoplasm remains unknown. Here we used cryo-electron tomography of infected cells to show that endosomes containing enteroviruses deform, rupture, and release the virus particles into the cytoplasm. Blocking endosome acidification with bafilomycin A1 reduced the number of particles that released their genomes, but did not prevent them from reaching the cytoplasm. Inhibiting post-endocytic membrane remodeling with wiskostatin promoted abortive enterovirus genome release in endosomes. The rupture of endosomes also occurs in control cells and after the endocytosis of very low-density lipoprotein. In summary, our results show that cellular membrane remodeling disrupts enterovirus-containing endosomes and thus releases the virus particles into the cytoplasm to initiate infection. Since the studied enteroviruses employ different receptors for cell entry but are delivered into the cytoplasm by cell-mediated endosome disruption, it is likely that most if not all enteroviruses, and probably numerous other viruses from the family Picornaviridae, can utilize endosome rupture to infect cells.
   Enteroviruses from the family Picornaviridae enter cells by endocytosis. Subsequently, endosome rupture, induced by cell-mediated membrane remodeling, enables enteroviruses to reach the cell cytoplasm and initiate infection.

AB  - Neurons are highly polarized cells that display characteristic differences in the organization of their organelles in axons and dendrites. The kinases SadA and SadB (SadA/B) promote the formation of distinct axonal and dendritic extensions during the development of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Here, we show that SadA/B are required for the specific dynamics of axonal mitochondria. Ankyrin B (AnkB) stimulates the activity of SadA/B that function as regulators of mitochondrial dynamics through the phosphorylation of tau. Suppression of SadA/B or AnkB in cortical neurons induces the elongation of mitochondria by disrupting the balance of fission and fusion. SadA/B-deficient neurons show an accumulation of hyper-fused mitochondria and activation of the integrated stress response (ISR). The normal dynamics of axonal mitochondria could be restored by mild actin destabilization. Thus, the elongation after loss of SadA/B results from an excessive stabilization of actin filaments and reduction of Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria.

AB  - HBP-A is the main active component of a traditional Chinese medicine Huaizhen Yanggan Capsule, for the remarkable treatment of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). This study aimed to elucidate the ameliorative effect of HBP-A on meniscus hypertrophy and mineralisation in KOA and the molecular mechanism of its action. An Hartley guinea pig model of KOA that underwent anterior cruciate ligament transection (ACLT) and a model of rat primary meniscus fibrochondrocytes (PMFs) were used to investigate the ameliorative effect of HBP-A on meniscal hypertrophy and calcification and its signal transduction mechanism of action. The results show that Guinea pig's meniscus width, as well as the area of meniscus calcification and meniscus and articular cartilage injury score, were significantly reduced in the HBP-A intervention group compared to the ACLT group. The expression levels of mtrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), Indian hedgehog (Ihh), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and ankylosis homologue (ANKH) at the protein and gene level significantly decreased in the HBP-A intervention group compared to the ACLT group. In vitro study, apoptosis, hypertrophy, and calcification of rat PMFs after 10% stretch force were significantly improved with HBP-A intervention. Western blot and RT-qPCR showed that hypertrophy, calcification, and p38 MAPK signalling pathway-related markers of PMFs were incredibly depressed in the HBP-A intervention group compared to the 10% stretch force group. In conclusion, HBP-A can slow down meniscus hypertrophy and mineralisation induced by abnormal mechanical loading, and its mechanism of action may be through the p38-MAPK signalling pathway.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) often exist together in patients. The RAB39B gene has been reported to be mutated in ID patients with additional clinical features ranging from ASD, macrocephaly, seizures and/or early-onset parkinsonism. Here, we describe a novel RAB39B nonstop mutation [Xq28; c.640 T > C; p.(*214Glnext*21)] in a family with ASD, severe ID and poor motor coordination, and we assessed the pathogenicity of the mutation. A heterologous cell system and a Rab39b knockdown (KD) murine model, which mimic the nonstop mutation, were used to validate the deleterious effect of the RAB39B mutation. The mutation led to RAB39B protein instability, resulting in its increased degradation and consequent downregulation. Using a Rab39b KD mouse model, we demonstrated that the downregulation of RAB39B led to increased GluA2 lacking Ca2+-permeable AMPAR composition at the hippocampal neuronal surface and increased dendritic spine density that remained in an immature filopodia-like state. These phenotypes affected behavioural performance in a disease-specific manner. Rab39b KD mice revealed impaired social behaviour but intact social recognition. They also showed normal anxiety-like, exploratory and motivational behaviours but impaired working and associative memories. In conclusion, we found a novel RAB39B nonstop variant that segregated in a family with a clinical phenotype including ID, ASD and poor motor coordination. The pathogenicity of mutations causing the downregulation of RAB39B proteins, impacting AMPAR trafficking and dendritic spine morphogenesis, reinforced the idea that AMPAR modulation and dendritic spine assets could be considered hallmarks of neurodevelopmental disorders.

AB  - Drug-mediated or medical condition-mediated disruption of hERG function accounts for the main cause of acquired long-QT syndrome (acLQTs), which predisposes affected individuals to ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden death. Many Chinese herbal medicines, especially alkaloids, have risks of arrhythmia in clinical application. The characterized mechanisms behind this adverse effect are frequently associated with inhibition of cardiac hERG channels. The present study aimed to assess the potent effect of Rutaecarpine (Rut) on hERG channels. hERG-HEK293 cell was applied for evaluating the effect of Rut on hERG channels and the underlying mechanism. hERG current (I-hERG) was measured by patch-clamp technique. Protein levels were analysed by Western blot, and the phosphorylation of Sp1 was determined by immunoprecipitation. Optical mapping and programmed electrical stimulation were used to evaluate cardiac electrophysiological activities, such as APD, QT/QTc, occurrence of arrhythmia, phase singularities (PSs), and dominant frequency (DF). Our results demonstrated that Rut reduced the I-hERG by binding to F656 and Y652 amino acid residues of hERG channel instantaneously, subsequently accelerating the channel inactivation, and being trapped in the channel. The level of hERG channels was reduced by incubating with Rut for 24 hours, and Sp1 in nucleus was inhibited simultaneously. Mechanismly, Rut reduced threonine (Thr)/ tyrosine (Tyr) phosphorylation of Sp1 through PI3K/Akt pathway to regulate hERG channels expression. Cell-based model unables to fully reveal the pathological process of arrhythmia. In vivo study, we found that Rut prolonged QT/QTc intervals and increased induction rate of ventricular fibrillation (VF) in guinea pig heart after being dosed Rut for 2 weeks. The critical reasons led to increased incidence of arrhythmias eventually were prolonged APD(90) and APD(50) and the increase of DF, numbers of PSs, incidence of early after-depolarizations (EADs). Collectively, the results of this study suggest that Rut could reduce the I-hERG by binding to hERG channels through F656 and Y652 instantaneously. While, the PI3K/Akt/Sp1 axis may play an essential role in the regulation of hERG channels, from the perspective of the long-term effects of Rut (incubating for 24 hours). Importantly, the changes of electrophysiological properties by Rut were the main cause of VA.

AB  - Tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) regulates postnatal phosphate homeostasis, but its role in utero-placental phosphate availability remains poorly understood. Gilts were bred and hysterectomized on Day 60 or Day 90 of gestation (n = 6/day). Phosphate was less abundant in allantoic and amniotic fluids on Day 90 compared to Day 60. TNSALP protein was immunolocalized, and enzymatic activity was quantified and localized in endometrial and chorioallantois tissues. Day had no effect on TNSALP activity in the chorioallantois. In contrast, endometrial TNSALP activity was lower on Day 90 compared to Day 60. Phosphate abundance in allantoic fluid correlated positively with endometrial TNSALP activity on Day 60 but not Day 90. TNSALP protein was abundantly expressed in the endometrium and chorioallantois on both days investigated, with localization to the endometrial, chorionic, and areolar epithelia, as well as stromal cells and endothelium. TNSALP activity was detected in the endothelium of the blood vessels in both the endometrium and chorioallantois, and on the basal surface of the endometrial glands on Day 60 but not Day 90. The endometrial stratum compactum stroma had strong TNSALP activity on Day 60. Weak TNSALP activity was present in the areolar epithelium, with a modest increase in activity on Day 90 compared to Day 60. TNSALP activity was present in the columnar chorionic epithelial cells, with an apparent decrease in activity in the chorioallantois on Day 90 compared to Day 60. These data reveal spatiotemporal changes in TNSALP localization and activity, suggesting its involvement in regulating phosphate availability at the utero-placental interface in swine.Lay SummaryPhosphate is an essential nutrient for fetal growth, but how it is managed during pregnancy is not fully understood. This study explored the role of an enzyme called tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) in regulating phosphate availability in the uterus and placenta in pigs in mid- and late pregnancy. Phosphate levels decreased in the fluids surrounding the fetus in late pregnancy. TNSALP was present in the uterus and placenta, and the amount of the enzyme varied depending on the tissue and stage of pregnancy and correlated with changes in phosphate levels. These findings suggest that TNSALP plays a key role in managing phosphate transport from the mother to the fetus in pregnancy to support fetal development.

AB  - B-raf (rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma) is a crucial player within the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway. In the CNS, B-raf has been implicated in neuronal differentiation, long-term memory, and major depression. Mice with forebrain neuron-specific B-raf knockout show behavioral deficits in spatial learning tasks and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). To elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying diminished synaptic plasticity in B-raf-deficient mice, we performed whole-cell recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in hippocampal slices of control and B-raf mutant mice. We found that the NMDA/AMPA ratio of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 pyramidal cell synapses was significantly reduced in B-raf mutants, which would at least partially account for their impaired LTP. Interestingly, the reduced NMDA component of field postsynaptic potentials in mutant preparations was partially reinstated by blocking the apamin-sensitive small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels, which have also been reported to modulate hippocampal LTP and learning tasks. To determine the impact of B-raf-dependent signaling on SK current, we isolated the apamin-sensitive tail current after a strong depolarizing event and found indeed a significantly bigger SK current in B-raf-deficient cells compared to controls, which is consistent with the reduced action potential firing and the stronger facilitating effect of apamin on CA1 somatic excitability in B-raf-mutant hippocampus. Our data suggest that B-raf signaling readjusts the delicate balance between NMDA receptors and SK channels to promote synaptic plasticity and facilitate hippocampal learning and memory.

AB  - Background Oocytes of large animal species isolated from small ovarian follicles (< 2 mm) are less competent to support early embryonic development after in vitro maturation and fertilization than their counterparts isolated from medium-sized and preovulatory follicles. This study aimed to assess the effect of a new maturation medium containing FGF2, LIF, and IGF1 (FLI medium) on the meiotic and developmental competence of pig cumulus-oocytes complexes (COCs) derived from the small and medium-sized follicles. Methods The growing oocytes were isolated from 1 to 2 (small follicle; SF) and the fully-grown ones from 3 to 6 (large follicle; LF) mm follicles and matured in a control M199 medium with gonadotropins and EGF and the FLI medium enriched by the triplet of growth factors. The matured oocytes were parthenogenetically activated and cultured to the blastocyst stage. Chromatin configuration before and during the culture and MAP kinase activity were assessed in the oocytes. Finally, the expression of cumulus cell genes previously identified as markers of oocyte quality was assessed. Results The maturation and blastocyst rates of oocytes gained from LF were significantly higher than that from SF in the control medium. In contrast, similar proportions of oocytes from LF and SF completed meiosis and developed to blastocysts when cultured in FLI. Most of the oocytes freshly isolated from SF possessed germinal vesicles with fine filaments of chromatin (GV(0)) or chromatin surrounding the nucleolus (GV(I); 30%); the oocytes from LF were mainly in GV(I) (or GV(II)) exhibiting a few small lumps of chromatin beneath the nuclear membrane. When cultured in the FLI medium for 16 h, an acceleration of the course of maturation in oocytes both from SF and LF compared to the control medium was observed and a remarkable synchrony in the course of chromatin remodeling was noticed in oocytes from SF and LF. Conclusions This work demonstrates that the enrichment of culture medium by FGF2, LIF, and IGF1 can enhance the meiotic and developmental competence of not only fully-grown, but also growing pig oocytes and significantly thus expanding the number of oocytes available for various assisted reproductive technology applications.

AB  - Increasing evidence supports the view that oxidative stress and brain demyelination play an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Resveratrol is a powerful antioxidant with neuroprotective effects. This study aimed to assess the effect of resveratrol on schizophrenia-like behaviors and possible brain demyelination induced by MK-801, an N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, and the underlying neuroprotective mechanism. Resveratrol (40 mg/kg/day/, intraperitoneal) was administered to mice for 14 days. MK-801 (1 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneal) was injected into the mice 4 h after the resveratrol administration for 14 days. The open-field and elevated-plus maze tests were performed to detect behavior changes on the 15th day. Following the behavioral tests, the expression of the myelin basic protein (MBP) was measured with the real-time PCR (RT-PCR) method, while total oxidant capacity (TOS) and total antioxidant capacity (TAS), which are the biomarkers of oxidative damage, were measured with the ELISA method. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was also used to identify stereological and pathological changes in the brain. According to the results obtained, this study showed for the first time that resveratrol prevented glial cell infiltration induced in the brain by MK-801 and shrinkage of nerve cell nuclei in the hippocampus and corpus callosum. However, the resveratrol administrations did not correct behavioral disorders and demyelination of schizophrenia. Although resveratrol partially prevented oxidative damage in the brain in the mice that were injected with MK-801, it was determined that this effect was not statistically significant. These results showed that resveratrol administration partially protects tissues against MK-801-induced neurodegeneration, and resveratrol may be used in combination with different antioxidants or at different doses in future studies.

AB  - Depression is a chronic, recurrent and life-threatening disease affecting approximately 15% of the world population. Depression is responsible for neuropathologies like decreased neurogenesis and increased dendritic atrophy. Antidepressant treatments increase hippocampal neurogenesis and neurotrophic factor expression. Based on this information, it was aimed to investigate effect of sertraline on depression in rats with chronic mild stress (CMS) model and to determine how it affects cell proliferation and hypothalamic peptide levels in hypothalamus. 56 adult male Wistar albino; control, depression(D), depression + sertraline, sertraline were divided into groups. Various stressors were applied to D for 30 days. Open field test (OFT) and forced swimming test (FST) were conducted to check whether the animals were depressed. On the 16th day osmotic minipump was placed subcutaneously and sertraline (10 mg/kg/day) was administered for 15 days. Behavior tests were done. Hypothalamic peptide gene expression levels were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Statistical evaluations were made using ANOVA. It caused a decrease in the percentage of movement in the D and control groups in the OFT, an increase in the immobility time in the D group in the FST, and an increase in the swimming behavior in the DS group. Animals did not show any anxiological behavior based on the elevated plus maze test results. CMS caused a decrease in GLUT2 and NPY gene expression in the hypothalamus of animals, an increase in POMC and FGFR2, and an increase in IGFIR and GLUT2 gene expression in the DS group. Sertraline has been shown to ameliorate the effects of CMS-induced depression. Sertraline is thought to have a positive regulatory effect on both the formation of neural precursor cells and the survival of newly formed neurons in the hypothalamus. Newly formed neurons in the hypothalamus express food intake-related NPY, POMC, GLUT2 neurons, and thus hypothalamic tanycytes may play a key role in the control of energy metabolism.

AB  - This study investigated the prevalence and genetic diversity of human astrovirus (HAstV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV) in bivalve mollusks (mussels and oysters) marketed in three tourist cities in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from January to December 2022. One hundred and thirty-four samples were processed according to the ISO 15216-1:2017 (Microbiology of food a chain-horizontal method for determination of hepatitis A virus and norovirus in food using real-time RTPCR-Part 1: method for quantification, vol 2017. International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, pp 1-48, 2017), and viral screening was performed by the TaqMan real-time RT-qPCR. HAstV RNA was detected in 13.9% (10/72) of the oyster samples and 14.5% (9/62) of the mussel samples. HAV RNA was detected in 8.1% (5/62) of the mussels, while HEV RNA was not detected in any of the analyzed bivalves. The molecular characterization revealed that HAstV strains detected in live oysters belonged to both classical (HAstV-1) and non-classical (MLB-1) genotypes. The HAV-IA genotype was detected in mussel samples and segregated into two subclusters. This study reports the presence of HAstV and HAV in oysters and mussels marketed in Brazil for the first time. The findings indicate local water contamination in the bivalve sampling areas, highlighting the importance of environmental monitoring and surveillance improvements, particularly in shellfish production areas.

AB  - Elevated environmental pollution of lead and fipronil is blamed for chronic toxicity. Fipronil and lead acetate are commonly used, but now no adequate data is available concerning the harmful side effects of their mixture. The present work investigated the curative effects of camel milk against lead and fipronil subchronic toxicity individually and as mixture with different doses (1/30 and 1/60 LD50) on male albino rats by oral ingestion. Rats were divided into eight groups; the first group (G1) was the normal health control. G2, G4, G6, and G8 are the normal health groups camel milk. G3 and G4 are ingested by 1/30 LD50 of the fipronil formulation. G5 and G6 are ingested by 1/30 LD50 of lead acetate. G7 and G8 are ingested by 1/60 LD50 of lead acetate and 1/60 LD50 of fipronil formulation. The lead acetate or fipronil and their mixture significantly induced destructive damage to the kidneys and liver function parameters as well as lipid profile and oxidative stress in both organs. Serum LDH activity increased under the same conditions. Most harmful effects were clearly observed in G7 followed by G3 and G5. Histological examination revealed hepatic degeneration and nephropathy in intoxicated rats relative to normal health control, as shown by hypertrophy of hepatocytes in addition to karyomegaly, binucleation, and mild individual cell coagulative and mild hypertrophy, as well as a vacuolar degeneration of tubular epithelium in the kidneys. Both toxicants in their mixture showed more harmful than those of their individual ones. Camel milk treatments into intoxicated animals (lead, fipronil, and mixture groups) attenuated all evaluated parameters, alleviated the harmful influences of the mixture of lead acetate and fipronil, and improved the biomarkers of their oxidative stress.

AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) has been proposed as a chemical light signal and neural system modulator via heme oxygenases -1 and -2 (HO-1 and HO-2). Many papers have proven the CO-HO circuit to be important for such physiological pathways as the molecular biological clock and the GnRH axis, but also in such pathological occurrences as ischemic injuries, or inflammation as a regenerative and neuroprotective factor. In this in vivo experiment, we used three groups of pigs: control-housed in natural conditions without any procedures; without CO-adapted and kept in constant darkness, infused with blank plasma; and with CO-adapted and kept in constant darkness infused with CO-enriched plasma. After the experiments, each animal was slaughtered and its eyes were collected for further analysis. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis were performed to show statistical differences in the expressions between the experimental groups. Our data revealed that exogenous CO is regulator of mRNA transcription for HO-1 and HO-2 and PCNA. Moreover, the mRNA abundance of analyzed factors in the experimental group after CO elevation revealed a restored gene-expression level similar to the control group, which we had observed in the group's restored protein level after CO elevation. In conclusion, exogenous CO regulates HO's and PCNA gene expression on transcriptional and translational levels in a similar way as a light cue.

AB  - BackgroundCamelina is an oilseed crop with particularly useful fatty acid and amino acid profiles of its seeds, high resilience to abiotic and biotic stresses, and a short life cycle. Previous genetic engineering approaches in camelina have largely relied on the floral dip method which is, however, associated with genotype-dependent efficiency and incompatibility with methods of direct biomolecule delivery.ResultsHere, we established a novel method of transgenesis for camelina, taking advantage of the high regenerative capacity of immature embryos. Various culture conditions and treatments were experimentally validated, which included the duration of explant pre-cultivation, wounding of explants and its time of application, Agrobacterium strain and density of inoculum, acetosyringone concentration, duration of explant-Agrobacterium co-cultivation, as well as application time and concentration of the selective agent hygromycin. We provide convergent evidence of stable transgenicity and transgene inheritance by (1) selection for resistance to hygromycin, (2) PCR, (3) detection of the transgene product GFP, and (4) DNA gel blot analysis involving primary transgenic plants and segregating progeny. Primary transgenics examined in detail featured one to three T-DNA integration loci, with one to seven T-DNA copies being integrated in total per plant. The established method proved efficient across all three tested accessions including two current cultivars, whereby transformation efficiencies, determined as PCR-positive primary transgenic plants related to agro-inoculated explants, of between 13 and 17% were obtained.ConclusionWith this method, we provide a viable platform for the functional validation of genes-of-interest and for biotechnological improvements of plant performance and quality features in camelina.

Current treatments for taste and smell disorders are limited. Involving patients has the potential to catalyze the dynamic exchange and development of new ideas and approaches to facilitate biomedical research and therapeutics. We assessed patients' perceptions of the efficacy of treatments for chemosensory impairment using an online questionnaire completed by 5,815 people in the US Logistic regression determined variables predictive of reported treatment efficacy for patients aged 18 to 24, 25 to 39, 40 to 60, and 60+ yrs. who were treated with nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, smell training, theophylline, platelet-rich plasma, and Omega 3. The most consistent predictor was age, with the majority of those 40 to 60 and 60+ reporting that nasal steroids, oral steroids, zinc, nasal rinse, and smell training were only slightly effective or not effective at all. Many of these treatment strategies target regeneration and immune response, processes compromised by age. Only those under 40 reported more than slight efficacy of steroids or smell training. Findings emphasize the need to include patients of all ages in clinical trials. Older adults with olfactory impairment are at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We speculate that olfactory impairment associated with long COVID introduces the potential for a significant rise in AD. Long COVID-associated chemosensory impairment increases the urgency for translational and clinical research on novel treatment strategies. Suggestions for high-priority areas for epidemiological, basic, and clinical research on chemosensory impairment follow.

AB  - Bergamot essential oil (BEO) is an extract of the bergamot fruit with significant neuroprotective effect. This study was to investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of BEO in mitigating depression. GC-MS were used to identify its constituents. Antidepressive properties of BEO were evaluated by sucrose preference test (SPT), force swimming test (FST) and open field test (OFT). Nissl staining was used to determine the number of Nissl bodies in hippocampus (HIPP) of rats. Changes in HIPP dendritic length and dendritic spine density were detected by Golgi-Cox staining. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to detect the postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) and synaptophysin (SYP) in the HIPP of rats. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) in the HIPP, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of rats. Inhaled BEO significantly improved depressive behaviour in chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rats. BEO increased Nissl bodies, dendritic length and spine density, PSD-95 and SYP protein in the HIPP. Additionally, BEO upregulated serum 5-HT, serum and CSF IGF-1, while downregulating serum IL-1 beta. Collectively, inhaled BEO mitigates depression by protecting the plasticity of hippocampal neurons, hence, providing novel insights into treatment of depression.

AB  - Learning enhances hippocampal engram cell synaptic connectivity which is crucial for engram reactivation and recall to natural cues. Memory retrieval engages only a subset of the learning-activated ensemble, indicating potential differences in synaptic connectivity signatures of reactivated and non-reactivated cells. We probed these differences in structural synaptic connectivity patterns after recent memory retrieval, 72 h after either neutral Context Exploration (CE) or aversive Contextual Fear Conditioning (CFC). Using a combination of eGRASP (enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) reconstitution across synaptic partners) and viral-TRAP (targeted recombination in activated populations) to label CA3 synapses onto CA1 engram cells, we investigated differences in spine density, clusters, and morphology between the reactivated and non-reactivated population of the learning ensemble. In doing so, we developed a pipeline for reconstruction and analysis of dendrites and spines, taking nested data structure into account. Our data demonstrate an interplay between reactivation status, context valence or both factors on the number, distribution, and morphology of CA1 engram cell synapses. Despite a lack of differences in spine density, reactivated engram cells encoding an aversive context were characterised by a higher probability of forming spine clusters and a more dynamic spine type signature compared to their non-reactivated counterparts or engram cells encoding a neutral context. Together, our data indicate that the learning-activated ensemble undergoes different trajectories in structural synaptic connectivity during engram refinement.

AB  - After delivery, bacterial contamination and uterine tissue degeneration in animals can lead to the development of uterine diseases, such as endometritis, accompanied by endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS). Increasing evidence suggests that spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1s), a critical component of ERS, is involved in several pathological processes in various organisms. However, the specific molecular mechanisms by which XBP1s mediates the inflammatory response in goat endometrial epithelial cells (gEECs) remain largely unknown. In the present study, XBP1s protein was induced into the nucleus in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 & mu;g/mL)-induced inflammatory response of gEECs. Lipopolysaccharide-induced expression and nucleation of XBP1s were reduced by the inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) using TAK-242 (1 & mu;M; a TLR4 inhibitor). Expression and nucleation of XBP1s were similarly reduced when the activity of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 & alpha; (IRE1 & alpha;) was inhibited using 4 & mu;8C (10 & mu;M; an IRE1 & alpha; inhibitor). In addition, inhibition of IRE1a increased IL-1 & beta;, TNF-& alpha;, and IL8 levels and secretion of IL-6 induced by LPS. Notably, phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-& kappa;B) P65 protein and expression of NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) were similarly increased. Furthermore, knockdown of XBP1s in gEECs consistently promoted NF-& kappa;B P65 protein phosphorylation, NLRP3 protein expression, and inflammatory cytokine secretion. In summary, the current results suggest that in the LPS-induced inflammatory response in gEECs, LPS generates intracellular signaling cascades in gEECs via TLR4, which may promote XBP1s protein expression and nucleation by activating IRE1a. However, downregulation of XBP1s expression exacerbates inflammation by promoting activation of the NF-& kappa;B and NLRP3 inflammatory vesicle pathways. These results will potentially contribute to the treatment and prevention of endometritis in ruminants.

AB  - The increasing consumption of rare earth elements (REEs) has resulted in a considerable risk of environmental exposure. However, the adverse effects of prenatal REEs exposure on children's neurodevelopment are not yet fully recognized. Therefore, we investigated the individual and joint effects of prenatal exposure to 13 REEs on children's neurocognitive development based on 809 mother-child pairs from a large birth cohort in Wuhan, China. Maternal urinary concentrations of 13 REEs were repeatedly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Children's neurodevelopment [e.g., mental and psychomotor development index (MDI/PDI)] at 24-months was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development of Chinese Revision. GEE and BKMR models were applied to estimate the individual and joint effects of prenatal REE exposure on child neurodevelopment level. After controlling for typical confounders, we observed that exposure to 9 REEs during the first trimester were significantly associated with decreased MDI scores [beta s and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) ranging from -2.24 (-3.86 similar to -0.63) to -1.44 (-2.26 similar to -0.26)], and 7 REEs during third trimester were significantly associated decreased PDI scores [beta and 95% CIs ranging from -1.95 (-3.19 similar to -0.71) to -1.25 (-2.34 similar to -0.16)]. Higher quantiles of REE mixture in first and third trimester were associated with decreased MDI and PDI score. Thulium, erbium in the first trimester and cerium, lanthanum in the third trimester accounted most importance to joint effects on MDI and PDI, respectively. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to higher concentrations of REEs during the first and third trimester were negative associated with children's neurodevelopment.

AB  - Background: Epidemic encephalitis B is a common zoonosis that threatens both pigs and humans. Effective prevention and control of epidemic encephalitis B is difficult. The cellular defence mechanism is closely related to the body's resistance to viral invasion. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in regulating various cellular activities. We previously found that lncRNA-SUSAJ1 could inhibit the proliferation of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). However, the mechanism underlying this suppression remains unclear. Methods: We performed Western blotting and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses, as well as mitochondrial membrane potential, flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL), RNA pull-down, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Results: JC-1 cationic dye staining showed that lncRNA-SUSAJ1 promoted the depolarisation of mitochondrial membrane potential; H2DCFDA probe staining showed that lncRNA-SUSAJ1 enhanced the level of reactive oxygen species in PK15 porcine kidney cells. qRT-PCR and Western blotting revealed the expression levels of associated mRNAs and proteins, and the TUNEL and flow cytometry assays detected cell apoptosis. Their results showed that lncRNA-SUSAJ1 promoted the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and inhibited the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. RNA pull-down experiments using biotin-labelled lncRNA-SUSAJ1 showed colocalisation between lncRNA-SUSAJ1 and the 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70). lncRNA-SUSAJ1 also activated unfolded protein response-related pathways, regulated protein degradation, and promoted apoptosis via the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, thereby inhibiting viral replication. Conclusions: The findings of this study provide insight into the specific molecular mechanism of lncRNA-SUSAJ1 resistance to viral proliferation by promoting cell apoptosis, clarify the antiviral effect of lncRNA-SUSAJ1 on JEV.

AB  - Background: Rotavirus (RV) is a major cause of diarrhea in young children and animals, especially piglets, leading to substantial economic losses in the global pig industry. Isoleucine (Ile), a branched-chain amino acid, plays an important role in regulating nutrient metabolism and has been shown to improve diarrhea. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Ile supplementation on the mucosal immune barrier of the small intestine in RV-infected weaned piglets. Methods: Forty-eight 21-day-old weaned piglets were randomly divided into three dietary treatments (each treatment was subdivided into two groups, eight replicates per group), with 0%, 0.5%, or 1% Ile added for 15 days, and then, one group from each treatment was challenged with RV. Results: The results showed that 1% Ile added to the diet promoted the healthy development of the intestinal mucosa. Ile could restore the reduced villus height in the ileum and the goblet cell number in the duodenum and ileum to normal levels, improving the intestinal epithelial tight junctions in RV-infected piglets. Additionally, Ile increased the activity of lipase, amylase, and sucrase, as well as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), along with the expression of SIgA, DEF beta 1, and DEF beta 2 in parts of the small intestine. Conclusions: The addition of Ile to the diet mitigated the effects of RV infection on intestinal morphology and mucosal barrier function, as well as the physiological functions of weaned piglets, and improved the antioxidant and immune functions of the piglets to some extent. These findings offer valuable insights, contributing to a deeper understanding of the role of Ile in supporting intestinal health.

AB  - Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a process in which a photosensitizer (PS) is exposed to specific wavelengths and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which act within nanometers. The low invasive nature and directed cytotoxicity of this approach render it attractive to the treatment of different conditions, including the ones that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The effect of PDT on healthy neurons is one main concern over its use in the CNS, since neuronal-like cells were shown to be particularly sensitive to certain PSs. Among available PSs, 1,9-dimethyl-methylene blue (DMMB) stands out as being resistant to reduction to its inactive leuco form and by being able to produce high levels of singlet-oxygen. In this study, we aimed to investigate DMMB photodamage mechanisms in the hippocampal cell line HT22. Our results demonstrate that DMMB-PDT decrease in cell viability was linked with an increase in cell death and overall ROS production. Besides, it resulted in a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS production and decreased mitochondria membrane potential. Furthermore, DMMB-PDT significantly increased the presence of acidic autolysosomes, which was accompanied by an increase in ATG1 and ATG8 homologue GaBarap1 expression, and decreased DRAM1 expression. Taken together our results indicated that mitochondrial and autophagic dysfunction underlie DMMB-PDT cytotoxicity in neuronal cells.

AB  - Objective: Working memory (WM) is critical for higher level cognition, but the underlying neural mechanisms are not fully understood. Impaired WM affects routine daily activities and is observed in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). This study investigated neural oscillations associated with different WM phases, to determine the specific neural activity linked with the phases of WM impairment. Methods: Patients with TLE (n = 52) and healthy volunteers (n = 35) completed a WM task, during which 34-channel electroencephalogram signals were recorded. Characteristic neural oscillation patterns during each WM phase were compared between the 2 groups. Results: Patients with TLE showed decreased theta power during the encoding phase of WM, which was associated with reduced accuracy in the WM task. Altered theta power in the frontal region of the brain during the encoding phase was associated with a longer reaction time. Conclusions: Alterations in theta oscillation are related to WM impairment in patients with TLE and may serve as an early marker for evaluating WM deficits. Significance: This study provides an early marker for evaluating WM deficits in TLE. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Veterinary drugs are frequently employed to treat and prevent diseases in food-producing animals to improve animal health and to avoid the introduction of microorganisms into the food chain. The analysis of the presence of pharmaceutical residues in animal manure could help to evaluate the legal and illegal practices during food production without harming the animals and to correctly manage manure when it is going to be applied as a fertilizer. This article describes a method for the simultaneous analysis of 29 active substances, mostly antibiotics and antiparasitic agents. Substances were extracted from lyophilized manure with a methanol:McIlvaine solution and analyzed with HPLC-ESI-MS/MS and a C18 HPLC column. The method was validated following European guidelines, the achieved trueness was between 63 and 128% (depending on the analytes), and the linearity was between 100 and 1500 mu g/kg. The applicability of the method was demonstrated in 40 manure samples collected from pig farms where tetracycline was quantified in 7.5% of the samples. These results show the viability of this non-invasive method for the control of the legal and illegal administration of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals.

AB  - The dentate gyrus (DG) of hippocampus is hypothesized to act as a pattern separator that distinguishes between similar input patterns during memory formation and retrieval. Sparse ensembles of DG cells associated with learning and memory, i.e. engrams, have been labeled and manipulated to recall novel context memories. Functional studies of DG cell activity have demonstrated the spatial specificity and stability of DG cells during navigation. To reconcile how the DG contributes to separating global context as well as individual navigational routes, we trained mice to perform a delayed-non-match-to-position (DNMP) T-maze task and labeled DG neurons during performance of this task on a novel T-maze. The following day, mice navigated a second environment: the same T-maze, the same T-maze with one route permanently blocked but still visible, or a novel open field. We found that the degree of engram reactivation across days differed based on the traversal of maze routes, such that mice traversing only one arm had higher ensemble overlap than chance but less overlap than mice running the full two-route task. Mice experiencing the open field had similar ensemble sizes to the other groups but only chance-level ensemble reactivation. Ensemble overlap differences could not be explained by behavioral variability across groups, nor did behavioral metrics correlate to degree of ensemble reactivation. Together, these results support the hypothesis that DG contributes to spatial navigation memory and that partially nonoverlapping ensembles encode different routes within the context of an environment.

AB  - The remyelination process within the diabetes mellitus (DM) brain is inhibited, and dynamic interactions between DNA methylation and transcription factors are critical for this process. Repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is a major regulator of oligodendrocyte differentiation, and the role of REST on DM remyelination remains to be investigated. Here, we investigated the effects of REST and DNA methylation on DM remyelination and explored the underlying mechanisms. In this study, using a diabetic mouse model, we found that myelin damage preceded neuronal damage and caused cognitive impairment in DM mice. Inhibition of REST by X5050 and DNMT3b by Naomycin A promoted myelin regeneration in the hippocampus and ameliorated cognitive deficits in DM mice. In addition, CpA methylation of the RE-1 locus of the CNTN1 gene was able to increase the binding capacity of REST. We also observed that CNTN1 promotes oligodendrocyte maturation, facilitates the ratio of microglia to pro-regenerative phenotypes as well as enhances the ability of microglia to remove myelin debris. Our findings suggest that REST and DNMT3b expression inhibit CNTN1 expression and exacerbate myelin damage. This mechanism of gene silencing may be associated with DNMT3b-mediated CpA methylation of the REST binding site in the promoter region of the CNTN1 gene. We also identified the role for CNTN1 in promoting oligodendrocyte precursor cell maturation and myelin debris removal during remyelination.

AB  - Poor adventitious root (AR) formation poses a major constraint to the propagation of tea cuttings. The present study identified two tea cultivars with different rooting behavior: Camellia sinensis cv. Taixuan 0310 (TX), with strong and rapid rooting; and C. sinensis cv. Qianmei 601 (QM), with poor and slow rooting. To elucidate the molecular events underlying AR formation in tea cuttings, transcriptomic analysis was performed during early root formation and root elongation. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TX and QM were identified. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, plant MAPK signaling and plant-pathogen interaction, all play important roles in AR information in C. sinensis. Among the DEGs, two GRETCHEN HAGEN3 (GH3) genes, CsGH3.2 and CsGH3.3, were isolated and characterized. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and molecular analysis suggest that CsGH3.2 and CsGH3.3 may have specific functions in different organs. Moreover, overexpression of CsGH3.2 and CsGH3.3 inhibited root growth and development in transgenic rice plant. These results give new insights into the possible role of CsGH3.2 and CsGH3.3 in adventitious rooting, and also provide an interesting starting point to discover new genes involved in AR formation in tea cuttings.
   Key message Transcriptomic analysis revealed the molecular events underlying adventitious root formation in tea cuttings, and facilitated the discovery of genes involved in this process. CsGH3.2 and CsGH3.3 appear to function in adventitious rooting in tea cuttings.

AB  - A variety of parameters, including liquefaction and semen viscosity, affect the sperm's ability to travel and reach the egg for fertilization and conception. Given that the details behind the viscosity of the semen in male camels have not yet been fully clarified, the purpose of this study was to ascertain how the addition of papain affected the viscosity of fresh diluted camel semen. The study examined semen samples derived from camels that had distinct viscosities. Sperm motility, viability, abnormal sperm percentage, concentration, viscosity, morphometry, acrosome integrity and liquefaction were among the evaluations following 0, 5, 10, 20 or 30 min of incubation at 37 degrees C with papain (0.004 mg/mL, 0.04 mg/mL or 0.4 mg/mL; a semen sample without papain was used as a control). A statistically significant interaction between the effects of papain concentrations and incubation time was found (F = 41.68, p = .0001). Papain concentrations (p = .0001) and incubation times (p = .0001) both had a statistically significant impact on viscosity, according to a simple main effects analysis. A lower viscosity was found (p < .05) at 0.04 mg/mL (0.1 +/- 0.0) after 10 min of incubation. A simple main effects analysis showed that papain concentrations and incubation time have a statistically significant effect on sperm motility (p = .0001). At 0.04 mg/mL papain, the sperm motility % was higher (p < .05) after 10 min (64.4 +/- 4.8), 20 min (68.4 +/- 6.2), and 30 min incubation (72.2 +/- 6.6) compared to 0, 5 min (38.3 +/- 4.1 and 51.6 +/- 5.0, respectively). In conclusion, the fresh diluted camel semen had the lowest viscosity properties after 10 min of incubation with 0.04 mg/mL papain, without compromising sperm motility, viability, acrosome integrity and sperm morphology.

AB  - Competition between overlapping memories is considered one of the major causes of forgetting, and it is still unknown how the human brain resolves such mnemonic conflict. In the present magnetoencephalography (MEG) study, we empirically tested a computational model that leverages an oscillating inhibition algorithm to minimise overlap between memories. We used a proactive interference task, where a reminder word could be associated with either a single image (non-competitive condition) or two competing images, and participants were asked to always recall the most recently learned word-image association. Time-resolved pattern classifiers were trained to detect the reactivated content of target and competitor memories from MEG sensor patterns, and the timing of these neural reactivations was analysed relative to the phase of the dominant hippocampal 3 Hz theta oscillation. In line with our pre-registered hypotheses, target and competitor reactivations locked to different phases of the hippocampal theta rhythm after several repeated recalls. Participants who behaviourally experienced lower levels of interference also showed larger phase separation between the two overlapping memories. The findings provide evidence that the temporal segregation of memories, orchestrated by slow oscillations, plays a functional role in resolving mnemonic competition by separating and prioritising relevant memories under conditions of high interference.

AB  - Plants can move in various complex ways in response to external stimuli.1,2 These mechanisms include re-sponses to environmental triggers, such as tropic responses to light or gravity and nastic responses to hu-midity or contact.3 Nyctinasty, the movements involving circadian rhythmic folding at night and opening at daytime of plant leaves or leaflets, has attracted the attention of scientists and the public for centuries.4,5 In his canonical work entitled The Power of Movement in Plants, Charles Darwin carried out pioneering ob-servations to document the diverse range of movements in plants.6 His systematic examination of plants showing "sleep [folding] movements of leaves"led him to conclude that the legume family (Fabaceae) in-cludes many more nyctinastic species than all other families combined.3 Darwin also found that a specialized motor organ, the pulvinus, is responsible for most sleep movements of plant leaves, although differential cell division and the hydrolysis of glycosides and phyllanthurinolactone also facilitate nyctinasty in some plants.7,8 However, the origin, evolutionary history, and functional benefits of foliar sleep movements remain ambiguous owing to the lack of fossil evidence for this process. Here, we document the first fossil evidence of foliar nyctinasty based on a symmetrical style of insect feeding damage (Folifenestra symmetrica isp. nov.) in gigantopterid seed-plant leaves from the upper Permian (-259-252 Ma) of China. The pattern of insect dam-age indicates that the host leaves were attacked when mature but folded. Our finding reveals that foliar nyc-tinasty extends back to the late Paleozoic and evolved independently among various plant lineages.

AB  - Epilepsy is commonly associated with cognitive and behavioral deficits that dramatically affect the quality of life of patients. In order to identify novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing these deficits, it is critical first to understand the mechanisms leading to cognitive impairments in epilepsy. Traditionally, seizures and epileptiform activity in addition to neuronal injury have been considered to be the most significant contributors to cognitive dysfunction. In this review we however highlight the role of a new mechanism: alterations of neuronal dynamics, i.e. the timing at which neurons and networks receive and process neural information. These alterations, caused by the underlying etiologies of epilepsy syndromes, are observed in both animal models and patients in the form of abnormal oscillation patterns in unit firing, local field potentials, and electroencephalogram (EEG). Evidence suggests that such mechanisms significantly contribute to cognitive impairment in epilepsy, independently of seizures and interictal epileptiform activity. Therefore, therapeutic strategies directly targeting neuronal dynamics rather than seizure reduction may significantly benefit the quality of life of patients.

AB  - Memory consolidation processes have been shown to benefit from modulations in brain activity, particularly theta oscillations. Our previous studies showed that increases in post-learning Theta/Beta power ratio improves subsequent performance in both procedural and declarative memory across various tasks. In this study, we investigated the role of increases in frontal-midline Theta/Beta power ratio using EEG neurofeedback (NFB) in enhancing spatial memory consolidation during a navigation task in a virtual Minecraft environment. Sixty-four participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: Theta/Beta NFB, Beta/Theta NFB, or a passive control group. Following spatial memory acquisition and three memory tests in the virtual environment, participants underwent a neurofeedback intervention designed to either upregulating or downregulate the Theta/ Beta power ratio. Performance was assessed immediately post-intervention, 24 h later, and one week after the intervention. Results indicate that while some participants failed to regulate their Theta/Beta power by using the NFB display, those who increased their Theta/Beta power ratio, regardless of NFB, showed improved spatial memory, reflected in faster task completion times. Conversely, participants who exhibited a decrease in Theta/ Beta ratio showed performance declines, while the passive control group showed minimal improvement. Although all participants improved over time, participants who increased Theta/Beta ratio showed the most substantial gains. These findings highlight the importance of post-learning Theta/Beta ratio oscillations in spatial memory consolidation. The study's implications extend to clinical neuromodulation applications and a deeper understanding of memory processes.

AB  - Exposure from the dissolved-phase and through food-chains contributes to bioaccumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in organisms such as fishes and copepods. However, very few studies have investigated the accumulation of PAHs in corals. Information on dietary uptake contribution to PAHs accumulation in corals is especially limited. Here, we used Cavity-Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) to investigate the uptake rates and accumulation of a C-13-labeled PAH, phenanthrene, in Acropora millepora corals over 14 days. Our experiment involved three treatments representing exposure levels of increasing food-chain length. In Level W, corals were exposed to C-13-phenanthrene directly dissolved in seawater. In Level 1 representing herbivory, Dunaliella salina microalgal culture pre-exposed to (13C)-phenanthrene for 48 h was added to the coral treatment jars. In Level 2 representing predation, corals were provided a diet of copepod (Parvocalanus crassirostris) nauplii fed on D. salina pre-exposed to C-13-phenanthrene. Bioconcentration factors (BCF) and bioaccumulation factors (BAF) were calculated as appropriate for all organisms, and biomagnification factors (BMF) were calculated for A. millepora. We found that while phenanthrene uptake rates were not significantly different for the treatments, the accumulated concentration in corals was significantly higher in Level W (33.5 +/- 2.83 mg kg(-1)) than in Level 1 (27.55 +/- 2.77 mg kg(-1)) and Level 2 (29.36 +/- 3.84 mg kg(-1)). Coral log BAF values increased with food-chain length; Level 2 log BAF (6.45) was higher than Level W log BCF (4.18) and Level 1 log BAF (4.5). Coral BMF was also higher for Level 2 than for Level 1. Exposure to dissolved or diet-bound phenanthrene had no significant effect on the coral symbionts' photosynthetic efficiency (F-v/F-m) as monitored by pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM) fluorometry, indicating the PAH can be accumulated without toxic effects to their Photosystem II. Our study highlights the critical role of dietary exposure for pollutant accumulation in corals.

AB  - Simple Summary: In the European Union, gestating sows are housed in groups in pens that often have slatted floors. Slatted floor can cause injuries to the animals' legs and hooves, leading to potentially painful lameness. The purpose of our study was to verify if the installation of rubber mats on their floors could limit the occurrence of injuries and lameness in gestating sows. Mats were installed on three commercial farms for use over two consecutive sow pregnancies. The mats limited the occurrence of inflammations around the sows' leg joints but had no impact on the occurrence of lameness or leg and hoof injuries. The benefit of mats would be greater if they were available throughout the sows' lives and not just during the gestation period. However, the mat design tested was unsatisfactory because manure did not drain well off the mat and sows were dirtied quickly.
   Lameness and foot disorders are major health and welfare issues in intensive swine production systems. They are exacerbated when sows are housed in large groups on slatted concrete floors during gestation. Our study aimed to assess the effect of rubber mats in the lying area of the gestation pen on lameness and leg health in gestating sows housed in large pens in commercial conditions. The study was conducted on three commercial farms over two successive gestations. A total of 582 Large White x Landrace sows, housed in 10 static groups, were enrolled: 5 groups in pens with rubber mats and 5 groups on slatted concrete floors. Lameness, bursitis, leg injuries, claw growth defects and claw lesions were measured at the beginning, middle and end of each gestation period. The rubber mats decreased the risk of suffering from bursitis, but had no effect on the risk of lameness, leg injuries, claw growth defects or claw lesions. Sows housed on rubber mats were heavily soiled compared with those on slatted concrete floors because the mats were not perforated for slurry evacuation. Locomotion disorders and foot lesions remained prevalent despite the rubber mats in the lying area of the gestation pens, but adding rubber mats in service rooms and farrowing crates may produce better results.

AB  - Prenatal exposure to air pollution may associated with inhibition of lung development in the child, however the pos-sible mechanism is unclear. We investigated the effects of traffic-related diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure on fetal lung branching morphogenesis and elucidate the possible mechanism. Ex vivo fetal lungs collected from ICR mice at an age of 11.5 embryonic (E) days were exposed to DEPs at 0 (control), 10, and 50 mu g/mL and branching morphogenesiswas measured for 3 days. Normal IMR-90 human fetal lung fibroblast cells were exposed to DEPs at 0 (control), 10, and 50 mu g/mL for 24 h. We observed that DEP exposure significantly inhibited lung branching morphogenesis with re-duced lung branching ratios and surface areas on day 3. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) showed that DEP increased the inflammatory response and impaired lung development-related gene expressions. DEPs significantly decreased Yes -associated protein (YAP), phosphorylated (p)-YAP, transcriptional coactivator with a PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), and p-TAZ in IMR-90 cells at 10 and 50 mu g/mL. Treatment of fetal lungs with the YAP inhibitor, PFI-2, also demonstrated restricted lung branching development similar to that of DEP exposure, with a significantly decreased lung branching ratio on day 3. DEP exposure significantly decreased the lung branching modulators fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), and SOX9 in IMR-90 cells at 10 and 50 mu g/mL. Fetal lung immuno-fluorescence staining showed that DEP decreased SOX2 expression in fibronectin+ fibroblasts. DEP exposure de-creased the cellular senescence regulator, p-sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/SIRT1 in IMR-90 cells, with RNA-Seq showing impaired telomere maintenance. DEP exposure impaired fetal lung growth during the pseudoglandular stage through dysregulating the Hippo signaling pathway, causing fibroblast lung branching restriction and early senescence. Prena-tal exposure to traffic-related air pollution has adverse effects on fetal lung development.

To answer open questions in feed efficiency analysis, biologists seek to retrieve information across multiple heterogeneous data sources. However, this is error-prone and time-consuming work since the queries can involve a sequence of multiple sub-queries over several databases. We present an implementation of an ontology-based Swine Gut Microbiota Federated Query Platform (SGMFQP) that provides a convenient, automated, and efficient query service about swine feeding and gut microbiota. The system is constructed based on a domain-specific Swine Gut Microbiota Ontology (SGMO), which facilitates the construction of queries independent of the actual organization of the data in the individual sources. This process is supported by a template-based query interface. A Datalog+-based federated query engine transforms the queries into sub-queries tailored for each individual data source, and an automated workflow orchestration mechanism executes the queries in each source database and consolidates the results. The efficiency of the system is demonstrated on several swine feeding scenarios.

AB  - Simple Summary Here we present a novel open-access 3D software called Ikhnos to register and analyze bone surface modifications in bone assemblages using a sample of wild and captive wolf populations as an example to demonstrate the possibilities offered by this newly developed toolkit. The study of bone surface modifications has been proven crucial in understanding archaeological and paleontological site formation processes, including the identification of the assemblage causal agent. The use of the tools provided by Ikhnos will help interpret the fossil record by allowing the generation of accurate biological and physicochemical referential models as well as the precise documentation of bone surface modifications in archaeological and paleontological assemblages. The study of bone surface modifications (BSM) is crucial in understanding site formation processes and the identification of the causal agent behind bone assemblages in the fossil record. In that line, many efforts have been made to generate referential models based on feeding experiments and human butchery simulations that can then be used to interpret the patterns observed in archaeological and paleontological sites. Considering these needs, we developed a novel open-access three-dimensional (3D) software called Ikhnos for the study of BSM distribution patterns on limb long bones. This software is comprised of all the necessary tools for the 3D documentation of BSM and bone breakage patterns, as well as the subsequent statistical analysis of this data due to the integration of an exclusive R library, the IkhnosToolBox. Additionally, Ikhnos integrates tools for bone survivorship calculations that could facilitate the estimation of the minimum number of elements (MNE) and minimum number of individuals (MNI). As a demonstration of its precision, here we present a case study analyzing the modifications produced by wild and captive wolf (Canis lupus signatus) populations of the Iberian Peninsula on deer carcasses.

AB  - Simple Summary Upper respiratory tract viral infections are among the most common diseases. The blood-brain barrier protects the brain from direct invasion of pathogens. However, the cells share their content with other cells in small nanovesicles called exosomes that can travel long distances and cross biological barriers. Therefore, virus-infected cell extracellular vesicles (EVs) might transmit inflammatory signals or even viral particles to other cells. If they would carry such signals or particles to the central nervous system, it might cause neuroinflammation. However, the migration and impact of virus-primed airway cell EVs on the brain have not been studied yet. Therefore, the study aimed to track airway EVs from the respiratory tract to the brain and determine how infection-primed particles affect microglia-the cells responsible for immune response in the brain. The study revealed that airway cell EVs enter the brain within an hour and gather in microglia. Interestingly, many airway EVs were found in the hippocampus, the region most affected by Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, EVs from virus-infected airway cells stimulated reactive oxygen species in microglia and induced other inflammation mediators in the brain. Thus, airway cells indeed might communicate inflammatory information to the brain during viral infection. Viral infections induce extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing viral material and inflammatory factors. Exosomes can easily cross the blood-brain barrier during respiratory tract infection and transmit the inflammatory signal to the brain; however, such a hypothesis has no experimental evidence. The study investigated whether exosome-like vesicles (ELVs) from virus mimetic poly (I:C)-primed airway cells enter the brain and interact with brain immune cells microglia. Airway cells were isolated from Wistar rats and BALB/c mice; microglial cell cultures-from Wistar rats. ELVs from poly (I:C)-stimulated airway cell culture medium were isolated by precipitation, visualised by transmission electron microscopy, and evaluated by nanoparticle analyser; exosomal markers CD81 and CD9 were determined by ELISA. For in vitro and in vivo tracking, particles were loaded with Alexa Fluor 555-labelled RNA. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were evaluated by DCFDA fluorescence and mitochondrial superoxide-by MitoSOX. ELVs from poly (I:C)-primed airway cells entered the brain within an hour after intranasal introduction, were internalised by microglia and induced intracellular and intramitochondrial ROS production. There was no ROS increase in microglial cells was after treatment with ELVs from airway cells untreated with poly (I:C). In addition, poly (I:C)-primed airway cells induced inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain. The data indicate that ELVs secreted by virus-primed airway cells might enter the brain, cause the activation of microglial cells and neuroinflammation.

AB  - A new hemofiltration system was developed to continuously capture circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a large volume of whole blood using a column that was packed with antifouling zwitterionized silica microspheres. The silica microspheres were modified with sulfobetaine silane (SBSi) to inhibit fouling, resist clogging, and give a high surface wettability and prolonged operation time. Packed microspheres with different diameters formed size-controllable interstitial pores that effectively captured CTCs by ligand-free size selection. For optimized performance of the hemofiltration system, operational factors, including the size of microspheres, flow rate, and cross-sectional area of the column, were considered with respect to the removal rate for colorectal cancer cells and the retention rate for white blood cells and red blood cells. The captured CTCs were collected from the column by density sedimentation. A large quantity of colorectal cancer cells was spiked into sheep blood, and the sample was circulated for 5 h with a total operational volume of 2 L followed by collection and culture in vitro. The results showed that the proposed hemofiltration device selectively removed abundant CTCs from in vitro circulatory blood. The viable cells were harvested for amplification and potential applications for precision medicine.

AB  - Successive auditory inputs are rarely independent, their relationships ranging from local transitions between elements to hierarchical and nested representations. In many situations, humans retrieve these dependencies even from limited datasets. However, this learning at multiple scale levels is poorly understood. Here, we used the formalism proposed by network science to study the representation of local and higher-order structures and their interaction in auditory sequences. We show that human adults exhibited biases in their perception of local transitions between elements, which made them sensitive to high-order network structures such as communities. This behavior is consistent with the creation of a parsimonious simplified model from the evidence they receive, achieved by pruning and completing relationships between network elements. This observation suggests that the brain does not rely on exact memories but on a parsimonious representation of the world. Moreover, this bias can be analytically modeled by a memory/efficiency trade-off. This model correctly accounts for previous findings, including local transition probabilities as well as high-order network structures, unifying sequence learning across scales. We finally propose putative brain implementations of such bias.
   Editor's evaluation
   This paper communicates important findings on the learning of local and higher order structures in auditory sequences and will be of interest to researchers studying statistical learning, learning of graph structures, and auditory learning. The strength of the evidence is convincing, including a compelling demonstration that humans do not encode objective transition probabilities and the implementation of a wide range of sequence learning models that have been proposed in the literature.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of surface water resources is often challenging due to the lack of monitoring systems in remote areas and the high spatial distribution of water bodies. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which houses a large set of remote sensing datasets and geospatial processing power, has been applied in various aspects of surface water resources monitoring to solve some of the challenges. PyGEE-SWToolbox is a freely available Google Earth Engine-enabled open-source toolbox developed with Python to be run in Jupyter Notebooks that provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) that enables the user to obtain time series of Landsat, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, pre-process them, and extract surface water using water indices, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI), and Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). The validation of the toolbox is carried out at four reservoir and lake locations: Elephant Butte Lake, Hubbard Creek Reservoir, Clearwater Lake, and Neversink Reservoir in the United States. A time series of the water surface area generated from PyGEE-SWToolbox compared to the observed surface areas yielded good results, with R-2 ranging between 0.63 and 0.99 for Elephant Butte Lake, Hubbard Creek Reservoir, and Clearwater Lake except the Neversink Reservoir with a maximum R-2 of 0.52. The purpose of PyGEE-SWToolbox is to provide water resource managers, engineers, researchers, and students a user-friendly environment to utilize the GEE platform for water resource monitoring and generation of datasets. The toolbox is accompanied by a step-by-step user manual and Readme documentation for installation and usage.

AB  - Simple Summary Replacing and reducing antimicrobial treatments in livestock farming has become crucial for animal, human and environmental health due to global concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance. Weaning is a stressful phase in which piglets can develop enteric disorders leading to the massive use of antibiotics. In this scenario, functional nutrition represents one alternative to reducing antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of the dietary administration of the combination of tannin extracts, leonardite and tributyrin supplementation on weaned piglets. After weaning, piglets were divided into two experimental groups: one fed a basal diet (CTRL) and one fed a basal diet supplemented with 0.75% Quebracho and Chestnut tannin extracts, 0.25% leonardite and 0.20% tributyrin (MIX), respectively, for 28 days. Zootechnical performance and diarrhoea incidence were recorded. Microbiological and microbiota analyses were performed on faecal samples, and metabolic profile of blood serum was evaluated. The MIX group revealed a reduced incidence of diarrhoea and improved faecal consistency compared to the CTRL group. After 28 days, MIX revealed an increased lactobacilli:coliform ratio compared to CTRL, and the serum metabolic profile showed lower levels of low-density lipoproteins, suggesting a modulation of the lipid metabolism. The results suggest that the combination of tannin extracts, leonardite and tributyrin could improve animal health, thus reducing diarrhoea occurrence in weaned piglets. The effects of the dietary administration of a combination of Quebracho and Chestnut tannins, leonardite and tributyrin were evaluated in weaned piglets. A total of 168 weaned piglets (Landrace x Large White) were randomly allotted to two experimental groups (6 pens/group, 14 piglets/pen). Animals were fed a basal control diet (CTRL) and a treatment diet (MIX) supplemented with 0.75% tannin extracts, 0.25% leonardite and 0.20% tributyrin for 28 days. Individual body weight and feed intake were recorded weekly. Diarrhoea incidence was recorded by a faecal scoring scale (0-3; considering diarrhoea >= 2). At 0 and 28 days, faecal samples were obtained from four piglets/pen for microbiological and chemical analyses of faecal microbiota, which were then assessed by V3-V4 region amplification sequencing. At 28 days, blood from two piglets/pen was sampled to evaluate the serum metabolic profile. After 28 days, a reduction in diarrhoea incidence was observed in the MIX compared to CTRL group (p < 0.05). In addition, compared to CTRL, MIX showed a higher lactobacilli:coliform ratio and increased Prevotella and Fibrobacter genera presence (p < 0.01). The serum metabolic profile showed a decreased level of low-density lipoproteins in the treated group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, a combination of tannin extract, leonardite and tributyrin could decrease diarrhoea incidence and modulate the gut microbiota.

AB  - Microwave radiation, a prevalent environmental stressor, significantly impacts human health. Based on previous studies, we hypothesize that microwave-induced cognitive impairments and vulnerability in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) region are due to abnormal synaptic plasticity regulated by both newborn and mature neurons derived from neural stem cells (NSCs). Epigenetics links external factors to organisms, offers insights into the health effects of environmental influences. To explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of microwave radiation on neuronal synaptic plasticity from the perspective of mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. We first assessed the impact of microwave radiation on cognitive memory abilities in rats through behavioral tests. Immunofluorescence staining were applied to clarify the influence of microwave radiation on both neurons and NSCs. Molecular mechanisms were investigated by ELISA, q-PCR, Western blot, MeRIP-seq, and RNA pull-down experiments. The microwave radiated rat model exhibiting learning and memory deficits. Impaired synaptic plasticity in mature hippocampal neurons alongside hindered NSCs proliferation and development were observed. Using our established non-contact co-culture model, we replicated the in vivo adverse effects of microwave radiation. Down-regulated HNRNPA2B1 leads to reduced binding of TrkB m6A and promoted TrkB degradation. This feedback loop results in low BDNF expression, ultimately causing cognitive impairments. Our study emphasizes the neurotoxicity of microwave radiation and identifies TrkB m6A modification as a potential target for protecting against cognitive damage induced by electromagnetic radiation.

AB  - Seahorses are considered a flagship species for conservation efforts and due to their conservation status, improving knowledge on their dietary composition while applying a non-invasive approach, could be useful. Using Hippocampus guttulatus as a case study, the present study represents pioneering research into investigating the diet of seahorses by NGS-based DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples. The study developed and tested the protocol for fecal DNA metabarcoding during the feeding trials where captive seahorses were fed on a diet of known composition; the process was subsequently applied on fecal samples collected from wild individuals. The analysis of samples collected during the feeding trials indicated the reliability of the applied molecular approach by allowing the characterization of the effectively ingested prey. In the field study, among detected prey species, results revealed that the majority of the seahorse samples contained taxa such as Amphipoda, Decapoda, Isopoda, and Calanoida, while less common prey taxa were Gastropoda and Polyplacophora. As only a small amount of starting fecal material is needed and the sampling procedure is neither invasive nor lethal. The present study indicates DNA metabarcoding as useful for investigating seahorse diet and could help define management and conservation actions.</p>

AB  - Induction of oxidative stress and the associated lipid peroxidation is a prevalent mechanism through which certain metal(loid)s exert nephrotoxic effects in mammals. Research on the toxic impacts of metal(loid)s in freeranging large mammals at high trophic positions is exceedingly rare, yet crucial for understanding environmental exposure scenarios relevant to both human and animal risk assessment. Renal cortex tissues (N = 457) of freeranging brown bears (Ursus arctos) from the Dinara-Pindos population sampled in Croatia were analysed herein for toxic metal(loid)s and the underlying biological and environmental drivers of variation, with their time trend monitored during the 2009-2022 period. In 28 individuals from the 2021-2022 period, we additionally investigated associations between metal(loid)s and oxidative stress and damage biomarkers in renal cortex cells. The principal generalized linear models used to approximate variations in biomarkers of oxidative stress and damage included non-essential As, Cd, Pb, Tl and U, and essential Co, Cu, Fe and Zn. Age class and season of sampling had no impact on biomarker levels, except for lipid peroxidation, LP (April up arrow). Age, sex (females up arrow), body condition index (down arrow) and season of sampling significantly influenced metal(loid)s levels. Non-specific mammalian thresholds were crossed for Cd and Pb toxicity in 1-16% and 2% of population, respectively. Renal levels of metal(loid)s did not exhibit a clear trend over the 13-year period. The levels found in this study were higher than in sympatric carnivorous and herbivorous species, but in line with findings in ursids worldwide. Potential adverse health effects from environmental exposure in brown bears may arise from disruption of oxidative balance, as evidence clearly indicated associated changes in catalase activity (up arrow), glutathione content (up arrow), LP (down arrow), reactive oxygen species (down arrow), total antioxidant capacity (up arrow) in the renal cortex due to the presence of the most toxicologically relevant Cd and Pb.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare the performance of various Bayesian methods for genomic prediction of characteristics indicative of resistance to worms in Santa Ines sheep. Phenotypic records were collected from 271 animals belonging to six breeders in the states of Piaui and Maranhao, five from commercial herds and one from the conservation center of the research unit of Embrapa Central-North in Campo Maior, Piaui. Phenotypic records were collected from 271 animals of the Santa Ines sheep breed belonging to six breeders located Sub-regiao Centro-Norte do Brasil in the states of Piaui and Maranhao, five coming from commercial herds and one from herds at the conservation center of the federal research unit Embrapa Central-North (Campo Maior, Piaui). Phenotypic records of Strongyloides sp. eggs in the feces (STE), log transformed fecal egg count (LFEC), FAMACHA score of the ocular conjunctiva (FAM), and body condition score (BCS) were used. All animals were genotyped using the OvineSNP50 BeadChip (Illumina Inc.). After quality control, 44,548 SNP markers and all the DNA samples remained for further analyses. The following models were tested to estimate the effects of markers: Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, and Bayesian least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (BLASSO). The correlations between Genomic Breeding Values ( GEBVs) and observed breeding values were calculated and used as indicators of prediction accuracy of the genomic models. We also calculated the accuracy of the pedigree-based BLUP for comparison. Variance components, heritability, and GEBvs were calculated using the BRR model. The BRR model was considered best, due to its prediction accuracy and because this model used the lowest number of parameters. Accuracy gains higher than 60% were obtained using Bayesian models in comparison to the pedigree-based model. The heritability estimates were 0.560, 0.242, 0.253, and 0.244 for STE, LFEC, FAM, and BCS, respectively. The Bayesian models showed similar performance for prediction accuracy and significantly outperformed the pedigreebased model. The BRR model is the most recommended for genomic selection for the traits evaluated.

AB  - One of the insects that cause the most damage to Moso bamboos in the southern regions of China is Hippotiscus dorsalis (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae). However, the study of molecular and growth development analysis is limited because its genetic resources are still in the blank stage. In order to improve our knowledge of the molecular traits of this insect pest, we first generated the transcriptome from H dorsalis using PacBio Iso-Seq. With an average length of 1495 bp, 207,663 nonredundant full-length reads were produced. Using five databases, we annotated 36,238 transcripts: Uniprot (24,388), GO (1160), NR (24,110), Pfam (9333), and KEGG (14,497). According to aligning of each transcript in the NR database, most of them (85.147 %) were annotated into the functional genes from Halyomorpha halys. In the meantime, we discovered 33,689 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), 4408 transcription factors (TFs), and 586 alternative splicing (AS) events, which involved in transcriptional regulation. Additionally, the candidate cathepsin genes from the bamboo pest were examined in order to comprehend how they adapted to their host. To sum up, our findings offer a fresh resource for comprehensive transcriptional data and insights into the genetics and gene expression of H dorsalis.

AB  - Simple Summary Pest thrips species damage fruits, vegetables, field crops, and ornamental plants. They are difficult to control effectively using only insecticides. Semiochemicals produced by plants or animals are useful in integrated pest management (IPM) to reduce insecticide use in crop production. These chemicals attract arthropod pests and/or natural enemies of arthropod pests into cropping systems. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV) or plant-produced semiochemicals such as methyl salicylate (MS) attract natural enemies and can be used as a pest management tactic. This research, conducted in Tennessee in 2018 and 2019, focused on investigating the efficacy of MS and the aggregation pheromone neryl (S)-2-methylbutanoate (NMB), an attractant of western flower thrips Frankliniella occidentalis, a severe pest of many crops, as a thrips management technique when compared with a no-lure control using sweet pepper as the crop plant. Our results show that the key species of thrips attracted to both lure treatments and the no-lure control was Frankliniella tritici, a significant pest of young cotton plants, which can also reduce the pest pressure from F. occidentalis by increasing its numbers in crop plants, banker plants, or trap crops. We discuss the possibility of using MS lure as a herbivorous thrips management practice in crop production.Abstract Herbivorous thrips that damage fruits, vegetables, field crops, and ornamentals are challenging to control using insecticides and need an integrated approach (IPM) for their management. Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are semiochemical plants produced to attract natural enemies (NEs) of arthropod herbivores. Sex pheromones are animal-based semiochemicals that can attract males or females of conspecifics. The HIPV methyl salicylate (MS) is used in IPM to attract NEs. We conducted field experiments in 2018-2019 in Tennessee to study the efficacy of MS and the aggregation pheromone neryl (S)-2-methylbutanoate (NMB), which attracts Frankliniella occidentalis (FO), a dominant pest of many crops, in attracting thrips using sweet peppers. We found a significantly higher number of thrips in traps baited with MS than in the traps containing NMB when compared with a no-lure control. All treatments caught only one thrips species, Frankliniella tritici (FT), a significant pest of young cotton. It can also lower the abundance of FO in other crops. Our findings show that although FO was not found in the study location in Tennessee, traps baited with MS are suitable for managing FT and reducing FO in susceptible crops by increasing FT and attracting NEs to crop productions that use IPM-based management practices.

AB  - This study reports the first occurrence of Leptodelphax maculigera (Stal, 1859) in Brazil and the Americas. Until now, this species has not been reported outside of Africa. The notification occurred in the State of Goias in species of agronomic importance, as corn, Brachiaria, elephant grass, cultivar BRS Capiacu and beans. The identification of the species was carried out through the morphological analysis of the male terminalia. This species has been found in maize plants, were sharing the same space with another wellknown species of great economic importance to crop, Dalbulus maidis (DeLong & Wolcott). Thus, the confirmed presence of L. maculigera in Brazil and the morphological distinction of the two species are key factors for establishing Integrated Pest Management (IPM) in the areas where it is found.

AB  - Our knowledge on how the local distribution pattern of ordinary and novel hosts promotes or hinders the progress of adaptation to the novel hosts by phytophagous insects is limited. The herbivorous ladybird beetle Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) depends mainly on solanaceous plants as hosts; the major wild host of this beetle species in Java, Indonesia, is Solanum torvum. However, in several regions of Southeast Asia, including Java, H. vigintioctopunctata also occurs on the introduced fabaceous weed, Centrosema molle. Circumstantial evidence indicates that the use of C. molle by beetles became frequent in the very early 2000s in East Java. In the present study, based on laboratory and field data obtained from 2003 to 2005, we evaluated the degree of adaptation to C. molle by H. vigintioctopunctata populations from East Java and documented the geographic pattern of host-plant distribution in East Java. Laboratory experiments revealed that the beetles from East Java possessed the highest degree of adaptation to C. molle among the beetle populations thus far investigated, suggesting that the adaptation to C. molle by beetles proceeded quite rapidly in East Java in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, field surveys showed that the habitats in East Java consisted of mosaics with sites where only C. molle was distributed and sites where C. molle and solanaceous plants co-occurred. We discussed the role of such geographical structure of habitats in promoting the rapid adaptation of H. vigintioctopunctata to C. molle in East Java.

AB  - The non-invasive treatment strategy is indispensable to overcome the side effects of conventional treatment with chelating agents against arsenic. Presence of catechins and flavonoids in Camellia sinensis have potential antioxidant properties and other beneficial effects. The aim of the study was to explore the curative potential role of Camellia sinensis against uterine damages produced by sodium arsenite in mature albino rats. A dose of 10 mg of Camellia sinensis ethyl acetate (CS-EA) fraction/100 gm body weight was provided to the sodium arsenite-treated rats (10 mg/Kg body weight). LC-MS analysis was used for the detection of active component in CS-EA fraction. Enzymatic antioxidants analysis carried out by reproducible native gel technique. Hormones and some pro and anti-inflammatory markers were detected by ELISA, PCR, and western blot techniques respectively. Immunostaining was performed for the detection of estradiol receptor alpha. LC-MS analysis of CS-EA fraction ensured the presence of active tea polyphenol and tea catechin of which highest peak of epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) was obtained in this study. Significant elevations of lipid peroxidation end products followed by the diminution of antioxidant enzymes activities were noted in arsenicated rats which were capably retrieved by the treatment of CS-EA fraction. Posttreatment with CS-EA fraction meaningfully improved gonadotrophins and estradiol signalling in association with a highly expressing estradiol receptor-alpha (ER alpha) in the ovary and uterus followed by the maintenance of normal utero-ovarian histoarchitecture in arsenic fed rats. CS-EA fractioned treated group overturned the sodium arsenite driven higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and proapoptotic markers along with a low level of anti apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and comparatively lower NF-kappa B signalling in the uterus via regulating IKK beta kinase mostly by EGCG of CS-EA fraction. However, ethyl acetate fraction of Camellia sinensis played a critical role in minimizing arsenic-mediated uterine hypo-function.

TI  - Gibberellin promotes theanine synthesis by relieving the inhibition of CsWRKY71 on CsTSI in tea plant (Camellia sinensis)

AB  - Theanine is a crucial indicator of tea quality, and its significance is closely tied to the economic value of tea. There have been many reports on the regulation mechanism of theanine synthesis and accumulation, but the mechanism by which gibberellin regulates theanine synthesis in tea plants is poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the content of theanine experiences significant changes in the growth stages of tea shoots, displaying a strong correlation with gibberellin. This study confirmed that gibberellin significantly promoted the expression of the major gene of theanine synthesis, known as CsTSI. Additionally, the study identified CsWRKY71 as a transcription factor that mediated the regulation by gibberellin of theanine synthesis in tea plants. CsWRKY71 was localized in the nucleus and had a typical WRKY domain. It was a member of subclass IIC and its expression was significantly suppressed following exogenous GA3 treatment. Further assays, such as the electrophoretic mobility shift assay, dual luciferase and asODN (antisense oligodeoxynucleotide) interference, demonstrated that CsWRKY71 significantly interacted with the promoter of CsTSI, which inhibited theanine synthesis by binding to the cis-acting element (C/T)TGAC(T/C) of the CsTSI promoter. Overall, the addition of exogenous gibberellin alleviated the inhibition of CsTSI by down-regulating the expression of CsWRKY71, ultimately facilitating the rapid biosynthesis of theanine. This study elucidated the molecular mechanism of CsWRKY71-mediated gibberellin regulation of theanine synthesis in tea plant. The findings not only enhance our understanding of the regulatory processes involved in theanine synthesis in tea plants, but also provide important references for maintaining the characteristics of high theanine in the tea plant.

AB  - In this paper, an integrated numerical model is presented and validated to investigate the particle charging and migration behaviors in a wire-plate electrostatic precipitator (ESP) for the collection efficiency (eta) enhancement of the ESP in the piggery. Calculations of the RNG k-epsilon model, corona model, and particle tracking model are coupled in our model by utilizing MATLAB and COMSOL Multiphysics. This model is used to investigate the influence of various factors, such as the particle diameter (d(p)), flow velocity (u), and applied voltage (V), on the performance of ESP. Simultaneously, a visual experimental platform for PM2.5 migration is established for verification. The calculated results show that the predicted values of potential distribution, u distribution, and eta are in good agreement with the previously reported experimental data. Moreover, the calculated results indicate that two elliptical shapes are produced by a relatively high electric potential and space charge density in the surrounding of the discharge corona wires. Furthermore, eta first decreases with the increase of dp, remains unchanged in the range of 0.1-1.0 mu m, and then increases until became constant in the range of 1.0-10 mu m, revealing the interaction between diffusion charging, electric field charge, and fluid drag. In addition, the experimental and calculation results indicate that the eta of PM(2.5 )increases with the decrease of u and increase of V. Notably, eta of 2.0 mu m is 100% at u =1 m/s, V = 50 kV. Therefore, both the migration behavior solution method and the rules of eta dependence on PM(2.5 )provide a scientific parameter control method for improving the air quality in pig house.

AB  - Developmental life experience has long-lasting influences on the brain and behavior. The present study aims to examine the long-term effects of the enriched environment (EE), which was imposed during the adolescence period of life, on their passive avoidance and recognition memories as well as anxiety-like behaviors and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, in sleep-deprived male rats. In the present study, the male pups were separated from their mothers in postnatal day 21 (PND21) and were housed in the standard or EE for 40 days. In PND 61, the rats were allocated in four groups: control, SD (sleep deprivation), EE, and EE + SD groups. SD was induced in rats by a modified multiple platform model for 24 h. Open field, novel object recognition memory, and passive avoidance memory tests were used to examine behavior and cognitive ability. The expression of hippocampal BDNF levels was determined by PCR. The results revealed that SD increased anxiety-like behaviors and impaired cognitive ability, while adolescent EE housing alleviated these changes. In addition, EE reversed SD-induced changes in hippocampal BDNF level. We also demonstrated that EE not only has beneficial effects on the cognitive functions of normal rats but also declined memory deficits induced by SD. In conclusion, our results suggest that housing in EE during the adolescence period of life reduces cognitive impairment induced by SD. The increase of the BDNF level in the hippocampus is a possible mechanism to alleviate cognitive performance in sleep-deprived rats.

AB  - Subterranean termite control methods using chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) aim at eliminating colonies that feed upon a bait formulation. Several benzoylurea active ingredient formulations are currently commercially available as alternative termite management strategies to liquid termiticides. Individual workers need to molt on a regular basis and CSIs interfere with such molting process, allowing sufficient time for the acquisition of a colony-wide lethal dose prior to widespread mortality. As workers progressively die, the colony eventually collapses, leaving only soldiers and primary reproductives that starve to death. One common observation is that young workers often die early owing to their relatively short molting cycle. However, the absence of brood in dying colonies raises questions about the potential fate of eggs laid by the queen.This study aims to determine if CSI baits also terminate the ability of a colony to produce a new cohort of workers by disabling the ongoing brood development. Incipient termite colonies were used to test the impact of noviflumuron on the queen's ability to lay eggs and on the eggs' ability to hatch. Our results showed that queens in colonies exposed to CSI not only initially laid less eggs than the control queens, but eggs also did not develop and were progressively cannibalized, eventually leading to colony establishment failure. This result implies that queens of mature colonies exposed to CSI would lose the ability to lay viable eggs as the colony collapses, leading to an absence of worker replacement, aiding in colony elimination.

AB  - The stria vascularis (SV) contributes to cochlear homeostasis and consists of three layers, one of which contains the blood-labyrinthic barrier (BLB), with a large number of bovine cochlear pericytes (BCPs). Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic drug that can damage the SV and cause hearing loss. In this study, cell viability, proliferation rate, cytotoxicity and reactive oxygen species production were evaluated. The protein content of phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1/2, total ERK 1/2, phospho-cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), total cPLA(2) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and the release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from BCPs were analyzed. Finally, the protective effect of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) on BCPs treated with cisplatin was investigated. Cisplatin reduced viability and proliferation, activated ERK 1/2, cPLA(2) and COX-2 expression and increased PGE2 and VEGF release; these effects were reversed by Dexamethasone. The presence of PDGF-BB during the treatment with cisplatin significantly increased the proliferation rate. No studies on cell regeneration in ear tissue evaluated the effect of the PDGF/Dex combination. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cisplatin on cochlear pericytes and propose new otoprotective agents aimed at preventing the reduction of their vitality and thus maintaining the BLB structure.

AB  - Plants can respond to insects that feed with stylet mouthparts using various processes that are initiated via the salicylic acid metabolic pathway. In Australia, scale insects of the genus Parthenolecanium can cause economic damage to grapevines as they feed on the vines and produce honeydew as a waste by-product, which supports the growth of black sooty mould on fruit and leaves, potentially affecting the plant growth and yield. Using rootlings of Sauvignon Blanc (SB, resistant) and Chardonnay (Char, susceptible), the growth and production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) following exposure to scale insect infestations were measured under controlled greenhouse conditions. At harvest, the numbers of scale insects per five leaves were higher on plants infested at the start of the study compared with the control plants. Infested SB had increased dry root and shoot mass compared with the SB control, which was also the case with Char (control and infested). Leaf volatiles differed between cultivars in response to scale infestation. Benzyl alcohol decreased among infested SB plants compared with the other treatments. A change in the salicylic acid pathway as indicated by the change in benzyl alcohol may cause the increased growth in SB associated with the increased scale insect infestation.

AB  - Facial thread lifting with absorbable threads such as poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) (P(LA/CL)) has been explored in an animal model. This experimental study utilized P(LA/CL)-HA-micro threads enhanced with hyaluronic acid microencapsulation via NAMICA technology in five four-month-old female pigs. The effects were compared to those of P(LA/CL)-HA threads over a six-month period through histological analysis. The results indicated improvements in skin remodeling, with P(LA/CL)-HA-micro threads enabling controlled and prolonged release of hyaluronic acid, leading to sustained improvements in tissue structure. These findings suggest that microencapsulated threads could enhance therapeutic outcomes; however, these results are preliminary and derived from an animal model. Further research and clinical trials are necessary to confirm these benefits in human subjects.

AB  - Maternal nutrition is one of the main environmental factors regulating gene expression during fetal development through epigenetic modifications. Some nutrients, such as the amino acid Larginine, are added to maternal diets to modulate gene expression, improve the reproductive performance of females, and enhance conceptus development. This study investigated the hypothesis that supplementation of pregnant gilts with L-arginine regulates gene expression in conceptuses through epigenetic mechanisms. For this, fetal programming phenotypic markers, the expression of key epigenetic genes, and the abundance of DNA methylation proteins (DNMT3A and DNMT1) were evaluated in 25- and 35-day conceptuses from gilts supplemented (ARG) or not (CON) with 1.0 % L-arginine during early gestation. At 25 days, there were no significant differences in phenotypic markers between CON and ARG embryos (P > 0.05). Similarly, no differences were found between CON and ARG fetuses at 35 days (P > 0.05). Maternal supplementation with L-arginine did not influence the expression of the evaluated key epigenetic genes in pig embryos or fetuses, nor DNMT3A protein abundance (P > 0.05); on the other hand, DNMT1 protein abundance was lower in ARG fetuses (P = 0.002). It is concluded that supplementation of L-arginine in pregnant gilts affects epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, in 35-day fetuses through regulation of DNMT1 levels. Further studies using transcriptomic and proteomic analysis could reveal additional epigenetic modifications in embryos and fetuses following maternal supplementation with L-arginine.

AB  - In keeping with Hippocrates' philosophy 'let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food', we focused on the nutraceutical potential of an agriculture by-product: Ficus carica cultivar Zidi leaves. The nutritional profiling of dried fig leaf at post-harvest stage was investigated, showing that it is a good source of carbohydrates (39.66 +/- 0.50%), proteins (25.49 +/- 0.27%), crude fiber (13.3 +/- 0.01%), iron (14.63 +/- 0.01 mg/100 g DW), manganese (52.55 +/- 0.14 mg/100 g DW), zinc (0.57 +/- 0.01 mg/100 g DW), and copper (0.34 +/- 0.0047 mg/100 g DW). GC-MS fatty acid analysis revealed that linolenic acid (48.76%) is the major component, followed by palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids, resulting in a good oil quality according to lipid quality indices. Among the different extraction procedures applied to recover phenolic compounds from leaves collected at pre-ripening (S1) and post-harvest (S2) stages, ethanol-water sonication stage 1 has the best total phenols, flavonoids, and condensed tannins contents values (53.95 +/- 0.17 mg gallic acid equivalent/g dry weight (DW), 17.64 +/- 0.48 mg catechin equivalent/g DW, and 28.42 +/- 2.17 mg catechin equivalent/g DW, respectively). Aqueous extracts of stage 1 have the strongest 2,2 '-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.47 mg/mL); and ethanol-water sonication stage 1 and ethanol-water maceration stage 2 extracts exhibited the highest antioxidant activities against DNA strand breaks. The assessment of the antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method showed that ethanol-water maceration extract of stage 2 exhibits the best bacteria inhibition activity. The highest inhibition diameter was 17 mm, against L. monocytogenes ATCC 15313 and B. cereus ATCC 11778.

AB  - Currently, dental implants have become a common and reliable treatment for restoring masticatory function in edentulous patients. Their surface topography is of great importance for the adhesion and remodeling of bone cells, both in the initial phases and over time, and different strategies have been proposed to improve the biological performance of conventional sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched implant surfaces. Corrosion has been identified as one of the causes of implant failure due to contact with oral fluids. Carboxyethylphosphonic acid is a potent anticorrosive that would form stable bonds with titanium oxide, generating an organic layer on which modifications could be made to improve cell adhesion. Osteopontin is considered a molecule capable of improving the osseointegration of titanium. Our study evaluated the osseointegration capacity of titanium implants modified with carboxyethylphosphonic acid and functionalized with osteopontin in a minipig model. A total of 16 implants were inserted in the tibial diaphysis of two minipigs, 8 implants modified with carboxyethylphosphonic acid and functionalized with osteopontin from the experimental group and 8 from the control group with sandblasted, large-grit, acid-etched surface treatment. After 4 weeks, the animals were sacrificed and the samples were analyzed by histomorphometric analysis, assessing bone-implant contact, cortical bone-implant contact, percentage of new bone, peri-implant bone density and interthread bone area interthread. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v.18. Statistical significance was found between groups for the percentage of new bone (p = 0.04) and for interthread bone area interthread (p = 0.01). Functionalization of titanium surfaces by osteopontin may be of interest for conditioning bone remodeling in the early stages of osseointegration, although more in vivo studies are needed to determine its real influence in this aspect.

AB  - Environmental noise is a common hazard in military operations. Military service members during long operations are often exposed to around-the-clock noise and suffer massive emotional and cognitive dysfunction related to an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology. It is essential to clarify the mechanisms underlying the effects of around-the-clock noise exposure on the central nervous system. Here, Wistar rats were continuously exposed to white noise (95 dB during the on-duty phase [8:00-16:00] and 75 dB during the off-duty phase (16:00-8:00 the next day)) for 40 days. The levels of phosphorylated tau, amyloid-beta (A beta), and neuroinflammation in the cortex and hippocampus were assessed and autophagosome (AP) aggregation was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Dyshomeostasis of autophagic flux resulting from around-the-clock noise exposure was assessed at different stages to investigate the potential pathological mechanisms. Around-the-clock noise significantly increased A beta peptide, tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and Ser404, and neuroinflammation. Moreover, the AMPK-mTOR signaling pathway was depressed in the cortex and the hippocampus of rats exposed to around-the-clock noise. Consequently, autophagosome-lysosome fusion was deterred and resulted in AP accumulation. Our results indicate that around-the-clock noise exposure has detrimental influences on autophagic flux homeostasis and may be associated with AD-like neuropathology in the cortex and the hippocampus.

AB  - Sweet potato is an important food and nutrition security crop cultivated widely in sub-Saharan Africa, including Namibia, where its productivity is low. The objectives of the present study were to assess and document the socio-economic status and cropping systems of sweet potato cultivation, and to identify opportunities and challenges to sustainable production in north-central Namibia. Using a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) approach, data was collected from 238 smallholder farmers across four regions: Omusati, Ohangwena, Oshana and Oshikoto through survey, focus group discussions, and field observations. Women made up 61.34 % of the respondents who were sweet potato farmers. Sweet potato ranked the fifth most important crop cultivated, with the most dominant 61 % of farmers using the mono-cropping systems across the study regions. The majority (78 %) of sweet potato farmers harvested low yields below 250 kg/ha across the study regions. Sweet taste (89.90 %), marketability (51.70 %),drought tolerance (46.20 %), high yield (42.20 %), early maturity (35.70 %), diseases and pests resistance (26.91 %) were identified as the most preferred sweet potato attributes by respondent farmers across the regions. Limited extension services (74.70 %), pests and diseases (52.50 %), lack of irrigation water (37 %), poor soil fertility (23.50 %), low yield (21 %), lack of planting materials (19 %). were identified as leading constraints to sweet potato cultivation across the study regions. Most (35 %) of sweet potato farmers used organic fertiliser as a sources of plant nutrients, reporting more use of cattle/goat manure (67 %) across the study regions. The study recommends improving extension services, market access, certified planting materials, and women's empowerment. It urges raising awareness of orange-fleshed sweet potato, enhancing irrigation infrastructure, and strengthening policies for better sweet potato production and resilience in Namibia.

AB  - The vagus nerve regulates metabolic homeostasis and mediates gut-brain communication. We hypothesized that vagus nerve dysfunction, induced by truncated vagotomy (VGX) or carotid artery occlusion (AO), would disrupt gut-brain communication and exacerbate metabolic dysregulation, neuroinflammation, and cognitive impairment. This study aimed to test the hypothesis in gerbils fed a high-fat diet. The gerbils were divided into four groups: AO with VGX (AO_VGX), AO without VGX (AO_NVGX), no AO with VGX (NAO_VGX), and no AO without VGX (NAO_NVGX). After 5 weeks on a high-fat diet, the neuronal cell death, neurological severity, hippocampal lipids and inflammation, energy/glucose metabolism, intestinal morphology, and fecal microbiome composition were assessed. AO and VGX increased the neuronal cell death and neurological severity scores associated with increased hippocampal lipid profiles and lipid peroxidation, as well as changes in the inflammatory cytokine expression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels. AO and VGX also increased the body weight, visceral fat mass, and insulin resistance and decreased the skeletal muscle mass. The intestinal morphology and microbiome composition were altered, with an increase in the abundance of Bifidobacterium and a decrease in Akkermansia and Ruminococcus. Microbial metagenome functions were also impacted, including glutamatergic synaptic activity, glycogen synthesis, and amino acid biosynthesis. Interestingly, the effects of VGX were not significantly additive with AO, suggesting that AO inhibited the vagus nerve activity, partly offsetting the effects of VGX. In conclusion, AO and VGX exacerbated the dysregulation of energy, glucose, and lipid metabolism, neuroinflammation, and memory deficits, potentially through the modulation of the gut-brain axis. Targeting the gut-brain axis by inhibiting vagus nerve suppression represents a potential therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.

AB  - Heat stress reduces the number of Sertoli cells, which is closely related to an imbalanced redox status. Glutamate functions to maintain the equilibrium of redox homeostasis. However, the role of glutamate in heat treated Sertoli cells remains unclear. Herein, Sertoli cells from 3-week-old piglets were treated at 44 degrees C for 30 min (heat stress). Glutamate levels increased significantly following heat stress treatment, followed by a gradual decrease during recovery, while glutathione (GSH) showed a gradual increase. The addition of exogenous glutamate (700 mu M) to Sertoli cells before heat stress significantly reduced the heat stress-induced apoptosis rate, mediated by enhanced levels of antioxidant substances (superoxide dismutase (SOD), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and GSH) and reduced levels of oxidative substances (reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA)). Glutamate addition to Sertoli cells before heat stress upregulated the levels of glutamate-cysteine ligase, modifier subunit (Gclm), glutathione synthetase (Gss), thioredoxin (Trx1) and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and the ratio of phosphorylated Akt (protein kinase B)/total Akt. However, it decreased the levels of Bcl2-associated X protein (Bax) and cleaved-caspase 3. Addition of the inhibitor of glutaminase (Gls1), Bptes (Bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide, 30 mu M)to Sertoli cells before heat stress reversed these effects. These results inferred that glutamate rescued heat stress-induced apoptosis in Sertoli cells by enhancing activity of antioxidant enzymes and activating the Trx1-Akt pathway. Thus, glutamate supplementation might represent a novel strategy to alleviate the negative effect of heat stress.

AB  - In this study, a 120-day whole-life cycle exposure and oviposition experiment on zebrafish with maternal and paternal mixed mating strategy was conducted to investigate the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation in ethylhexyl salicylate (EHS, 1, 10, 100 mu g/L)-induced transgenerational effects. Results showed that EHS could induce the decrease of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) activity and average global DNA methylation level in maternal parents and the increase of the above indexes in paternal parents, while the change of glycine Nmethyltransferase activity was opposite to DNMT1. The average global DNA methylation levels were significantly increased in the offsprings of both parents exposed and father-only exposed to EHS, suggesting that EHSinduced epigenetic modifications may be stable and heritable. Hierarchical clustering analysis of promoter at different methylation sites showed that the DNA methylation pattern of offsprings were similar to that of the paternal parents, meaning that the offsprings may have inherited paternal DNA methylation pattern with eya2, pcdh2g5 and pcdh2g1 as key genes and lead to high locomotor activity in offsprings. KEGG pathway analysis showed that parental exposure to EHS may interfere with the central nervous system, insulin function system, melanogenesis system and the normal development of somatic axis of offsprings.

AB  - Passiflora organensis is a small herbaceous vine with characteristic morphological variations throughout its development. The plant bears button-shaped extrafloral nectaries exclusively in adult leaves. Extrafloral nectaries are structures that secrete nectar and play an important role in plant-animal interactions as a strategy for protecting plants against herbivory. In this work, we performed anatomical and ultrastructural studies to characterize P. organensis extrafloral nectaries during their secretory phase. We showed extrafloral nectaries in Passiflora organensis are composed of three distinct regions: nectary epidermis, nectariferous parenchyma, and subnectariferous parenchyma. Our data suggests that all nectary regions constitute a functional unit involved in nectar production and release. The high metabolic activity in the nectary cells is characterized by the juxtaposition of organelles such as mitochondria and plastids together plasmalemma. In addition, calcium oxalate crystals are frequently associated to the nectaries. An increasing concentration of calcium during leaf development and nectary differentiation was observed, corresponding to the calcium deposition as calcium oxalate crystals. This is the first description of extrafloral nectaries in Passiflora organensis that is a promising tropical model species for several studies.

AB  - Glutamate, one of the most important excitatory neurotransmitters, acts as a signal transducer in peripheral tissues and endocrine cells. Excessive glutamate secretion has been shown to cause excitotoxicity and neurodegenerative disease. Cerebrolysin is a mixture of enzymatically treated peptides derived from pig brain including neurotrophic factors, like brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). The present study investigated the protective effects of cerebrolysin on glutamate transporters (EAAT 1, EAAT 2) and cytokines (IL-1 beta and IL-10) activity in glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity. Primary cortex neuron culture was exposed to glutamate and successively treated with various cerebrolysin concentrations for 24 and 48 h. Our data showed that cerebrolysin primarily protects neurons by decreasing glutamate concentration in the synaptic cleft. In addition, Cerebrolysin can decrease oxidative stress and neuron cell damage by increasing antioxidant activity and decreasing inflammation cytokine levels.

AB  - As a main agronomic intervention in tea cultivation, nitrogen (N) application is useful to improve tea yield and quality. However, the effects of N application on the formation of tea quality-related metabolites have not been fully studied, especially in long-term field trials. In this study, a 10-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of long-term N application treatments on tea quality-related metabolites, their precursors, and related gene expression. Long-term N application up-regulated the expression of key genes for chlorophyll synthesis and promoted its synthesis, thus increasing tea yield. It also significantly increased the contents of total free amino acids, especially L-theanine, in fresh tea leaves, while decreasing the catechin content, which is conducive to enhancing tea liquor freshness. However, long-term N application significantly reduced the contents of benzyl alcohol and 2-phenylethanol in fresh tea leaves, and also reduced (E)-nerolidol and indole in withered leaves, which were not conducive to the formation of floral and fruity aroma compounds. In general, an appropriate amount of N fertilizer (225 kg/hm(2)) balanced tea yield and quality. These results not only provide essential information on how N application affects tea quality, but also provide detailed experimental data for field fertilization.

AB  - Alveolar macrophages (AMs) form the first defense line against various respiratory pathogens, and their immune response has a profound impact on the outcome of respiratory infection. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which catalyzes the trimethylation of H3K27 for epigenetic repression, has gained increasing attention for its immune regulation function, yet its exact function in AMs remains largely obscure. Using porcine 3D4/21 AM cells as a model, we characterized the transcriptomic and epigenomic alterations after the inhibition of EZH2. We found that the inhibition of EZH2 causes transcriptional activation of numerous immune genes and inhibits the subsequent infection by influenza A virus. Interestingly, specific families of transposable elements, particularly endogenous retrovirus elements (ERVs) and LINEs which belong to retrotransposons, also become derepressed. While some of the derepressed ERV families are pig-specific, a few ancestral families are known to be under EZH2-mediated repression in humans. Given that derepression of ERVs can promote innate immune activation through "viral mimicry", we speculate that ERVs may also contribute to the coinciding immune activation in AMs after the inhibition of EZH2. Overall, this study improves the understanding of the EZH2-related immune regulation in AMs and provides novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of retrotransposons in pigs.

AB  - Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) infects the larval stage of many coleopteran insects; however, the underlying mechanisms and biomarkers of infection are not fully characterised. In this study, an optimal culture condition was developed for OrNV replication and proteomic biomarkers were identified using comparative proteomic analysis. The highest level of viral copy number was observed in Sf9 cells treated with 450 mu M of H2O2 and 2% foetal bovine serum (FBS). Among the 48 identified proteins, 14 proteins were significantly modulated in 2% FBS and H2O2- treated OrNV-infected cells (F2V) as compared with 10% FBS treated non-infected cells (F10M). Network analysis revealed that SLC25A5, VDAC3, PHB2, and ANXA1 act as signature proteins for OrNV replication. Moreover, viral envelope glycoproteins, GRBNV_gp28-like and GrBNV_gp62-like proteins could be used as sensitive diagnostic signatures for OrNV infection. Furthermore, to conveniently identify the OrNV-infection in Allomyrina dichotoma larvae, an image classification model was trained by Google Teachable Machine, which distinguished images with accuracy rates of 91% and 86% for infected and non-infected larvae, respectively, at a learning rate of 0.001. This study demonstrated that Sf9 cell medium treated with 2% FBS and 450 mu M H2O2 is a permissible culture condition for OrNV replication. Proteomic signatures may be involved in the progression of viral infection. Additionally, a low-cost and non-invasive machine learning-derived digital imaging analysis may improve the prediction of OrNV infection in larvae.

AB  - Ticks are very important ectoparasites transmitting diseases to animals and humans and their natural control is an urgent need. The efficacy of nine novel aqueous plant extracts against Hyalomma dromedarii, semi-fed males, was evaluated through the adult immersion test; seven concentrations were applied (10, 20, 40, 90, 110, 130, and 170 mg/ml) for each plant extract. Plants could be arranged according to their Mortality (MO) percent, 15 days post-treatment (PT) with 170 mg/ml, as follows: 96% by Ricinus communis; followed 84% by Alchemilla vulgaris, Cichorium endivia, Quercus cortex, and Salvia rosmarinus. Three, seven, and 12 days PT, the LC50 values of the highly effective group including R. communis (100.11, 30.34, and 30.22%), A. vulgaris (140.11, 60.94, and 50.38%), C. endivia (120.56, 60.13, and 30.80%), Q. cortex (110.87, 50.05, and 30.13%) and S. rosmarinus (110.73, 50.26, and 40.35%) were calculated. The LT50 values for the highly effective plants were 1.000, 3.136, 2.282, 4.498, and 2.614 days, PT with 170 mg/ml, for R. communis, A. vulgaris, C. endivia, Q. cortex, and S. rosmarinus and their LT99 values were 9.224, 19.840, 19.296, 22.928, and 29.907 days, respectively. The relative toxicity of the A. vulgaris, Allium sativum, C. endivia, Cyperus rotundus, Lepidium sativum, Q. cortex, R. communis, and S. rosmarinus were 1.0, 1.6, 1.6, 1.2, 1.3, 1.7, 1.7, and 12 times, more effective than Lawsonia inermis, respectively. Phytochemical analyses indicated the presence of phenolic, tannin, and flavonoid compounds. This study recommended using R. communis for tick control, followed by Alc. vulgaris, Ci. endivia, Q. cortex, and S. rosmarinus.

AB  - Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) is a major pest of palms worldwide. Seedlings and juvenile palms are more vulnerable to beetle damage and in severe cases, inflicting palm death. The present study was to develop a physical pest control technique for juvenile palms using nylon nets as a pest exclusion barrier. The unopened spear leaf with -two to four adjacent leaf bases were loosely wrapped with the nylon nets of different mesh size during June - December 2017 (N = 40). Results revealed that the damaged leaves were reduced from 61.02 to 7.53% (t = 17.23; p < 0.001). Further experiment was up scaled in 120 palms during June - December 2018 and the beetles trapped in nylon nets were recorded at weekly intervals. Nylon nets entrapped 618 adult beetles that comprised 61.80% females and 38.18% males with corresponding sex ratio of 1.61: 1. Thus, use of nylon nets as a pest exclusion barrier guarded the young palms from beetle attack and additionally acted as passive trap by entrapping 20.6 beetles/week/120 palms without any insecticidal intervention.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) play a pivotal role in mediating tritrophic interactions between plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies. Paracarophenax alternatus, a parasitic mite targeting the egg stage of Monochamus alternatus, has emerged as a promising biocontrol agent. However, its ability to detect Pinus massoniana-derived HIPVs for host insect localization remains unclear. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) may play a role in mediating the perception of HIPVs and associated chemosensory signaling pathways in mites. In this study, a total of 85 GPCRs were identified from P. alternatus. All GPCRs exhibited conserved transmembrane domains and stage-specific expression patterns, with 21 receptors significantly upregulated in viviparous mites. Combined with two previously identified odorant receptors (ORs), six candidate chemosensory receptors were selected for molecular dynamics simulations to validate their binding stability with key volatile compounds. The results demonstrate that specific GPCRs likely facilitate HIPV detection in mites, enabling precise host localization within dynamic ecological niches. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular basis of mite-host interactions and establish a framework for optimizing P. alternatus-based biocontrol strategies against pine wilt disease vectors.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown how serious the problem of re-emerging zoonotic infections is for our existence. Migrations of animals, which are natural reservoirs of a particular virus, play a colossal role in the spread of pathogens to new territories. Examples are the migrations of both land animals (carnivores, rodents, and ungulates) and many marine mammals (pinnipeds and cetaceans). Yet the most interesting from the point of view of the speed and range of the spread of viral infections are migrations associated with flights. In nature, these can be migrations of insects, bats, and, of course, birds. Unfortunately, there are very few studies on the migration of these animals in Russia. Considering the problems related to climate change and other environmental factors, it is important to obtain up-to-date data on the changing animal migration routes and, as a consequence, to develop domestic equipment, particularly transmitters, to fix them.

AB  - Key message Two 4-coumarate: CoA ligase genes in tea plant involved in phenylpropanoids biosynthesis and response to environmental stresses. Tea plant is rich in flavonoids benefiting human health. Lignin is essential for tea plant growth. Both flavonoids and lignin defend plants from stresses. The biosynthesis of lignin and flavonoids shares a key intermediate, 4-coumaroyl-CoA, which is formed from 4-coumaric acid catalyzed by 4-coumaric acid: CoA ligase (4CL). Herein, we report two 4CL paralogs from tea plant, Cs4CL1 and Cs4CL2, which are a member of class I and II of this gene family, respectively. Cs4CL1 was mainly expressed in roots and stems, while Cs4CL2 was mainly expressed in leaves. The promoter of Cs4CL1 had AC, nine types of light sensitive (LSE), four types of stress-inducible (SIE), and two types of meristem-specific elements (MSE). The promoter of Cs4CL2 also had AC and nine types of LSEs, but only had two types of SIEs and did not have MSEs. In addition, the LSEs varied in the two promoters. Based on the different features of regulatory elements, three stress treatments were tested to understand their expression responses to different conditions. The resulting data indicated that the expression of Cs4CL1 was sensitive to mechanical wounding, while the expression of Cs4CL2 was UV-B-inducible. Enzymatic assays showed that both recombinant Cs4CL1 and Cs4CL2 transformed 4-coumaric acid (CM), ferulic acid (FR), and caffeic acid (CF) to their corresponding CoA ethers. Kinetic analysis indicated that the recombinant Cs4CL1 preferred to catalyze CF, while the recombinant Cs4CL2 favored to catalyze CM. The overexpression of both Cs4CL1 and Cs4CL2 increased the levels of chlorogenic acid and total lignin in transgenic tobacco seedlings. In addition, the overexpression of Cs4CL2 consistently increased the levels of three flavonoid compounds. These findings indicate the differences of Cs4CL1 and Cs4CL2 in the phenylpropanoid metabolism.

AB  - Dhurrin, a cyanogenic glucoside, is a plant defensive chemical synthesized from aliphatic amino acids and consists of beta-d-glucopyranose linked to alpha-hydroxy nitrile. It is catabolized by the consecutive action of hydroxynitrilase and beta-glucosidase to release hydrogen cyanide on tissue disruption during herbivory. These phytoanticipins are widely distributed across various monocot and dicot plants such as Sorghum, Macadamia, Ostrya sp., and many other plant species with ornamental, pharmaceutical, medicinal, and food value. Although repellent properties of dhurrin against herbivores are often reported, less is known about its distribution, metabolism, mode of action against insects, and application for pest control. Herein, we highlight recent updates on dhurrin distribution, biosynthesis, and catabolism along with the cyanide detoxification pathway. Additionally, this article focuses on biological activities of dhurrin against various herbivores and opportunities to explore the utilization of dhurrin as a natural pest control agent and a substitute for chemically synthesized pesticides.

AB  - GABA is generally known as the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, usually acting by hyperpolarizing membrane potential. However, GABAergic currents sometimes exhibit non-inhibitory effects, depending on the brain region, developmental stage or pathological condition. Here, we investigate the diverse effects of GABA on the firing rate of several single neuron models, using both analytical calculations and numerical simulations. We find that GABAergic synaptic conductance and output firing rate exhibit three qualitatively different regimes as a function of GABA reversal potential, E-GABA: monotonically decreasing for sufficiently low E-GABA (inhibitory), monotonically increasing for E-GABA above firing threshold (excitatory); and a non-monotonic region for intermediate values of E-GABA. In the non-monotonic regime, small GABA conductances have an excitatory effect while large GABA conductances show an inhibitory effect. We provide a phase diagram of different GABAergic effects as a function of GABA reversal potential and glutamate conductance. We find that noisy inputs increase the range of E-GABA for which the non-monotonic effect can be observed. We also construct a micro-circuit model of striatum to explain observed effects of GABAergic fast spiking interneurons on spiny projection neurons, including non-monotonicity, as well as the heterogeneity of the effects. Our work provides a mechanistic explanation of paradoxical effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs, with implications for understanding the effects of GABA in neural computation and development.
   Author summary Neurons in nervous systems mainly communicate at chemical synapses by releasing neurotransmitters from the presynaptic side that bind to receptors on the post-synaptic side, triggering ion flow through ion channels on the cell membrane and changes in the membrane potential of the post-synaptic neuron. Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal neurotransmitter expressed by inhibitory neurons. Its binding to GABAergic ionotropic receptors mainly causes a flow of chloride ions across the membrane, and typically hyperpolarizes the post-synaptic neuron, resulting in firing suppression. While GABA is canonically viewed as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, non-inhibitory effects have been observed in early stages of development, in stress-related disorders, and in specific parts of brain structures such as cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus. Here, we employ analytical and computational approaches on spiking neuronal models to investigate the mechanisms of diverse effects of GABAergic synaptic inputs. We find that in addition to monotonically excitatory or monotonically inhibitory effects, GABAergic inputs show non-monotonic effects, for which the effect depends on the strength of the input. This effect is stronger in the presence of noise, and is observed in different models both at the single cell, and at the network level. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation of several paradoxical experimental observations, with potential implications for neural network dynamics and computation.

AB  - Although cells are frequently maintained at cold temperatures during experiments, the effects of cold stress on cell viability and subsequent cellular conditions remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the effects of cold stress on cancer cells under various culture conditions. We showed that cold stress induces ferroptosis, a form of cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation, in sensitive cancer cell lines. High cell density and serum starvation activate the Hippo pathway and suppress cold-induced cell death. Genetic deletion of Hippo pathway components enhances cold stress susceptibility. Furthermore, the cell attachment status influences the response to cold stress, with suspended cells showing greater resistance and faster recovery than attached cells. This study highlights the importance of cellular conditions and the Hippo pathway in the handling and storage of cancer cells at cold temperatures, thereby offering insights into experimental and clinical contexts.

AB  - This study investigated the accumulation of phenlyacetaldoxime (PAOx) and PAOx-Glc in Tococa quadrialata leaves in response to herbivore infestation and mechanical wounding. Results show that PAOx levels peaked at 24 h post-infestation, while PAOx-Glc remained present for several days. The accumulation of PAOx began as early as 3 h after herbivory, with PAOx-Glc significantly increased after 6 h. Mechanical wounding induced similar responses in PAOx and PAOx-Glc accumulation as herbivory, suggesting that continuous tissue damage triggers the production of these compounds. Interestingly, SpitWorm-treated leaves showed the highest levels of both PAOx and PAOx-Glc, indicating that herbivore-derived oral secretions (OS) play a role in the induction of these compounds. Additionally, JA-independent PAOx production was found to be associated with tissue damage rather than specific known signaling compounds. Emission of benzyl cyanide and 2-phenylethanol, PAOx-derived plant volatiles, was observed in response to herbivory and SpitWorm treatment providing plant-derived OS, further highlighting the role of herbivore cues in plant defense responses.

AB  - Plants have evolved complex physical and chemical defense systems that allow them to withstand herbivory infestation. Composed of a complex mixture of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives, cuticular wax constitutes the first physical line of defense against herbivores. Here, we report the function of Glossy 8 (ZmGL8), which encodes a 3-ketoacyl reductase belonging to the fatty acid elongase complex, in orchestrating wax production and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated defenses against herbivores in maize (Zea mays). The mutation of GL8 enhanced chemical defenses by activating the JA-dependent pathway. We observed a trade-off between wax accumulation and JA levels across maize glossy mutants and 24 globally collected maize inbred lines. In addition, we demonstrated that mutants defective in cuticular wax biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana and maize exhibit enhanced chemical defenses. Comprehensive transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses indicated that the gl8 mutant confers chemical resistance to herbivores by remodeling VLCFA-related lipid metabolism and subsequent JA biosynthesis and signaling. These results suggest that VLCFA-related lipid metabolism has a critical role in regulating the trade-offs between cuticular wax and JA-mediated chemical defenses.

AB  - Both herbivory and jasmonic acid (JA) activate the biosynthesis of defensive metabolites in maize, but the mechanism underlying this remains unclear. We generated maize mutants in which ZmMYC2a and ZmMYC2b, two transcription factor genes important in JA signaling, were individually or both knocked out. Genetic and biochemical analyses were used to elucidate the functions of ZmMYC2 proteins in the maize response to simulated herbivory and JA. Compared with the wild-type (WT) maize, the double mutant myc2ab was highly susceptible to insects, and the levels of benzoxazinoids and volatile terpenes, and the levels of their biosynthesis gene transcripts, were much lower in the mutants than in the WT maize after simulated insect feeding or JA treatment. Moreover, ZmMYC2a and ZmMYC2b played a redundant role in maize resistance to insects and JA signaling. Transcriptome and Cleavage Under Targets and Tagmentation-Sequencing (CUT&Tag-Seq) analysis indicated that ZmMYC2s physically targeted 60% of the JA-responsive genes, even though only 33% of these genes were transcriptionally ZmMYC2-dependent. Importantly, CUT&Tag-Seq and dual luciferase assays revealed that ZmMYC2s transactivate the benzoxazinoid and volatile terpene biosynthesis genes IGPS1/3, BX10/11/12/14, and TPS10/2/3/4/5/8 by directly binding to their promoters. Furthermore, several transcription factors physically targeted by ZmMYC2s were identified, and these are likely to function in the regulation of benzoxazinoid biosynthesis. This work reveals the transcriptional regulatory landscapes of both JA signaling and ZmMYC2s in maize and provides comprehensive mechanistic insight into how JA signaling modulates defenses in maize responses to herbivory through ZmMYC2s.

AB  - Seasonal greening is crucial for albino plants but the underlying regulatory mechanism is unclear, especially concerning light regulation as one of the most important environmental factors for light-sensitive albino tea plants. Here, we report that the UV-B signal regulates the seasonal greening process of albino leaves by modulating CsHY5-inhibiting chlorophyll biosynthesis in Camellia sinensis cv. Huangkui. Reduction of solar UV-B in plantation promoted the seasonal greening of albino 'HK' leaves by inhibiting CsHY5 transcription and activating genes involved in light-harvesting CsLhlb and the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway (CsCHLH, CsHEMA1, and CsPORA), leading to enrichment of chlorophyll accumulation and recovery of dysfunctional chloroplasts. In contrast, indoor supplementary UV-B exposure reduced chlorophylls by activating CsHY5 but inhibiting chlorophyll biosynthetic genes. In vivo and in vitro molecular analyses showed that CsHY5 can directly bind to the promoters of CsLhlb, CsCHLH, CsHEMA1, and CsPORA. These results indicate that CsHY5 acts as a repressor for the seasonal greening of the albino tea plants in response to the UV-B signal. This is the first study that investigates the regulatory role of the CsHY5-mediated UV-B signal in regulating the seasonal greening of the albino tea plant, which improves our understanding of light regulation in leaf phenotypes of higher plants.

AB  - While classically linked to memory, the hippocampus is also a feeding behavior modulator due to its multiple interconnected pathways with other brain regions and expression of receptors for metabolic hormones. Here we tested whether variations in insulin sensitivity would be correlated with differential brain activation following exposure to palatable food cues, as well as with variations in implicit food memory in a cohort of healthy adolescents, some of whom were born small for gestational age (SGA). Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) was positively correlated with activation in the cuneus, and negatively correlated with activation in the middle frontal lobe, superior frontal gyrus and precuneus when presented with palatable food images versus non-food images in healthy adolescents. Additionally, HOMA-IR and insulinemia were higher in participants with impaired food memory. SGA individuals had higher snack caloric density and greater chance for impaired food memory. There was also an interaction between the HOMA-IR and birth weight ratio influencing external eating behavior. We suggest that diminished insulin sensitivity correlates with activation in visual attention areas and inactivation in inhibitory control areas in healthy adolescents. Insulin resistance also associated with less consistency in implicit memory for a consumed meal, which may suggest lower ability to establish a dietary pattern, and can contribute to obesity. Differences in feeding behavior in SGA individuals were associated with insulin sensitivity and hippocampal alterations, suggesting that cognition and hormonal regulation are important components involved in their food intake modifications throughout life.

AB  - Increasing evidence has shown that noise overexposure could lead to impaired hippocampal function. Hippocampal alteration is also observed in several auditory deficits, including hearing loss, and tinnitus. Therefore, the functions of hearing and cognition interact with each other. Here, we summarize the evidence that noise affects the hippocampus from aspects of behavior, neurogenesis, ultrastructure, neurotransmission, other biomarkers, and electrophysiology. We also address hippocampal alterations in auditory disorders, including hearing loss and tinnitus. Based on the current state of the field, we point out several aspects that need further investigation. This review is not only to provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of the field but to emphasize that hearing matters in cognition and pave the way for future research.

AB  - Neonicotinoid insecticides are used against agricultural, forest, and urban insect pests. Evaluation of dry neonicotinoid residues on treated filter paper is a commonly used method to determine the toxicity of active ingredients towards target and non-target organisms. Dry residues of four neonicotinoids, acetamiprid, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam, on filter paper did not cause significant levels of mortality in Hippodamia convergens (Guerin-Meneville) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) when compared to paired untreated groups. Conversely, nearly 100% mortality was observed when test insects were exposed to dry neonicotinoid residues on leaf discs and glass plate surfaces. On the other hand, dry residues of the pyrethroid bifenthrin on filter paper, leaf disks, and glass plates killed significantly more test insects when compared to untreated groups. Additional bioassays tested the toxicity of acetamiprid and thiamethoxam by evaluating the toxicity of dry residues on (1) the upper and (2) lower surfaces of treated filter paper, (3) on a glass plate underneath treated filter paper, (4) on the upper surface of treated filter paper treated with insecticide and adjuvant, and (5) dried residues on a glass plate after dipping treated filter paper in water and letting the solvent dry on the inert test surface. The results indicated that neonicotinoid insecticides applied to filter paper were adsorbed. Toxic compounds possibly move in between and binding to paper fibers so that no toxic residues were left on treated surfaces. However, adsorbed insecticides were still biologically active when washed out of filter paper and dried on an inert glass surface. The results reported here clearly demonstrate that the toxicity of neonicotinoid insecticides should not be evaluated using filter paper as a test surface.

AB  - Where a female lays her eggs has strong implications for the survival of her offspring, an impetus that takes on particular significance for species that exhibit highly specific requirements. The preference-performance (optimal oviposition) hypothesis predicts that an individual will place its eggs where the resulting offspring experience their highest success. We assessed the spatial patterns of ovipositioning of the rare, monophagous Harris' checkerspot butterfly (Chlosyne harrisii: Nymphalidae) and related this pattern to the survival of their early offspring, and the initial foraging-site decisions of the young. Harris' checkerspots laid their egg masses exclusively on flat-topped white asters (Doellingeria umbellata: Asteraceae), exhibiting a strong preference for tall plants (> 40 cm). However, they frequently laid multiple egg masses on a single plant, seemingly contradicting the preference-performance hypothesis, since even a single brood usually consumed all the leaves of its natal plant, eventually forcing the caterpillars to find another host plant. Larvae in the second instar recruiting to their next aster experienced extremely high losses, though some individuals usually managed to locate the closest site. Accordingly, the average success of single broods on a foodplant significantly exceeded that of multiple ones. We thus found little evidence that plant characteristics associated with oviposition choice benefitted overall survival. Although occasional second broods prevailed over first broods, they typically had fewer food resources than on an unoccupied plant. This study presents an apparent conundrum for the preference performance hypothesis with potential implications for the conservation of this rare butterfly.

AB  - Stomatosematidi are by far the smallest of the four supertribes of Cecidomyiinae (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) containing 56 species. The life history of only one species has been known previously: adults of Stomatosema nemorum Kieffer were reared from larvae feeding on a mushroom, Lactarius sp. (Fungi: Russulaceae). Here we describe the larva and adults of a new species, Stomatosema gagnei Kolesik, that was found inducing pustulate leaf galls on Causonis trifolia (Vitaceae) plants in Cape York Peninsula, Australia. Stomatosema gagnei is the first Stomatosematidi with a described larva and the first known to cause a gall. The fact that a species of Stomatosematidi, a supertribe hypothesized to be the sister group to all remaining Cecidomyiinae, was found inducing a plant gall suggests that the first of the transitions from the ancestral fungus-feeding habit to plant-feeding occurred in Cecidomyiidae at the base of the Cecidomyiinae clade more than 100-110 million years ago, during the lower Cretaceous.

AB  - Tetranychus urticae is an extremely generalist herbivore that can cause serious yield losses in various plants, including beans. Although alternative control options are present to control T. urticae populations in greenhouses, such as biological control, the control of spider mites in open fields has largely relied on chemical pesticides. Determination of resistance status and resistance mechanisms underlying the decreasing susceptibility is of vital importance to design a robust integrated resistance management program. Up to 9- and 15-fold resistance ratios to abamectin and pyridaben, respectively, were determined based on LC50 values. Abamectin showed excellent efficacy, whereas pyridaben application would cause control failure in more than half of the tested populations under suitable spraying conditions. Therefore, the use of pyridaben should be in rotation with other acaricides belonging to different mode of action groups. None of the populations harboured the point mutations at the target sites of abamectin and pyridaben. For the first time, resistance monitoring in T. urticae populations against pyridaben was determined in Turkey, despite its long usage history.

AB  - Mitochondrial genome sequences serve as reliable molecular markers and play a crucial role in species evolutionary analysis. From adult specimens of Tropilaelaps mercedesae, we successfully extracted the mitochondrial genome, obtaining a sequence of 15,009 base pairs (bp). This mitochondrial genome comprises 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes (tRNAs), and one control region. Research on codon usage bias in protein-coding genes reveals that most amino acids favour codons ending in A/U, with the codon usage pattern being predominantly shaped by mutational pressure, potentially supplemented by the effects of natural selection. Compared to other species within Dermanyssoidea, the mitochondrial genome of T. mercedesae displays a novel arrangement pattern. To explore the phylogenetic position of Dermanyssoidea, we utilized 13 protein-coding genes and applied maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The analysis revealed that T. mercedesae forms an independent branch and shares a closer relationship with Rhinonyssidae. Our findings constitute the first complete mitochondrial genome of the genus Tropilaelaps, laying the groundwork for future investigations into mitochondrial gene rearrangements and phylogenetics within Dermanyssoidea.

AB  - In lower termites, which exhibit a high degree of compound eye degradation or absence, antennae play a pivotal role in information acquisition. This comprehensive study investigates the olfactory system of Reticulitermes aculabialis, spanning five developmental stages and three castes. Initially, we characterize the structures and distribution of antennal sensilla across different developmental stages. Results demonstrate variations in sensilla types and distributions among stages, aligning with caste-specific division of labor and suggesting their involvement in environmental sensitivity detection, signal differentiation, and nestmate recognition. Subsequently, we explore the impact of antennal excision on olfactory gene expression in various caste categories through transcriptomics, homology analysis, and expression profiling. Findings reveal that olfactory genes expression is influenced by antennal excision, with outcomes varying according to caste and the extent of excision. Finally, utilizing fluorescence in situ hybridization, we precisely localize the expression sites of olfactory genes within the antennae. This research reveals the intricate and adaptable nature of the termite olfactory system, highlighting its significance in adapting to diverse ecological roles and demands of social living.

AB  - Spotted cucumber beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi; also known as southern corn rootworm) is a pest feeding on many crops, including cucurbits, corn (maize), peanuts, beans, and other crops and wild plants in North America. On cucurbit crops, where it co-occurs with striped cucumber beetle (Acalymma vittatum), both are key pests that vector Erwinia tracheiphila, a destructive pathogen that causes bacterial wilt. Here we deployed synthetic vittatalactone, the male-produced aggregation pheromone of A. vittatum, as lures in the field, to measure attraction of the target and non-target insects. Both sexes of D. u. howardi were strongly attracted to the vittatalactone lures (5-7.5-fold compared to blank trap) throughout the growing season in Maryland and Virginia, USA. Moreover, D. u. howardi was more attracted to live A. vittatum males feeding on squash plants than to plants with females or without any beetles, confirming the genuine organismal cross-attraction between these two key pests. The kairomonal attraction to vittatalactone suggests that it functions as a "keystone semiochemical, " mediating the colonization of cucurbits by multiple herbivore species. Such cross attraction could allow for use of vittatalactone in management of multiple pest species, with potential reduction of pesticide use in cucurbit crops.

AB  - Simple Summary There are many more wild cockroaches than household species, but they mostly live a similar life to the latter, feeding on dead and inactive organic material, and hiding in confined spaces. Most of the fossil cockroaches are similar to modern ones in their general appearance, so the lifestyle of the fossil species is probably similar to that of modern cockroaches. Years ago, a unique fossil cockroach, Manipulator modificaputis VrsanskATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE and Bechly, 2015, was discovered from Cretaceous Myanmar amber. This species somewhat resembles mantises and was speculated to be a predator. However, this hypothesis is debatable. In the present study, we redescribe Manipulator modificaputis based on new material, and describe a closely related new species, Manipulatoides obscura gen. & sp. nov. We discuss the feeding habit of these species, and consider that they tend to live around and feed on flowers (as occasionally do some modern cockroaches), instead of hunting for prey. So far, no cockroaches specialized in predation have been affirmed. Manipulator modificaputis VrsanskATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH ACUTE and Bechly, 2015 (Manipulatoridae, Corydioidea) is a purported predatory cockroach from Cretaceous Myanmar amber, based on a single male. It is distinctive by the nimble head, elongate pronotum and legs, and particularly by the extraordinarily long maxillary palpi. In the present study, we redescribe Manipulator modificaputis based on six new fossils including males and females, and comment on the original description. The closely related Manipulatoides obscura gen. & sp. nov. is proposed on the basis of five fossils, including males and females. It differs from Manipulator in weaker spination of the legs, including the type-C forefemoral spination instead of the type-A of Manipulator. Some undetermined adults and nymphs are also described. We discuss the ethology of Manipulatoridae and speculate that they might feed on flowers. They are unlikely to be specialized predators since they lack necessary weaponry for capturing prey; in contrast, their unique morphotype appears to be suitable for efficient foraging and locomotion amid flowering twigs. The possibility of being kleptoparasites of the spider-web is also discussed. In addition, regenerated four-segmented tarsi are found from the new species.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Litsea glaucescens K. (Lauraceae) is a small tree from the Mexican and Central American temperate forests, named as "Laurel". Its aromatic leaves are ordinarily consumed as condiments, but also are important in Mexican Traditional Medicine, and among the most important non wood forest products in this area. The leaves are currently used in a decoction for the relief of sadness by the Mazahua ethnic group. Interestingly, "Laurel" has a long history. It was named as "Ehecapahtli" (wind medicine) in pre-Columbian times and applied to heal maladies correlated to the Central Nervous System, among them depression, according to botanical texts written in the American Continent almost five centuries ago.Aim of the study: Depression is the first cause of incapacity in the world, and society demands alternative treatments, including aromatherapy. We have previously demonstrated the antidepressant-like activity of L. glaucescens leaves' essential oil (LEO), as well as their monoterpenes linalool, and beta-pinene by intraperitoneal route in a mice behavioral model. Here we now examined if LEO and linalool exhibit this property and anxiolytic activity when administered to mice by inhalation. We also investigated if these effects occur by BDNF pathway activation in the brain.Materials and methods: The LEO was prepared by distillation with water steam and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The monoterpenes linalool, eucalyptol and 8-pinene were identified and quantified. Antidepressant type properties were determined with the Forced Swim Test (FST) on mice previously exposed to LEO or linalool in an inhalation chamber. The spontaneous locomotor activity and the sedative effect were assessed with the Open Field Test (OFT), and the Exploratory Cylinder (EC), respectively. The anxiolytic properties were investigated with the Elevated Plus Maze Apparatus (EPM) and the Hole Board Test (HBT). All experiments were video documented. The mice were subjected to euthanasia, and the brain hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were dissected.Results: The L. glaucescens essential oil (LEO) contains 31 compounds according to GC/MS, including eucalyptol, linalool and beta-pinene. The LEO has anxiolytic effect by inhalation in mice, as well as linalool, and 8-pinene, as indicated by OFT and EC tests. The LEO and imipramine have antidepressant like activity in mice as revealed by the FST; however, linalool and ketamine treatments didn't modify the time of immobility. The BDNF was increased in FST in mice treated with LEO in both areas of the brain as revealed by Western blot; but did not decrease the level of corticosterone in plasma. The OFT indicated that LEO and imipramine didn't reduce the spontaneous motor activity, while linalool and ketamine caused a significant decrease. Conclusion: Here we report by the first time that L. glaucescens leaves essential oil has anxiolytic effect by inhalation in mice, as well as linalool, and beta-pinene. This oil also maintains its antidepressant-like activity by this administration way, similarly to the previously determined intraperitoneally. Since inhalation is a common administration route for humans, our results suggest L. glaucescens essential oil deserve future investigation due to its potential application in aromatherapy.

AB  - Bacillus velezensis is a species of Bacillus that has been widely investigated because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. However, most studies on B. velezensis have focused on the biocontrol of plant diseases, with few reports on antagonizing Salmonella Typhimurium infections. In this investigation, it was discovered that B. velezensis HBXN2020, which was isolated from healthy black pigs, possessed strong anti-stress and broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Importantly, B. velezensis HBXN2020 did not cause any adverse side effects in mice when administered at various doses (1x10(7), 1x10(8), and 1x10(9) CFU) for 14 days. Supplementing B. velezensis HBXN2020 spores, either as a curative or preventive measure, dramatically reduced the levels of S. Typhimurium ATCC14028 in the mice's feces, ileum, cecum, and colon, as well as the disease activity index (DAI), in a model of infection caused by this pathogen in mice. Additionally, supplementing B. velezensis HBXN2020 spores significantly regulated cytokine levels (Tnfa, Il1b, Il6, and Il10) and maintained the expression of tight junction proteins and mucin protein. Most importantly, adding B. velezensis HBXN2020 spores to the colonic microbiota improved its stability and increased the amount of beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus and Akkermansia). All together, B. velezensis HBXN2020 can improve intestinal microbiota stability and barrier integrity and reduce inflammation to help treat infection by S. Typhimurium.

AB  - The carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae (Zeller) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a serious pest of fruit and nut crops worldwide that causes significant losses in Iranian pistachio orchards. In order to assess variation among cultivars is susceptibility to carob moth and biochemical correlates, the present study evaluated the suitability of kernels of 10 pistachio cultivars for E. ceratoniae development and reproductive performance under laboratory conditions: 25 +/- 1 degrees C, 65 +/- 5% RH and a 16:8 (L:D) photoperiod. The primary and secondary metabolites of nuts were quantified and correlated with life history traits and various metrics of biological performance and indices of relative suitability were calculated. Nut protein content averaged 18.4 +/- 0.1% and did not vary significantly among cultivars. Two cultivars yielded significantly slower larval development and lower values for relative growth rate, female longevity and fecundity, relative to all others. Suitability indices calculated from moth life history parameters varied by a factor of 4.66 across cultivars, with values < 1 for the two most resistant varieties. The latter cultivars were less consumed by larvae and were lowest in carbohydrate content and efficiency of food conversion, but ranked highest in total phenolics, tannins and flavonoids. Linear regressions indicated that carbohydrate content was positively correlated with kernel suitability for larval development and adult reproduction, whereas total phenolics, tannins, flavonoids and anthocyanins were all negatively correlated. The implications of these findings for integrated management of E. ceratoniae in pistachio orchards, and the possibility of improving pistachio resistance to carob moth, are discussed.

AB  - Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and C. gestroi (Wasmann) are economically important structural pests in urban areas. Due to anthropogenic activity, both species have been introduced into the United States, with their respective invasive ranges now overlapping in Florida, and the two species have the capability to hybridize. The potential for structural damage from subterranean termite colonies primarily depends on colony size. However, long-term colony growth and wood consumption capabilities of hybrid Coptotermes colonies remain to be investigated, to determine the potential pest status of field-established hybrid colonies. In this study, we investigated long-term colony development over four years to determine if aging hybrid colonies display vigor in terms of colony growth. In addition, we compared wood consumption rate of hybrid colonies to compare their potential impact as structural pests with the two parental species. In aging colonies (four-year-old), both hybrid mating types displayed a colony growth equivalent to C. formosanus. However, the wood consumption rates of four-year-old colonies of the two parental Coptotermes species and their hybrids were similar, indicating equal damaging potential. We also found multiple secondary reproductives in hybrid colonies, even in the presence of primary reproductives, which may favor their potential establishment and spread. Although hybrid colonies or hybrid alates have yet to be detected in the field, our results suggest that such hybrid colonies would be an additional termite threat in the future if they were established in the field.

AB  - 1. Colonisation, i.e. the establishment of dispersed individuals in an unoccupied area, is a fundamental biological process that drives the distribution and range dynamics of organisms. It is crucial to understand the basic mechanisms of colonisation, especially in invasive species.
   2. In this study, we investigated the importance of dispersal success (the proportion of settlers and founders) and intrinsic population growth rate for colonisation ability in phytophagous mites that spread both passively and actively. We performed laboratory experiments using two eriophyid mite species: Aceria tosichella [wheat curl mite (WCM)] and Abacarus hystrix [cereal rust mite (CRM)]. These are obligate herbivores of economic importance because they feed on cereal plants, including wheat.
   3. To test the colonisation ability of WCMand CRM on wheat when dispersed actively by walking and passively when blown by air currents, we estimated the number of individuals that established new populations after dispersal and calculated the intrinsic population growth rate (r) for both species.
   4. WCM had a higher colonisation ability on wheat than CRM. This resulted from the higher dispersal success of WCM; however, the two species did not differ in r. This pattern was consistent for both dispersal modes. Moreover, both species had higher colonisation success when dispersing actively, albeit with a very limited spatial range.
   5. These results underline the role of successful dispersal in the colonisation ability of species. The knowledge of the colonisation process of WCM and CRM is important for understanding their invasiveness and for predicting their potential geographical distributions.

AB  - Parasitoids exhibit distinct behaviours while foraging for their herbivorous hosts. Some are specialised with respect to the host stage they can utilise and even the age of individuals within a single stage. Observing the behavioural response of parasitoids to hosts of varying age may provide more practical understanding of potential biocontrol agents. A wind tunnel experiment was conducted to test for host-stage dependent foraging behaviour in Goniozus jacintae Farrugia (Hymenoptera: Bethylidae), a common but understudied parasitoid of the light brown apple moth (LBAM), Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), which is a pest of grapevine, Vitis vinifera L. (Vitaceae), and other crops in Australia. Goniozus jacintae was already known to parasitise instars 3-6 of LBAM, but most readily parasitises the later instars. Later instars are larger and have a higher rate of feeding, producing more faeces and silk deposits than earlier instars, and are likely to also produce more volatile cues that may be detected by parasitoids. We found that the timing, frequency, and duration of foraging behaviours of G. jacintae varied significantly among host instars. Flight duration was shortest when females were exposed to leaves infested by fifth instars. The profile of behaviours exhibited was different during pre- and post-flight foraging, with the newly described slow walking behaviour only exhibited in close proximity to a potential host. These results contribute to the understanding of bethylid foraging, a relatively unexplored aspect of bethylid reproductive behaviour, and towards enhancing the efficacy of utilising G. jacintae in the control of leafroller pests.

AB  - The prohibition of processed animal proteins (PAPs) has been relaxed gradually since 2007. The official control method for PAPs in feedingstuff, a combination of light microscopy (LM) followed by PCR, is no longer sufficient. Thus, a targeted LC-MS/MS method was developed, which enables a tissue-specific distinction between egg and dairy products, gelatine, and PAPs derived from blood or muscle tissue of the species ruminants, pigs, poultry, and fish. Tissue-specific proteins were analyzed after tryptic digestion to peptides with high-resolution ESI-QTOF-MS. A targeted method was developed based on untargeted proteomics approaches and the selection of specific peptides (45 unique peptides in total). Proficiency testing of blank and spiked samples revealed excellent results for trueness and selectivity. Furthermore, sensitivity was achieved at a level of 0.1% (w/w) for assessed peptides. Summing up, the developed method seems to be suitable for routine analysis after verification by ring trials.

AB  - Introduction: Organs procured following brain stem death (BSD) are the main source of organ grafts for transplantation. However, BSD is associated with inflammatory responses that may damage the organ and affect both the quantity and quality of organs available for transplant. Therefore, we aimed to investigate plasma andbronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles and cardiovascular physiology in a clinically relevant 6-h ovinemodel of BSD. Methods: Twelve healthy female sheep (37-42 Kg) were anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated prior to undergoing BSD induction and then monitored for 6 h. Plasma and BAL endothelin-1 and cytokines (IL-1b, 6, 8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)) were assessed by ELISA. Differential white blood cell counts were performed. Cardiac function during BSD was also examined using echocardiography, and cardiac biomarkers (A-type natriuretic peptide and troponin I were measured in plasma. Results: Plasma concentrations big ET-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a and BAL IL-8 were significantly (p < 0.01) increased over baseline at 6 h post-BSD. Increased numbers of neutrophils were observed in the whole blood (3.1 x 10(9) cells/L [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.06-4.14] vs. 6 x 10(9) cells/L [95%CI 3.92-7.97]; p< 0.01) andBAL (4.5 x 10(9) cells/L [95%CI0.41-9.41] vs. 26[95%CI 12.29e39.80]; p = 0.03) after 6 h of BSD induction vs baseline. A significant increase in ANP production(20.28pM[95%CI 16.18-24.37] vs. 78.68pM[95%CI 53.16-104.21]; p< 0.0001) and cTnI release (0.039 ng/mL vs. 4.26 [95%CI 2.69-5.83] ng/mL; p < 0.0001), associated with a significant reduction in heart contractile function, were observed between baseline and 6 h. Conclusions: BSD induced systemic pro-inflammatory responses, characterized by increased neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production in the circulation and BAL fluid, and associated with reduced heart contractile function in ovine model of BSD.

AB  - Introduction: Variants in GATOR1 genes are well established in focal epilepsy syndromes. A strong asso-ciation of GATOR1 variants with drug-resistant epilepsy as well as an increased risk of sudden unex-plained death in epilepsy warrants developing strategies to facilitate the identification of patients who could potentially benefit from genetic testing and precision medicine. We aimed to determine the yield of GATOR1 gene sequencing in patients with focal epilepsy typically referred for genetic testing, establish novel GATOR1 variants and determine clinical, electroencephalographic, and radiological characteristics of variant carriers. Patients and Methods: Ninety-six patients with clinical suspicion of genetic focal epilepsy with previous comprehensive diagnostic epilepsy evaluation in The Neurology Clinic, University Clinical Center of Serbia, were included in the study. Sequencing was performed using a custom gene panel encompassing DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3. Variants of interest (VOI) were classified according to criteria proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association for Molecular Pathology. Results: Four previously unreported VOI in 4/96 (4.2%) patients were found in our cohort. Three likely pathogenic variants were determined in 3/96 (3.1%) patients, one frameshift variant in DEPDC5 in a patient with nonlesional frontal lobe epilepsy, one splicogenic DEPDC5 variant in a patient with nonle-sional posterior quadrant epilepsy, and one frameshift variant in NPRL2 in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy associated with hippocampal sclerosis. Only one VOI, a missense variant in NPRL3, found in 1/96 (1.1%) patients, was classified as a variant of unknown significance. Conclusion: GATOR1 gene sequencing was diagnostic in 3.1% of our cohort and revealed three novel likely pathogenic variants, including a previously unreported association of temporal lobe epilepsy with hip-pocampal sclerosis with an NPRL2 variant. Further research is essential for a better understanding of the clinical scope of GATOR1 gene-associated epilepsy.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - 13-Lipoxygenases (LOXs) initiate the synthesis of jasmonic acid (JA), the best-understood oxylipin hor-mone in herbivory defense. However, the roles of 9-LOX-derived oxylipins in insect resistance remain un-clear. Here, we report a novel anti-herbivory mechanism mediated by a tonoplast-localized 9-LOX, ZmLOX5, and its linolenic acid-derived product, 9-hydroxy-10-oxo-12(Z),15(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9,10-KODA). Transposon-insertional disruption of ZmLOX5 resulted in the loss of resistance to insect her-bivory. lox5 knockout mutants displayed greatly reduced wound-induced accumulation of multiple oxyli-pins and defense metabolites, including benzoxazinoids, abscisic acid (ABA), and JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile). However, exogenous JA-Ile failed to rescue insect defense in lox5 mutants, while applications of 1 mM 9,10-KODA or the JA precursor, 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (12-OPDA), restored wild-type resistance levels. Metabolite profiling revealed that exogenous 9,10-KODA primed the plants for increased production of ABA and 12-OPDA, but not JA-Ile. While none of the 9-oxylipins were able to rescue JA-Ile induction, the lox5 mutant accumulated lower wound-induced levels of Ca2+, suggesting this as a potential explanation for lower wound-induced JA. Seedlings pretreated with 9,10-KODA exhibited rapid or more robust wound -induced defense gene expression. In addition, an artificial diet supplemented with 9,10-KODA arrested fall armyworm larvae growth. Finally, analysis of single and double lox5 and lox10 mutants showed that ZmLOX5 also contributed to insect defense by modulating ZmLOX10-mediated green leaf volatile signaling. Collectively, our study uncovered a previously unknown anti-herbivore defense and hormone -like signaling activity for a major 9-oxylipin a-ketol.

AB  - Proper placental development is crucial for the conceptus to grow and survive, because the placenta is responsible for transporting nutrients and oxygen from the pregnant female to the developing fetus. However, the processes of placental morphogenesis and fold formation remain to be fully elucidated. In this study, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and RNA sequencing to produce a global map of DNA methylation and gene expression changes in placentas from Tibetan pig fetuses 21, 28, and 35 days post-coitus. Substantial changes in morphology and histological structures at the uterine-placental interface were revealed via hematoxylin-eosin staining. Transcriptome analysis identified 3959 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and revealed the key transcriptional properties in three stages. The DNA methylation level in the gene promoter was negatively correlated with gene expression. We identified a set of differentially methylated regions associated with placental developmental genes and transcription factors. The decrease in DNA methylation level in the promoter was associated with the transcriptional activation of 699 DEGs that were functionally enriched in cell adhesion and migration, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis. Our analysis provides a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms of DNA methylation in placental development. The methylation status of different genomic regions plays a key role in establishing transcriptional patterns from placental morphogenesis to fold formation.

AB  - Historically, Lysmata vittata has been reported with a near global non-polar distribution. Early studies reported a wide morphological variation in this species, which served as a basis for further synonymization of at least four species. Herein, we investigated the species diversity within L. vittata complex and tested whether L. rauli and L. durbanensis are valid species instead of junior synonyms of L. vittata. Our integrated morphological and molecular data strongly supports the validity of at least six taxonomic entities within the broader L. vittata complex, including L. rauli and L. durbanensis and three undescribed species. Multivariate analyses highlighted prominent morphological differences in accessory branch structure of dorsolateral antennular flagellum, number of carpal and meral segments of the second pereopod, and color pattern which segregated shrimps into distinct morpho-groups. Phylogenetic analyses supported morphological groupings and recovered five widely divergent lineages, which corresponded to the morphological groupings: L. vittata sensu stricto; L. rauli sensu stricto; L. sp. CHINA; L. sp. AUS1; and L. sp. AUS2. Therefore, we formally resurrect L. rauli to valid species status and posit it is native to the subtropical and tropical Indo West-Pacific. Although data were limited, we also formally resurrect L. durbanensis to valid species status from southern Africa. Our results imply L. vittata and L. rauli are exotic species in the western Atlantic, New Zealand, and the Mediterranean. This study provides a solid framework to continue untangling the historic L. vittata species complex, which is likely to include additional species to the ones included in the present study.

AB  - Greco-Arab medicine, popular as a complementary or alternative medicine, is based largely on herbs and minerals. This was initiated by Hippocrates (460-377 BC) and his associates in Greece, but its preferred home today is the Indian subcontinent. It believes that every person has its own distinct temperament made up of combinations of four basic humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile). A proper balance in quantity and quality of these humors indicates health, while imbalance represents a diseased condition. The temperament of individuals is influenced by a variety of internal and external factors. Treatment is done normally through regimental therapy, dietotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy. The nature of drugs (hot, cool, dry, wet, etc) is also taken into consideration. This therapy is known to have minimal side effects. It received the patronage of Delhi Sultans and Mughal Emperors for over 500 years (13th to 18th century) and is now advancing under the banner of Indian systems of medicine. This review discusses the basic principles and concepts as well as the systematic progress of Unani medicine and critically evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of this therapy in addition to highlighting the contributions of Indian Hakims (Unani physicians) to public health sector in India during the last seven centuries.

AB  - Plants are frequently exposed to herbivory and mechanical damage that result in wounding. Two fundamental strategies, regeneration and healing, are employed by plants upon wounding. How plants make different decisions and how wound healing is sustained until the damaged tissues recover are not fully understood. In this study, we found that local auxin accumulation patterns, determined by wounding modes, may activate different recovery programs in wounded tissues. Wounding triggers transient jasmonic acid (JA) signaling that promotes lignin deposition in the first few hours after wounding occurs. This early response is subsequently relayed to ABA signaling via MYC2. The induced JA signaling promotes ABA biosynthesis to maintain the expression of RAP2.6, a key factor for sustained lignin biosynthesis and the later wound-healing process. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into how plants heal from wounding and clarify the molecular mechanisms that underlie the prolonged healing process following wounding.

AB  - Albino tea cultivars have high economic value because their young leaves contain enhanced free amino acids that improve the quality and properties of tea. Zhonghuang 1 (ZH1) and Zhonghuang 2 (ZH2) are two such cultivars widely planted in China; however, the environmental factors and molecular mechanisms regulating their yellow-leaf phenotype remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that both ZH1 and ZH2 are light- and temperature-sensitive. Under natural sunlight and low-temperature conditions, their young shoots were yellow with decreased chlorophyll and an abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure. Conversely, young shoots were green with increased chlorophyll and a normal chloroplast ultrastructure under shading and high-temperature conditions. RNA-seq analysis was performed for high light and low light conditions, and pairwise comparisons identified genes exhibiting different light responses between albino and green-leaf cultivars, including transcription factors, cytochrome P450 genes, and heat shock proteins. Weighted gene coexpression network analyses of RNA-seq data identified the modules related to chlorophyll differences between cultivars. Genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis and development, light signaling, and JA biosynthesis and signaling were typically downregulated in albino cultivars, accompanied by a decrease in JA-ILE content in ZH2 during the albino period. Furthermore, we identified the hub genes that may regulate the yellow-leaf phenotype of ZH1 and ZH2, including CsGDC1, CsALB4, CsGUN4, and a TPR gene (TEA010575.1), which were related to chloroplast biogenesis. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying leaf color formation in albino tea cultivars.
   ZH1 and ZH2 were identified as light- and temperature-sensitive albino tea cultivars. WGCNAidentified hub genes regulating the albino phenotype of ZH1 and ZH2.

AB  - Culture conditions regulate the process of pluripotency acquisition and self-renewal. This study aimed to analyse the influence of the in vitro environment on the induction of porcine induced pluripotent stem cell (piPSCs) differentiation into primordial germ cell-like cells (pPGCLCs). piPSC culture with different supplementation strategies (LIF, bFGF, or LIF plus bFGF) promoted heterogeneous phenotypic profiles. Continuous bFGF supplementation during piPSCs culture was beneficial to support a pluripotent state and the differentiation of piPSCs into pPGCLCs. The pPGCLCs were positive for the gene and protein expression of pluripotent and germinative markers. This study can provide a suitable in vitro model for use in translational studies and to help answer numerous remaining questions about germ cells.

AB  - Cryptosporidium spp. is the most important foodborne and waterborne pathogens and a leading cause of mortality from foodborne and waterborne gastrointestinal diseases. In neonates of domestic animals, it is associated with consistent diarrhea and dehydration. Cryptosporidium infection begins with the ingestion of sporulated oocytes disseminated by carrier animals that consistently contaminate the environment. Many diagnostic tests are available including microscopy and antigen trap-ELISA, but none of the diagnostic tests available currently cannot differentiate between active and passive infection in the host. In the current study, to address this challenge an mRNA-based duplex TaqMan (R) probe PCR was developed to target the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein gene and 18SSU rRNA gene in a single tube that can detect metabolically active cryptosporidial oocysts. The mRNA transcripts are the direct indicator of any actively replicating cell and they will help decipher the active stages of its lifecycle in a host. This diagnostic assay was standardized by computing transcript copy number-based limit of detection (LOD). For COWP and 18SSU rRNA genes, the LOD was 7.08 x 10(04) and 5.95 x 10(05), respectively. During active infections, the oocyst wall protein will be active and so its COWP gene transcripts will act as a marker for active infection. While transcripts for 18SSU rRNA are constitutively expressed in cryptosporidial life cycle. This current diagnostic assay will be a quantitative marker that will help assess the active stages of Cryptosporidium infection in neonates. The disease dynamics will help better understand to formulate the control strategies and contain infection among healthy animals.

AB  - Plants are frequently subjected to a range of environmental stresses, including drought, salinity, cold, pathogens, and herbivore attacks. To survive in such conditions, plants have evolved a novel adaptive mechanism known as 'stress memory'. The formation of stress memories necessitates coordinated responses at the cellular, genetic/ genomic, and epigenetic levels, involving altered physiological responses, gene activation, hyper-induction and chromatin modification. Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is an important economic crop with numerous applications and high economic value. In this study, we establish G. hirsutum drought memory following cycles of mild drought and re-watering treatments and analyzed memory gene expression patterns. Our findings reveal the physiological, biochemical, and molecular mechanisms underlying drought stress memory formation in G. hirsutum. Specifically, H3K4me3, a histone modification, plays a crucial role in regulating [+ /+ ] transcriptional memory. Moreover, we investigated the intergenerational inheritance of drought stress memory in G. hirsutum. Collectively, our data provides theoretical guidance for cotton breeding.

AB  - Simple Summary The present study investigated the impacts of a change in animal housing system on selected parameters of the camel immune system. Samples collected from camels during a free-ranging time were compared with samples collected from the same camels during movement-restricted housing. Movement-restricted camels showed elevated myeloperoxidase activity in their serum, a significant shape-change of their neutrophils, and higher reactive oxygen species content in their monocytes and neutrophils. The leukogram pattern of the camels under restricted housing was characterized by increased numbers of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. Within the lymphocyte population, only the helper T cells and B cells were expanded in animals under restricted housing. In addition, restricted housing modulated the expression of several cell surface antigens, including monocyte-polarization markers and cell adhesion molecules. Functional analysis of bacterial phagocytosis indicated impaired antibacterial function of phagocytes in camels under restricted housing. In summary, the present study identified significant changes in blood immune cell composition, phenotype, and function in dromedary camels under restricted-housing conditions, and suggests the development of an excitement leukogram in those animals. Background: The dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) is an important livestock animal of desert and semi-desert ecosystems. In recent years, several elements of the camel immune system have been characterized. Stress and excitement induced by animal housing represent the most important environmental factors with potential modulatory effects on the immune system. The present study evaluated the impacts of a restricted-housing system on some phenotypic and functional properties of blood leukocytes in dromedary camels. Methods: Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were used to comparatively analyze samples collected from camels during a free-ranging time and samples collected from the same camels during movement-restricted housing. Results: In comparison to blood samples collected from the camels during the free-ranging time, samples from movement-restricted camels showed elevated serum myeloperoxidase activity, a significant shape-change in their neutrophils, and higher reactive oxygen species content in their monocytes and neutrophils, indicating increased cellular oxidative stress under movement-restricted housing. The leukogram pattern of the camels under restricted housing was characterized by leukocytosis with increased numbers of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes, resembling an excitement leukogram pattern. Within the lymphocyte population, only the helper T cells and B cells were expanded in animals under restricted housing. The upregulation of CD163 together with the downregulation of MHC-II on monocytes from excited camels indicate a modulatory potential of animal excitement to polarize monocytes toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Functional analysis of bacterial phagocytosis indicates an impaired antibacterial function of phagocytes in excited camels. The downregulation of several cell adhesion molecules on leukocytes from excited camels suggests a role for impaired cell adhesion and tissue migration and leukocyte retention in blood in the observed leukocytosis in animals under excitement. Conclusions: The present study identified significant changes in blood immune cell composition, phenotype, and function in dromedary camels under restricted-housing conditions.
   The observed changes in leukocyte composition suggest the development of an excitement leukogram pattern in camels under movement-restricted housing. To evaluate the clinical relevance of the observed changes in immune cell phenotype and function for the immune competence of camels under restricted housing, further studies are required.

AB  - Plants show an unparalleled regenerative capacity, allowing them to survive severe stress conditions, such as injury, herbivory attack, and harsh weather conditions. This potential not only replenishes tissues and restores damaged organs but can also give rise to whole plant bodies. Despite the intertwined nature of development and regeneration, common upstream cues and signaling mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to being activators of regeneration, ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 114 (ERF114) and ERF115 govern developmental growth in the absence of wounding or injury. Increased ERF114 and ERF115 activity enhances auxin sensitivity, which is correlated with enhanced xylem maturation and lateral root formation, whereas their knockout results in a decrease in lateral roots. More -over, we provide evidence that mechanical cues contribute to ERF114 and ERF115 expression in correlation with BZR1-mediated brassinosteroid signaling under both regenerative and developmental conditions. Antagonistically, cell wall integrity surveillance via mechanosensory FERONIA signaling suppresses their expression under both conditions. Taken together, our data suggest a molecular framework in which cell wall signals and mechanical strains regulate organ development and regenerative responses via ERF114-and ERF115-mediated auxin signaling.

AB  - Reconstruction of jaw bone defects present a significant problem because of specific aesthetic and functional requirements. Although widely used, the transplantation of standard autograft and allograft materials is still associated with significant constraints. Composite scaffolds, combining advantages of biodegradable polymers with bioceramics, have potential to overcome limitations of standard grafts. Polyethyleneimine could be an interesting novel biocompatible polymer for scaffold construction due to its biocompatibility and chemical structure. To date, there have been no in vivo studies assessing biological properties of hydroxyapatite bioceramics scaffold modified with polyethyleneimine. The aim of this study was to evaluate in vivo effects of composite scaffolds of hydroxyapatite ceramics and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) and novel polyethyleneimine on bone repair in swine's mandibular defects, and to compare them to conventional bone allograft (BioOss). Scaffolds were prepared using the method of polymer foam template in three steps. Pigs, 3 months old, were used and defects were made in the canine, premolar, and molar area of their mandibles. Four months following the surgical procedure, the bone was analyzed using radiological, histological, and gene expression techniques. Hydroxyapatite ceramics/polyethyleneimine composite scaffold demonstrated improved biological behavior compared to conventional allograft in treatment of swine's mandibular defects, in terms of bone density and bone tissue histological characteristics.

AB  - Understanding the complex interactions between plants and herbivores is essential for improving crop resistance. Aiming to expand the role of cyanogenesis in plant defence, we investigated the response of the cyanogenic Phaseolus lunatus (lima bean) and the non-cyanogenic Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) to Tetranychus urticae (spider mite) infestation. Despite mite infesting both legumes, leaf damage infringed by this feeder was reduced in lima bean. Comparative transcriptome analyses revealed that both species exhibited substantial metabolic and transcriptional changes upon infestation, although alterations in P. lunatus were significantly more pronounced. Specific differences in amino acid homeostasis and key genes associated with the cyanogenic pathway were observed in these species, as well as the upregulation of the mandelonitrile lyase gene ( PlMNL1 ) following T. urticae feeding. Concomitantly, the PIMNL1 activity increased. Lima bean plants also displayed an induction of beta-cyanoalanine synthase (PlCYSC1), a key enzyme for cyanide detoxification, suggesting an internal regulatory mechanism to manage the toxicity of their defence responses. These findings contribute to our understanding of the legume -herbivore interactions and underscore the potential role of cyanogenesis in the elaboration of specific defensive responses, even within the same genus, which may reflect distinctive evolutionary adaptations or varying metabolic capabilities between species.

AB  - The plant U-box (PUB) gene family, one of the major ubiquitin ligase families in plants, plays important roles in multiple cellular processes including environmental stress responses and resistance. The function of U-box genes has been well characterized in Arabidopsis and other plants. However, little is known about the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) PUB genes. Here, 89 U-box proteins were identified from the chromosome-scale referenced genome of tea plant. According to the domain organization and phylogenetic analysis, the tea plant PUB family were classified into ten classes, named Class I to X, respectively. Using previously released stress-related RNA-seq data in tea plant, we identified 34 stress-inducible CsPUB genes. Specifically, eight CsPUB genes were expressed differentially under both anthracnose pathogen and drought stresses. Moreover, six of the eight CsPUBs were upregulated in response to these two stresses. Expression profiling performed by qRT-PCR was consistent with the RNA-seq analysis, and stress-related cis-acting elements were identified in the promoter regions of the six upregulated CsPUB genes. These results strongly implied the putative functions of U-box ligase genes in response to biotic and abiotic stresses in tea plant.

AB  - The ubiquitous volatile linalool is metabolized in plants to nonvolatile derivatives. We studied Nicotiana attenuata plants which naturally vary in (S)-(+)-linalool contents, and lines engineered to produce either (R)-(-)- or (S)-(+)-linalool. Only (S)-(+)-linalool production was associated with slower growth of a generalist herbivore, and a large fraction was present as nonvolatile derivatives. We found that variation in volatile linalool and its nonvolatile glycosides mapped to the same genetic locus which harbored the biosynthetic gene, NaLIS, but that free linalool varied more in environmental responses. This study reveals how (S)-(+)-linalool and conjugates differ in their regulation and possible functions in resistance.

AB  - Cardiac shock wave therapy (CSWT) is a novel therapeutic procedure for patients with angina that is refractory to conventional therapy. We investigated the potential mechanism and therapeutic efficacy of non-R-wave-triggered CSWT to attenuate myocardial dysfunction in a large animal model of hypertensive cardiomyopathy. Sustained elevated blood pressure (BP) was induced in adult pigs using a combination of angiotensin-II and deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA). Two sessions of non-R-wave-triggered CSWT were performed at 11 and 16 weeks. At 10 weeks, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, LV posterior wall thickness and intraventricular septum thickness significantly increased in both the hypertension and CSWT groups. At 20 weeks, +dP/dt and end-systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) decreased significantly in the hypertension group but not the CSWT group, as compared with week 10. A significant improvement in end-diastolic pressure-volume relationship (EDPVR) was observed in the CSWT group. The CSWT group exhibited significantly increased microvascular density and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the myocardium. Cytokine array demonstrated that the CSWT group had significantly reduced inflammation compared with the hypertension group. Our results demonstrate that non-R-wave-triggered CSWT is safe and can attenuate LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction via enhancement of myocardial neovascularization and anti-inflammatory effect in a large animal model of hypertensive cardiomyopathy.

AB  - Jasmonates (JAs), a class of lipid -derived stress hormones, play a crucial role across an array of plant physiological processes and stress responses. Although JA signaling is thought to rely predominantly on the degradation of specific JAZ proteins by SCF COI1 , it remains unclear whether other pathways are involved in the regulation of JAZ protein stability. Here, we report that PUB22, a plant U -box type E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a critical role in the regulation of plant resistance against Helicoverpa armigera and other JA responses in tomato. Whereas COI1 physically interacts with JAZ1/2/5/7, PUB22 physically interacts with JAZ1/3/4/6. PUB22 ubiquitinates JAZ4 to promote its degradation via the 26S proteasome pathway. Importantly, we observed that pub22 mutants showreduced resistance to H. armigera, whereas jaz4 single mutants and jaz1 jaz3 jaz4 jaz6 quadruple mutants have enhanced resistance. The hypersensitivity of pub22 mutants to herbivores could be partially rescued by JAZ4 mutation. Moreover, we found that expression of PUB22 can be transcriptionally activated by MYC2, thus forming a positive feedback circuit in JA signaling. We noticed that the PUB22-JAZ4 module also regulates other JA responses, including defense against B. cinerea , inhibition of root elongation, and anthocyanin accumulation. Taken together, these results indicate that PUB22 plays a crucial role in plant growth and defense responses, together with COI1regulated JA signaling, by targeting specific JAZs.

AB  - Jasmonate (JA) regulates various aspects of plant growth and development and stress responses, with prominent roles in male reproductive development and defenses against herbivores and necrotrophic pathogens. JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins are key regulators in the JA signaling pathway and function to repress the expression of JA-responsive genes. Here, we show that JAZ proteins directly interact with several chromatin-associated Polycomb proteins to mediate repressive chromatin modifications at JA-responsive genes and, thus, their transcriptional repression in Arabidopsis. Genetic analyses revealed that the developmental defects, including anther and pollen abnormalities, resulting from loss or block of JA signaling were partially rescued by loss of Polycomb protein-mediated chromatin silencing (Polycomb repression). We further found that JAZ-mediated transcriptional repression during anther and pollen development requires Polycomb proteins at four key regulatory loci. Analysis of genome-wide occupancy of a Polycomb factor and transcriptome reprogramming in response to JA revealed that Polycomb repression is involved in the repression of various JA-responsive genes. Taken together, our study reveals an important chromatin-based mechanism for JAZ-mediated transcriptional repression and JA signaling in plants.

AB  - Simple Summary This study aims to investigate how epidermal growth factor (EGF) attenuates the effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, microelement absorption of early-weaned pigs. A total of 48 early weaned piglets were randomly distributed to four groups consisting of a 2 x 2 factorial design. The main factors were the level of LPS (H-LPS = high LPS: 100 mu g/kg body weight; Z(LPS) = low LPS: 0 mu g/kg body weight) and EGF (H-EGF = high EGF: 2 mg/kg diet; Z(EGF) = low EGF: 0 mg/kg diet). Each group had four replicates and each replicate consisted of three piglets. The results showed that H-LPS level decreased the growth performance and the apparent digestibility of crude fat, while H-EGF level increased the average daily feed intake. The concentration of most microelements in the gastrointestinal tract chyme and feces were increased by H-LPS level and decreased by H-EGF level. The expression levels of most microelement transport-relative genes in the mucosa of gastrointestinal tissues were decreased by H-LPS level and increased by H-EGF level. In conclusion, dietary EGF could attenuate the negative effect of LPS exposure on the apparent digestibility of crude fat and microelement absorption through changing the expression levels of microelement transport-relative genes. EGF can be used as an additive to increase the essential trace elements absorption in the early weaning piglets. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in nutrients absorption. However, whether it can be an effective additive to improve the growth performance and nutrients absorption in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenged early weaning piglets is still unknown. A 14-days trial was conducted to investigate how EGF attenuates the effect of LPS on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, microelement absorption of early-weaned pigs, and study the underlying mechanism. A total of 48 early weaned piglets, aged 25 days, were randomly distributed to four groups (control, EGF, LPS and EGF + LPS groups) consisting of a 2 x 2 factorial design. The main factors were the level of LPS (H-LPS = high LPS: 100 mu g/kg body weight; Z(LPS) = low LPS: 0 mu g/kg body weight) and EGF (H-EGF = high EGF: 2 mg/kg diet; Z(EGF) = low EGF: 0 mg/kg diet). Each group had four replicates and each replicate consisted of three piglets. The results showed that piglets injected with H-LPS level significantly decreased the average daily gain (ADG), and significantly increased the feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared with the piglets injected with Z(LPS) level, while piglets fed H-EGF level significantly increased the average daily feed intake (ADFI) compared with the piglets fed Z(EGF) level (p < 0.05). Piglets injected with H-LPS level significantly decreased the apparent digestibility of crude fat compared with the piglets injected with Z(LPS) level (p < 0.05). Piglets injected with H-LPS level significantly increased the concentration of most microelements in the gastrointestinal tract chyme and feces, and significantly decreased the expression levels of most microelement transport-relative genes in the mucosa of gastrointestinal tissues compared with the piglets injected with Z(LPS) level (p < 0.05).
   Piglets fed H-EGF level significantly decreased the concentration of microelement in the gastrointestinal tract chyme and feces, and significantly increased the expression levels of the microelement transport-relative genes in the mucosa of gastrointestinal tissues compared with the piglets fed Z(EGF) level (p < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary EGF could attenuate the negative effect of LPS exposure on the apparent digestibility of crude fat and microelement absorption of early-weaning piglets. EGF and LPS influenced the absorption of essential trace element through changing the expression levels of microelement transport-relative genes in the mucosa of gastrointestinal tissues. In the early weaning piglets, EGF can be used as an additive to increase the essential trace elements absorption.

AB  - In several rodent models, acute administration of the metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptor antagonist LY341495 induced antidepressant-like effects via a mechanism of action similar to that of ketamine. However, the effects of chronic mGlu2/3 antagonism have not yet been explored. Therefore, we investigated the effects of chronic LY341495 treatment on the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and the levels of synaptic proteins in mice subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). LY341495 (1 mg/kg) was administered daily for 4 weeks to mice with and without CUS exposure. After the final treatment, the forced swimming test (FST) was used to assess antidepressant-like effects. The hippocampal levels of mTORC1-related proteins were derived by Western blotting. Chronic LY341495 treatment reversed the CUS-induced behavioral effects of FST. CUS significantly reduced the phosphorylation of mTORC1 and downstream effectors [eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP-1) and small ribosomal protein 6 (S6)], as well as the expression of synaptic proteins postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GluA1) in the hippocampus. However, chronic LY341495 treatment rescued these deficits. Our results suggest that the activation of hippocampal mTORC1 signaling is related to the antidepressant effect of chronic LY341495 treatment in an animal model of CUS-induced depression.

AB  - A substantial percentage of late-life depression patients also have an cognitive impairment, which severely affects the life quality, while the co-occurring mechanisms are still unclear. Physical exercise can ameliorate both depressive behaviors and cognitive dysfunction, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its beneficial effects remain elusive. In this study, we uncover a novel adipose tissue to hippocampus crosstalk mediated by Adiponectin-Notch pathway, with an impact on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function. Adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, could activate Notch signaling in the hippocampus through upregulating ADAM10 and Notch1, two key molecules in the Notch signaling. Chronic stress inhibits the Adiponectin-Notch pathway and induces impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive dysfunction, which can be rescued by AdipoRon and running. Inhibition Notch signaling by DAPT mimics the adverse effects of chronic stress on hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function. Adiponectin knockout mice display depressive-like behaviors, associated with inhibited Notch signaling, impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive dysfunction. Physical exercise could activate Adiponectin-Notch pathway, and improve hippocampal neurogenesis and cognitive function, while deleting adiponectin gene or inhibiting Notch signaling blocks its beneficial effects. Together, our data not only suggest that Adiponectin-Notch pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction associated with depression, but also contributes to the therapeutic effect of physical exercise. This work helps to decipher the etiology of cognitive impairment associated with depression and hence will provide a potential innovative therapeutic target for these patients.

AB  - Social insects produce complex nest structures as a result of the repetition of simple behaviors by many individuals. Individual actions are often consistent across different socio-environmental conditions, which enables colonies to build a variety of structures with minimal change in behavior. In this study, we show that the individual building behavior of termites can be a species-specific trait shared even between distinct morphological castes. Subterranean termites engage in soil excavation in two different contexts in their life history: foraging for resources by workers and initial nest excavation by colony foundation pairs. Our comparison of tunneling behaviors by colony founders of three different species revealed distinct transporting mechanisms; Heterotermes aureus (Snyder) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) and Gnathamitermes perplexus (Banks) (Isoptera: Termitidae) carry sand particles using only their mandibles, while Paraneotermes simplicicornis (Banks) (Isoptera: Kalotermitidae) use their legs to kick sand particles backward. The observed behaviors are consistent with those of workers in each species, despite a substantial dimorphism of body size, especially in G. perplexus. Furthermore, the behavioral difference is associated with distinct tunnel development and task allocation patterns among species. Our study suggests that the nest building behavior of termites varies little with context or function within a species but can change among species, emphasizing the fruitfulness of comparative studies in future research.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effects of tea polyphenols (TP) and probiotics (PB) on the production performance, biochemical indices, and gut health of laying hens. A total of 400 Hy-line Brown layers (45 weeks old) were randomly assigned to 8 diet groups for 8-week feeding trial. Compared with the control basal diet (CT), dietary high dosage of TP and PB (HTP-PB) increased egg mass (P < 0.05). Supplementation with HTP-PB improved the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and decreased the malonic dialdehyde (MDA) content (P < 0.05) without affecting the contents of immunoglobulins in the serum. The combination of HTP and PB supplementation promoted the secretion of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (PROG) compared with treatment with TP or PB alone (P < 0.05). The combined use of HTP and PB induced higher jejunal villus height (VH) than the CT group (P < 0.05). Dietary TP and PB could optimize the functional network of intestinal microflora and the interactions between the intestinal microflora and the host. Therefore, the combined use of the high dosage of TP and PB affected laying performance, improved antioxidant capacity, and promoted intestinal health, which may be associated with regulation of the intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Soybean allergens are commonly quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with anti-bodies produced by the single allergen. To enhance the specificity and avoid the false-negative results, the sandwich ELISA method was developed using a rabbit anti-bulk soybean proteins polyclonal antibody and a goat anti-bulk soybean proteins polyclonal antibody as the detection and capture antibody, respectively. The pro-posed method has been optimized and validated according to the requirements of the AOAC Allergen Com-munity. The method has a wide quantification range from 0.0625 mu g/mL to 6.0 mu g/mL and can quantify soybean residues at a low level down to 0.25 mg/kg with satisfactory accuracy (recovery range from 89.5% to 118%) and precision (RSDs < 16.67%). The new approach performs high specificity to soybean residues without obvious cross-reactivity to common allergic foods and legumes, and has been successfully applied to detect soybean proteins in commercial foods. Our data demonstrated that the established sandwich ELISA method has a higher specificity, accuracy, and robustness that could meet the quantification requirements for soybean allergens.

AB  - Kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) spatiotemporally produces medicinally-important ent-labdane-related diterpenoids (ent-LRDs); andrographolide (AD), 14-deoxy-11,12-didehydroandrographolide (DDAD), neoandrographolide (NAD). ApCPS1 and ApCPS2, the ent-copalyl pyrophosphate (ent-CPP)-producing class II diterpene synthases (diTPSs) were identified, but their contributions to ent-CPP precursor supply for ent-LRD biosynthesis were not well understood. Here, we characterized ApCPS4, an additional ent-CPP-forming diTPS. Further, we elucidated in planta function of the ent-CPP-producing diTPSs (ApCPS1,2,4) by integrating transcriptmetabolite co -profiles, biochemical analysis and gene functional characterization. ApCPS1,2,4 localized to the plastids, where diterpenoid biosynthesis occurs in plants, but ApCPS1,2,4 transcript expression patterns and ent- LRD contents revealed a strong correlation of ApCPS2 expression and ent-LRD accumulation in kalmegh. ApCPS1,2,4 upstream sequences differentially activated beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in Arabidopsis and transientlytransformed kalmegh. Similar to higher expression of ApCPS1 in kalmegh stem, ApCPS1 upstream sequence activated GUS in stem/hypocotyl of Arabidopsis and kalmegh. However, ApCPS2,4 upstream sequences weakly activated GUS expression in Arabidopsis, which was not well correlated with ApCPS2,4 transcript expression in kalmegh tissues. Whereas, ApCPS2,4 upstream sequences could activate GUS expression at a considerable level in kalmegh leaf and roots/calyx, respectively, suggesting the involvement of transcriptional regulator(s) of ApCPS2,4 that might participate in kalmegh-specific diterpenoid pathway. Interestingly, ApCPS2-silenced kalmegh showed a drastic reduction in AD, DDAD and NAD contents and compromised defense against insect herbivore Spodoptera litura. However, ent-LRD contents and herbivore defense in ApCPS1 or ApCPS4-silenced plants remained largely unaltered. Overall, these results suggested an important role of ApCPS2 in producing ent- CPP for medicinal ent-LRD biosynthesis and defense against insect herbivore.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as key gene expression regulators, influencing intracellular biological and pathological processes. They are of significant interest in animal genetics as potential biomarkers for animal selection and health. This study aimed to unravel the complex miRNA signature involved in mastitis in in vitro cell culture. For this purpose, we constructed a control and treatment model in ovarian mammary epithelial cells to analyze miRNA responses upon Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) stimulation. The high-throughput Illumina Small RNA protocol was employed, generating an average of 7.75 million single-end reads per sample, totaling 46.54 million reads. Standard bioinformatics analysis, including cleaning, filtering, miRNA quantification, and differential expression was performed using the miRbase database as a reference for ovine miRNAs. The results indicated differential expression of 63 miRNAs, including 33 up-regulated and 30 down-regulated compared to the control group. Notably, miR-10a, miR-10b, miR-21, and miR-99a displayed a significant differential expression (p <= 0.05) associated to signal transduction, transcriptional pathways, diseases of signal transduction by growth factor receptors and second messengers, MAPK signaling pathway, NF-kappa B pathway, TNF alpha, Toll Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) cascade, and breast cancer. This study contributes expanding miRNA databases, especially for sheep miRNAs, and identifies potential miRNA candidates for further study in biomarker identification for mastitis resistance and diagnosis.

AB  - Staying longer in outer space will inevitably increase the health risks of astronauts due to the exposures to galactic cosmic rays and solar particle events. Exposure may pose a significant hazard to space flight crews not only during the mission but also later, when slow-developing adverse effects could finally become apparent. The body of literature examining ground-based outcomes in response to high-energy charged-particle radiation suggests differential effects in response to different particles and energies. Numerous animal and cellular models have repeatedly demonstrated the negative effects of high-energy charged-particle on the brain and cognitive function. However, research on the role of space radiation in potentiating cardiovascular dysfunction is still in its early stages. This review summarizes the available data from studies using ground-based animal models to evaluate the response of the brain and heart to the high-energy charged particles of GCR and SPE, addresses potential sex differences in these effects, and aims to highlight gaps in the current literature for future study.

AB  - To investigate the effects of tannins (TA) on porcine oocyte in vitro maturation (IVM), different concentrations of TA (0, 1, 10 and 100 mu g/mL) were supplemented with a maturation medium and the COCs and subsequent embryonic development were examined. The results showed that 10 mu g/mL TA significantly improved the cumulus expansion index (CEI), cumulus-expansion-related genes (PTGS1, PTGS2, PTX-3, TNFAIP6 and HAS2) expression and blastocyst formation rates after parthenogenetic activation (PA), in vitro fertilization (IVF) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) compared to the control groups, but not oocyte nuclear maturation. Nevertheless, 10 mu g/mL TA dramatically enhanced the mRNA expression of oocyte-development-related genes (BMP15, GDF9, CDC2 and CYCLIN B1), GSH, ATP, SOD1, PGC1 alpha, BMP15, GDF9 and CDC2 levels and reduced intracellular ROS level in porcine oocytes. These results indicated that porcine oocyte cytoplasmic maturation was improved by 10 mu g/mL TA treatment during IVM. In contrast, a high concentration of TA (100 mu g/mL) significantly decreased the CEI and PTGS1, PTGS2, PTX-3 and HAS2 mRNA expressions in cumulus cells, and reduced oocyte nuclear maturation and the total cell numbers/blastocyst. In general, these data showed that 10 mu g/mL TA supplementation has beneficial effects on oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and subsequent embryonic development in pigs.

AB  - Humans are exposed to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from various sources throughout life. Because humans are easily impacted by environmental factors during early development, it is believed that EMF can cause structural and functional changes on the developing brain that may lead to behavioural changes. This paper investigates the impact of EMF exposure and zinc supplementation during the prenatal and postnatal periods on behavioural changes and synaptic proteins in a gender-dependent manner. Pups from four groups of pregnant rats were used: Sham, EMF (5 days/wk, 4 h/day EMF-exposure applied), Sham+Zinc (5 days/wk, 5 mg/kg/day zinc applied) and EMF+Zinc (5 days/wk, 4 h/day EMF-exposure and 5 mg/kg/day zinc applied). EMF exposure and zinc supplementation were initiated from the first day of pregnancy to the 42nd postnatal day. Zinc levels in blood, NLGN3 and SHANK3 levels in hippocampus and amygdala, and synaptic structures in amygdala were examined. Behavioural tests showed that EMF exposure had no effect on social behaviour, but adversely affected activity and exploratory behaviour, and led to increased anxiety formation. Zinc supplementation had a partially positive effect on female, but not male offspring. SHANK3 and NLGN3 proteins were significantly lower in EMF groups, however, no positive effect of zinc supplementation was found. In conclusion, EMF exposure may alter the levels of synaptic proteins in the developing brain, leading to behavioural changes in a gender-dependent manner. Evaluation of zinc supplementation at different doses could be beneficial to prevent or reduce the behavioural and structural effects of EMF.

AB  - Horseshoe bats (genus Rhinolophus, , family Rhinolophidae) represent an important group within chiropteran phylogeny due to their distinctive traits, including constant high-frequency echolocation, rapid karyotype evolution, and unique immune system. Advances in evolutionary biology, supported by high- quality reference genomes and comprehensive wholegenome data, have significantly enhanced our understanding of species origins, speciation mechanisms, adaptive evolutionary processes, and phenotypic diversity. However, genomic research and understanding of the evolutionary patterns of Rhinolophus are severely constrained by limited data, with only a single published genome of R. ferrumequinum currently available. In this study, we constructed a high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for the intermediate horseshoe bat (R. R. affinis). ). Comparative genomic analyses revealed potential genetic characteristics associated with virus tolerance in Rhinolophidae. Notably, we observed expansions in several immune-related gene families and identified various genes functionally associated with the SARS-CoV2 signaling pathway, DNA repair, and apoptosis, which displayed signs of rapid evolution. In addition, we observed an expansion of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) region and a higher copy number of the HLA-- DQB2 gene in horseshoe bats compared to other chiropteran species. Based on whole-genome resequencing and population genomic analyses, we identified multiple candidate loci (e.g., GLI3) ) associated with variations in echolocation call frequency across R. affinis subspecies. This research not only expands our understanding of the genetic characteristics of the Rhinolophus genus but also establishes a valuable foundation for future research.

AB  - Two new species of Pseudasphondylia Monzen, 1955 are described and are the first records of this genus in Australia and for the plant families Myrtaceae and Chenopodiaceae. Pseudasphondylia melanopileus sp. nov. forms inconspicuous galls on the fruits of Melaleuca ericifolia (Myrtaceae) in southern Victoria. Pseudasphondylia nitrariaceia sp. nov. causes semi-woody galls on the inflorescences of Chenopodium nitrariaceum (Chenopodiaceae) and is widespread in low-rainfall regions of south-eastern Australia. Descriptions of adults and immature stages and DNA sequences of the cytochrome oxidase unit I mitochondrial gene segment are given for each of the new species.

AB  - Fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has a long association with maize (Zea mays mays L., Poaceae) and is among the crop's most significant pests worldwide. We contrasted the preference for and performance of FAW on three maize cultivars: the Mexican landrace Tuxpe & ntilde;o, the USA inbred B73 and B73-lox10; B73-lox10 is deficient in production of jasmonic acid (JA), green leaf volatiles (GLVs) and herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Female oviposition and neonate colonization preferences were assessed in triple-choice tests in greenhouse settings. Performance was assessed on the bases of larval, pupal and adult weights, larval and pupal development times, and adult longevity. We expected females to preferentially oviposit on plants on which their offspring performed best, and neonates to randomly colonize plants because they disperse aerially, presumably oriented solely by wind currents. Females preferred to oviposit on Tuxpe & ntilde;o plants, followed by B73-lox10 and B73 plants, whereas their offspring performed best on B73-lox10 and poorest on Tuxpe & ntilde;o. In contrast, neonates preferentially colonized plants on which they performed best, B73-lox10, though initially and transiently they colonized plants on which they performed poorly, B73 and Tuxpe & ntilde;o. Altogether, our results showed that FAW females preferred to oviposit on maize plants on which their offspring's performance was poorest (Tuxpe & ntilde;o), and neonates preferentially colonized plants on which their own performance was best (B73-lox10), though they initially colonized plants that were detrimental to their performance (Tuxpe & ntilde;o, B73). These results suggested that the ovipositional choices of FAW mothers are uncoupled from their offspring's performance, but newborn offspring rectified their mother's sub-optimal host plant choice by colonizing plants that enhanced their own performance. Notably, these results also suggested that aerially dispersing (ballooning) FAW larvae do not colonize plants randomly, and that plant volatiles (GLVs, HIPVs) and JA may be relevant to host plant selection by ballooning larvae.

AB  - Most insect herbivores are adapted to feed on a few host plants only, but the mechanisms underlying plant specialization are poorly understood. One of the dominant hypotheses is that insects inject an oral secretion into the plant that manipulates the plant's defences resulting in induced susceptibility. This hypothesis was tested on the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), which forms multiple biotypes, each specialized on specific legume hosts. In particular, the hypothesis that a pea-adapted biotype can induce host susceptibility on pea and increase the fitness of a non-pea-adapted biotype was tested. Survival and fecundity of an alfalfa-adapted biotype on peas were enhanced by co-infestation but not by pre-infestation with a pea-adapted biotype. The electrical penetration graph (EPG) method was then used to dissect the components of the alfalfa biotype feeding behaviour on peas with and without co-infestation by the pea biotype. While probing time did not differ between these two conditions, differences were observed in most other EPG parameters. When co-infested with the pea-adapted biotype, the alfalfa-adapted biotype was more likely to establish a phloem feeding and exhibited a longer ingestion time on peas. Our results indicated that the pea-adapted biotype induced pea susceptibility by increasing the accessibility of non-pea-adapted aphids to the host phloem sap. As a result, the alfalfa biotype increased its survival and fecundity. These results contribute to understanding how aphids manipulate their specific host plants.

AB  - The Hippo pathway's main effector, Yes-associated protein (YAP), plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis as a transcriptional coactivator. YAP's phosphorylation by core upstream components of the Hippo pathway, such as mammalian Ste20 kinase 1/2 (MST1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks), and their substrate, large tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2), influences YAP's subcellular localization, stability, and transcriptional activity. However, recent research suggests the existence of alternative pathways that phosphorylate YAP, independent of these core upstream Hippo pathway components, raising questions about additional means to inactivate YAP. In this study, we present evidence demonstrating that TSSK1B, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK) superfamily member, is a negative regulator of YAP, suppressing cellular proliferation and oncogenic transformation. Mechanistically, TSSK1B inhibits YAP through two distinct pathways. Firstly, the LKB1-TSSK1B axis directly phosphorylates YAP at Ser94, inhibiting the YAP-TEAD complex's formation and suppressing its target genes' expression. Secondly, the TSSK1B-LATS1/2 axis inhibits YAP via phosphorylation at Ser127. Our findings reveal the involvement of TSSK1B-mediated molecular mechanisms in the Hippo-YAP pathway, emphasizing the importance of multilevel regulation in critical cellular decision-making processes.

AB  - Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the main membrane water channel in the brain involved in regulating water homeostasis. The water distribution in neural tissue is often dysregulated after hypoxic neural injury. Previous research has indicated that victims of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) have an underlying brain dysfunction that impairs their critical arousal response to hypoxic stress during sleep. The aim of this study was to determine the expression levels of AQP4 in the hippocampus in SIDS/SUDC cases and controls, and compare the findings with AQP4 genotypes that previously have been shown to be associated with SIDS. Immunochemical staining and morphometry were used to evaluate the density of AQP4positive astrocytes in 30 SIDS/SUDC cases and 26 controls. AQP4-positive cells were counted in grids covering three layers in the hippocampus, which revealed that their count in any of the layers did not differ significantly between cases and controls. A decline in AQP4 expression was observed for infants older than 12 weeks. The AQP4 expression was lower in infants and children with the rs2075575 CT/TT genotype than in those with the CC genotype. This study indicates that AQP4 expression may be influenced by both age and genotype in infants. The role of AQP4 in the pathogenesis of SIDS remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Host plants can strongly influence the population performance of insects. Here, we investigated the development, survival, and oviposition of Scirtothrips dorsalis Hood on 6 host plants-Camellia sinensis ( L.) Kuntze (Ericales: Theaceae), Rosa chinensis Jacq. (Rosales: Rosaceae), Capsicum annuum L. (Solanales: Solanaceae), Eustoma grandiflorum (Hook.) G.Don (Gentianales: Gentianaceae), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (Fabales: Fabaceae), and Cucumis sativus L. (Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae), and constructed life tables for S. dorsalis on each plant. Significant differences in S. dorsalis development on the host species were observed. The mean developmental period from egg to adult was 11.45 +/- 0.12 days, 11.24 +/- 0.13 days, 12.08 +/- 0.15 days, 12.28 +/- 0.12 days, 12.67 +/- 0.10 days, and 13.03 +/- 0.11 days on C. sinensis, R. chinensis, C. annuum, E. grandiflorum, G. max, and C. sativus, respectively. Significant differences in survival of S. dorsalis were observed, namely, C. sinensis approximate to R. chinensis > E. grandiflorum approximate to C. annuum > G. max > C. sativus. The highest and lowest fecundities of S. dorsalis were recorded on R. chinensis (60.44 +/- 1.53) and C. sativus (28.64 +/- 1.02), respectively. Both of the net reproductive rate (R0) and intrinsic rate of increase (r(m)) of S. dorsalis were the highest on R. chinensis, with the values of 27.63 +/- 0.58 and 0.142 +/- 0.002, respectively; while the lowest on C. sativus, with the values of 8.81 +/- 0.12 and 0.092 +/- 0.003, respectively. Thus, R. chinensis was found to be the most suitable host, but C. sativus was the least suitable, for population development of S. dorsalis. Our results provide important information for the key control of S. dorsalis among different host plants.

AB  - In Brazil, Phaseolus vulgaris L. constitutes one of the main food substrates for human consumption due to its high nutritional features and its affordable cost. Despite the extensive bean production in the country, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a polyphagous chewing pest, uses bean plants as alternative hosts, thereby reducing its productivity. The objective of this study was to screen and characterize different bean genotypes for their resistance against S. frugiperda. From 22 genotypes screened on antixenosis experiments, ten genotypes were selected for detailed study on their influence on S. frugiperda biology through antibiosis experiments. The genotypes selected for characterization were IPR Celeiro, IAC Tigre, IAC Nuance, IPR Curio, IAC Una, IAC Sintonia, IAPAR 65, BRS Esplendor, IAC Formoso and IPR Eldorado. For antibiosis analysis, insects since neonates, were kept feeding on leaves during whole larval cycle. The genotype IAC Nuance was the least harmed by S. frugiperda in both free-choice (F-9,F-90 = 3.96; p < 0.001) and no-choice (F-9,F-90 = 8.21; p < 0.001) antixenosis tests. In antibiosis tests, the insects fed on the genotype IAC Tigre had the highest mortality rate (F-9,F-40 = 7.52; p < 0.001). In addition, IAC Nuance negatively influenced the larval weight (F-9,F-229 = 6.59; p < 0.001), larval viability (F-9,F-40 = 7.52; p < 0.001), pupal period (F-8,F-114 = 4.93; p < 0.001) and total cycle duration (F-8,F-96 = 4.34; p < 0.001) of S. frugiperda. Finally, using a multivariate clustering analysis, the genotypes were sorted as: Highly resistant- IAC Tigre; Moderately resistant- IAC Nuance; Susceptible- IPR Curio, IAC Una and IPR Celeiro; Highly susceptible- IAC Sintonia, IAPAR 65, BRS Esplendor, IAC-Formoso and IPR Eldorado. This study provides a scientific basis for selecting a genotype that can mitigate the attack of fall armyworm S. frugiperda in bean crops, which can be essential for the integrated pest management (IPM) of this key pest.

AB  - Andrena camellia Wu is one of the primary pollinators of Camellia oleifera A. in China. In this paper, the essential number of individuals for efficient pollination by this species was calculated via two criteria, based on various indicators including counts of pollen grains in provisions, from single visits, and from single foraging trips overall; single flower visit duration; single flight period duration; number of eggs laid by a single female over their lifetime; and the average number of flowers per plant. Based on the number of pollen grains collected per flower visit, the essential number of females necessary is 2107 in a 1-ha Camellia oleifera garden with 1800 plants, while only 1998 female individuals are essentially needed when estimated based on the mean number of pollen grains collected in a single flight period. We argue that the essential number estimated by the former method is more reasonable and accurate for practical applications.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Musk is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine derived from musk deer that has the pharmacological effects of "activating blood dredging collateral" and "consciousness-restoring resuscitation". Its volatile compounds (VCs) play a key role in these effects, especially in the treatment of stroke. However, there have been no comprehensive studies on the differences in the VCs of these different musks. This study investigated the differences in the VCs of different musks and the potential targets and mechanisms of action for stroke. Methods: Different musks were studied via GC-MS, and the potential targets and mechanisms of VCs associated with stroke were investigated using network pharmacology. Results: A total of 99 VCs were detected in 79 musk samples. The most important VCs of different colours and forms were muscone, phenol, acetic acid, and isovaleric acid. Further study revealed that the change in organic acids and ketones was the cause of the significant difference between white musk and other types of musk. In addition, network pharmacological analyses identified 180 potential targets of the major volatile compounds of musk associated with stroke, and five key targets (SRC, EGFR, ESR1, PTGS2, and DRD2). Enrichment analysis showed that these key targets play an important role in neural related pathways. The molecular docking results confirmed that the key targets can effectively bind with the main VCs (muscone and phenol). Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights into the distinct volatile compositions of various types of musk and underscore the significant potential of volatile compounds (VCs) in stroke treatment.

AB  - We studied the connections (connectome) of the adult zebrafish pallium using carbocyanine dye tracing and ancillary anatomical methods. The everted zebrafish pallium (dorsal telencephalic area, D) is composed of several major zones (medial, lateral, dorsal, central, anterior, and posterior) distinguishable by their topography, cytoarchitecture, immunohistochemistry, and genoarchitecture. Our comprehensive study reveals poor interconnectivity between these pallial areas, especially between medial (Dm), lateral/dorsal (Dl, Dd), and posterior (Dp) regions. This suggests that the zebrafish pallium has dedicated modules for different neural processes. Pallial connections with extrapallial regions also show compartmental organization. Major extratelencephalic afferents come from preglomerular nuclei (to Dl, Dd, and Dm), posterior tuberal nucleus (to Dm), and lateral recess nucleus (to Dl). The subpallial (ventral, V) zones dorsal Vv, Vd, and Vs, considered homologues of the striatum, amygdala, and pallidum, are mainly afferent to Dl/Dd and Dp. Regarding the efferent pathways, they also appear characteristic of each pallial region. Rostral Dm projects to the dorsal entopeduncular nucleus. Dp is interconnected with the olfactory bulbs. The central region (Dc) defined here receives mainly projections from Dl-Dd and projects toward the pretectum and optic tectum, connections, which help to delimiting Dc. The connectome of the adult pallium revealed here complements extant studies on the neuroanatomical organization of the brain, and may be useful for neurogenetic studies performed during early stages of development. The connectome of the zebrafish pallium was also compared with the pallial connections reported in other teleosts, a large group showing high pallial diversity.

AB  - Introduction: Ischemic conditionings (ICon) were intensively investigated and several protective signaling pathways were identified. Previously, we have shown the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MIRI) and the cardioprotective role of biglycan (BGN), a small leucine-rich proteoglycan in vitro. Here, we hypothesized that cardiac MMP and BGN signaling are involved in the protective effects of ICon. Methods: A reverse target-microRNA prediction was performed by using the miRNAtarget (TM) 2.0 software to identify human microRNAs with a possible regulatory effect on MMP and BGN, such as on related genes. To validate the identified 1289 miRNAs in the predicted network, we compared them to two cardioprotective miRNA omics datasets derived from pig and rat models of MIRI in the presence of ICons. Results: Among the experimentally measured miRNAs, we found 100% sequence identity to human predicted regulatory miRNAs in the case of 37 porcine and 24 rat miRNAs. Upon further analysis, 42 miRNAs were identified as MIRI-associated miRNAs, from which 24 miRNAs were counter-regulated due to ICons. Conclusions: Our findings highlight 24 miRNAs that potentially regulate cardioprotective therapeutic targets associated with MMPs and BGN in a highly translatable porcine model of acute myocardial infarction.

AB  - Evidence that music therapy stabilises vital parameters in preterm infants is growing, but the optimal setting for therapy is still under investigation. Our study aimed to quantify the effect of physical contact during live music therapy in preterm infants born < 32 weeks' gestational age (GA) on post-therapy vital sign values. Live music therapy was delivered twice-weekly until discharge from hospital to 40 stable infants < 32 weeks' GA. Baseline and post-therapy heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and physical contact during each session were recorded. 159 sessions were performed with, and 444 sessions without, physical contact. Descriptive and multivariable regression analyses based on directed acyclic graphs were performed. The mean GA was 28.6 +/- 2.6 weeks, and 26 (65%) infants were male. Mean absolute values for heart and respiratory rates lowered during music therapy regardless of physical contact. The mean post-therapy SaO2 was higher compared to baseline values regardless of physical contact (mean differences -8.6 beats/min; -13.3 breaths/min and +2.0%). There were no clinically relevant changes in vital sign responses between therapy sessions, with or without physical contact, or adjusted post-therapy values for any of the studied vital signs. Physical contact caused better baseline and post-therapy vital sign values but did not enhance the vital sign response to music therapy. Thus, the effect of music therapy on preterm infants' vital signs is independent of physical contact and parents' presence during music therapy in the neonatal intensive care unit.

AB  - Vesicles within presynaptic terminals are thought to be segregated into a variety of readily releasable and reserve pools. The nature of the pools and trafficking between them is not well understood, but pools that are slow to mobilize when synapses are active are often assumed to feed pools that are mobilized more quickly, in a series. However, electrophysiological studies of synaptic transmission have suggested instead a parallel organization where vesicles within slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools would separately feed independent reluctant- and fast-releasing subdivisions of the readily releasable pool. Here, we use FM-dyes to confirm the existence of multiple reserve pools at hippocampal synapses and a parallel organization that prevents intermixing between the pools, even when stimulation is intense enough to drive exocytosis at the maximum rate. The experiments additionally demonstrate extensive heterogeneity among synapses in the relative sizes of the slowly and quickly mobilized reserve pools, which suggests equivalent heterogeneity in the numbers of reluctant and fast-releasing readily releasable vesicles that may be relevant for understanding information processing and storage.

AB  - Historically, reproductive health in wildlife species has been evaluated primarily via immunoassay detection of fecal and urinary steroid hormone metabolites. This combination of sample type, biomarker category, and assay has been preferred for decades due to the ease of assessing reproductive health through the evaluation of stable compounds in easily collected biological samples using a cost-effective method. Increasingly, beginning with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and more recently with convergence chromatography and ultra HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry (MS), wildlife studies are incorporating more sensitive and specific high-throughput technologies for the assessment of not only steroid hormone metabolites but proteins as well. Of note, a comprehensive health evaluation requires the measurement of biological readouts that modulate reproduction such as: glucocorticoids, leptin, insulin, thyroid hormones, melatonin, the microbiome, and markers of inflammation. Emerging modulatory biomarkers of reproductive health include acute phase proteins, microRNAs, and reactive oxygen species. Several of these biomarkers require application of newer technologies such as LC-MS/ MS and sequencing, which demonstrates the need for the field of wildlife reproductive biology to diversify from its reliance on immunoassays. Importantly, endocrine disrupting chemicals adversely affect many aspects of reproductive function and evaluation of these compounds requires high throughput technology such as LC-MS/ MS. The application of sequencing, particularly Next Generation Sequencing of bulk RNA (RNA-Seq) and single cell RNA-Seq, is uncommon in studies of wildlife reproductive health. However, as the cost of these methods decreases and consortiums of wildlife researchers band together to raise funds in support of studies using these technologies, their use will become more routine. Future research should focus on integration of known biomarkers of related systems into comprehensive reproductive assessments and the development of new biomarkers which are sensitive, precise, and employ non-invasive methodologies for the assessment of reproductive health of wildlife species.

AB  - Simple Summary Exposure to microbial stressors has huge implications in terms of animal health and welfare. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a potent endotoxin, commonly responsible for various livestock pathologies, which impose huge economic losses to the livestock industry. MiRNAs regulate major biological processes and have multiple biological functions in terms of stress responsiveness. However, research on the altered miRNA expression profiles in sheep is still inadequate, especially in terms of the stress response to LPS. We found that extreme phenotypes, high and low stress responding sheep, had different expression patterns of miRNA. Our study indicated that miRNAs play an indispensable role in the stress response and could be potential biomarkers of stress. Animals respond to stress by activating a wide array of physiological and behavioral responses that are collectively referred to as the stress response. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that play key roles in the regulation of homeostasis. There are many reports demonstrating examples of stress-induced miRNA expression profiles. The aim of this study was to determine the circulatory miRNA profile of variable stress-responding lambs (n = 112) categorized based on their cortisol levels as high (HSR, 336.2 +/- 27.9 nmol/L), middle (MSR, 147.3 +/- 9.5 nmol/L), and low (LSR, 32.1 +/- 10.4 nmol/L) stress responders post-LPS challenge (400 ng/kg iv). Blood was collected from the jugular vein at 0 (T0) and 4 h (T4) post-LPS challenge, and miRNAs were isolated from four animals from each group. An array of 84 miRNAs and 6 individual miRNAs were evaluated using qPCR. Among 90 miRNAs, there were 48 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs (log fold change (FC) > 2 < log FC) in the HSR group, 46 in the MSR group, and 49 in the LSR group compared with T0 (control) samples. In the HSR group, three miRNAs, miR-485-5p, miR-1193-5p, and miR-3957-5p were significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated, while seven miRNAs, miR-376b-3p, miR-376c-3p, miR-411b-5p, miR-376a-3p, miR-376b-3p, miR-376c-3p, and miR-381-3p, were downregulated (p < 0.05) as compared to the LSR and MSR groups. Functional analysis of DE miRNAs revealed their roles in Ras and MAPK signaling, cytokine signaling, the adaptive immune system, and transcription pathways in the HSR phenotype, implicating a hyper-induced acute-phase response. In contrast, in the LSR group, enriched pathways included glucagon signaling metabolic regulation, the transportation of amino acids and ions, and the integration of energy metabolism. Taken together, these results indicate variation in the acute-phase response to an immune stress challenge, and these miRNAs are implicated in regulating responses within cortisol-based phenotypes.

AB  - The cotton mealybug Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is a polyphagous invasive species native to America and considered one of the major cotton pests in Asia. It is currently threatening horticultural and ornamental protected crops in Mediterranean countries. Due to ecological and environmental concerns, the conventional chemical control of P. solenopsis in new areas of introduction is being replaced by exploring the potential of indigenous natural enemies as a sustainable biological control tool. After P. solenopsis introduction in Sicily (Italy), field surveys were conducted on native natural enemies attacking the mealybug to select promising biocontrol agents for field applications. For the first time, Aenasius arizonensis (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was reported in Europe, and the native Anagyrus matritensis (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) was recorded in association with P. solenopsis. The two parasitoid species were identified by morphological features and molecularly using a portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene. Because of missing information, additional morphological features were provided for the morphological identification of A. matritensis. In addition, the generalist predators Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, Hippodamia variegata and Parexochomus nigripennis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) were also recorded attacking the invasive mealybug.

AB  - Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an important pest in several regions being the use of Bacillus thuringiensis-based bioproducts an alternative for its control. Firstly, 3 L of an aqueous bioproduct suspension was produced and characterized. Its 50% lethal concentration against molecularly identified corn and rice S. frugiperda strains using an artificial diet were 77.01% (95% CL, 68.16-90.47) and 2.22% (95% CL, 0.01-6.68), respectively. The next objective of this work was to evaluate the performance of this bioproduct in maize against S. frugiperda strains under different simulated agrological regions mimicking their corresponding periodic day/night temperatures. Thus, the impact of environmental temperature on the bioproduct efficacy (E) was studied. It was observed that a warmer scenario (35 degrees C day/30 degrees C night) could favor the tolerance of corn S. frugiperda strain to the bioproduct (E = 56.36 +/- 0.61%) maintaining a high efficacy (92.44 +/- 6.55%) when it was tested against rice S. frugiperda strain. Conversely, under temperate conditions, efficacy values ranged from 84 to 95% for both S. frugiperda strains. On the other hand, based on a foliar feeding damage analysis, our bioproduct displayed a significant foliar protection in maize plants infested with either corn or rice S. frugiperda strains.

AB  - Cryopreservation is a stressful process for sperm, as it is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated ROS levels, which create an imbalance with antioxidant capacity, may result in membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO), protein damage and DNA fragmentation. This study aimed to determine whether the membrane LPO and DNA fragmentation of frozen-thawed horse sperm relies upon antioxidant activity, including enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT) and paraoxonase type 1 (PON1)); non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), plasma ferric reducing antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC)); and the oxidative stress index (OSI) of their seminal plasma (SP). Based on total motility and plasma membrane integrity (SYBR14(+)/PI-) after thawing, ejaculates were hierarchically (p < 0.001) clustered into two groups of good- (GFEs) and poor-(PFEs) freezability ejaculates. LPO and DNA fragmentation (global DNA breaks) were higher (p < 0.05) in the PFE group than in the GFE group, with LPO and DNA fragmentation (global DNA breaks) after thawing showing a positive relationship (p < 0.05) with SP OSI levels and ROS production. In addition, sperm motility and membrane integrity after thawing were negatively (p < 0.05) correlated with the activity levels of SP antioxidants (PON1 and TEAC). The present results indicate that LPO and DNA fragmentation in frozen-thawed horse sperm vary between ejaculates. These differences could result from variations in the activity of antioxidants (PON1 and TEAC) and the balance between the oxidant and antioxidant components present in the SP.

AB  - To understand the interactions of entomopathogenic fungi with forage plants and their influence on associated herbivorous, we evaluated the influence of endophytic colonization with three isolates (CEPAF_ENT 25, CEPAF_ENT 27, and IBCB 425) of Metarhizium anisopliae on Cynodon dactylon, regarding the biological and behavioral aspects of Collaria scenica, an emerging sucking pest in pastoral systems in Brazil. The application of suspensions at the base of plant (drench) was effective in promoting endophytic colonization, especially in the roots, with emphasis on isolates CEPAF_ENT25 and CEPAF_ENT27. Despite the significant reduction in damage caused by C. scenica observed in plants colonized with isolate CEPAF_ENT 27 in a choice test, our results indicated a limited influence of the isolates tested on the host selection behavior and in C. scenica development, including parameters of the fertility life table. The cluster analysis, however, indicated a significant difference between all isolates tested in terms of the chemical-bromatological composition and the levels of photosynthetic pigments in inoculated plants. The biplot analysis indicated that isolate CEPAF-ENT27 (most promising) showed a positive correlation with nitrogen, potassium, calcium, boron, copper, and zinc levels, as well as with chlorophyll a and b levels. Additionally, foliar magnesium levels were significantly higher in all isolates tested. Improvements in plant nutrition may increase tolerance in infested plants through compensation mechanisms, contributing to more resilient pastoral systems.

AB  - The phytophagous mite Tetranychus truncatus is a serious pest in East Asia but has a relatively narrower host range than the pest mite Tetranychus urticae, which can feed on over 1200 plant species. Here, we generated a high-quality chromosomal level genome of T. truncatus and compared it with that of T. urticae, with an emphasis on the genes related to detoxification and chemoreception, to explore the genomic basis underlying the evolution of host range. We also conducted population genetics analyses (in 86 females from 10 populations) and host transfer experiments (in 4 populations) to investigate transcription changes following transfer to a low-quality host (Solanum melongena, eggplant), and we established possible connections between fitness on eggplant and genes related to detoxification and chemoreception. We found that T. truncatus has fewer genes related to detoxification, transport, and chemoreception than T. urticae, with a particularly strong reduction in gustatory receptor (GR) genes. We also found widespread transcriptional variation among T. truncatus populations, which varied in fitness on eggplant. We characterized selection on detoxification-related genes through omega values and found a negative correlation between expression levels and omega values. Based on the transcription results, as well as the fitness and genetic differences among populations, we identified genes potentially involved in adaptation to eggplant in T. truncatus. Our work provides a genomic resource for this pest mite and new insights into mechanisms underlying the adaptation of herbivorous mites to host plants.

AB  - As a new protein class of semiochemical binding and transporting, Niemann-Pick proteins type C2 (NPC2) in arthropods have received more attentions in recent decade. However, the gene function has not been studied in phytoseiid mites with biocontrol potential. In the current study, we cloned a NPC2 gene PpNPC2a from the transcriptome of Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot. By encoding 181 amino acids with a conserved ML domain, PpNPC2a was found a homolog of NPC2-1 in Galendromus occidentalis Nesbitt. We then measured the spatio-temporal expression of PpNPC2a in P. persimilis, and found the highest expression in female adults compared to other stages. Due to the tiny body size of predatory mites, we only examined tissue expressions in two sections: the anterior part (gnathosoma and the first pair of legs) and the posterior part (idiosoma without the first pair of legs). Higher transcription of PpNPC2a was found in the posterior part. To investigate the potential function of PpNPC2a in P. persimilis, we interfered gene expression in female adults by feeding dsRNA, which resulted in a decrease of relative expression by 59.1 and 78.2% after 24 and 72 h, respectively. Compared with the control, dsNPC2a-treated P. persimilis were insensitive to the scent of leaves or plants infested by spider mites, suggesting a role of PpNPC2a in response to plant volatiles. However, the dsNPC2a-interfered mites could still respond to four representative compounds of herbivore-induced plant volatiles, including 4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene (TMTT), methyl salicylate (MeSA), beta-caryophyllene and linalool. In short, our results indicated PpNPC2a may be involved in the chemosensory process of P. persimilis in response to whole-plant volatiles.

AB  - The wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana (G & eacute;hin) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), poses a threat to spring wheat in North America. Larvae feed on the developing kernels, causing decreased grain quality and yield loss. The resistance gene Sm1, a single, naturally occurring gene that results in larval mortality, is important for managing this pest. However, relying on a single resistance gene may result in the evolution of virulent pest biotypes. To identify possible alternative mechanisms of resistance, mechanical deterrence against wheat midge oviposition was evaluated using doubled haploid spring wheat lines (DH lines) with different combinations of awns and hairy glumes. Adult wheat midges were introduced to cages containing 12 preanthesis wheat spikes consisting of combinations of the presence or absence of awns with either hairy or smooth glumes, and oviposition on these phenotypes was recorded. In addition, kernel damage of five lines per phenotype was assessed under field conditions. The presence of awns on wheat spikes reduced oviposition in the laboratory choice cages, but not all wheat lines with awns reduced damage in the field. Hairy glumes did not reduce midge oviposition or grain damage. Independent of the awned and hairy-glumed phenotypes, egg numbers and damage varied among the DH lines. Four wheat lines exhibited wheat midge deterrence and are promising candidates as sources of novel resistance to combine with Sm1 to pyramid resistance.

AB  - Background Cydnoseius negevi (Swirski and Amitai) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a promising bio-agent in the Mediterranean region. It attacks a wide range of pest species. Two fundamental questions have been raised when C. negevi was a promising candidate for biological control applications in a hydroponic system. This study was carried out to answer the raised questions: (1) how long a predatory female takes to attack its prey in a non-choice biological control application? and (2) what do the predatory females prefer when offered a multiple choice (free-choice) of pest preys?, to understand the potentialities of C. negevi attacking behaviour. Results Two sets of experiments were conducted for 240 min under laboratory conditions of 27 +/- 2 degrees C, 60 +/- 5% RH, and 18:6h L:D photoperiod. The tested prey species were Tetranychus urticae Koch, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), Parlatoria ziziphi (Lucas), and Icerya aegyptiaca (Douglas). Non-choice experiments tested the time (min) needed to the 24 h starved female to attack its prey. The free-choice experiments tested the female' choices and the time recorded for each female during the full experimental time. Significant differences were recorded in both sets at confidence level of 95%. The spider mite T. urticae recorded the shortest predatory female's response in both non- and free-choice sets. On the contrary, the insect I. aegyptiaca had the least female's choice in both sets of experiment. Conclusion The present study discussed the behavioural categories of C. negevi. The female responses showed a list of priorities to the tested herbivore species. Such behavioural simulation is considerable for the future pest control applications to predict the generalist predator's preferences among a wide range of multiple herbivore species.

AB  - Social insects' constructions are diverse and functionally flexible. We aimed to understand how termites modify their behavior and building material to change the function of a shelter tube. Construction behaviors of three termite species, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae), Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) (Blattodea: Termitidae), and Nasutitermes takasagoensis (Nawa) (Blattodea: Termitidae), were recorded and analyzed. We measured the thickness and organic matter content of shelter tubes, and further tested their water loss and water drop resistance. All three termite species used a cement-brick construction procedure. The shelter tubes of C. formosanus and N. takasagoensis incorporating of woody material and feces present a strong resistance to water drops. Shelter tubes of the fungus-growing termite, O. formosanus, constructed using only soil and fluid secretion had a weak resistance to water drops. The trade-off between using feces to increase hydrophobicity of shelter tubes and using feces to grow fungus likely occurs in fungus-growing termites. Among intraspecific colonies, increasing the thickness of shelter tube improved resistance to water loss and water drops. This study demonstrated termites employed limited construction material and building behaviors to achieve functional plasticity of foraging shelter.

AB  - Parasitoid wasps locate their hosts by tracking host-related chemicals, such as herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). Attractiveness of HIPVs to parasitoid wasps has often been investigated using four-arm olfactometers, but suitability of observation times for behavioral tests using olfactometers has received insufficient attention. In this study, we evaluated differences in results of two-choice bioassays with multiple observation times in a four-arm olfactometer. We found that odor preferences of the parasitoid Cotesia kariyai (Watanabe) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) to host-induced plant volatiles changed with time in a four-arm olfactometer. These changes were detected only between 60-120 s from the start of experiments, and there were no changes in preference after 120 s. The gradual decrease in odor preference can be explained by habituation. It is necessary to consider habituation of parasitoid wasps to plant volatiles and to determine suitable observation times depending on the species, so that appropriate behavioral assays can be performed in a multi-arm olfactometer or other equipment.

AB  - Modern agricultural policies across the globe are committed to a significant reduction in chemical pesticide dependency; however, pest management strategies are still based on the use of synthetic pesticides. There is an urgent need to find new, sustainable and biorational tools for pest management programs. Plants communicate with each other and activate defense mechanisms against pests using herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs). The use of such HIPVs could be an ecologically sustainable alternative. However, as of now, there have been no comprehensive studies on HIPVs, from selection to practical use in industry production. Here, we describe the first case of an HIPV successfully implemented for pest control under commercial greenhouse conditions. In this research, tomato plants induced with (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate [(Z)-3-HP] were less susceptible to the attack of economically important tomato pests. We designed and calibrated polymeric dispensers for the constant release of (Z)-3-HP. These dispensers maintained commercial tomato plant defenses activated for more than two months reducing herbivore pest damage without reducing plant productivity. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses of plants induced with (Z)-3-HP confirmed that genes involved in specialized anti-herbivore defense were up-regulated, resulting in an increased production of fatty acid-derived compounds, activation of the lipoxygenase pathway and accumulation of specific defense compounds. Our work demonstrates under commercial greenhouse conditions how the release of HIPVs as elicitors of plant defenses via designed polymeric dispensers can be successfully integrated as a new biorational and sustainable tool for pest control.

AB  - Acalypha wilkesiana is considered a great tool for rearing Tetranychus urticae in the laboratory; it has two colors of leaves i.e., green and red. The leaf pigment content and some chemical properties were observed in this study to examine the correlation between the biology of T. urticae and the physio-biochemical features of the green and red leaves of A. wilkesiana . Results showed that T. urticae individuals achieved faster growth and a greater number of eggs deposited by females when feeding on A. wilkesiana with greener leaves, which contained higher levels of photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b, and total carotenoids). There was a significant positive correlation (P <= 0.05) between T. urticae female hatchability, egg deposited/female, and daily rate with contents of total carbohydrate, total carotenoids, soluble sugars, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b. For male biology, there was a significant positive correlation (P <= 0.05 ) between T. urticae male life span, immature stages, and life cycle with contents of total phenols, and anthocyanin. These results indicated the role of chemical components of Acalypha leaves in the biological aspects of T. urticae .

AB  - Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 5E-2.0311, "Performance Standards and Acceptable Test Conditions for Preventive Termite Treatments for New Construction," approved in 2003, currently remains without change as originally written. This Code requires broad revision to include updating existing and new termite management methods and technologies, describing acceptable testing protocols that objectively evaluate termite management product efficacy, and clearly and accurately define product performance standards required for approval and use in Florida, USA. This manuscript provides modification and expansion of the existing Code, first in outline form, then followed by a proposed complete revision including detailed explanations for each outline heading and sub-heading. Efficacy requirements, acceptable test conditions, and performance standards requirements are described for termite management products, materials, and non-chemical physical exclusion barriers. We also include testing protocols for field plot and structure efficacy tests. Minimum performance standards also are described for field plots and structure tests to include: (1) termiticide applications to soil, (2) termite baiting systems, (3) pesticides applied directly to wood and building components, (4) pesticide combination mixtures, and (5) new application technologies, products, and methodologies. Although this manuscript addresses revision of a specific Florida Administrative Code, it also is appropriate for consideration by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) as well as regulatory entities in other states responsible for pesticide regulation and consumer protection services when writing or revising their code requirements for termite management.

AB  - The Transantarctic Mountains are an important corridor between the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and the Western Ross Sea, where most current ice streams and outlet glaciers arise. We investigated Ricker Hills, the largest exposed mountainous region between Southern Victoria Land and Terra Nova Bay, and dated the glacial landforms using in-situ cosmogenic-nuclide Be-10 surface exposure dating to reconstruct the paleo-glacial dynamics. The surface of the Hollingsworth glacier lowered since the middle of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2 (22.1 ka); therefore, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) occurred before that period. Cosmogenic, geomorphic, and climatic records constrained the glacial surface slope to be between 5.4 degrees and 6.8 degrees. The ice was 270-320 m thicker at the LGM (MIS 2) than presently but did not override the top surface of the Benson Knob. Moreover, previous glacial periods such as the local LGM (MIS 4) or Penultimate Glacial Maximum (MIS 6) maintained thicker ice than the LGM (MIS 2). The Ross Ice Shelf opening during the mid-Holocene (similar to 6 ka) caused the rapid collapse of the terminal outlet glaciers and supplied notable snow accumulation upstream, which stagnated lowering. The greatest lowering and retreat occurred during the late Holocene (2.3 similar to 0.8 ka), when elephant seal colonies thrived in the Ross Embayment.

AB  - Background Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), a widely used plasticizer, has been shown to impair ovarian function. While tanshinone IIA exhibits ovarian protective effects in aging models, its potential to counteract TOCP-induced ovarian damage and associated signaling mechanisms remains unexplored. This study investigates the therapeutic effects of tanshinone IIA on TOCP-damaged ovaries in mice, with focus on Hippo, AKT, and MAPK pathways. Results TOCP exposure (200 mg/kg/d for 28 days) significantly reduced ovarian follicle counts (primordial, preovulatory, and mature follicles) and disrupted hormone levels (elevated Estrogen(E2), decreased Follicle stimulating hormone(FSH)/ Anti-Mueller tube hormone(AMH)) in mice. Treatment with high-dose tanshinone IIA restored ovarian structure and function: growing follicle counts increased significantly (p < 0.001), FSH (p < 0.001) and AMH (p < 0.001) levels surged to marked degrees, while E2 (p < 0.001) levels decreased significantly. All changes were statistically significant. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed that tanshinone IIA restored ovarian AMH and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Receptor (FSHR) protein expression, which were suppressed by TOCP. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that TOCP dose-dependently inhibited granulosa cell viability (p < 0.001) and proliferation (p < 0.001). Co-treatment with tanshinone IIA (0.01 mM) rescued cell viability (p < 0.01) and proliferation (p < 0.05). Mechanistically, tanshinone IIA suppressed ovarian apoptosis (p < 0.01) and modulated multiple signaling pathways: it attenuated Hippo signaling (p < 0.05) and reactivated PI3K/AKT (p < 0.05), p38 (p < 0.05), and ERK1/2 (p < 0.01) pathways. Conclusions Tanshinone IIA alleviates TOCP-induced ovarian dysfunction primarily through coordinated modulation of Hippo signaling and AKT/MAPK pathway activities, offering a potential therapeutic strategy for chemical-induced ovarian injury.

AB  - Plant defense traits such as trichomes along with biocontrol agents may provide alternatives to insecticide use in tomatoes, Solanum lycopersicum L. (Solanaceae). However, plant-herbivore-natural enemy interactions are not always complementary. In a series of greenhouse and field experiments, we explored whether augmented defense traits (i.e., production of acylsugars) in tomato plants could reduce sweet potato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), populations and aid the establishment of the predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot (Acari: Phytoseiidae). In the field experiment, commercial tomato cultivars and acylsugar-producing tomato lines received no predatory mites or mites released via three methods: dusting on top, dusting on bottom, or slow-release sachets. In the first greenhouse experiment, predatory mites were released onto the commercial and acylsugar-producing tomato plants via sachets. In the second greenhouse experiment using a similar design, we augmented the mite diet with an alternative non-prey resource (i.e., cattail pollen). Our results indicated that acylsugar-producing tomato plants supported significantly fewer whiteflies than the commercial lines in all experiments. However, in the field, despite lower whitefly numbers, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) (Geminiviridae, Begomovirus) was detected at higher frequencies in acylsugar-producing lines. Few mites were recovered from all commercial and acylsugar-producing lines in the field or greenhouse experiments suggesting A. swirskii does not establish well on tomatoes, and acylsugar lines successfully decreased whitefly populations but not a viral disease transmitted even at low whitefly abundance.

AB  - It is widely documented that plants respond to herbivory by releasing volatile compounds mediated by phytohormone signaling pathways. Herbivore-Induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs), among which are the green leaf volatiles, can repel herbivores, attract their natural enemies, and warn neighboring plants of herbivore attacks. Plants that receive these warning signals activate defense mechanisms and therefore become more resistant to pests and diseases. In this work, we tested whether plants activated by exposure to the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate [(Z)-3-HP)] can enhance the management of one of the most important pests of sweet peppers, the aphid Aulacorthum solani (Kalt.) (Homoptera: Aphididae). Here, we show that sweet pepper plants exposed to (Z)-3-HP induce plant defenses that repel A. solani winged adults and attract females of Aphelinus abdominalis (Dalman) (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), an aphid parasitoid used to control a plethora of aphid pests, including A. solani. Additionally, (Z)-3-HP-exposed plants were less infested by A. solani than their non-exposed counterparts under greenhouse conditions. Significant transcriptional differences were obtained when studying the temporal gene expression pattern of three defense-related genes, ASR1, PIN2, and AMP1, markers of abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid, respectively, during the duration of the greenhouse experiment. Our results demonstrate how the use of volatiles as plant defense inducers can play a role in the management of A. solani in sweet pepper and opens the door to exploring this technique on other aphid pests in other crops.

AB  - The olfactory system of adult lepidopterans is among the best described neuronal circuits. However, comparatively little is known about the organization of the olfactory system in the larval stage of these insects. Here, we explore the expression of olfactory receptors and the organization of olfactory sensory neurons in caterpillars of Pieris brassicae, a significant pest species in Europe and a well-studied species for its chemical ecology. To describe the larval olfactory system in this species, we first analyzed the head transcriptome of third-instar larvae (L3) and identified 16 odorant receptors (ORs) including the OR coreceptor (Orco), 13 ionotropic receptors (IRs), and 8 gustatory receptors (GRs). We then quantified the expression of these 16 ORs in different life stages, using qPCR, and found that the majority of ORs had significantly higher expression in the L4 stage than in the L3 and L5 stages, indicating that the larval olfactory system is not static throughout caterpillar development. Using an Orco-specific antibody, we identified all olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) expressing the Orco protein in L3, L4, and L5 caterpillars and found a total of 34 Orco-positive ORNs, distributed among three sensilla on the antenna. The number of Orco-positive ORNs did not differ among the three larval instars. Finally, we used retrograde axon tracing of the antennal nerve and identified a mean of 15 glomeruli in the larval antennal center (LAC), suggesting that the caterpillar olfactory system follows a similar design as the adult olfactory system, although with a lower numerical redundancy. Taken together, our results provide a detailed analysis of the larval olfactory neurons in P. brassicae, highlighting both the differences as well as the commonalities with the adult olfactory system. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the development of the olfactory system in insects and its life-stage-specific adaptations.

AB  - The relationship between herbivorous insects and plants is an example of an 'evolutionary arms race'. Understanding the relationship between insects and their host plants makes it possible to determine critical points in the bioecology of these herbivores. In this relationship, insects and plants use strategies to overcome, avoid and mitigate the actions of the other. Insect-induced galls are one of the great examples of this 'arms race'. Psyllids (Hemiptera: Psylloidea) are among the most important gall-inducing insects. The psyllid Triozoida limbata (Triozidae) is an important pest of guava (Psidium guajava) in the Neotropics. Thus, this work aimed to determine the morphological, anatomical, and biochemical changes in guava leaves caused by T. limbata to study the 'arms race' between these two organisms. Therefore, the process of gall formation on guava leaves during the psyllid life cycle was described. A comparative study of the anatomy and levels of phytohormones in leaves attacked and not attacked by the psyllid was carried out. It was found that the psyllid attack triggered the plant's defence by increasing the jasmonic acid content in the leaves. The psyllid attack caused anatomical changes in the leaves (such as cell non-differentiation), allowing the insect to survive feeding on the plant. In addition, the psyllid-induced galls provided shelter for the psyllid.

AB  - Honeydew from Hemipteran insects serves as carbohydrate source to beneficial insects but also to various microorganisms. Microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) may play diverse roles in herbivore-microbe-natural enemy interactions. However, the functional significance of mVOCs from aphid honeydew remains largely unclear. In this study, a total of seven cultivable bacteria from Sitobion miscanthi honeydew have been isolated and identified based on 16S rRNA technique, which included Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Erwinia aphidicola, E. tasmaniensis, Acinetobacter bereziniae, Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. Similipneumoniae, Staphylococcus capitis and Bacillus safensis subsp. safensis. One bacterial strain, L. fusiformis MH1, was found to be most attractive to Aphidius gifuensis parasitic wasp in Y-tube olfactometer. Two compounds, namely 1-ethyl-2-methylbenzene and 2-butyl-1-octanol, were emitted from L. fusiformis MH1 and were attractive to A. gifuensis and identified by using coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography and coupled gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Application of bacterial and mVOCs formulations in crop field resulted in significant aphid abundance decrease associated with higher parasitism rates compared with control. Our results indicated that some microbes in aphid honeydew could manipulate the herbivore-natural enemy interactions and could be developed as a novel alternative for environmentally friendly biological control of aphids.

AB  - Vittatalactone, the aggregation pheromone of the striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma vittatum (F.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is attractive to two species of squash bugs (Hemiptera: Coreidae), the squash bug Anasa tristis (DeGeer) and horned squash bug Anasa armigera (Say). In field trapping experiments in Maryland and Virginia, clear sticky traps baited with 1 mg of a synthetic 8-isomer mix of vittatalactone captured similar to 9x more of female A. tristis and of both sexes of A. armigera, whereas male A. tristis were not significantly attracted, compared to unbaited traps. A. armigera showed a distinct dose-response to vittatalactone lure loading in the late season, and this species was more attracted than A. tristis, based on comparison to captures from underneath wooden boards emplaced in adjacent fields. Results suggest that vittatalactone could be a 'keystone semiochemical' in colonization of cucurbit hosts by specialist herbivores, and may offer the opportunity for multi-species behavioral control as a component of integrated pest management in cucurbit crops.

AB  - The foraging of honey bees is one of the most well-organized and admirable behaviors that exist among social insects. In behavioral studies, these beautiful insects have been extensively used for understanding time-space learning, landmark use, and the concept of learning. Highly organized behaviors such as social interaction and communication are systematically well-organized behavioral components of honey bee foraging. Over the last two decades, understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying honey bee foraging at the cellular and molecular levels has been increasingly interested to several researchers. Upon the search of regulatory genes of brain and behavior, immediate early (IE) genes are considered as a good tool to begin the search investigation. Our two recent studies have demonstrated three IE genes, namely, Egr-1, Hr38, and Kakusei, playing a role in the daily foraging of bees and their association with learning and memory during foraging. These studies further evidence that IE genes can be used as a tool in finding the specific molecular/cellular players of foraging in honey bees and its behavioral components such as learning, memory, social interaction, and social communication. In this article, we provide the details of the method of sample collection at different times during foraging to investigate the foraging regulatory molecules.

AB  - Control of the soybean looper Chrysodeixis includens (Walker) in bean cultivation has been achieved mainly through the application of chemical insecticides. However, this pest is acquiring resistance to common agents, and its habit of sheltering under leaves in the middle or lower thirds makes contact with control products difficult. The use of resistant plant genotypes is promising, as plants have complex defense mechanisms against herbivorous insects. The objective of this work was to evaluate the expression of potential sources of constitutive resistance to C. includens, by twelve commercial common bean genotypes. Attractiveness and non-preference for feeding were evaluated by free-choice and no-choice tests, using leaf discs to determine the percentage of caterpillars present on leaf discs, as well as the leaf area consumed. Biological development was assessed by growth parameters such as weight, developmental period and survival. On analyzing the data, BRS MG Madreperola (antixenosis and antibiosis), BRS Sublime (antixenosis) and IAC 1850 (antibiosis) were found to be resistant to the pest. In contrast, IAC Sintonia (Antiga selecao), IAC Sintonia (Nova selecao) and IAC Imperador, showed susceptibility. The results of this work are important for the selection of new sources of common bean resistance to C. includens, since thus far there are few published studies of this phenomenon. Additional investigations should be carried out to identify the mechanisms responsible for resistance to C. includens, with a view to increasing their expression or to incorporating them into common bean breeding programs.

AB  - Monitoring adult populations of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a major agricultural pest, provides data useful for its control. Food attractants, considered as adult insect behavior regulators based on the preference of an herbivorous pest for food sources or their volatiles, also have great potential for monitoring populations. To study the feasibility of monitoring the population dynamics and reproductive development of H. armigera in the field using food attractants, we quantitatively analyzed reproductive organ development of adults in a laboratory population as a way to predict the reproductive development of adults trapped using food attractants in the field in 2019 and 2020. The adults trapped using food attractants had obvious generational changes and the same trends in variation for females and males. The extent of ovarian development in trapped females tended to increase within each generation, and the major axis length of testis in trapped males tended to decrease. Reproductive developmental status of trapped adults also differed significantly among months. This study shows that by trapping H. armigera with food attractants, the population dynamics of adults in the field can be monitored, and reproductive anatomy can also be used to monitor adult reproductive status. These approaches are a new way to forecast the population dynamics of this pest.

AB  - The phytotoxicity of fluoride and its build-up in agricultural plants and subsequently the entry into the food chain is a serious threat to human health. The present study highlighted the green synthesis of calcium oxide nanoparticles (CaO NPs) and characterization using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, TEM, SEM, EDX, XRD, and FTIR. Further, synthesized CaO NPs (0, 10, and 50 mg/L) were applied on fluoride-stressed (10 mg/L) rice seedlings to check its possible ameliorative effects towards growth and fluoride accumulation in different parts of rice seedlings. Characterization revealed that nanoparticles were crystalline (46.72 %) and spherical in shape, with an average diameter of 20-25 nm. Results of the seedling growth analysis revealed that CaO NPs inhibited the translocation of fluoride in rice plants, which in turn decreased the phytotoxicity caused by fluoride, including lipid peroxidation and chlorosis, and enhanced the overall growth of seedlings. The co-exposure of CaO NPs with fluoride also showed a reduction in the fluoride-induced oxidative stress, as demonstrated by lower MDA, O2 center dot contents, and activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, and POD) as compared to fluoride treatment alone. The application of CaO NPs also restored potassium content in seedlings grown under fluoride stress. Furthermore, the highest reduction of fluoride accumulation by 65 and 76 % in roots and shoots was recorded at 50 mg/L of CaO NPs treatment, respectively. Therefore, the present study clearly indicated the ameliorative potential of CaO NPs towards fluoride stress in rice. However, a field study is needed to establish the social acceptance of this valuable nanofertilizer in fluoride-contaminated areas.

AB  - With recent evidence of hybridization events in the field, the phenotypic traits of F1 hybrid colonies of 2 destructive subterranean termite species, Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki and Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) remain to be investigated. In this study, laboratory colonies of 2 conspecific pairings and 2 heterospecific pairings (hybrid F = female C. formosanus x male C. gestroi, hybrid G = female C. gestroi x male C. formosanus) were examined in Florida, USA, and in Taiwan. Colony nest architecture for both hybrids displayed disorganized carton materials compared to the defined trabecular carton of both parental species. Soldier head measurements were not a reliable approach for diagnostic purposes, as soldier morphometric traits widely overlapped across all mating combinations, except for hybrid F soldiers displaying abnormally long mandibles. Hybrid F soldiers' mandibles also remained parallel when at rest. However, 4 qualitative morphological differences in soldiers were determined for diagnostic purposes. First, the fontanelle in both hybrids is horizontally ellipsoid whereas subcircular in C. gestroi and trianguliform in C. formosanus. Second, sclerotized striations along the postmental sulcus are present in C. gestroi, absent in C. formosanus, and intermediate in both hybrid soldier types. Third, each lateral margin of the fontanelle is flanked by 2 setae in C. formosanus and both hybrids, while a single seta resides on each side of the fontanelle in C. gestroi. Finally, C. gestroi and hybrid soldiers' heads are characterized by a bulging vertex that is lacking in C. formosanus. Therefore, a combination of these 4 characteristics now allows for soldier identification of hybrid Coptotermes.

AB  - Background: Depression is a widely recognized neuropsychiatric disorder. Recent studies have shown a potential correlation between bile acid disorders and depression, highlighting the importance of maintaining bile acid balance for effective antidepressant treatment. Schisandrol B (SolB), a primary bioactive compound from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. or Schisandra sphenanthera Rehd.etWils, is pivotal in regulating bile acid homeostasis via pregnane X receptor (PXR) in cholestasis. However, the potential of SolB in alleviating depression-like symptoms, its pharmacological effects, and the underlying mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Methods: We confirmed the effect of SolB against depression induced by chronic restraint stress (CRS) and chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in mice. The role of SolB in bile acid homeostasis in depression was analyzed using the metabolomic. Gene analyses and 16S rRNA sequencing were employed to investigate the involvement of PXR. Experiments with Pxr- /- mice were conducted to confirm the essential role of the PXR pathway in SolB's antidepressant effects. Results: SolB treatment significantly increased sucrose consumption in the SPT and the locomotor activity in the OFT, while decreasing immobility time in the FST and TST in mice exposed to CRS and CUMS. Additionally, SolB treatment significantly preserved the integrity of the dendritic spine, elevated synaptic protein PSD95 levels, and augmented CREB/BDNF expression. Metabolomic and gene analyses indicated that SolB treatment significantly facilitated bile acid metabolism, promoted intestinal bile acid efflux, decreased hippocampal levels of the secondary bile acids DCA and TLCA, and upregulated expression of the PXR target proteins CYP3A11, SULT2A1, MRP2, and OATP1B1 in the liver, and MRP2 and MDR1 in hippocampus, which are integral to bile acid homeostasis. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that SolB reduced the abundance of the bile salt hydrolase (BSH)producing bacteria Lactobacillus johnsonii and Bacteroides fragilis and subsequently decreased the production of TLCA and DCA. Moreover, SolB failed to protect against depression induced by CRS in Pxr-null mice, suggesting that the antidepressant effect of SolB was PXR-dependent. Conclusions: These results provide direct evidence of the antidepressant effect of SolB via activation of PXR to regulate bile acid homeostasis in the brain-liver-gut axis, suggesting that SolB may serve as a novel potential target for preventing and treating depression.

AB  - Epipregnanolone (3 beta-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one, Epi) is an endogenous steroid with important physiological effects and high affinity for GABA(A) receptors. The effect of Epi on GABA-induced chloride current (I-GABA) in native neurons has hardly been studied. In this work, we studied the influence of Epi on the I-GABA in the Purkinje cells of rat cerebellum and pyramidal neurons of rat hippocampus with the patch clamp technique. We showed that Epi is a positive modulator of the I-GABA with EC50 of 5.7 mu M in Purkinje cells and 9.3 mu M in hippocampal neurons. Epi-induced potentiation of the I-GABA was more potent at low vs. high GABA concentrations. Isopregnanolone (3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one, Iso) counteracted Epi, reducing its potentiating effect by 2-2.3 times. Flumazenil, a nonsteroidal GABA(A) receptor antagonist, does not affect the Epi-induced potentiation. Comparison of the potentiating effects of Epi and allopregnanolone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one, ALLO) showed that ALLO is, at least, a four times more potent positive modulator than Epi. The combined application of ALLO and Epi showed that the effects of these two steroids are not additive. We conclude that Epi has a dual effect on the I-GABA increasing the current in the control solution and decreasing the stimulatory effect of ALLO.

AB  - Simple Summary Determination of nutrient requirements in sheep is essential to generate appropriate recommendations for dietary formulation, promoting sustainable systems. However, there is limited information regarding the energy and protein requirements of growing lambs in the Colombian highlands. Twenty-two growing lambs were enrolled in this experiment. Four lambs were slaughtered at the beginning of the experiment to determine the lambs' energy and protein baseline concentration. The remaining lambs received different amounts of feed and were slaughtered to determine the energy and protein accumulation during the evaluation period. The maintenance energy was 82.3 kcal/kg BW0.75, while maintenance and gain energy efficiencies were 0.72 and 0.29, respectively. In addition, the crude protein requirement for maintenance was 1.78 g/kg BW0.75, and the nitrogen efficiency for maintenance and gain protein was 0.41 and 0.27, respectively. The maintenance requirement of energy was greater, while protein was similar to values reported in the literature; however, the efficiency of energy and protein use was lower in growing lambs. These results suggested that estimating energy and nitrogen requirements for growing lambs must be adjusted in Colombian highland conditions.Abstract Determining the nutritional requirements of lambs is necessary to formulate balanced rations and contribute to sustainable sheep production systems. However, limited information is available regarding the nutritional requirements of growing lambs in the Colombian highlands. Twenty-two Romney Marsh males were used. Initially, four lambs were slaughtered at 20 kg body weight (BW). The remaining 18 lambs were distributed into two groups, according to BW (light: 20 BW and heavy: 30 kg BW). Lambs were randomly allocated into one of three different nutritional schemes, according to voluntary intake (no restriction, and 25 and 50% restriction). All the animals received a totally mixed ration. When a voluntary-fed lamb gained 10 kg BW, the two other lambs restricted to 25 and 50% were slaughtered and dissected into components to determine protein and gross energy concentration. Energy and protein accumulation were analyzed through regression analysis. The net energy for maintenance was 82.3 kcal/kg BW0.75, while the energy efficiencies for maintenance and gain were 0.72 and 0.29, respectively. Crude protein for maintenance was 1.78 g/kg BW0.75, and the nitrogen efficiencies for maintenance and gain were 0.41 and 0.27, respectively. The maintenance requirement of energy was greater, while protein was similarly related to values reported in the literature; however, the efficiency of energy and protein use was lower in growing lambs. These results suggested that estimating energy and nitrogen requirements for growing lambs must be adjusted in Colombian highland conditions.

AB  - Porcine pseudorabies (PR) is an important infectious disease caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV), which poses a major threat to food safety and security. Vaccine immunization has become the main means to prevent and control the disease. However, since 2011, a new PRV variant has caused huge economic losses to the Chinese pig industry. Panax notoginseng polysaccharides have immunomodulatory activity and other functions, but the antiviral effect has not been reported. We studied the anti-PRV activity of Panax notoginseng polysaccharides in vitro. A less cytopathic effect was observed by increasing the concentration of Panax notoginseng polysaccharides. Western blot, TCID50, plaque assay, and IFA revealed that Panax notoginseng polysaccharides could significantly inhibit the infectivity of PRV XJ5 on PK15 cells. In addition, we also found that Panax notoginseng polysaccharides blocked the adsorption and replication of PRV to PK15 cells in a dose-dependent manner. These results show that Panax notoginseng polysaccharides play an antiviral effect mainly by inhibiting virus adsorption and replication in vitro. Therefore, Panax notoginseng polysaccharides may be a potential anti-PRV agent.

AB  - Pig farmers in Taiwan tend to overdose copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in animal feeds to ensure pig health. The application of Cu- or Zn-rich livestock compost to fields can result in high Cu/Zn residues in surface soil and violate limitations for zinc and copper in land applications. This study aims to extract Cu and Zn from sludge using organic acid or H2O2/organic acids. The livestock bio-sludge was dried and treated with different concentrations of acetic acid (1N, 2N, and 4N). The acid-extracted sludge was then treated with or without adding H2O2 during different periods (4, 24, and 48 h) to investigate the efficiency of acid extraction of Cu and Zn. The supernatant of the acid-extracted product was separated from the residues through centrifugation. Experimental results showed that the treatment set of dried bio-sludge with 2% H2O2 significantly promoted the removal efficiency of Cu and Zn from the bio-sludge (p < 0.01). The best removal efficiency of Cu and Zn from the bio-sludge was 40% and 70%, respectively, using 4N acetic acid in the 48 h group. The study shows a green method for extracting Cu and Zn from livestock sludge, enhancing the sustainability of intensive livestock farming.

AB  - Recognition and monitoring of neurotransmitters like dopamine (DA) and serotonin (SE) have been subjects of great importance in the past few years. Disorder of the quantity of these neurotransmitters may have a detrimental effect on human health. Now, the development of a well-organized monitoring probe for DA and SE detection is vital. Herein, an efficient electrochemical sensor was constructed with copper and cobalt on FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) to act as an enzyme-free biosensor for the first time. Structure, composition, and surface morphology of CoCu2O3 were examined by X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), and atomic force microscopy techniques. Endogenous measurements of DA, SE, and the nature of the electrode were demonstrated using voltammetry and amperometry studies, which showed impressive electroanalytical performance in the detection of DA and SE separately and simultaneously. The biosensing probe shows a detection limit, and its sensitivity is around 0.206 and 0.237 mu M and 65.12 and 61.12 mu A mu M-1 cm-2 for DA and SE, respectively. The fabricated sensor has excellent stability, repeatability, and reproducibility of FTO/CoCu2O3 thin film due to its uniform active sites of the grains, suggesting a future scope in biosensing. It exhibits good selectivity in interference studies with different interferents. With the successful recognition of DA in dopamine hydrochloride injections, DA and SE in goat and hen blood serum samples were tested using the electrode fruitfully. A UV-vis experiment was performed with the reaction mixture before and after electrochemical analysis that proved the presence of oxidized products of DA and SE. The time-dependent density-functional theory method of calculation was utilized to predict the probable structure of intermediates with plausible mechanisms. It is a promising platform for DA and SE biosensing with high efficacy.

AB  - Lanthanide (Ln3+)-doped A 2 M 3 O 12 negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials have gained increasing interest owing to their ability to resist thermal quenching. However, several issues limit their practical application, such as a high hygroscopicity and a poor understanding of the influence of M-site cations on the luminescence thermal response. Herein, we synthesized and characterized 9 mol% Nd 3+ :Yb 2 Mo 3(1-x) W 3x O 12 phosphor powders and their corresponding phosphor-in-glass (PiG) composites. The results demonstrate that Yb2W3O12 exhibits superior NTE characteristics compared to Yb2Mo3O12, attributable to the weaker attractive energy of the W-O bond. Upon 980 nm excitation, the Nd3+: 4 F j -> 4 I 9/2 (j = 7/2, 5/2, 3/2) emissions significantly intensify with increasing temperature, especially in Nd3+:Yb2W3O12, which correlates with its higher phonon energy and enhanced NTE. Incorporating Yb2M3O12 (M = Mo, W) powders into a silicate glass matrix effectively improves the water resistance of the materials. Using the intensity ratio of the Nd3+: 4 F 7/2 -> 4 I 9/2 and Yb3+: 2 F 5/2 -> 2 F 7/2 transitions for optical thermometry, the PiG-Yb2W3O12 and PiG-Yb2Mo3O12 composites achieve maximum relative sensing sensitivities of approximately 4.52 and 3.88 %K-1, respectively, surpassing those of their pristine phosphor counterparts. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the performance of Ln3+-doped A2M3O12-type NTE materials.

AB  - The management of Meloidogyne spp. in tomato crops presents significant challenges for sustainable agriculture. This study evaluates the potential of Nesidiocoris tenuis, Macrolophus pygmaeus, and (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate-two zoophytophagous mirid species and one of the herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) they trigger-to induce systemic resistance against Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica in tomato plants (cv. Bodar). To this end, we assess the expression of the PIN2 and PR1 genes, related to the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) pathways, respectively. Exposure of tomato plants to 15 nymphs of either N. tenuis or M. pygmaeus for 24 or 48 h, and to (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate for 24 h, before inoculation with 200 second-stage juveniles of the nematodes significantly reduced nematode infectivity and reproduction. Notably, PIN2 gene expression in leaves was upregulated nine- and 14-fold by N. tenuis and M. pygmaeus, respectively, zero days after nematode inoculation (DANI) and was repressed by the nematode seven DANI with a nine-fold decrease, but not when the plants were exposed to M. pygmaeus or N. tenuis, indicating a strong early defense response. However, PR1 expression levels showed no significant changes, suggesting a predominant role of the JA pathway over the SA pathway in the induced resistance. We conclude that induction of systemic resistance in tomato plants by N. tenuis, M. pygmaeus, and (Z)-3-hexenyl propanoate before nematode exposure is a promising strategy for nematode management, at least to suppress nematode infection by the primary inoculum and later reproduction.

AB  - We address two computational issues common to open-population N-mixture models, hidden integer-valued autoregressive models, and some hidden Markov models. The first issue is computation time, which can be dramatically improved through the use of a fast Fourier transform. The second issue is tractability of the model likelihood function for large numbers of hidden states, which can be solved by improving numerical stability of calculations. As an illustrative example, we detail the application of these methods to the open-population N-mixture models. We compare computational efficiency and precision between these methods and standard methods employed by state-of-the-art ecological software. We show faster computing times (a similar to 6 to similar to 30 times speed improvement for population size upper bounds of 500 and 1000. respectively) over state-of-the-art ecological software for N-mixture models. We also apply our methods to compute the size of a large elk population using an N-mixture model and show that while our methods converge, previous software cannot produce estimates due to numerical issues. These solutions can be applied to many ecological models to improve precision when logs of sums exist in the likelihood function and to improve computational efficiency when convolutions are present in the likelihood function.

AB  - Ever since their discoveries, the Wnt pathways have been consistently associated with key features of cellular development, including metabolism, structure and cell fate. The three known pathways (the canonical Wnt/(beta-catenin and the two non-canonical Wnt/Ca++ and Wnt/JNK/PCP pathways) participate in complex networks of interaction with a wide range of regulators of cell function, such as GSK-3 beta, AKT, PKC and mTOR, among others. These proteins are known to be involved in the formation and maintenance of memory. Currently, studies with Wnt and memory have shown that the canonical and non-canonical pathways play key roles in different processes associated with memory. So, in this review we briefly summarize the different roles that Wnt signaling can play in neurons and in memory, as well as in Alzheimer's disease, focusing towards animal studies. We start with the molecular characterization of the family and its receptors, as well as the most commonly used drugs for pharmacological manipulations. Next, we describe its role in synaptic plasticity and memory, and how the regulations of these pathways affect crucial features of neuronal function. Furthermore, we succinctly present the current knowledge on how the Wnt pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease, and how studies are seeing them as a potential candidate for effective treatments. Lastly, we point toward challenges of Wnt research, and how knowledge on these pathways can lead towards a better understanding of neurobiological and pathological processes.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis), as a major, global cash crop providing beverages, is facing major challenges from droughts and water shortages due to climate change. The accurate estimation of the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) of tea plants is essential for improving the water management and crop health of tea plantations. However, an accurate quantification of tea plantations' ETa is lacking due to the complex and non-linear process that is difficult to measure and estimate accurately. Ensemble learning (EL) is a promising potential algorithm for accurate evapotranspiration prediction, which solves this complexity through the new field of machine learning. In this study, we investigated the potential of three EL algorithms-random forest (RF), bagging, and adaptive boosting (Ad)-for predicting the daily ETa of tea plants, which were then compared with the commonly used k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms, and the experimental model. We used 36 estimation models with six scenarios from available meteorological and evapotranspiration data collected from tea plantations over a period of 12 years (2010-2021). The results show that the combination of R-n (net radiation), T-mean (mean air temperature), and RH (relative humidity) achieved reasonable precision in assessing the daily ETa of tea plantations in the absence of climatic datasets. Compared with other advanced models, the RF model demonstrated superior performance (root mean square error (RMSE): 0.41-0.56 mm day(-1), mean absolute error (MAE): 0.32-0.42 mm day(-1), R-2: 0.84-0.91) in predicting the daily ETa of tea plantations, except in Scenario 6, followed by the bagging, SVM, KNN, Ad, and MLP algorithms. In addition, the RF and bagging models exhibited the highest steadiness with low RMSE values increasing (-15.3 similar to+18.5%) in the validation phase over the testing phase. Considering the high prediction accuracy and stability of the studied models, the RF and bagging models can be recommended for estimating the daily ETa estimation of tea plantations. The importance analysis from the studied models demonstrated that the R-n and T-mean are the most critical influential variables that affect the observed and predicted daily ETa dynamics of tea plantations.

AB  - The Xiaohe cemetery is located in the desert of the Lop Nur region of Xinjiang, and its excavated cultural relics include numerous textiles and animal hair. In this study, we examined the hair fiber morphology of two relics from Xiaohe cemetery, one being a fragment of a cloak and the other a hair sample, but were unable to identify the species of origin using this technique. Therefore, we employed DNA barcoding, which successfully identified both samples as deriving from goat ( Capra hircus ). Besides, three efficient methods for removing bacteria from hair fibers were established. However, the bacteria-removing treatments may have negative impacts on the species identification of cultural relics. This study provided a new molecular archaeological basis for the studies of various archaeological issues such as the development of textiles, the domestication of fur-bearing animals, as well as the origin and early development of agricultural and husbandry civilization in the Lop Nur region of Xinjiang.

AB  - Glaesserella parasuis (G. parasuis) is the primary pathogen responsible for Gl & auml;sser's disease and poses a significant threat to the global pig industry. MicroRNAs are a class of short, endogenous, single-stranded noncoding RNAs that play crucial roles in inflammation, apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, and invasion in various organisms. This study analyzed the characteristics of porcine alveolar macrophage (PAM) cells infected with G. parasuis through the knockdown and overexpression of ssc-miR-129a-3p. We constructed a cellular model with ssc-miR-129a-3p knockdown invaded by G. parasuis strain XX0306, screening 160 differentially expressed genes via high-throughput sequencing. GO enrichment analysis revealed that 376 GO entries were enriched. KEGG enrichment analysis found that mRNA target genes were enriched in 17 cell signaling pathways, including G protein-coupled components, PPAR, and other signaling pathways that can mediate inflammatory pathways. By examining the expression of relevant inflammatory factors and signaling pathways, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms through which ssc-miR-129a-3p targets the TLR4/NF-kappa B signaling pathway to regulate inflammatory injury. This study establishes a foundation for further research into the role of miRNA in the pathogenesis of Gl & auml;sser disease and is highly significant for the prevention and control of bacterial diseases within the pig industry.

AB  - Soy protein concentrate improves nutrient utilization and growth performance compared to soybean meal, and diets with a low crude protein (CP) level decreases diarrhoea. The objectives were to (1) test a low CP diet based on different soy products, and (2) to test a very-low CP diet (15.1%) with amino acids (AA) on diarrhoea and productivity. A total of 5,635 weaned pigs (similar to 28 days), were assigned to five dietary treatments; PC (positive control): Standard CP levels (192, 189, 191 g/kg CP) with 2500 ppm ZnO; NC (negative control): Same as PC without ZnO; SP (Soy protein concentrate): Low CP levels (176, 174, 191 g/kg CP); SB (Soybean meal): Low CP levels (177, 176, 191 g/kg CP); and XLA (X-low CP + AA): Very low CP levels (154, 151, 191 g/kg CP) with AA. The PC and XLA diets reduced diarrhoea by 41 and 61%, respectively, compared to the NC group, while no difference between SB and SP were observed. The XLA diet reduced feed intake and daily gain compared with PC and NC, where SP, SB, and XLA had a poorer feed conversion compared with PC. Conclusively, the SP and SB low-protein diets did not reduce diarrhoea or growth performance, whereas the XLA diet decreased both diarrhoea and performance.

AB  - Age-related memory loss affects approximately 40% of the world's population after the age of 65 and is a significant risk factor for the development of dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Numerous studies have reported that late in life there decreases in the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, the main regulator of protein degradation in cells that is also critically involved in memory formation. However, ubiquitin can mark proteins for fates other than destruction by the proteasome. Importantly, it remains unknown how the aging process alters proteasome-independent forms of ubiquitination and how this could contribute to age-related memory loss. Here, using an unbiased proteomic approach, we found that linear polyubiquitination-the only non-lysine proteasome-independent form of polyubiquitination-is significantly increased in the aged hippo-campus at rest relative to young adults. However, in response to learning there was a significant reduction in linear polyubiquitination in the aged hippocampus, which contrasted with increases seen in young adult animals following learning. CRISPR-dCas9 mediated upregulation of linear polyubiquitination in the hippocampus improved memory in young adult, but not aged, rats. Together, these data suggest that while linear polyubiquitination is a critical regulator of hippocampus-dependent memory, increasing it in the aged hippocampus is not sufficient to improve memory in advanced age. These findings advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating memory late in life and stimulate future research on the role of degradation-independent ubiquitination in this process.

AB  - PurposeLevothyroxine (LEV) monotherapy cannot completely improve cognitive and behavioral impairments induced by hypothyroidism, whereas a combination therapy of exercise and LEV may ameliorate these deficits. This study aimed to determine the effects of mild-intensity forced exercise and LEV treatment on the anxiety profile and cognitive functions in male offspring of hypothyroid dams.MethodTwenty-four female rats (mothers) were randomly divided into sham (healthy) and hypothyroidism groups and then placed with male rats to mate. The presence of vaginal plaque confirmed pregnancy (gestational day, GD 0). 6-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU, 100 ppm) was added to the drinking water of the hypothyroidism group from GD 6 to the 21st postnatal day (PND). The sham group received tap water. On PND 21, serum T4 levels of mothers, and 10 pups were measured to confirm hypothyroidism. Sixty-four male pups were left undisturbed for 30 days and then were divided into eight groups that received saline or LEV (50 mu g/kg, i.p.) with or without forced mild-intensity exercise. After 14 days of interventions, anxiety-like behaviors, spatial learning and memory, and hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were evaluated.FindingA pre and postnatal PTU-induced model of hypothyroidism increased anxiety-like behaviors, impaired spatial learning and memory, and decreased hippocampal BDNF levels in male offspring rats. LEV alone increased BDNF levels and improved spatial learning. Exercise alone increased BDNF levels, improved spatial learning and memory, and decreased anxiety-like behaviors. Exercise plus LEV more effectively improved anxiety-like behaviors and spatial learning than exercise or LEV alone.ConclusionPractically, these pre-clinical findings highlight the importance of the combination of exercise and LEV regimen in treating patients with hyperthyroidism.
   A maternal PTU-induced hypothyroidism model led to increased anxiety-like behaviors, impaired spatial navigation, and reduced hippocampal BDNF levels in male offspring rats. Levothyroxine alone increased BDNF levels and improved spatial learning, while exercise alone boosted BDNF levels, enhanced spatial learning and memory, and reduced anxiety-like behaviors. The combination of exercise and levothyroxine was more effective in improving anxiety-like behaviors and spatial learning than either treatment alone. image

AB  - Numerous species of adventive aphids in Japan exhibit a strong association with naturalized plants, making the aphid studies on such plants crucial for the early detection of newly introduced species. During 2017-2018 and 2023-2024, we examined the aphids occurring on a naturalized plant, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link (Fabaceae) in Japan, documenting the occurrence of a new adventive species, Ctenocallis setosa (Kaltenbach, 1846) in the country. This represents the first record of this species also from Asia, as it is native to Europe and had previously been adventive only in North America. This paper provides the photographs and morphological redescriptions of its viviparae (apterous and alate) and sexuals (oviparae and alate males). The findings from this field study suggest that this species exhibits a monoecious holocyclic life cycle in Japan, characterized by the sexual morph production for laying overwintering eggs in fall and the absence of host alternation during summer.

AB  - The subterranean termite Reticulitermes chinensis Snyder is an important pest in China. We determined the inhibition of six selected insecticides to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) extracted from R. chinensis. Our results yielded half maximal inhibitory concentrations (I-50) for each of the insecticides to be 3.49 x 10(-3) M for methomyl, 3.87 x 10(-2) M for phoxim, 2.18 x 10(-3) M for triazophos, 1.89 x 10(-3) M for profenosos, 1.10 x 10(-3) M for malathion, and 4.39 x 10(-2) M for omethoate. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of AChE by the six insecticides was increased with the increase of insecticide concentration from 3.3 x 10(-7) to 5 x 10(-3) M. These results provide a theoretical basis for the management of R. chinensis.

AB  - Background The efficient use of fertilizers depends very much on their proper placement, and the effects of fertilizer placement on the woody perennial plant tea (Camellia sinensis L.) are not clearly understood. Methods A N-15 mini-plot field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of four common techniques of fertilizer placement techniques. N-15-labeled urea was applied in October by surface broadcasting, surface broadcasting with 3-5 cm soil incorporation, shallow (3-5 cm), and deep (10-15 cm) side dressing (DSD). The proportion of N derived from N-15-labeled fertilizer (N-dff%) was estimated in root, and soil samples were collected 15 and 43 days after fertilization (DAA15 and DAA43) and in young shoots collected in the following spring. Results Most fertilizer N-15 was located in the soil near the placement position at DAA15 and N-15 had moved downward but maintained a similar distribution in the soil profile at DAA43. The distribution of fibrous root N-dff% in the soil profile was very similar to that of soil N-dff%. DSD resulted in the highest shoot N-dff%, the estimated amount of N-15 in young shoot derived from N-15-label fertilizer (shoot N-15), and its percentage related to the amount of N-15-labeled fertilizer input (REFN%). Thus, DSD of urea as basal application in autumn maintained a higher and prolonged N supply in the middle and deep soil layers, thereby improving fertilizer-N absorption and utilization in the following spring tea. However, direct broadcasting of urea on the soil surface resulted in low N availability in the soil and utilization by tea plants. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that DSD of N fertilization should be recommended for tea planting to increase N use efficiency and reduce environmental losses in forms of runoff and volatilization.

AB  - Objective: To measure seasonal effects on semen quality profiles, seminal biochemical and oxidative stress attributes in fresh and liquid stored semen in monsoon and dry seasons.Methods: A total of 10 Teressa bucks (3-4 years) were selected from breeding farm, ICAR-Central Island Agricultural Research Institute, Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. Semen samples (n=25 per season) were collected through artificial vagina method and preserved at refrigerated temperature (5(degrees)C) for 48 h using Tris citrate glucose based extender. We detected semen quality parameters [volume, mass activity, pH, sperm concentration, total motility, viability, total sperm abnormality, and plasma membrane, acrosomal and nuclear integrities], biochemical profiles [aspartate amino transferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT) and total cholesterol], and oxidative stress markers [total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and malondialdehyde (MDA)] during monsoon and dry seasons.Results: Semen quality parameters significantly differed between seasons (P<0.05) and among storage periods (P<0.05). Volume, pH, mass activity, motility, viability, acrosomal, plasma membrane and nuclear integrities, and TAC were significantly higher (P<0.05). Sperm concentration, sperm abnormalities, MDA, AST, ALT and total cholesterol were significantly lower in fresh semen of monsoon than dry season (P<0.05). Motility, viability, acrosomal, plasma membrane and nuclear integrities, and TAC were significantly decreased (P<0.05) while sperm abnormality, AST, ALT, total cholesterol and MDA were significantly increased as liquid semen storage period advanced (P<0.05).Conclusions: Monsoon season has higher beneficial effects on semen quality profiles and liquid stored semen remained usable for upto 48 h. Good quality ejaculates with higher TAC and lower MDA can be cryopreserved and will be used for artificial insemination.

AB  - Many grasses (Poaceae) defend their basal meristems with silicified trichomes, prickles, and spines. These leaf features are often unidirectional, pointing from the leaf base to the tip. They have been hypothesized to direct small herbivores away from vulnerable meristems, making grasses tolerant of the loss of leaf tissue. The aim of this study was to determine whether leaves of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and broomsedge (Andropogon virginicus L.) with silicified non-glandular trichomes and prickles experience more chewing damage to leaf tips than to leaf bases, and whether the unidirectional leaf features were responsible for this pattern. Rice and A. virginicus leaves received 4x and 3x more chewing damage, respectively, to tips than middle sections, and 3x and 8x more damage to middle sections compared to basal sections. Removing trichomes and prickles from half of each leaf did not increase the overall frequency of damage to those leaves. However, removing silicified structures caused herbivores to increase the frequency of damage to leaf sections without trichomes and prickles, including basal leaf sections. Leaves of A. virginicus were experimentally folded in half such that the middle section was above the tip and basal sections; folded leaves received more damage to tips and bases than to middle sections. This indicates that herbivores do not choose to feed on the tallest leaf tissue but are likely influenced by the orientation of the silicified leaf features. Previous studies have shown variation in silicified structures on the leaves of many crop species. As these structures are involved in directing herbivores away from basal meristems, they should be considered as targets for crop breeding.

AB  - Termites, being vulnerable to parasitic or pathogenic infections due to large number of individuals living together in colonies, have evolved various behavioral and physiological tactics to resist the infections by those pathogens. Locomotion can help termites collect information on parasites and accordingly exhibit hygienic behaviors. Termites inevitably encounter entomopathogenic fungi during nesting and foraging. However, how these fungal pathogens influence locomotion of termites and how hygienic behavior benefits their survival remains unknown. Here, we examined locomotion alteration of the termite Reticulitermes chinensis (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) after infections with different concentrations of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae). When R. chinensis was isolated, the low concentration (5 x 10(3) conidia/ml) significantly increased termite locomotion after 6, 12, and 24 h compared with control. However, the high concentrations (5 x 10(7), 5 x 10(9) conidia/ml) significantly decreased termite locomotion after 48 h, and termite survival was also significantly lower at 5 x 10(7) and 5 x 10(9) conidia/ml compared with the low concentrations and the control. When R. chinensis was in group, however, the locomotion significantly increased 24 h after exposure to 5 x 10(3) and 5 x 10(9) conidia/ml but was normalized after 48 h of exposure compared with the control. Allogrooming was significantly higher at 5 x 103 and 5 x 10(9) conidia/ml compared with the control.The fungal infection did not result in significantly higher mortality of the group termites probably owing to their allogrooming. These findings enhance our understanding on how a termite species copes with biotic stress (i.e., fungal infections) via adaptive behaviors.

AB  - Limited research has been conducted on porcine miR-155 promoters, and previous study from our group have identified two haplotypes (TT and CC) in different pig breeds, each associated with five fully linked mutation sites within or near the miR-155 gene (Li et al. Dev Comp Immunol 39(1):110-116, 2013). In this study, the promoter region of porcine miR-155 was screened, and two important transcription factors, Foxp3 and RelA, were identified. The binding ability of Foxp3 protein was found to be affected by the first mutation site (A/C) using EMSA analysis. In vitro experiments revealed that the expression level of miR-155 was significantly higher in the C haplotype compared to the T haplotype. Additionally, northern blotting assays indicated that both the first mutation site (A/C) and the fourth mutation site (G/T) had a significant impact on miR-155 expression levels. These findings provide further insights into the transcriptional regulation of porcine miR-155 and identify crucial mutation sites that influence miR-155 expression. This knowledge can serve as a basis for identifying potential molecular markers associated with disease resistance in swine.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Hemp ( Cannabis sativa L.) is increasingly being recognized for its medicinal properties beside utilizing it for food, oil, and textile fibers. The high level of cannabidiol (CBD) content in hemp's flowers shows promising neuroprotective properties without causing psychotomimetic or addictive effects. Recently, products containing CBD and its precursor, cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), have been used to treat stress-related cognitive impairment. However, the therapeutic potential of hemp extract remains inadequately explored. Aim of the study: To investigate the effect of CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract on learning and memory, neuroendocrine alterations, and hippocampal neuropathological changes in the chronic restraint stress model.<br /> Materials and methods: Chronic restraint stress (CRS) was induced in male Wistar rats by immobilizing them in a restrainer for 6 h per day for 21 consecutive days. CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract (10 and 30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) was administered daily, 1 h before restraint. After the last day of CRS, behavioral tests for cognition were conducted using the Y-maze and object recognition tests. Serum corticosterone (CORT) levels were measured by ELISA. Histopathological changes, neuronal density, and the activation of microglia and astrocytes were visualized using cresyl violet and immunohistochemical staining. |Results: A high dose of CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract effectively ameliorated CRS-induced cognitive impairment and reversed HPA axis hyperactivity in CRS rats by reducing CORT levels and adrenal gland weight. Additionally, CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract protected CRS-induced damage to hippocampal neurons. Further analysis showed that CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extract reduced specific markers of microglial activation (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1, Iba-1) and astrocytic structural protein (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) in CRS rats.<br /> Conclusion: CBD/CBDA-rich hemp extracts remarkably reversed the stress-induced behavioral perturbations and hippocampal damage, suggesting its ameliorative effect on stress response.
