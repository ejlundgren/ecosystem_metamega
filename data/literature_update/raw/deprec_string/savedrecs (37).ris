AB  - Background: Previous studies have established a connection between adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and alcohol use disorder (AUD), both of which are associated with alterations in grey matter volume (GMV) and cortical thickness (CT). The current study aimed to assess the neurobiological impact of ACE specifically in the context of AUD, as well as the role of maltreatment type (i.e., abuse or neglect) and timing. Methods: Structural MRI data were collected from 35 adults with AUD (mean age: 40; 31% female) and 28 healthy controls (mean age: 36; 61% female). ACE were assessed retrospectively using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the Maltreatment and Abuse Chronology interview. Global and regional GMV and CT were estimated using voxel- and surface-based morphometry. Results: Relative to the healthy controls, the AUD group had significantly reduced CT in the left inferior frontal gyrus, left circular sulcus of the insula and subcentral gyrus and sulci (cluster C1), and in the central sulcus and precentral gyrus (cluster C2). Within the AUD group, a reduction of CT in cluster C1 was significantly associated with higher severity of ACE and AUD. Type and timing analyses revealed a significant association between higher levels of abuse at ages 13 to 15 and reduced CT in cluster C1 within the AUD group. Conclusions: In adults with AUD, abuse experienced during early adolescence is associated with reduced CT in regions involved in inhibitory control, indicating the potential relevance of cognitive pathways in the association between ACE and AUD. Longitudinal studies are needed to confirm and expand upon current findings.

AB  - Neurovascular defects are one of the most common alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, but whether these deficits develop before the onset of amyloid beta (A beta) accumulation remains to be determined. Using in vivo optical imaging in freely moving mice, we explored activity-induced hippocampal microvascular blood flow dynamics in AppSAA knock-in and J20 mouse models of AD at early stages of disease progression. We found that prior to the onset of A beta accumulation, there was a pathologically elevated blood flow response to context exploration, termed functional hyperemia. After the onset of A beta accumulation, this context exploration-induced hyperemia declined rapidly relative to that in control mice. Using in vivo electrophysiology recordings to explore the neural circuit mechanism underlying this blood flow alteration, we found that hippocampal interneurons before the onset of A beta accumulation were hyperactive during context exploration. Chemogenetic tests suggest that hyperactive activation of inhibitory neurons accounted for the elevated functional hyperemia. The suppression of nitric oxide (NO) produced from hippocampal interneurons in young AD mice decreased the accumulation of A beta. Together, these findings reveal that neurovascular coupling is aberrantly elevated before A beta deposition, and this hyperactive functional hyperemia declines rapidly upon A beta accumulation.

AB  - It is not entirely clear how the interaction between joint inflammation and the central nervous system (CNS) response in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) works, and what pathophysiology underlies the sex differences in coexisting neuropsychiatric comorbidities. It is known that estrogen hormones reduce inflammation in RA and that this occurs mainly via the stimulation of G protein-coupled receptor-30 (GPR30), also known as G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) 1. However, changes in GPR30 expression and sex differences induced by local and systemic inflammation in RA are not yet known. Our aim was to reveal sex differences in the expression and association of joint GPR30 with local and systemic inflammation, clinical course and furthermore with hippocampal GPR30 expression during pristane-induced arthritis (PIA) in Dark Agouti (DA) rats, an animal model of RA. Furthermore, we demonstrated sex-specific differences in the association between joint and systemic inflammation and hippocampal microglia during PIA. Our results suggest sex-specific differences not only in the clinical course and serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines but also in the expression of GPR30. Female rats show greater synovial inflammation and greater damage to the articular cartilage compared to males during PIA attack. Male rats express higher levels of synovial and cartilaginous GPR30 than females during PIA, which correlates with a less severe clinical course. The correlation between synovial and cartilaginous GPR30 and joint inflammation scores (Krenn and Mankin) in male rats suggests that the more severe the joint inflammation, the higher the GPR30 expression. At the same time, there is no particular upregulation of hippocampal GPR30 in males. On the other hand, female rats express higher levels of neuroprotective GPR30 in the hippocampus than male rats at the basic level and during PIA attack. In addition, females have a higher number of Iba-1+ cells in the hippocampus during PIA attack that strongly correlates with the clinical score, serum levels of IL-17A, and Krenn and Mankin scores. These results suggest that male rats are better protected from inflammation in the joints and female rats are better protected from the inflammation in the hippocampus during a PIA attack, independently of microglia proliferation. However, in the remission phase, synovial GPR30 expression suddenly increases in female rats, as does hippocampal GPR30 expression in males. Further experiments with a longer remission period are needed to investigate the molecular background of these sex differences, as well as microglia phenotype profiling.

AB  - Marine cyanobacteria are known to produce structurally diverse bioactive specialized metabolites during bloom occurrence. These ecologically active allelochemicals confer chemical defense for the microalgae from competing microbes and herbivores. From a collection of a marine cyanobacterium, cf. Lyngbya sp., a small quantity of a new cyclopropane-containing molecule, benderadiene (2), and lyngbyoic acid (1) were purified and characterized using spectroscopic methods. Using live reporter quorum-sensing (QS) inhibitory assays, based on P. aeruginosa PAO1 lasB-gfp and rhlA-gfp strains, both compounds were found to inhibit QS-regulated gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to lyngbyoic acid being more active in the PAO1 lasB-gfp biosensor strain (IC50 of 20.4 mu M), it displayed anti-biofilm activity when incubated with wild-type P. aeruginosa. The discovery of lyngbyoic acid in relatively high amounts provided insights into its ecological significance as a defensive allelochemical in targeting competing microbes through interference with their QS systems and starting material to produce other related analogs. Similar strategies could be adopted by other marine cyanobacterial strains where the high production of other lipid acids has been reported. Preliminary evidence is provided from the virtual molecular docking of these cyanobacterial free acids at the ligand-binding site of the P. aeruginosa LasR transcriptional protein.

AB  - Cancer and neurodegenerative diseases are two of the leading causes of premature death in modern societies. Their incidence continues to increase, and in the near future, it is believed that cancer will kill more than 20 million people per year, and neurodegenerative diseases, due to the aging of the world population, will double their prevalence. The onset and the progression of both diseases are defined by dysregulation of the same molecular signaling pathways. However, whereas in cancer, these alterations lead to cell survival and proliferation, neurodegenerative diseases trigger cell death and apoptosis. The study of the mechanisms underlying these opposite final responses to the same molecular trigger is key to providing a better understanding of the diseases and finding more accurate treatments. Here, we review the ten most common signaling pathways altered in cancer and analyze them in the context of different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD), and Huntington's (HD) diseases.

AB  - Tropomyosin (Tpm) has been regarded as the master regulator of actin dynamics. Tpms regulate the binding of the various proteins involved in restructuring actin. The actin cytoskeleton is the predominant cytoskeletal structure in dendritic spines. Its regulation is critical for spine formation and long-term activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength. The Tpm isoform Tpm3.1 is enriched in dendritic spines, but its role in regulating the synapse structure and function is not known. To determine the role of Tpm3.1, we studied the synapse structure and function of cultured hippocampal neurons from transgenic mice overexpressing Tpm3.1. We recorded hippocampal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) from brain slices to examine if Tpm3.1 overexpression alters long-term synaptic plasticity. Tpm3.1-overexpressing cultured neurons did not show a significantly altered dendritic spine morphology or synaptic activity. Similarly, we did not observe altered synaptic transmission or plasticity in brain slices. Furthermore, expression of Tpm3.1 at the postsynaptic compartment does not increase the local F-actin levels. The results suggest that although Tpm3.1 localises to dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons, it does not have any apparent impact on dendritic spine morphology or function. This is contrary to the functional role of Tpm3.1 previously observed at the tip of growing neurites, where it increases the F-actin levels and impacts growth cone dynamics.

AB  - Transcranial Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused Ultrasound can oscillate intravenously delivered microbubbles and transiently open the blood brain barrier (BBB) in a targeted brain region. However, high microbubble doses or Focused ultrasound pressures (FUS) leads to injury. So, we administered nitrous oxide (N2O), an anesthetic gas to determine reduced need of FUS pressure and microbubble dose for opening BBB. Swiss Webster mice were treated with N2O or medical air (MA) at varying FUS pressures, while the microbubble dose was kept constant and the vice-versa. Consequently, BBB opening was quantified by acoustic emissions and enhancement rate on T1-weighted MR. To compare the effect of N2O on gene delivery, following BBB opening with either MA or N2O, a viral vector expressing GFP was subsequently delivered. Additionally, Immunohistochemical studies quantified viral transfection efficacy and assessed acute cell injury. We observed that N2O significantly potentiates acoustic emissions and enhancement rate on post-contrast MRI images, compared to MA at all measured pressures (0.39, 0.45, 0.67 MPa). Furthermore, N2O reduces the microbubble dose to 0.02 mu l/kg and FUS pressures to 0.28 and 0.39 MPa for BBB disruption and enhanced viral gene delivery, respectively. Hence, N2O potentiates microbubble oscillations, allowing reduced microbubble dose and FUS pressures and improved viral gene delivery.

AB  - Microglia modulate pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic activities. Edible plantderived factors improve brain function. Current knowledge of the molecular interactions between edible plant-derived factors and the microglial cell is limited. Here an alcohol-induced chronic brain inflammation model is used to identify that the microglial cell is the novel target of oat nanoparticles (oatN). Oral administration of oatN inhibits brain inflammation and improves brain memory function of mice that are fed alcohol. Mechanistically, ethanol activates dectin-1 mediated inflammatory pathway. OatN is taken up by microglial cells via beta-glucan mediated binding to microglial hippocalcin (HPCA) whereas oatN digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) prevents assess of oatN beta-glucan to dectin-1. Subsequently endocytosed beta-glucan/HPCA is recruited in an endosomal recycling compartment (ERC) via interaction with Rablla. This complex then sequesters the dectin-1 in the ERC in an oatN beta-glucan dependent manner and alters the location ofdectin-1 from Golgi to early endosomes and lysosomes and increases exportation of dectin-1 into exosomes in an Rablla dependent manner. Collectively, these cascading actions lead to preventing the activation of the alcoholic induced brain inflammation signing pathway(s). This coordinated assembling of the HPCA/Rablla/dectin-1 complex by oral administration of oatN may contribute to the prevention of brain inflammation.

AB  - Optoelectronic biointerfaces have emerged as a promising platform for controlling the nervous system at the cellular, tissue, and organ levels with potential clinical applications via transduction of light energy to ionic currents. To improve charge injection, supercapacitor materials like IrOx, TiN, and PEDOT have been incorporated as an additional layer on the photodiodes at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. Here, a bioelectronic design is demonstrated where AgBiS2 quantum dots (QDs) serve as the photoabsorption material, hole transport medium, and pseudocapacitive electrode-electrolyte interface. The power-law behavior of the anodic and cathodic peaks suggests that diffusion-controlled and capacitive processes contribute to the charge storage mechanism. Furthermore, 3D Bode capacitance maps and phase angle responses indicate a high capacitance of 3.3 mF cm(-)(2) at the half-wave potential (0.044 V vs Ag/AgCl) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). For efficient transduction of light to electrical stimulation, AgBiS2 QDs are embedded onto ZnO nanowires (NWs) in a photovoltaic device architecture, which produces twice the photocurrent (1.9 +/- 0.3 mA cm(-)(2)) and nearly three times the charge injection (29 +/- 2.3 mu C cm(-)(2)) compared to the planar devices without NWs. Moreover, photostimulation of hippocampal neurons is demonstrated on the device without inducing significant oxidative stress. This study demonstrates an unconventional and efficient bioelectronic device via pseudocapacitive optoelectronic nanocrystals.

AB  - Real-time and non-invasive monitoring of neuronal differentiation helps to increase understanding of neuronal development and develop stem cell therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Conventional methods such as RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunofluorescence (IF), lack single-cell-level resolution and require invasive procedures, fixation, and staining. These limitations hinder accurate monitoring progress of neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation and understanding its functions. Herein, a novel approach is reported to non-invasively monitor neuronal differentiation in real-time using cell-based biosensors (CBBs) that detects hippocalcin, biomarker of neuronal differentiation. To construct the hippocalcin sensor proteins, two different hippocalcin bioreceptors are fused to each split-intein, carrying split-nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, respectively, and fluorescent protein is introduced as reporter. CBBs operated in the presence of hippocalcin to generate functional signal peptides, which promptly translocated the fluorescence signal to the nucleus. The NSC-based biosensor shows fluorescence signal translocation only upon neuronal differentiation and not undifferentiated stem cells or glial cells. Furthermore, this approach allows monitoring of neural differentiation at earlier stages than detected using IF staining. It is believed that novel CBBs offer an alternative to current techniques by capturing the dynamics of differentiation progress at the single-cell-level and providing a tool to evaluate how NSCs efficiently differentiate into neurons.
   Novel cell-based biosensor (CBB) is developed to monitor neuronal differentiation in real-time. CBB reports early neurogenesis through translocation of fluorescence signal before expression of TuJ1, key neuronal marker. The ability to capture differentiation dynamics at single-cell-level improves the capability to examine and control neuronal development. Its non-invasiveness can be valuable to investigate neurodegenerative diseases and promote advances in cell therapy. image

AB  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a technique commonly used both in clinical and fundamental neurosciences. Classically, brain stimulation requires an implanted and wired electrode system to deliver stimulation directly to the target area. Although techniques such as temporal interference (TI) can provide stimulation at depth without involving any implanted electrodes, these methods still rely on a wired apparatus which limits free movement. Herein organic photocapacitors as untethered light-driven electrodes which convert deep-red light into electric current are reported. Pairs of these ultrathin devices can be driven using lasers at two different frequencies to deliver stimulation at depth via temporally interfering fields. This concept of laser TI stimulation using numerical modeling, tests with phantom brain samples, and finally in vivo tests is validated. Wireless organic photocapacitors are placed on the cortex and elicit stimulation in the hippocampus, while not delivering off-target stimulation in the cortex. This laser-driven wireless TI evokes a neuronal response at depth that is comparable to control experiments induced with deep brain stimulation protocols using implanted electrodes. This work shows that a combination of these two techniques-temporal interference and organic electrolytic photocapacitors-provides a reliable way to target brain structures requiring neither deeply implanted electrodes nor tethered stimulator devices. The laser TI protocol demonstrated here addresses two of the most important drawbacks in the field of DBS and thus holds potential to solve many issues in freely moving animal experiments or for clinical chronic therapy application.

AB  - Surgery remains an essential treatment for managing drug-resistant focal epilepsy, but its accessibility and efficacy are limited in patients without distinct structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Potassium ion (K+), a critical marker for seizure-associated neuronal signaling, shows significant promise for designing sensors targeting hidden epileptic foci. However, existing sensors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and lack the ability to specifically enrich and amplify K+ signals in the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, an intravenously administered neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor (NSAN) is reported that combines real-time dynamic reversible K+ fluorescence imaging with high-resolution structural MRI, enabling electroencephalogram-concordant imaging of MRI-negative epileptic foci. Guided by NSANs, minimally invasive surgery is successfully performed in both intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model with foci confined to the ipsilateral hippocampus, and intraperitoneal KA model where foci are randomly distributed, resulting in sustained seizure control and cognitive improvement. These findings highlight the NSAN as a transformative tool for visualizing hidden epileptic foci, thereby broadening eligibility for minimally invasive and precision surgical intervention.

AB  - Age-related decline in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress plays a critical role in neurodegeneration. Lactate dehydrogenase-B (LDHB) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of lactate, an important brain energy substrate, into pyruvate. It has been reported that the LDHB pattern changes in the brain during ageing. Yet very little is known about the effect of LDHB deficiency on brain pathology. Here, we have used Ldhb knockout (Ldhb(-/-)) mice to test the hypothesis that LDHB deficiency plays an important role in oxidative stress-mediated neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. LDHB knockout (Ldhb(-/-)) mice were generated by the ablation of the Ldhb gene using the Cre/loxP-recombination system in the C57BL/6 genetic background. The Ldhb(-/-) mice were treated with either osmotin (15 mu g/g of the body; intraperitoneally) or vehicle twice a week for 5-weeks. After behavior assessments, the mice were sacrificed, and the cortical and hippocampal brain regions were analyzed through biochemical and morphological analysis. Ldhb(-/-) mice displayed enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) production, and they revealed depleted stores of cellular ATP, GSH:GSSG enzyme ratio, and downregulated expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 proteins, when compared to WT littermates. Importantly, the Ldhb(-/-) mice showed upregulated expression of apoptosis mediators (Bax, Cytochrome C, and caspase-3), and revealed impaired p-AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1alpha signaling. Moreover, LDHB deficiency-induced gliosis increased the production of inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, Nf-kappa B, and NOS2), and revealed cognitive deficits. Treatment with osmotin, an adipoR1 natural agonist, significantly increased cellular ATP production by increasing mitochondrial function and attenuated oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis, probably, by upregulating p-AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1alpha signaling in Ldhb(-/-) mice. In brief, LDHB deficiency may lead to brain oxidative stress-mediated progression of neurodegeneration via regulating p-AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1alpha signaling, while osmotin could improve mitochondrial functions, abrogate oxidative stress and alleviate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in adult Ldhb(-/-) mice.

AB  - Despite the availability of new drugs on the clinics in recent years, drug-resistant epilepsy remains an unresolved challenge for healthcare, and one-third of epilepsy patients remain refractory to anti-seizure medications. Gene therapy in experimental models has emerged as effective treatment targeting specific neuronal populations in the epileptogenic focus. When combined with an external chemical activator using chemogenetics, it also becomes an "on-demand" treatment. Here, we evaluate a targeted and specific chemogenetic therapy, the PSAM/PSEM system, which holds promise as a potential candidate for clinical application in treating drug-resistant epilepsy. We show that the inert ligand uPSEM817, which selectively activates the chloride-permeable channel PSAM4-GlyR, effectively reduces the number of depolarization-induced action potentials in vitro. This effect is likely due to the shunting of depolarizing currents, as evidenced by decreased membrane resistance in these cells. In organotypic slices, uPSEM817 decreased the number of bursts and peak amplitude of events of spontaneous epileptiform activity. Although administration of uPSEM817 in vivo did not significantly alter electrographic seizures in a male mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, it did demonstrate a strong trend toward reducing the frequency of interictal epileptiform discharges. These findings indicate that PSAM4-GlyR-based chemogenetics holds potential as an anti-seizure strategy, although further refinement is necessary to enhance its efficacy.

AB  - Brain atrophy induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI) progresses in parallel with epileptogenesis over time, and thus accurate placement of intracerebral electrodes to monitor seizure initiation and spread at the chronic postinjury phase is challenging. We evaluated in adult male Sprague Dawley rats whether adjusting atlas-based electrode coordinates on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) increases electrode placement accuracy and the effect of chronic electrode implantations on TBI-induced brain atrophy. One group of rats (EEG cohort) was implanted with two intracortical (anterior and posterior) and a hippocampal electrode right after TBI to target coordinates calculated using a rat brain atlas. Another group (MRI cohort) was implanted with the same electrodes, but using T2-weighted MRI to adjust the planned atlas-based 3D coordinates of each electrode. Histological analysis revealed that the anterior cortical electrode was in the cortex in 83% (25% in targeted layer V) of the EEG cohort and 76% (31%) of the MRI cohort. The posterior cortical electrode was in the cortex in 40% of the EEG cohort and 60% of the MRI cohort. Without MRI-guided adjustment of electrode tip coordinates, 58% of the posterior cortical electrodes in the MRI cohort will be in the lesion cavity, as revealed by simulated electrode placement on histological images. The hippocampal electrode was accurately placed in 82% of the EEG cohort and 86% of the MRI cohort. Misplacement of intracortical electrodes related to their rostral shift due to TBI-induced cortical and hippocampal atrophy and caudal retraction of the brain, and was more severe ipsilaterally than contralaterally (p < 0.001). Total lesion area in cortical subfields targeted by the electrodes (primary somatosensory cortex, visual cortex) was similar between cohorts (p > 0.05). MRI-guided adjustment of coordinates for electrodes improved the success rate of intracortical electrode tip placement nearly to that at the acute postinjury phase (68% vs. 62%), particularly in the posterior brain, which exhibited the most severe postinjury atrophy. Overall, MRI-guided electrode implantation improved the quality and interpretation of the origin of EEG-recorded signals.

AB  - BackgroundReduction of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is an early critical event in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contributing to progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Reduced levels of the nucleoporin 153 (Nup153), a key epigenetic regulator of NSC stemness, characterize the neural stem cells isolated from a mouse model of AD (3xTg) (AD-NSCs) and determine their altered plasticity and gene expression.MethodsNup153-regulated mechanisms contributing to NSC function were investigated: (1) in cultured NSCs isolated from AD and wild type (WT) mice by proteomics; (2) in vivo by lentiviral-mediated delivery of Nup153 or GFP in the hippocampus of AD and control mice analyzing neurogenesis and cognitive function; (3) in human iPSC-derived brain organoids obtained from AD patients and control subjects as a model of neurodevelopment.ResultsProteomic approach identified Nup153 interactors in WT- and AD-NSCs potentially implicated in neurogenesis regulation. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that Nup153-bound proteins in WT-NSCs were involved in RNA metabolism, nuclear import and epigenetic mechanisms. Nup153-bound proteins in AD-NSCs were involved in pathways of neurodegeneration, mitochondrial dysfunction, proteasomal processing and RNA degradation. Furthermore, recovery of Nup153 levels in AD-NSCs reduced the levels of oxidative stress markers and recovered proteasomal activity. Lentiviral-mediated delivery of Nup153 in the hippocampal niche of AD mice increased the proliferation of early progenitors, marked by BrdU/DCX and BrdU/PSANCAM positivity and, later, the integration of differentiating neurons in the cell granule layer (BrdU/NeuN+ cells) compared with GFP-injected AD mice. Consistently, Nup153-injected AD mice showed an improvement of cognitive performance in comparison to AD-GFP mice at 1 month after virus delivery assessed by Morris Water Maze. To validate the role of Nup153 in neurogenesis we took advantage of brain organoids derived from AD-iPSCs characterized by fewer neuroepithelial progenitor loops and reduced differentiation areas. The upregulation of Nup153 in AD organoids recovered the formation of neural-like tubes and differentiation.ConclusionsOur data suggest that the positive effect of Nup153 on neurogenesis is based on a complex regulatory network orchestrated by Nup153 and that this protein is a valuable disease target.

AB  - Background: Adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is restricted under the pathological conditions of neurodegenerative diseases, especially in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The drop of AHN reduces neural circuit plasticity, resulting in the decrease of the generation of newborn neurons in dentate gyrus (DG), which makes it difficult to recover from learning/memory dysfunction in AD, therefore, it is imperative to find a therapeutic strategy to promote neurogenesis and clarify its underlying mechanism involved.
   Methods: Amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice were treated with photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) for 0.1 mW/mm(2) per day in the dark for 1 month (10 min for each day). The neural stem cells (NSCs) were isolated from hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice at E14, and the cells were treated with PBMT for 0.667 mW/ mm(2) in the dark (5 min for each time).
   Results: In this study, photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is found to promote AHN in APP/PS1 mice. The latent transforming growth factor-beta 1 (LTGF beta 1) was activated in vitro and in vivo during PBMT-induced AHN, which promoted the differentiation of hippocampal APP/PS1 NSCs into newborn neurons. In particular, behavioral experiments showed that PBMT enhanced the spatial learning/memory ability of APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistically, PBMT-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) activates TGF beta/Smad signaling pathway to increase the interaction of the transcription factors Smad2/3 with Smad4 and competitively reduce the association of Smad1/5/9 with Smad4, thereby significantly upregulating the expression of doublecortin (Dcx)/neuronal class-III beta-tubulin (Tuj1) and downregulating the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These in vitro effects were abrogated when eliminating ROS. Furthermore, specific inhibition of TGF beta receptor I (TGF beta R I) attenuates the DNA-binding efficiency of Smad2/3 to the Dcx promotor triggered by PBMT.
   Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that PBMT, as a viable therapeutic strategy, directs the adult hippocampal APP/PS1 NSCs differentiate towards neurons, which has great potential value for ameliorating the drop of AHN in Alzheimer's disease mice.

AB  - Effective traffic flow management entails monitoring edge devices to ensure traffic is evenly dispersed across networks. However, existing flow control systems, sometimes incorporating machine learning, struggle with complicated configurations and inefficiencies, particularly in large-scale device networks. This study provides a hybrid bioinspired system to optimize traffic flow control in edge device networks and address these issues. The proposed methodology utilizes request-response time data to forecast traffic flows across multiple device sets. Using this predictive capacity, edge resources are dynamically assigned, considerably enhancing Quality of Service (QoS) in large-scale systems. The model analyzes this data using a hybrid Elephant Herding Particle Swarm Optimizer (EHPSO), which assigns temporal weights to IP groups to estimate future demands, permitting effective resource allocation depending on system capacity. A performance-based fitness function further modifies edge configurations to respond to incoming traffic. By using EHPSO, the suggested model achieves an 8.3% improvement in resource allocation efficiency, a 4.5% reduction in calculation time, and a 6.4% decrease in computational burden for processing huge numbers of requests, making it very useful for large-scale applications.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of some oxidative stress (OS), ceruloplasmin (Cp), and neopterin (NPT) as diagnostic biomarkers for dromedary camels endometritis as well as to explore the impact of ceftiofur treatment on endometritis. Camels were categorized into two groups; healthy control group (n = 20) and endometritis group (n = 60). She-camels with clinical signs of endometritis (CE) received 6.6 mg/kg BW of ceftiofur (i/m). On days 7, and 14, she-camels were evaluated and clinical cure or failure to cure was determined. The comparison of the groups for OS demonstrated that endometritis caused an increase in serum malondialdehyde (5MDA), Cp, and NPT levels (P<0.05), but decreased serum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH) (P<0.05). The most prevalent pathogens involved in the etiology of CE are Arcanobacterium pyogenes, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. All examined biomarkers demonstrated a high degree of recognition between CE camel and healthy controls (the area under the curve (AUC) was 95.9 for NPT). A higher proportion of camels with CE that were treated with ceftiofur (90%, P<0.0001) showed clinical cure by the first dose, while 10% required a second dose. In conclusion, CE causes increased oxidative reactions and decreased antioxidant defense competence. Subsequently, the alteration in that balance that was represented by the biomarkers of OS could be beneficial for clinical practice and basic clinical research. Additionally, all trials demonstrated the efficacy of ceftiofur for the treatment of CE in she-camel.

AB  - Depression has drawn increasing attention from the public around the world in recent years. Studies have shown that liver injury caused by chronic stress is relevant to depression and neurotransmitter changes. It is essential to clarify the relationship between neurotransmitter changes and hepatic gene expression in depression. In this study, we used the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model combined with UHPLC-MS to explore the changes of neurotransmitters in serum and hippocampus and to decipher the differential gene expression in the liver by using the RNA-Seq combined with multivariate statistical analysis. Compared with the control group, the levels of neurotransmitters including 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), acetylcholine, glutamate (Glu), and dopamine (DA) in the hippocampus and 5-HT, norepinephrine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in serum were significantly changed in the CUMS rats. The results of liver transcriptomic analysis and correlation analysis showed that the Glu, DA, 5-HT, and GABA were impacted by 68 liver genes which were mainly enriched in three pathways including circadian rhythm, serotonergic synapse, and p53 signaling pathway. The expressive levels of clock genes and serotonergic synapse genes were validated by using q-PCR, and the diurnal rhythms of neurotransmitters were validated by in vivo hippocampus microdialysis. The CUMS stressors might cause phase advance of Glu and GABA by adjusting clock genes. The transcriptomic technique combined with correlation analysis and in vivo microdialysis could be used to discover comprehensive pathways of depression. It provides a new strategy for the rational assessment of the mechanism of disease.

AB  - Abnormal copper (Cu) levels are often closely associated with neurological disorders including neurodevelopmental conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the mechanisms underlying the disruption of Cu homeostasis in critical organs, such as the brain, remain unclear. In this study, we elucidated the molecular mechanisms of Cu imbalance in the brain of a valproic acid (VPA) mouse model along with the changes in specific metabolites. Significant alterations occurred in proteins associated with primary Cu-related metabolism in specific regions of the brain (prefrontal cortex, amygdala, cerebellum, and hippocampus), resulting in a direct elevation of Cu ions within the brain tissues (control: 5.05 +/- 0.61 mu g/g vs model: 6.28 +/- 0.81 mu g/g, p = 0.015). Furthermore, the brain metabolic profiles revealed significant upregulation of lipids, particularly phospholipid metabolites. Typical neurotransmitters, for example, dopamine (DA) (p < 0.0001) and serotonin (5-HT) (p = 0.02) were upregulated in amygdala. Other small metabolites like glutathione (GSH) (p = 0.0004) also exhibited notable variation in brain. The potential impact of Cu toxicity on the signaling pathways of key metabolites was then evaluated, providing new insights into the role of Cu in metabolism of neurotransmitters in the brain. Our finding sheds molecular aberrations associated with essential element metabolism in the brain, providing new elemental perspectives for understanding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ASD.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a drastic surge in neurological disorders with sporadic cases contributing more than ever to their cause. Radiation exposure through diagnostic or therapeutic routes often results in neurological injuries that may lead to neurodegenerative pathogenesis. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the neurological impact of exposure to near-low doses of ionizing radiation are not known. In particular, the neurological changes caused by metabolomic reprogramming have not yet to be elucidated. Hence, in the present study, C57BL/6 mice were exposed to a single whole-body X-ray dose of 0.5 Gy, and 14 days post-treatment, the hippocampus was subjected to metabolomic analysis. The hippocampus of the IR animals showed significant alterations in 15 metabolites, which aligned with altered tyrosine, phenylalanine, and alpha-linolenic acid metabolism and the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Furthermore, a multiomics interaction network comprising metabolomics and RNA sequencing data analysis provided insights into gene-metabolite interactions. Tyrosine metabolism was revealed to be the most altered, which was demonstrated by the interaction of several crucial genes and metabolites. The present study revealed the regulation of low-dose radiation-induced neurotoxicity at the metabolomic level and its implications for the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Present study provides novel insights into metabolomic pathways altered following near-low-dose IR exposure and its link with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

AB  - Reproduction: Protective protein readies uterus for pregnancy A protein known to regulate cell proliferation plays a key role in preparing a woman's uterus for pregnancy, a finding that could inform future treatments for female infertility. A team led by Zhan-Peng Yue and Bin Guo from Jilin University, Changchun, China, examined the role of a co-activator protein called TAZ in decidualization, the process in which the uterine lining changes hormonally and biochemically following ovulation. The researchers showed that TAZ levels build up in the mucosal lining of the uterus, where the protein works with various regulators of the cell cycle to promote the proliferation of connective tissue cells known as stromal cells, which support early embryonic development. The researchers demonstrated that in the face of oxidative stress TAZ helps orchestrate molecular detoxification mechanisms that protect these stromal cells from damage.
   TAZ, as a crucial effector of Hippo pathway, is required for spermatogenesis and fertilization, but little is known regarding its physiological function in uterine decidualization. In this study, we showed that TAZ was localized in the decidua, where it promoted stromal cell proliferation followed by accelerated G1/S phase transition via Ccnd3 and Cdk4 and induced the expression or activity of stromal differentiation markers Prl8a2, Prl3c1 and ALP, indicating the importance of TAZ in decidualization. Knockdown of TAZ impeded HB-EGF induction of stromal cell proliferation and differentiation. Under oxidative stress, TAZ protected stromal differentiation against oxidative damage by reducing intracellular ROS and enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity dependent on the Nrf2/ARE/Foxo1 pathway. TAZ strengthened the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 which directly bound to the antioxidant response element (ARE) of Foxo1 promoter region. Additionally, silencing TAZ caused accumulation of intracellular ROS through heightening NOX activity whose blockade by APO reversed the disruption in stromal differentiation. Further analysis revealed that TAZ might restore mitochondrial function, as indicated by the increase in ATP level, mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial membrane potential with the reduction in mitochondrial superoxide. Additionally, TAZ modulated the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes I and III whose suppression by ROT and AA resulted in the inability of TAZ to defend against oxidative damage to stromal differentiation. Moreover, TAZ prevented stromal cell apoptosis by upregulating Bcl2 expression and inhibiting Casp3 activity and Bax expression. In summary, TAZ might mediate HB-EGF function in uterine decidualization through Ccnd3 and ameliorate oxidative damage to stromal cell differentiation via Nrf2/ARE/Foxo1 pathway.

AB  - Understanding the computational mechanisms that underlie the encoding and decoding of environmental stimuli is a crucial investigation in neuroscience. Central to this pursuit is the exploration of how the brain represents visual information across its hierarchical architecture. A prominent challenge resides in discerning the neural underpinnings of the processing of dynamic natural visual scenes. Although considerable research efforts have been made to characterize individual components of the visual pathway, a systematic understanding of the distinctive neural coding associated with visual stimuli, as they traverse this hierarchical landscape, remains elusive. In this study, we leverage the comprehensive Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and utilize the capabilities of deep learning neural network models to study neural coding in response to dynamic natural visual scenes across an expansive array of brain regions. Our study reveals that our decoding model adeptly deciphers visual scenes from neural spiking patterns exhibited within each distinct brain area. A compelling observation arises from the comparative analysis of decoding performances, which manifests as a notable encoding proficiency within the visual cortex and subcortical nuclei, in contrast to a relatively reduced encoding activity within hippocampal neurons. Strikingly, our results unveil a robust correlation between our decoding metrics and well-established anatomical and functional hierarchy indexes. These findings corroborate existing knowledge in visual coding related to artificial visual stimuli and illuminate the functional role of these deeper brain regions using dynamic stimuli. Consequently, our results suggest a novel perspective on the utility of decoding neural network models as a metric for quantifying the encoding quality of dynamic natural visual scenes represented by neural responses, thereby advancing our comprehension of visual coding within the complex hierarchy of the brain.
   Understanding how the brain processes visual information is a crucial area of neuroscience research. One of the main challenges is studying how the brain handles dynamic natural visual scenes. Although there has been progress in studying parts of the visual pathway, we still do not fully understand how different areas of the brain work together to process these scenes. Here we used the comprehensive Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and advanced deep learning models to explore how the brain encodes and decodes visual information. We found that our model could accurately interpret visual scenes based on neural activity from various regions of the brain. Our findings show a strong link between our decoding results and established brain hierarchy indexes. This not only supports existing knowledge about visual coding but sheds light on the role of deeper brain regions in processing visual scenes. Our study suggests that decoding neural network models can be a valuable tool for understanding how the brain encodes visual information, providing new insights into the complex workings of the visual system in the brain.

AB  - Mounting evidence suggests that probiotics are beneficial for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms by which specific probiotics modify AD pathophysiology are not clearly understood. In this study, we investigated whether Lactobacillus paracasei-derived extracellular vesicles (Lpc-EV) can directly act on neuronal cells to modify amyloid-beta (A ss)-induced transcriptional changes and A ss pathology in the brains of Tg-APP/PS1 mice. Lpc-EV treatment in HT22 neuronal cells counteracts A ss-induced downregulation of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), Neurotrophin 3 (Nt3), Nt4/5, and TrkB receptor, and reverses A ss-induced altered expression of diverse nuclear factors, including the downregulation of Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2) and Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). Systematic siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments indicate that the upregulation of Bdnf, Nt3, Nt4/5, and TrkB by Lpc-EV is mediated via multiple epigenetic factors whose activation converges on Mecp2 and Sirt1. In addition, Lpc-EV reverses A ss-induced downregulation of the A ss-degrading proteases Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (Mmp-2), Mmp-9, and Neprilysin (Nep), whose upregulation is also controlled by MeCP2 and Sirt1. Lpc-EV treatment restores the downregulated expression of Bdnf, Nt4/5, TrkB, Mmp-2, Mmp-9, and Nep; induces the upregulation of MeCP2 and Sirt1 in the hippocampus; alleviates A ss accumulation and neuroinflammatory responses in the brain; and mitigates cognitive decline in Tg-APP/PS1 mice. These results suggest that Lpc-EV cargo contains a neuroactive component that upregulates the expression of neurotrophic factors and A ss-degrading proteases (Mmp-2, Mmp-9, and Nep) through the upregulation of MeCP2 and Sirt1, and ameliorates A ss pathology and cognitive deficits in Tg-APP/PS1 mice.

AB  - Theta-band oscillations (3-8 Hz) in the mammalian hippocampus organize the temporal structure of cortical inputs, resulting in a phase code that enables rhythmic input sampling for episodic memory formation and spatial navigation. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary pressures might have driven the selection of theta over higher-frequency bands that could potentially provide increased input sampling resolution. Here, we address this question by introducing a theoretical framework that combines the efficient coding and neural oscillatory sampling hypotheses, focusing on the information rate (bits/s) of phase coding neurons. We demonstrate that physiologically realistic noise levels create a trade-off between the speed of input sampling, determined by oscillation frequency, and encoding precision in rodent hippocampal neurons. This speed-precision trade-off results in a maximum information rate of similar to 1-2 bits/s within the theta frequency band, thus confining the optimal oscillation frequency to the low end of the spectrum. We also show that this framework accounts for key hippocampal features, such as the preservation of the theta band along the dorsoventral axis despite physiological gradients, and the modulation of theta frequency and amplitude by running speed. Extending the analysis beyond the hippocampus, we propose that theta oscillations could also support efficient stimulus encoding in the visual cortex and olfactory bulb. More broadly, our framework lays the foundation for studying how system features, such as noise, constrain the optimal sampling frequencies in both biological and artificial brains.

AB  - We propose the "runtime learning" hypothesis which states that people quickly learn to perform unfamiliar tasks as the tasks arise by using task-relevant instances of concepts stored in memory during mental training. To make learning rapid, the hypothesis claims that only a few class instances are used, but these instances are especially valuable for training. The paper motivates the hypothesis by describing related ideas from the cognitive science and machine learning literatures. Using computer simulation, we show that deep neural networks (DNNs) can learn effectively from small, curated training sets, and that valuable training items tend to lie toward the centers of data item clusters in an abstract feature space. In a series of three behavioral experiments, we show that people can also learn effectively from small, curated training sets. Critically, we find that participant reaction times and fitted drift rates are best accounted for by the confidences of DNNs trained on small datasets of highly valuable items. We conclude that the runtime learning hypothesis is a novel conjecture about the relationship between learning and memory with the potential for explaining a wide variety of cognitive phenomena.
   Human cognition is remarkably flexible, with the ability to reliably perform a wide variety of tasks, including idiosyncratic and unfamiliar ones, in a wide variety of contexts. However, despite impressive advances in machine learning, leading to artificial intelligences capable of outperforming humans on select individual tasks, this flexibility has yet to be replicated by computational models. Doing so is essential to both creating general artificial intelligence and to achieving a deeper understanding of the human brain and mind. To account for this vital property of human cognition, we introduce the "runtime learning hypothesis", in which the brain rapidly constructs task-specific models in response to the needs of the moment using an internal training process based on valuable exemplars of the relevant concepts. We examine the plausibility of this hypothesis using human behavioral experiments and machine-learning-based computational modeling. The results are consistent with the human brain using runtime learning to flexibly perform tasks.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of processing human ovarian tissue on follicle activation dynamics.
   Methods Fresh ovarian tissue was retrieved from 9 women undergoing laparoscopic surgery for benign conditions. Biopsies from each patient were divided into 3 fragments, the first of which was immediately fixed in the operating room (T0) and the second and third just after processing at 25 (T25) and (T90) 90 min. To evaluate follicle activation, markers of the PI3K and Hippo signaling pathways were immunolabeled at each time point, targeting phospho-Akt (p-Akt) by immunohistochemistry and yes-associated protein (YAP) cellular localization in the granulosa cell layer by immunofluorescence.
   Results Four hundred forty primordial follicles were evaluated for p-Akt and 420 for YAP. Significantly stronger p-Akt expression was observed at T25 (23.01 +/- 13.45%; p=0.04) and T90 (38.99 +/- 25.21%; p<0.001) than at T0 (2.72 +/- 3.35%). A significant nucleus- to-cytoplasm shift in YAP was detected at T25 (1.21 +/- 0.25; p=0.015 compared to T0 (0.95 +/- 0.09), while T90 (1.10 +/- 0.16) values were similar to T25.
   Conclusion Our data prove that ovarian tissue manipulation significantly impacts follicle dynamics by stimulating the PI3K and Hippo signaling pathways involved in primordial follicle activation. Further experimental evidence must nevertheless be gathered to understand and gain control of follicle activation mechanisms in non-physiological conditions (like ovarian tissue manipulation), in order to optimize fertility preservation and restoration strategies.

AB  - The hippocampus and some other brain regions are critically involved in synaptic plasticity. Electrophysiological recordings using extracellular field potentials (EFPs) reveal diverse synaptic activity within the hippocampus, including input/output functions (reflecting neural excitability), paired-pulse responses (reflecting short-term plasticity), and long-term potentiation (reflecting long-term plasticity). EFP techniques offer various measurable components for assessing multiple neural functions. These include fEPSP slope, amplitude, and area under curve (AUC), as well as latency (fEPSP onset or peak after stimulation), width at half amplitude, fiber volley, decay time, time-course (fEPSP rise and decay time constants; tau), initial slope/initial area and-/late area derived from a fEPSP waveform sample. Each of these parameters is separately evaluated and provides distinct electrophysiological interpretations. Despite the rich data offered by EFP techniques, many studies adopt a limited approach, focusing solely on fEPSP slope, amplitude, and occasionally AUC, thereby neglecting the potential insights provided by other parameters. Given the inherent variability of fEPSP components within a single recording and timeframe, a comprehensive analysis of synaptic activity within a specific hippocampal region is necessary for obtaining the full spectrum of fEPSP-related data. Researchers should consider the potential influence of additional factors contributing to the variability of synaptic activity magnitude. A detailed analysis considering different parts of extracellular fEPSP recordings and their properties is crucial for a deeper understanding of synaptic activity changes within the brain. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of diverse forms of hippocampal synaptic activity, measurable components of EFP recordings, and their corresponding interpretations.

AB  - Objective: To determine the differences in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection of patients based on sex and disease severity.Methods: We used an analytical framework of 382 transcriptional modules and multi-omics analyses to discriminate COVID-19 patients based on sex and disease severity.Results: Male and female patients overexpressed modules related to the innate immune response. The expression of modules related to the adaptive immune response showed lower enrichment levels in males than females. Inflammation modules showed ascending overexpression in male and female patients, while a higher level was observed in severe female patients. Moderate female patients demonstrated significant overexpression to interferon, cytolytic lymphocyte, T & B cells, and erythrocytes modules. Moderate female patients showed a higher adaptive immune response than males matched group. Pathways involved in metabolism dysregulation and Hippo signaling were upregulated in females than in male patients. Females and moderate cases showed higher levels of metabolic dysregulation.Conclusions: The immune landscape in COVID-19 patients was noticeably different between the sexes, and these differences may highlight disease vulnerability in males. This study suggested that certain treatments that increase or decrease the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 might be necessary for male and female patients at certain disease stages.

AB  - C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) can induce a strong inflammatory response to an injury. Targeting C5aR1 has emerged as a novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic method. However, the role of C5aR1 in cerebral ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury and the definitive mechanism have not been elucidated clearly. Here, we determined whether C5aR1 signaling was essential to the post-ischemic inflammation and brain injury and whether it is a valid target for therapeutic blockade by using soluble receptor antagonist PMX53 in the early stage after I/R injury. In an in vitro model (oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion, OGD/R) and in vivo model (middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion, MCAO/R) of I/R, the neuronal cells of rats showed significantly up-regulated gene expression of C5aR1, and a notable inflammatory response was demonstrated with elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin1 beta (IL-1 beta), and IL-6. Inhibition of C5aR1 by PMX53 treatment significantly reduced cell injury and inflammation and promoted brain function recovery. Further mechanism studies showed that inhibiting C5aR1 by PMX53 protected the rats from MCAO/R injury, decreased cell inflammation, and apoptosis via inhibiting the TLR4 and NF-kappa B signaling pathway and reducing the production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 in MCAO/R rats. In addition, manipulation of the C5aR1 gene expression in vitro displayed that the inflammatory cascade signals including TLR4, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 were coincidently regulated with the regulation of C5aR1 expression levels. Thus, our results demonstrated a pathogenic role for C5aR1 in the progression of brain injury and inflammation response following I/R injury. Our study clearly demonstrated that C5aR1 inhibition might be an effective treatment strategy for ischemic stroke.

AB  - MicroRNAs are key players in gene regulatory networks controlling cell homeostasis. Their altered expression has been previously linked to disease outcomes and microRNAs thus serve as biomarkers for disease diagnostics. However, their synthesis and its transcriptional regulation have been challenging to investigate. In this study, we validated the use of H3K36me3 histone modification for the quantification of microRNA transcription levels using data from the ENCODE Consortium and then applied this approach to provide new insight into the cell-type-specific regulation in tissues, cell line models and cardiac disease. In cardiomyocytes derived from patients suffering from septal defects, carrying a G296S mutation in the transcription factor GATA4, we show that microRNA gene transcription is altered in cardiomyocytes carrying this mutation and coincides with novel super-enhancers formed within regulatory domains defined using chromatin interaction profiles. The most prominently elevated primary transcript encodes for let-7a and miR-100 that may target genes in the Hippo signaling pathway. Collectively, our work presents a methodology to quantify microRNA gene expression using histone marker data and paves the way for functional studies of cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation occurring in disease pathology.

AB  - Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability and autism, is caused by the transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene, which encodes the fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein (FMRP). FMRP interacts with numerous brain mRNAs that are involved in synaptic plasticity and implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Our published studies indicate that single-source, soy-based diets are associated with increased seizures and autism. Thus, there is an acute need for an unbiased protein marker identification in FXS in response to soy consumption. Herein, we present a spatial proteomics approach integrating mass spectrometry imaging with label-free proteomics in the FXS mouse model to map the spatial distribution and quantify levels of proteins in the hippocampus and hypothalamus brain regions. In total, 1250 unique peptides were spatially resolved, demonstrating the diverse array of peptidomes present in the tissue slices and the broad coverage of the strategy. A group of proteins that are known to be involved in glycolysis, synaptic transmission, and coexpression network analysis suggest a significant association between soy proteins and metabolic and synaptic processes in the Fmr1(KO) brain. Ultimately, this spatial proteomics work represents a crucial step toward identifying potential candidate protein markers and novel therapeutic targets for FXS.

AB  - Mitophagy induction upon mitochondrial stress is critical for maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and cellular function. Here, we found that Mst1/2 (Stk3/4), key regulators of the Hippo pathway, are required for the induction of mitophagy under various mitochondrial stress conditions. Knockdown of Mst1/2 or pharmacological inhibition by XMU-MP-1 treatment led to impaired mitophagy induction upon CCCP and DFP treatment. Mechanistically, Mst1/2 induces mitophagy independently of the PINK1-Parkin pathway and the canonical Hippo pathway. Moreover, our results suggest the essential involvement of BNIP3 in Mst1/2-mediated mitophagy induction upon mitochondrial stress. Notably, Mst1/2 knockdown diminishes mitophagy induction, exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction, and reduces cellular survival upon neurotoxic stress in both SH-SY5Y cells and Drosophila models. Conversely, Mst1 and Mst2 expression enhances mitophagy induction and cell survival. In addition, AAV-mediated Mst1 expression reduced the loss of TH-positive neurons, ameliorated behavioral deficits, and improved mitochondrial function in an MPTP-induced Parkinson's disease mouse model. Our findings reveal the Mst1/2-BNIP3 regulatory axis as a novel mediator of mitophagy induction under conditions of mitochondrial stress and suggest that Mst1/2 play a pivotal role in maintaining mitochondrial function and neuronal viability in response to neurotoxic treatment.
   Mitochondria, the energy producers of cells, are vital for cell function and energy balance. But, when stressed, they can malfunction and contribute to brain diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. This study found that two proteins, Mst1/2, are important for triggering mitophagy-a process that removes damaged mitochondria, in response to different mitochondrial stresses. The researchers found that Mst1/2 control this process through their kinase activity-a type of protein modification, and the stabilization of another protein, BNIP3. They also discovered that Mst1/2 are key in maintaining mitochondrial health and cell survival under conditions harmful to neurons. This research, led by Dr. Jeanho Yun and team, suggests that targeting the Mst1/2 pathway could improve mitochondrial health and protect against brain diseases.This summary was initially drafted using artificial intelligence, then revised and fact-checked by the author.

AB  - Hundreds of proteins determine the function of synapses, and synapses define the neuronal circuits that subserve myriad brain, cognitive, and behavioral functions. It is thus necessary to precisely manipulate specific proteins at specific sub-cellular locations and times to elucidate the roles of particular proteins and synapses in brain function. We developed PHOtochemically TArgeting Chimeras (PHOTACs) as a strategy to optically degrade specific proteins with high spatial and temporal precision. PHOTACs are small molecules that, upon wavelength-selective illumination, catalyze ubiquitylation and degradation of target proteins through endogenous proteasomes. Here, we describe the design and chemical properties of a PHOTAC that targets Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKII alpha), which is abundant and crucial for the baseline synaptic function of excitatory neurons. We validate the PHOTAC strategy, showing that the CaMKII alpha-PHOTAC is effective in mouse brain tissue. Light activation of CaMKII alpha-PHOTAC removed CaMKII alpha from regions of the mouse hippocampus only within 25 mu m of the illuminated brain surface. The optically controlled degradation decreases synaptic function within minutes of light activation, measured by the light-initiated attenuation of evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) responses to physiological stimulation. The PHOTACs methodology should be broadly applicable to other key proteins implicated in synaptic function, especially for evaluating their precise roles in the maintenance of long-term potentiation and memory within subcellular dendritic domains.

AB  - Cathepsin B has been shown to contribute to deficits in traumatic brain injury (TBI), an important risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cathepsin B is elevated in TBI and AD patients, as well as in animal models of these conditions. Knockout of the cathepsin B gene results in amelioration of TBI-induced motor dysfunction and improvement of AD memory deficit in mice. The mechanism of cathepsin B pathogenesis in these brain disorders has been hypothesized to involve its translocation to the cytosol from its normal lysosomal location. This study, therefore, evaluated brain cytosolic cathepsin B activity in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) mouse model of TBI. CCI-TBI resulted in motor deficits demonstrated by the rotarod assay, brain tissue lesions, and disorganization of the hippocampus. Significantly, CCI-TBI increased cytosolic cathepsin B activity in the brain cortex in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere that received the CCI-TBI injury, with a concomitant decrease in the lysosomal fraction. Cathepsin B activity was monitored using the substrate Z-Nle-Lys-Arg-AMC which specifically detects cathepsin B activity but not other cysteine proteases. The normal lysosomal distribution of cathepsin B was observed by its discrete localization in brain cortical cells. CCI-TBI resulted in a more diffuse cellular distribution of cathepsin B consistent with translocation to the cytosol. Further studies utilized the novel neutral pH-selective inhibitor, Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK, that specifically inhibits cathepsin B at neutral pH 7.2 of the cytosol but not at acidic pH 4.6 of lysosomes. Daily administration of Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK (ip), beginning 1 day before CCI-TBI, resulted in the reduction of the increased cytosolic cathepsin B activity induced by CCI-TBI. The inhibitor also reduced cathepsin B activities in homogenates of the brain cortex and hippocampus which were increased by CCI-TBI. Furthermore, the Z-Arg-Lys-AOMK inhibitor resulted in the reduction of motor function deficit resulting from CCI-TBI. These findings demonstrate the activation of cytosolic cathepsin B activity in CCI-TBI mouse brain injury.

AB  - Brain iron content is widely reported to increase during "ageing", across multiple species from nematodes, rodents (mice and rats) and humans. Given the redox-active properties of iron, there has been a large research focus on iron-mediated oxidative stress as a contributor to tissue damage during natural ageing, and also as a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. Surprisingly, however, the majority of published studies have not investigated brain iron homeostasis during the biological time period of senescence, and thus knowledge of how brain homeostasis changes during this critical stage of life largely remains unknown. This commentary examines the literature published on the topic of brain iron homeostasis during ageing, providing a critique on limitations of currently used experimental designs. The commentary also aims to highlight that although much research attention has been given to iron accumulation or iron overload as a pathological feature of ageing, there is evidence to support functional iron deficiency may exist, and this should not be overlooked in studies of ageing or neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Understanding the molecular changes associated with the aged brain forms the basis for developing potential strategies for slowing cognitive decline associated with normal aging. Focusing on the hippocampus, a critical brain region involved in learning and memory, we employed tandem mass tag methodology to investigate global proteomic changes that occur in advanced-aged (20-month) versus young (3-month) C57BL/6 male mice. Our analysis revealed the upregulation of 236 proteins in the old hippocampal proteome, including those enriched within several age-related processes, such as the adaptive immune response and molecular metabolic pathways, whereas downregulated proteins (88 in total) are mainly involved in axonogenesis and growth cone-related processes. Categorizing proteins by cell-type enrichment in the brain identified a general upregulation of proteins preferentially expressed in microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. In contrast, proteins with neuron-specific expression displayed an overall age-related downregulation. By integrating our proteomic with our previously published transcriptomic data, we discovered a mild but significant positive correlation between mRNA and protein expression changes in the aged hippocampus. Therefore, this proteomic data is a valuable additional resource for further understanding age-related molecular mechanisms.

AB  - Introduction Numerous clinical data and animal models demonstrate that many patients with neuropathic pain suffer from concomitant depressive symptoms.Methods Massive evidence from biological experiments has verified that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and other brain regions play an influential role in the co-morbidity of neuropathic pain and depression, but the mechanism by which neuropathic pain induces depression remains unclear.Results In this study, we mined existing publicly available databases of high-throughput sequencing data intending to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the process of neuropathic pain-induced depression.Conclusion This study provides a rudimentary exploration of the mechanism of neuropathic pain-induced depression and provides credible evidence for its management and precaution.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is among the most valuable commercial crops being a non-alcoholic beverage having antioxidant properties. Like in other plants, circadian oscillator in tea modulates several biological processes according to earth's revolution dependent variations in environmental cues like light and temperature. In the present study, we report genome wide identification and characterization of circadian oscillator (CO) proteins in tea. We first mined the genes (24, in total) involved in circadian rhythm pathway in the 56 plant species having available genomic information and then built their hidden Markov models (HMMs). Using these HMMs, 24 proteins were identified in tea and were further assessed for their functional annotation. Expression analysis of all these 24 CO proteins was then performed in 3 abiotic (A) and 3 biotic conditions (B) stress conditions and co-expressed as well as differentially expressed genes in the selected 6 stress conditions were elaborated. A methodology to identify the differentially expressed genes in specific types of stresses (A or B) is proposed and novel markers among CO proteins are presented. By mapping the identified CO proteins against the recently reported genome wide interologous protein-protein interaction network of tea (TeaGPIN), an interaction sub-network of tea CO proteins (TeaCO-PIN) is developed and analysed. Out of 24 CO proteins, structures of 4 proteins could be successfully predicted and validated using consensus of three structure prediction algorithms and their stability was further assessed using molecular dynamic simulations at 100 ns. Phylogenetic analysis of these proteins is performed to examine their molecular evolution.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway is a kinase cascade that plays an important role in organ size control. As the main effectors of the Hippo pathway, transcription coactivators Yap1/Wwtr1 are regulated by the upstream kinase Stk3. Recent studies in mammals have implicated the Hippo pathway in kidney development and kidney diseases. To further illustrate its roles in vertebrate kidney, we generated a series of zebrafish mutants targeting stk3, yap1 and wwtr1 genes. The stk3(-)(/-) mutant exhibited edema, formation of glomerular cysts and pronephric tubule dilation during the larval stage. Interestingly, disruption of wwtr1, but not yap1, significantly alleviated the renal phenotypes of the stk3(-/-) mutant, and overexpression of Wwtr1 with the CMV promoter also induced pronephric phenotypes, similar to those of the stk3(-/- )mutant, during larval stage. Notably, adult fish with Wwtr1 overexpression developed phenotypes similar to those of human polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Overall, our analyses revealed roles of Stk3 and Wwtr1 in renal cyst formation. Using a pharmacological approach, we further demonstrated that Stk3-deficient zebrafish could serve as a PKD model for drug development.

AB  - Bottom-up models of functionally relevant patterns of neural activity provide an explicit link between neuronal dynamics and computation. A prime example of functional activity patterns are propagating bursts of place-cell activities called hippocampal replay, which is critical for memory consolidation. The sudden and repeated occurrences of these burst states during ongoing neural activity suggest metastable neural circuit dynamics. As metastability has been attributed to noise and/or slow fatigue mechanisms, we propose a concise mesoscopic model which accounts for both. Crucially, our model is bottom-up: it is analytically derived from the dynamics of finite-size networks of Linear-Nonlinear Poisson neurons with short-term synaptic depression. As such, noise is explicitly linked to stochastic spiking and network size, and fatigue is explicitly linked to synaptic dynamics. To derive the mesoscopic model, we first consider a homogeneous spiking neural network and follow the temporal coarse-graining approach of Gillespie to obtain a "chemical Langevin equation", which can be naturally interpreted as a stochastic neural mass model. The Langevin equation is computationally inexpensive to simulate and enables a thorough study of metastable dynamics in classical setups (population spikes and Up-Down-states dynamics) by means of phase-plane analysis. An extension of the Langevin equation for small network sizes is also presented. The stochastic neural mass model constitutes the basic component of our mesoscopic model for replay. We show that the mesoscopic model faithfully captures the statistical structure of individual replayed trajectories in microscopic simulations and in previously reported experimental data. Moreover, compared to the deterministic Romani-Tsodyks model of place-cell dynamics, it exhibits a higher level of variability regarding order, direction and timing of replayed trajectories, which seems biologically more plausible and could be functionally desirable. This variability is the product of a new dynamical regime where metastability emerges from a complex interplay between finite-size fluctuations and local fatigue.
   Author summary
   Cortical and hippocampal areas of rodents and monkeys often exhibit neural activities that are best described by sequences of re-occurring firing-rate patterns, so-called metastable states. Metastable neural population dynamics has been implicated in important sensory and cognitive functions such as neural coding, attention, expectation and decision-making. An intriguing example is hippocampal replay, i.e. short activity waves across place cells during sleep or rest which represent previous animal trajectories and are thought to be critical for memory consolidation. However, a mechanistic understanding of metastable dynamics in terms of neural circuit parameters such as network size and synaptic properties is largely missing. We derive a simple stochastic population model at the mesoscopic scale from an underlying biological neural network with dynamic synapses at the microscopic scale. This "bottom-up" derivation provides a unique link between emergent population dynamics and neural circuit parameters, thus enabling a systematic analysis of how metastability depends on neuron numbers as well as neuronal and synaptic parameters. Using the mesoscopic model, we discover a novel dynamical regime, where replay events are triggered by fluctuations in finite-size neural networks. This fluctuation-driven regime predicts a high level of variability in the occurrence of replay events that could be tested experimentally.

AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that the metabolic hormone, leptin markedly influences the functioning of the hippocampus. In particular, exposure to leptin results in persistent changes in synaptic efficacy at both temporoammonic (TA) and Schaffer Collateral (SC) inputs to hippocampal CA1 neurons. The ability of leptin to regulate TA-CA1 and SC-CA1 synapses has important functional implications, as both synaptic connections play important roles in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Here we review the modulatory actions of the hormone leptin at these hippocampal CA1 synapses and explore the impact on learning and memory processes.

AB  - Drosophila models for tumorigenesis have revealed conserved mechanisms of signaling involved in mammalian cancer. Many of these models use highly mitotically active Drosophila tissues. Few Drosophila tumorigenesis models use adult tissues, when most cells are terminally differentiated and postmitotic. The Drosophila accessory glands are prostate-like tissues, and a model for prostate tumorigenesis using this tissue has been explored. In this prior model, oncogenic signaling was induced during the proliferative stages of accessory gland development, raising the question of how oncogenic activity impacts the terminally differentiated, postmitotic adult tissue. Here, we show that oncogenic signaling in the adult Drosophila accessory gland leads to activation of a conserved pro-tumorigenic program, similar to that of mitotic tissues, but in the absence of proliferation. In our experiments, oncogenic signaling in the adult gland led to tissue hypertrophy with nuclear anaplasia, in part through endoreduplication. Oncogene-induced gene expression changes in the adult Drosophila prostate-like model overlapped with those in polyploid prostate cancer cells after chemotherapy, which potentially mediate tumor recurrence. Thus, the adult accessory glands provide a useful model for aspects of prostate cancer progression that lack cellular proliferation.

AB  - We contrast two computational models of sequence learning. The associative learner posits that learning proceeds by strengthening existing association weights. Alternatively, recoding posits that learning creates new and more efficient representations of the learned sequences. Importantly, both models propose that humans act as optimal learners but capture different statistics of the stimuli in their internal model. Furthermore, these models make dissociable predictions as to how learning changes the neural representation of sequences. We tested these predictions by using fMRI to extract neural activity patters from the dorsal visual processing stream during a sequence recall task. We observed that only the recoding account can explain the similarity of neural activity patterns, suggesting that participants recode the learned sequences using chunks. We show that associative learning can theoretically store only very limited number of overlapping sequences, such as common in ecological working memory tasks, and hence an efficient learner should recode initial sequence representations.
   Author summary The ability to remember multiple individual events as a sequence is necessary for most complex human tasks. There is clear evidence that human sequence learning is accompanied by change in the way sequences are represented in the brain but the exact nature of the change remains unclear. In this study we use brain imaging to ask what is the neural mechanism underpinning sequence learning: we contrast two computational models of learning-associative and recoding-and test their predictions with neural activity data from the dorsal visual processing stream. We provide evidence that, instead of strengthening the initial cortical representations of sequences, learning proceeds by recoding the initial stimuli using a different set of codes. Furthermore, we show that associative learning without recoding is not theoretically capable of supporting long-term memory of short ecological sequences present in every day tasks such as reading, speaking, or navigating.

AB  - As the main inhibitory neurotransmission system, the GABAergic system poses an interesting yet underutilized target for molecular brain imaging. While PET imaging of postsynaptic GABAergic neurons has been accomplished using radiolabeled benzodiazepines targeting the GABAA receptor, the development of presynaptic radioligands targeting GABA transporter 1 (GAT1) has been unsuccessful thus far. Therefore, we developed a novel GAT1-addressing radioligand and investigated its applicability as a PET tracer in rodents. We selected a lipophilic nipecotic acid scaffold that is known to bind selectively to GAT1 as the basis for our radioligand. To obtain the desired candidate radiotracer [ 18 F]4, ester-protected radioligands [ 18 F]11a-b were synthesized through aliphatic nucleophilic radiofluorination of the respective bromo-precursors, after which chemical deprotection was attempted using various conditions. Because these deprotections were unsuccessful, it was evaluated whether the ethyl ester [ 18 F]11a could function as a prodrug and afford the active radioligand [ 18 F]4 after in vivo ester hydrolysis by esterases. Unfortunately, PET imaging studies in a rat model using [ 18 F]11a showed no brain uptake of the radiotracer. Instead, significant uptake of radioactivity was observed in the liver and bones, the latter being caused by radiodefluorination of the PET tracer. Since the PET tracer developed in this study was found to be unstable, further efforts should investigate the development of a more stable GAT1-addressing PET tracer without the potential labile benzyl fluoride moiety. Moreover, as the still intact fraction of the radiotracer did not cross the BBB, options other than the prodrug approach should be considered to increase the BBB permeability of future GAT1 radioligands.

AB  - The Arabidopsis Serine/Threonine Kinase 1 (SIK1) is a Sterile 20 (STE20)/Hippo orthologue that is also categorized as a Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinase Kinase (MAP4K). Like its animal and fungi orthologues, SIK1 is required for cell cycle exit, cell expansion, polarity establishment, as well as pathogenic response. The catalytic activity of SIK1, like other MAPKs, is presumably regulated by its phosphorylation states. Since no crystal structure for SIK1 has been reported yet, we built structural models for SIK1 kinase domain in different phosphorylation states with different pocket conformation to see how this kinase may be regulated. Using computational structural biology methods, we outlined a conduction path in which a phosphorylation site on the A-loop regulates the catalytic activity of SIK1 by controlling the closing or opening of the catalytic pocket at the G-loop. Furthermore, with analyses on the dynamic motions and in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that three key residues in this conduction path, Lys278, Glu295, and Arg370, are indeed important for the kinase activity of SIK1. Since these residues are conserved in all STE20 kinases examined, the regulatory mechanism that we discovered may be common in STE20 kinases. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Transfer RNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) - categorized as tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs), tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tiRNAs) and internal tRF (itRF) - are small non-coding RNAs that participate in various cellular processes such as translation inhibition and responses to cellular stress. We here identified tsRNA profiles within susceptible tissues in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) to pinpoint disease-specific tsRNAs and those shared across neurodegenerative diseases. We performed small RNA sequencing in the SOD1(G93A) and TDP43(A315T) mouse models of ALS (spinal cord), the Tau(P301S) model of FTD (hippocampus), and the parkin/POLG model of PD (substantia nigra). Bioinformatic analysis showed higher expression of 5 ' tiRNAs selectively in the two ALS models, lower expression of 3 ' tRFs in both the ALS and FTD mouse models, and lower expression of itRF Arg in the PD model. Experimental validation confirmed the expression of tsRNAs. Gene Ontology analysis of targets associated with validated 3 ' tRFs indicated functions in the regulation of synaptic and neuronal pathways. Our profiling of tsRNAs indicates disease-specific fingerprints in animal models of neurodegeneration, which require validation in human disease.

AB  - Estrogen-deficient postmenopausal women have oxidative stress-mediated suppression of endothelial function that is exacerbated by high blood pressure. Previous research suggests blueberries may improve endothelial function through reductions in oxidative stress, while also exerting other cardiovascular benefits. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of blueberries to improve endothelial function and blood pressure in postmenopausal women with above-normal blood pressure, and to identify potential mechanisms for improvements in endothelial function. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm clinical trial was performed, where postmenopausal women aged 45-65 years with elevated blood pressure or stage 1-hypertension (total n = 43, endothelial function n = 32) consumed 22 g day(-1) of freeze-dried highbush blueberry powder or placebo powder for 12 weeks. Endothelial function was assessed at baseline and 12 weeks through ultrasound measurement of brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) normalized to shear rate area under the curve (FMD/SRAUC) before and after intravenous infusion of a supraphysiologic dose of ascorbic acid to evaluate whether FMD improvements were mediated by reduced oxidative stress. Hemodynamics, arterial stiffness, cardiometabolic blood biomarkers, and plasma (poly)phenol metabolites were assessed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and venous endothelial cell protein expression was assessed at baseline and 12 weeks. Absolute FMD/SRAUC was 96% higher following blueberry consumption compared to baseline (p < 0.05) but unchanged in the placebo group (p > 0.05), and changes from baseline to 12 weeks were greater in the blueberry group than placebo (+1.09 x 10(-4) +/- 4.12 x 10(-5)vs. +3.82 x 10(-6) +/- 1.59 x 10(-5), p < 0.03, respectively). The FMD/SRAUC response to ascorbic acid infusion was lower (p < 0.05) at 12 weeks compared to baseline in the blueberry group with no change in the placebo group (p > 0.05). The sum of plasma (poly)phenol metabolites increased at 4, 8, and 12 weeks in the blueberry group compared to baseline, and were higher than the placebo group (all p < 0.05). Increases in several plasma flavonoid and microbial metabolites were also noted. No major differences were found for blood pressure, arterial stiffness, blood biomarkers, or endothelial cell protein expression following blueberry consumption. These findings suggest daily consumption of freeze-dried blueberry powder for 12 weeks improves endothelial function through reduced oxidative stress in postmenopausal women with above-normal blood pressure. The clinical trial registry number is NCT03370991 (https://clinicaltrials.gov)

AB  - The control of the camel tick, Hyalomma dromedarii is very crucial. This study evaluated the novel toxicity of photosensitizers and Phoxim insecticide against H. dromedarii males using the adult immersion tests. Ticks were subjected to sunlight for 10 min post-treatment (PT). The optical characters of the applied materials were determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy (250-900 nm wavelengths). The intensity of spectra decreased as dye concentration decreased. The optical bandgap energies of the dyes at different concentrations were not changed as the concentration changed and decreased as the absorption peak of individual dyes red-shifted. The mortalities 72 h PT reached 42.2%, 44.4%, 51.1%, 71.1%, 46.7%, 48.9%, 44.4%, and 55.6% for chlorophyllin, echinochrome, field stain, methylene blue, phthalocyanine, rhodamine 6G, riboflavin, and safranin, respectively. Methylene blue recorded the highest median lethal concentration (LC50 = 127 ppm) followed by safranin, field stain, rhodamine 6G, phthalocyanine, echinochrome riboflavin, and chlorophyllin (LC50 = 209, 251, 271, 303, 324, 332, and 362 ppm, respectively, 72 h PT). Their median lethal time, LT50, values PT with 240 ppm were 45, 87, 96, 72, 129, 115, 131, and 137 h, respectively. The relative toxicities of the LC50 values 72 h PT showed that chlorophyllin, echinochrome, field stain, methylene blue, phthalocyanine, rhodamine 6G, riboflavin, and safranin were 3.2, 3.6, 4.6, 9.1, 3.8, 4.3, 3.5, and 5.6 times, respectively, more effective than Phoxim. Methylene blue, safranin, and field stain showed a broad absorbance area indicating a large photoactivity and better phototoxicity and could be used as alternative agents to synthetic acaricides.

AB  - BackgroundSubcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is a common subtype of vascular dementia. Currently, the bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) mouse model is the most suitable SIVD rodent model. In this study, we investigated the functional and structural impairments in the hippocampus 1 month after BCAS.MethodsWe used behavioral tests, laser speckle flowmetry, long-term potentiation, histochemical staining, molecular experiments, and voxel-based morphometry to evaluate the hippocampal impairments.ResultsBehavioral studies revealed that BCAS mice exhibited worse performance. Laser speckle flowmetry detected an obvious decrease in cerebral blood flow. The synaptic plasticity of the perforant path-dentate gyrus pathway was inhibited. Decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity were detected in the hippocampus via diffusion tensor imaging data. A reduction in gray matter volume, which was most prominent in the hippocampus and its surrounding areas, was detected via voxel-based morphometry analysis. Impairments in cell morphology and myelin integrity were validated using histochemical staining and molecular biology techniques. In addition, the numbers of GFAP+ astrocytes and Iba1+ microglia increased in the hippocampus.ConclusionsOverall, our study demonstrates early functional and structural impairments in the hippocampus contributing to learning and memory deficits after 1 month of BCAS, indicating that the hippocampus is vulnerable to chronic cerebral ischemia.

AB  - Background: The oligometastatic disease has been proposed as an intermediate state between primary tumor and systemically metastatic disease, which has great potential curable with locoregional therapies. However, since no biomarker for the identification of patients with true oligometastatic disease is clinically available, the diagnosis of oligometastatic disease remains controversial.Objective: We aim to identify potential biomarkers of colorectal cancer patients with true oligometastatic states, who will benefit most from local therapy.Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed the transcriptome profiles and clinical parameters of 307 metastatic colorectal cancer patients. A novel network propagation method and network-based strategy were combined to identify oligometastatic biomarkers to predict the prognoses of metastatic colorectal cancer patients.Results: We defined two metastatic risk groups according to twelve oligometastatic biomarkers, which exhibit distinct prognoses, clinicopathological features, immunological characteristics, and biological mechanisms. The metastatic risk assessment model exhibited a more powerful capacity for survival prediction compared to traditional clinicopathological features. The low-MRS group was most consistent with an oligometastatic state, while the high-MRS might be a potential polymetastatic state, which leads to the divergence of their prognostic outcomes and response to treatments. We also identified 22 significant immune check genes between the high-MRS and low-MRS groups. The difference in molecular mechanism between the two metastatic risk groups was associated with focal adhesion, nucleocytoplasmic transport, Hippo, PI3K-Akt, TGF-beta, and EMC-receptor interaction signaling pathways.Conclusion: Our study provided a molecular definition of the oligometastatic state in colorectal cancer, which contributes to precise treatment decision-making for advanced patients.

AB  - Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and oxidativestress lead to protein misfolding, and the resulting accumulation ofprotein aggregates is often associated with the pathogenesis ofneurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkin-son's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion disease. Smallmolecules preventing these pathogenic processes may be effectiveinterventions for such neurodegenerative disorders. In this paper,we identify several novel oxindole compounds that can prevent ERstress- and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Among them,derivatives of the lead compound GIF-0726-r in which a hydrogenatom at the oxindole ring 5 position is substituted with a methyl(GIF-0852-r), bromine (GIF-0854-r), or nitro (GIF-0856-r) grouppotently suppressed global ER stress. Furthermore, GIF-0854-r and-0856-r prevented protein aggregate accumulationin vitroand in cultured hippocampal HT22 neuronal cells, indicating that thesetwo compounds function effectively as chemical chaperones. In addition, GIF-0852-r, -0854-r, and -0856-r prevented glutamate-induced oxytosis and erastin-induced ferroptosis. Collectively, these results suggest that the novel oxindole compounds GIF-0854-rand -0856-r may be useful therapeutics against protein-misfolding diseases as well as valuable research tools for studying themolecular mechanisms of ER and oxidative stress

AB  - The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is primarily involved in the formation of contextual fear-conditioned (CxFC) memory. However, CxFC memory can be formed even in the absence of the DH. In addition to the DH, the infralimbic cortex (IL), a sub-region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), also plays an important role in the consolidation of CxFC memory. However, role of IL in the development of compensatory CxFC memory is not known. Here, we have examined (a) the development of the compensatory circuitry of CxFC memory within 3 days after the first test in the absence of the DH and (b) the role of IL in the induction of compensatory CxFC memory in the absence of the DH. The DH-lesioned rats re-trained for CxFC 1 day after the first testing exhibited significantly less freezing compared to the control group. However, the DH-lesioned rats, re-trained for CxFC 3 days after the first testing, showed a robust freezing response. It suggests that the fully functional compensatory circuitry of contextual fear memory develops after multiple training separated by 3 days. Furthermore, we observed that reversible inactivation of the IL of the DH-lesioned rats during the first training waned the formation of compensatory CxFC. It suggests that (a) the IL receives contextual fear memory information during the first trial in the absence of the DH and (b) perturbation in fear memory information encoding in the IL during the first trial impairs the development of the compensatory network in the absence of the DH.

AB  - The current production of recombinant insulin via fermenter-based platforms (Escherichia coli and yeast) could not fulfill its fast-growing commercial demands, thus leading to a great interest in its sustainable large-scale production at low cost using a plant-based system. In the present study, Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated nuclear stable genetic transformation of an industrial oilseed crop, Camelina sativa, to express pro-insulin (with three furin endoprotease cleavage sites) fused with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) in their seeds was successfully achieved for the first time. The bar gene was used as a selectable marker for selecting transformants and producing herbicide-resistant camelina plants. The transformation process involved the infiltration of camelina inflorescences (at flower buds with partially opened flowers) with A. tumefaciens and harvesting the seeds (T-0) at maturity. The T-0 seeds were raised into the putative T-1 plants sprayed with Basta herbicide (0.03%, v/v), and the survived green transformed plants tested positive for pro-insulin and bar genes. A transformation frequency of 6.96% was obtained. The integration and copy number of the pro-insulin transgene and its expression at RNA and protein levels were confirmed in T-1 plants using Southern hybridization, semi-quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (sqPCR), and quantitative real-time Time PCR (qPCR) and western blot analysis, respectively. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) quantified the amount of expressed pro-insulin protein, and its anti-diabetic efficacy was validated in diabetic rats on oral feeding. Transgenic plants integrated the pro-insulin gene into their genomes and produced a maximum of 197 mu g/100 mg of pro-insulin (0.804% of TSP) that had anti-diabetic efficacy in rats.

AB  - Orexin (hypocretin) is secreted from the perifornical/lateral hypothalamus and is well known for sleep regulation. Orexin has two, orexin A and B, transcripts and two receptors, type 1 and 2 (OX1R and OX2R), located in the plasma membrane of neurons in different brain areas, including the hippocampus involved in learning, memory, seizures, and epilepsy, as physiologic and pathologic phenomena. OX1R is expressed in the dentate gyrus and CA1 and the OX2R in the CA3 areas. Orexin enhances learning and memory as well as reward, stress, seizures, and epilepsy, partly through OX1Rs, while either aggravating or alleviating those phenomena via OX2Rs. OX1Rs activation induces long-term changes of synaptic responses in the hippocampus, an age and concentration-dependent manner. Briefly, we will review the localization and functions of hippocampal orexin receptors, their role in learning, memory, stress, reward, seizures, epilepsy, and hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are considered essential mediators of regenerative roles of autologous platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP) and platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich gel (PVRG). PVRP and PVRG are novel blood-derived products gaining attraction in regenerative medicine. However, despite their reported good efficacy, their preparation protocols are too time-consuming. Moreover, patient-tailored preparation protocols are desired to optimize platelet and EV count in PVRP and PVRG. This article presents the clinical implementation of one-step, patient-tailored erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)-based, PVRP and PVRG preparation protocols through the presentation of three cases: (1) large chronic tympanic membrane (TM) perforation, (2) osteoradionecrosis of the lateral skull base, and (3) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak in the sphenoid sinus. These were treated with PVRP and PVRG, prepared according to our preclinically constructed mathematical sedimentation model of cells and EVs based on the patient's ESR. (1) TM healed completely after the treatment with 3.6 mL of PVRP and PVRG (high platelet and EV protocol). The speech discrimination score and air conduction pure tone average improved from 75% to 95% and from 65 to 25 dB, respectively. (2) The osteoradionecrotic surface area decreased from 46 to 18 cm(2), and infection was eradicated after six applications of 13-65 mL of PVRG ("half-volume" protocol). (3) No CSF leak recurrence was detected after surgical closure with 30 mL of PVRG postoperatively. Reproducible preparation protocols proved effective, safe, fast, and straightforward enough for the surgical staff to prepare PVRP and PVRG intraoperatively. To alleviate preparation, a calculator is provided. This pilot study presents a sound basis for further studies, which are needed to assess the therapeutic effect of PVRP and PVRG.

AB  - A hallmark of biological and artificial neural networks is that neurons tile the range of continuous sensory inputs and intrinsic variables with overlapping responses. It is characteristic for the underlying recurrent connectivity in the cortex that neurons with similar tuning predominantly excite each other. The reason for such an architecture is not clear. Using an analytically tractable model as well as spiking neural networks, we show that it can naturally arise from a cooperative coding scheme. In this scheme neurons with similar responses specifically support each other by sharing their computations to obtain the desired population code. This sharing allows each neuron to effectively respond to a broad variety of inputs, while only receiving few feedforward and recurrent connections. Few strong, specific recurrent connections then replace many feedforward and less specific recurrent connections, such that the resulting connectivity optimizes the number of required synapses. This suggests that the number of required synapses may be a crucial constraining factor in biological neural networks. Synaptic savings increase with the dimensionality of the encoded variables. We find a trade-off between saving synapses and response speed. The response speed improves by orders of magnitude when utilizing the window of opportunity between excitatory and delayed inhibitory currents that arises if, as found in experiments, spike frequency adaptation is present or strong recurrent excitation is balanced by strong, shortly-lagged inhibition.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the molecular screening and safety of 14 lactic acid bacteria isolates for their capacity to produce antimicrobial peptides from milk proteins. The isolates were molecularly identified as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. hordniae, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and Weissella confusa. The tested lactococci isolates produced bioactive peptides with a wild-type antimicrobial spectrum against Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes. The majority of isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and ampicillin but resistant to nalidixic acid. Lactococcus lactis FFNL-2034 and Weissella confusa FFNL-1850 presented antibiotic multiresistance. Antibiotic resistance genes bla, ermB, tetK, cat, vanA, and vanC were absent in most of the tested isolates. The ermC, strA, strB, and tetM genes were positive in some isolates. These results provide safe LAB, which could act as a potent biopreservative agent for functional dairy products.

AB  - P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), as a brain inflammation biomarker, play important roles in the epileptogenic progress. Mounting evidence supports their activation in the brain during epilepsy, and inhibition of the P2X7 receptor reduces the seizure frequency and severity. In this study, we investigate P2X7R-targeted (18F-FTTM) position emission tomography (PET) imaging in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy to obtain further insights into the role of P2X7R during epileptogenesis. 18F-FTTM (5-10% radiochemical yield, over 99% radiochemical purity, and a specific activity of 270-300 MBq/nmol, n = 6, EOS) was first synthesized. Then, the rat models induced by intrahippocampal injection of saline (1.2 mu L, n = 15) or kainic acid (1.2 mu L, 0.5 mu g/mu L, n = 35) were examined using 18F-FTTM Micro-PET/CT longitudinal imaging, respectively. The imaging results showed that increases in the 18F-FTTM uptake was evident after status epilepticus (SE) in the epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, or temporal cortex, and this peaked during the latent period. The histopathological analysis revealed that the P2X7R PET uptake reached a peak at 7 days after SE and was mostly related to microglial activation. Thus, P2X7R-targeted PET imaging agent 18F-FTTM may act as a useful tool for identifying brain inflammation during epilepsy. P2X7R PET is a highly potent longitudinal biomarker of epilepsy and could be of interest to determine the therapeutic windows in epilepsy and to monitor treatment response, and it warrants further clinical studies.

AB  - Background Radiation-induced brain injury (RIBI) is one of the most common long-term complications for patients with malignant brain tumors after radiotherapy. At present, there is no effective treatment for RIBI. Recent studies have also confirmed that polysaccharides from laminaria japonica (LJP) display potential neuroprotective function. However, its mechanisms of neuroprotection remain unclear. Aim In this study, we aimed to explore the effect and underlying mechanism of LJP on neurogenesis in radiation-induced brain injury mice. Methods SPF two-month-old male mice were randomly divided into control group (Con), LJP treatment group (LJP), irradiation group (IR), and irradiation with LJP treatment group (IR + LJP). LJP (40 mg/kg/day) was intraperitoneally injected at one day before radiation for seven consecutive days (once daily). The mice were exposed to 10 Gy x 2 fractionated doses, once every other day, with a total dose of 20 Gy. Changes in cognitive function of mice following radiation were evaluated by the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, body weight and general status of mice were measured throughout the experiment. Immunohistochemical staining for neural proliferating cells (Ki67+ cells) and immature neurons (DCX + cells) was utilized to assay changes of neurogenesis in hippocampus. Microglial activation and collagen IV deposition within the neurogenic microenvironment were observed respectively by immunohistochemical staining for Iba-1 and Collagen IV in the hippocampus. Levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) in the hippocampus were detected by ELISA kits post-radiation. Results Morris water maze test showed that LJP therapy markedly reduced the escape latency and increased the times of crossing platform and percent time of the target quadrant in the radiated mice. In addition, the decrease of the neural proliferating cells (Ki67+ cells) and immature neurons (DCX + cells) in the hippocampus of mice following irradiation was significantly mitigated by the LJP treatment, suggesting that LJP could prevent from neurogenesis damage after irradiation. LJP injection significantly attenuated degradation of collagen IV, activation of microglia, and increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta) levels in the neurogenic microenvironment of the hippocampus after radiation. Conclusion These findings suggest that LJP early treatment may mitigate radiation-induced cognitive impairments and that its mechanism may relate to its protection of neurogenesis by alleviating neuroinflammation and collagen IV degradation within the neurogenic microenvironment.

AB  - Vasopressin (VP) is a nonapeptide made of nine amino acids synthesized by the hypothalamus and released by the pituitary gland. VP acts as a neurohormone, neuropeptide and neuromodulator and plays an important role in the regulation of water balance, osmolarity, blood pressure, body temperature, stress response, emotional challenges, etc. Traditionally VP is known to regulate the osmolarity and tonicity. VP and its receptors are widely expressed in the various region of the brain including cortex, hippocampus, basal forebrain, amygdala, etc. VP has been shown to modulate the behavior, stress response, circadian rhythm, cerebral blood flow, learning and memory, etc. The potential role of VP in the regulation of these neurological functions have suggested the therapeutic importance of VP and its analogues in the management of neurological disorders. Further, different VP analogues have been developed across the world with different pharmacotherapeutic potential. In the present work authors highlighted the therapeutic potential of VP and its analogues in the treatment and management of various neurological disorders.

AB  - Basic Pentacysteine (BPC) proteins are plant-specific transcription factors that bind to GAGA dinucleotide repeats in target gene promoters. Different classes of BPC proteins are able to form complexes and recruit chromatin-modifying proteins to regulate target gene expression. However, the mechanisms by which the relationships among BPC members regulate tissue-specific gene expression remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the tissue-specific functions and mechanisms of CjBPC5, a class II BPC gene from Camellia japonica. The ectopic overexpression of CjBPC5 induced pleiotropic morphological defects in the leaves and floral tissues. Global gene expression profiling and DNA binding-site analyses showed that CjBPC5 regulated tissue-specific expression of several downstream genes by binding to the GAGA-rich binding sites in their promoters. Furthermore, we identified DNA motifs in the BPC binding sites that were critical for regulating tissue-specific gene expression and various developmental processes via transcription factor binding. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated direct binding of CjBPC5 to the promoter regions of EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), BEL1-LIKE HOMEODOMAIN 6 (BLH6) and BRASSINOSTEROID-6-OXIDASE 2 (BR6OX2). In conclusion, our study suggests that CjBPC5 plays a critical role in plant development by interacting with specific transcription factors and regulating downstream genes in a tissue-specific manner.

Survivin, a key member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family, plays a central role in HCC tumorigenesis and progression. Despite significant research, a comprehensive understanding of the contributions of survivin to the hallmarks of cancer, its molecular network, and its potential as a therapeutic target remains incomplete. In this review, we integrated bioinformatics analysis with an extensive literature review to provide deeper insights into the role of survivin in HCC. Using bioinformatics tools such as the Human Protein Atlas, GEPIA, STRING, TIMER, and Metascape, we analyzed survivin expression and its functional associations and identified the top 20 coexpressed genes in HCC. These include TK1, SPC25, SGO2, PTTG1, PRR11, PLK1, NCAPH, KPNA2, KIF2C, KIF11, HJURP, GTSE1, FOXM1, CEP55, CENPA, CDCA3, CDC45, CCNB2, CCNB1 and CTD2510F5.4. Our findings also revealed significant protein-protein interactions among these genes, which were enriched in pathways associated with the FOXM1 oncogenic signaling cascade, and biological processes such as cell cycle regulation, mitotic checkpoints, and diseases such as liver neoplasms. We also discussed the involvement of survivin in key oncogenic pathways, including the PI3K/AKT, WNT/ beta-catenin, Hippo, and JAK/STAT3 pathways, and its role in modulating cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and autophagy. Furthermore, we explored its interactions with the tumor microenvironment, particularly its impact on immune modulation through myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated macrophages, and natural killer cell function in HCC. Additionally, we highlighted its involvement in alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (AGPS)-mediated lipid reprogramming and identified important gaps in the survivin network that warrant further investigation. This review also examined the role of survivin in cancer stemness, inflammation, and virally mediated hepatocarcinogenesis. We evaluated its potential as a diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, and pharmacodynamic biomarker in HCC, emphasizing its relevance in precision medicine. Finally, we summarized emerging survivin-targeted therapeutics and ongoing clinical trials, underscoring the need for novel strategies to effectively target survivin in HCC.

AB  - The main deterrent to long-term space travel is the risk of Radiation Exposure Induced Death (REID). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has adopted Permissible Exposure Levels (PELs) to limit the probability of REID to 3% for the risk of death due to radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The most significant contributor to current REID estimates for astronauts is the risk of lung cancer. Recently updated lung cancer estimates from Japan's atomic bomb survivors showed that the excess relative risk of lung cancer by age 70 is roughly fourfold higher in females compared to males. However, whether sex differences may impact the risk of lung cancer due to exposure to high charge and energy (HZE) radiation is not well studied. Thus, to evaluate the impact of sex differences on the risk of solid cancer development after HZE radiation exposure, we irradiated Rb fl/fl , Trp53fl/1male and female mice infected with Adeno-Cre with various doses of 320 kVp X rays or 600 MeV/n 56 Fe ions and monitored them for any radiation-induced malignancies. We conducted complete necropsy and histopathology of major organs on 183 male and 157 female mice after following them for 350 days postirradiation. We observed that lung adenomas/carcinomas and esthesioneuroblastomas (ENBs) were the most common primary malignancies in mice exposed to X rays and 56 Fe ions, respectively. In addition, 1 Gy 56 Fe-ion exposure compared to X-ray exposure led to a significantly increased incidence of lung adenomas/carcinomas (P 1 / 4 0.02) and ENBs (P <0.0001) in mice. However, we did not find a significantly higher incidence of any solid malignancies in female mice as compared to male mice, regardless of radiation quality. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of ENBs suggested a distinct gene expression pattern with similar hallmark pathways altered, such as MYC targets and MTORC1 signaling, in ENBs induced by X rays and 56 Fe ions. Thus, our data revealed that 56 Fe-ion exposure significantly accelerated the development of lung adenomas/carcinomas and ENBs compared to X rays, but the rate of solid malignancies was similar between male and female mice, regardless of radiation quality.

AB  - Galloylated catechins are major catechins in tea, resulting in a bitter and astringent taste. In this study, to identify the key genes involved in the hydrolysis of astringency-associated galloylated catechins in Camellia sinensis, multiomics association analysis, including enzyme activity assays, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, was performed. Subsequently, seven candidate genes involved in the hydrolysis of galloylated catechin were screened from tea genomes using correlation analysis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes were clustered into caffeoyl shikimate esterase, acetate esterase, and tannase groups. In vitro, the purified recombinant enzymes rCSS0031888 and rCSS0049322 catalyzed the hydrolysis of galloylated catechins into nongalloylated catechins. This study provides an efficient method for mining functional genes and identifying key genes involved in the hydrolysis of galloylated catechins in vitro, thereby reducing the bitterness and astringency of tea and offering a molecular basis for cultivating high-quality tea varieties.

AB  - The ultrasonic-assisted extraction of polysaccharides from Camellia fascicularis (PCF) was optimized using response surface methodology. After separation and purification with DEAE-52 cellulose and Sephadex G-200 glucan gel columns, the purified polysaccharide components of PCFa-1 and PCFc-1 were analyzed for their structural characterization, antioxidant and anti-tumor activities in vitro. The results indicated that liquid to material ratio of 42 mL/g, ultrasonic time of 53 min, ultrasonic temperature of 73.C, and ultrasonic power of 215 W were the optimum extraction conditions for PCF with maximum yields (4.05 %). PCFa-1 and PCFc-1 contained 5.88 % and 9.58 % uronic acid content, with 7.53 and 108.91 kDa of average molecular weights, respectively. The PCFa-1 was mainly constituted of galactose, arabinose, and glucose, while PCFc-1 was primarily composed of arabinose, glucose, galacturonic acid, and rhamnose. Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that PCFa-1 and PCFc-1 contained typical polysaccharide bands. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface of PCFa-1 and PCFc-1 were irregular and clumpy structures. Nuclear magnetic resonance showed that PCFa-1 and PCFc-1 were mainly alpha-glycosidic bond conformation. Furthermore, the PCFc-1 showed better antioxidant capacities than PCFa-1 against hydroxyl, DPPH, and ABTS radicals and exhibited more potent toxicity on A549 and HepG2 cells. These research results suggested that PCF, especially PCFc-1, possesses great potential as natural antioxidants and anti-tumor drugs.

AB  - Camellia oleifera fruit shell (CFS), a waste lignocellulosic biomass resulting from Camellia oleifera oil production industry, is abundantly available in Southern China. Herein, to understand the structural variations of CFS lignins and lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC) during ripening, the native lignin and LCC fractions from CFS (harvested every seven days from October 1 to 30, 2022) were isolated and characterized systematically. The molecular weights of both MWL and DEL fractions steadily increased during ripening. CFS lignins contained abundance of beta-O-4 ' linkages (maximum of 58.6 per 100Ar in DEL-2), and had low S/G ratios (S/G < 0.6). Moreover, the amounts of beta-O-4 ' linkages in MWL, DEL, and LCC-AcOH fractions increased first and then decreased during ripening. The main lignin-carbohydrate linkages in the LCC-AcOH fractions were benzyl-ether (7.0-9.4 per 100Ar) and phenyl-glycoside (4.5-5.2 per 100Ar) bonds. Based on the quantitative results, the potential structural diagrams of lignins from different ripening stages of CFS were proposed. Additionally, the LCC-AcOH fractions exhibited pronounced antioxidant capacity and were promising as natural antioxidants. The properties and functions of lignin in plant cell walls, as well as its further appreciation, are crucial for the design and selection of feasible pretreatment strategies for the lignocellulosic materials.

AB  - The YES-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are two important transcriptional coactivators that are often aberrantly activated in cancer cells. Their dysregulation promotes cancer development and can confer resistance to anticancer therapies. Therefore, the pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ presents a promising approach for treating tumors with heightened YAP/TAZ activity. However, the clinical use of a known YAP/TAZ inhibitor, niflumic acid (NA), is limited by its poor in vivo half-life. To improve its bioavailability, we developed a series of NA-based prodrug polymers and investigated the impact of NA monomer units on the physicochemical properties of their self-assembled nanoparticles. The optimal pNA polymer was selected as a prodrug micellar nanocarrier to load hydrophobic receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) for combination therapy. The nanocarrier selectively accumulated in the tumor and synergistically inhibited tumor growth with the cargo RTKIs, particularly Dasatinib, introducing a nanocombination therapy enhanced breast cancer treatment.

AB  - Theaflavins (TFs) are important quality compounds in black tea with a variety of biological activities. However, direct extraction of TFs from black tea is inefficient and costly. Therefore, we cloned two PPO isozymes from Huangjinya tea, termed HjyPPO1 and HjyPPO3. Both isozymes oxidized corresponding catechin substrates for the formation of four TFs (TF1, TF2A, TF2B, TF3), and the optimal catechol-type catechin to pyrogallol-type catechin oxidation rate of both isozymes was 1:2. In particular, the oxidation efficiency of HjyPPO3 was higher than that of HjyPPO1. The optimum pH and temperature of HjyPPO1 were 6.0 and 35 degrees C, respectively, while those of HjyPPO3 were 5.5 and 30 degrees C, respectively. Molecular docking simulation indicated that the unique residue of HjyPPO3 at Phe260 was more positive and formed a pi-pi stacked structure with His108 to stabilize the active region. In addition, the active catalytic cavity of HjyPPO3 was more conducive for substrate binding by extensive hydrogen bonding.

AB  - Camellia oleifera shells (COS), a by-product of the tea-oil industry, are characterized by a high hemicellulose content and a relatively low cellulose level. Effective utilization of COS based on their unique composition can reduce agricultural waste and add value to the tea-oil industry. In this study, COS holocellulose (COSH) was converted into strong and biodegradable films through a process involving dissolution, gelation, and regeneration, using zinc chloride molten salt hydrate (ZnCl2 MSH) as an environmentally friendly solvent. A NaOH pretreatment with varying concentrations (1-10 wt%) and durations (1-4 h) was applied to COSH to investigate the impact of hemicelluloses on the structure and properties of the resulting films. By applying a dilute (1-1.5 wt %) and short (1-2h) NaOH pretreatment, the degradation of both cellulose and hemicellulose during film formation was significantly reduced, leading to regenerated films with enhanced hydrophobicity, thermal and mechanical properties. Notably, films derived from COSH treated with 1.5 wt% NaOH for 2 h contained the highest amount of hemicellulose and exhibited the highest tensile strength (26.46 MPa) and Young's modulus (2158.95 MPa) among all samples. This work highlights the potential for fabricating biodegradable films from regenerated holocellulose.

AB  - COVID-19 made apparent the devastating impact viral pandemics have had on global health and order. Development of broad-spectrum antivirals to provide early protection upon the inevitable emergence of new viral pandemics is critical. In this work, antiviral polymers are discovered using a combination of high-throughput polymer synthesis and antiviral screening, enabling diverse polymer compositions to be explored. Amphipathic polymers, with ionizable tertiary amine groups, are the most potent antivirals, effective against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, with minimal cytotoxicity. It is hypothesized that these polymers interact with the viral membrane as they showed no activity against a nonenveloped virus (rhinovirus). The switchable chemistry of the polymers during endosomal acidification was evaluated using lipid monolayers, indicating that a complex synergy between hydrophobicity and ionization drives polymer-membrane interactions. This new high-throughput methodology can be adapted to continue to engineer the potency of the lead candidates or develop antiviral polymers against other emerging viral classes.

AB  - Victims of a radiation terrorist event will include pregnant women and unborn fetuses. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are key pathogenic factors of fetal radiation injury. The goal of this preclinical study is to investigate the efficacy of mitigating fetal radiation injury by maternal administration of the mitochondrial-targeted gramicidin S (GS)-nitroxide radiation mitigator JP4-039. Pregnant female C57BL/6NTac mice received 3 Gy total-body irradiation (TBI) at mid-gestation embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5). Using novel time- and-motion-resolved 4D in utero magnetic resonance imaging (4D-uMRI), we found TBI caused extensive injury to the fetal brain that included cerebral hemorrhage, loss of cerebral tissue, and hydrocephalus with excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Histopathology of the fetal mouse brain showed broken cerebral vessels and elevated apoptosis. Further use of novel 4D Oxy-wavelet MRI capable of probing in vivo mitochondrial function in intact brain revealed a significant reduction of mitochondrial function in the fetal brain after 3 Gy TBI. This was validated by ex vivo Oroboros mitochondrial respirometry. One day after TBI (E14.5) maternal administration of JP4-039, which passes through the placenta, significantly reduced fetal brain radiation injury and improved fetal brain mitochondrial respiration. Treatment also preserved cerebral brain tissue integrity and reduced cerebral hemorrhage and cell death. JP4039 administration following irradiation resulted in increased survival of pups. These findings indicate that JP4-039 can be deployed as a safe and effective mitigator of fetal radiation injury from mid-gestational in utero ionizing radiation exposure.

AB  - Oxytocin (OXT) is an "affiliative" hormone or neurohormone or neuropeptide consists of nine amino acids, synthesized in magnocellular neurons of paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON) of hypothalamus. OXT receptors are widely distributed in various region of brain and OXT has been shown to regulate various social and nonsocial behavior. Hippocampus is the main region which regulates the learning and memory. Hippocampus particularly regulates the acquisition of new memories and retention of acquired memories. OXT has been shown to regulate the synaptic plasticity, neurogenesis, and consolidation of memories. Further, findings from both preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that the OXT treatment improves performance in memory related task. Various trials have suggested the positive impact of intranasal OXT in the dementia patients. However, these studies are limited in number. In the present study authors have highlighted the role of OXT in the formation and retrieval of memories. Further, the study demonstrated the outcome of OXT treatment in various memory and related disorders.

AB  - Anthriscus sylvestris (L.) Hoffm has a long history of use for anti-aging, although the anti-aging properties of its decoction ingredients have been seldom explored. This study marks the first detailed examination of the in vivo anti-aging activity of A. sylvestris roots polysaccharide (AP). Structural analyses revealed that AP is a neutral heteropolysaccharide with an average molecular weight (Mw) of 34.17 kDa, comprising glucose, xylose, galactose, mannose, and arabinose, with a backbone primarily of 1,4-alpha-D-Glc and minor branching at 1,4,6-alpha-D-Man. Its advanced structure is characterized by stable triple-helical chains and nanoscale agglomerated spherical particles. Using a D-gal-induced aging mouse model, further investigation showed that AP boosts the activity of various antioxidant enzymes via the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling pathway. Aging-related immune decline was also mitigated by an increase in lymphocyte production in thymus. Moreover, AP reduced inflammation and downregulated aging genes p53 and p21 in hippocampus and liver tissues, enhanced the cholinergic system, and improved liver functions and lipid metabolism. The collective impact of these mechanisms underscores the robust anti-aging properties of AP. These findings highlight the anti-aging and immunomodulatory potential of A. sylvestris polysaccharide, broadening the understanding of its active components.

AB  - Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) extracted from the waste shell of Camellia oleifera Abel (C. oleifera) are gaining attention as valuable materials. In this study, CNCs were extracted from the agricultural waste shell of C. oleifera through phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid hydrolysis, respectively. Firstly, we optimized the alkaline treatment process for cellulose isolation by using response surface methodology. Furthermore, the properties of CNCs were investigated by neutralizing them with NaOH and NH3 & sdot;H2O, and by dialysis in water. In addition, the characterization methods including FT-IR, TGA, AFM and TEM were used to analysis the properties of the synthesized CNCs. Finally, CNCs were studied for their application in essential oil-based Pickering emulsions. CNCs obtained from sulfuric acid showed the smallest particle size and good dispersibility. Moreover, the release profiles of essential oils in the emulsions were followed by Peppa's kinetic release model. The antibacterial activity of the emulsions against E. coli and S. aureus showed that CNCs-stabilized emulsions enhanced the antibacterial activity of essential oils. Therefore, neutralization treatments may enhance the properties of CNCs, and CNCs stabilized Pickering emulsions can enhance antibacterial activity of essential oil. This study provides insight into the potential application of CNCs derived from C. oleifera waste shells.

AB  - The radiosensitivity of mice differs between postnatal days 10 (P10) and 21(P21); these days mark different stages of brain development. In the present study, Ki67 and doublecotin (DCX) immunostaining and hematoxylin staining was performed, which showed that acute radiation exposure at postnatal day 10 induced higher cell apoptosis and loss in the hilus of the dentate gyrus at day 1 postirradiation than postnatal day 21. MicroRNA (miRNA) sequencing and real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated the upregulation of miRNA-34a-5p at days 1 and 7 after irradiation at postnatal day 10, but not at postnatal day 21. Down- regulation of T-cell intracytoplasmic antigen-1 pathway (Tia1) was indicated by qRT-PCR at day 1 day but not day 7 after irradiation at postnatal day 10. Neurobehavioral testing in mature mice irradiated at postnatal day 10 demonstrated the impairment of short-term memory in novel object recognition and spatial memory, compared to those irradiated at postnatal day 21. Combined with our previous luciferase assay showing the direct interaction of miRNA34a-5p and Tia1, these findings suggest that radiation-induced abnormal miR-34a-5p/Tial interaction at day 1 after irradiation at postnatal day 10 may be involved in apoptosis of the dentate gyrus hilar, impairment of neurogenesis and subsequent short-term memory loss as observed in the novel object recognition and Barnes maze tests.

AB  - Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of the primary virulence factors of Staphylococcus aureus but there is still a lack of targeted drugs. SEB activates immune cells via interacting with MHC-II on antigen-presenting cells, leading to the production of large amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Blocking the interaction between SEB and MHC-II can avert the overactivation of immune cells. Nanobodies are the smallest functional antibodies that can bind stably to antigens. In this study, an ideal approach to obtain specific nanobodies without immunizing camelids was introduced. We constructed a library containing up to 5 x 108 nanobodies, and then screened those targeting SEB by using yeast surface display (YSD) technique and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). A total of 8 nanobodies with divergent complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) sequences were identified and one candidate Nb8 with high affinity to SEB was isolated. In vitro study demonstrated that Nb8 significantly inhibited SEB-induced inflammatory response. Molecular docking simulation indicated that the unique CDR3 sequence contributed to the binding of Nb8 to the MHC-II binding domain of SEB and accordingly cut off the connection between SEB and MHC-II. Our efforts contributed to the development of specific nanobodies for eliminating the threats of SEB.

AB  - As the global population ages, cognitive decline in older adults has gained significant attention in public health, underscoring the urgent need for effective intervention strategies. This study investigates the impact of salmon protein hydrolysate (SPH) on gut microbiota and cognitive decline in aged rats. Over 8 weeks, aged SpragueDawley rats were treated with SPH, resulting in significant enhancements in cognitive function as evidenced by operant-based attentional set-shifting and Morris water maze tasks. SPH modulated microglial activation in the hippocampus, reducing M1 polarization and promoting M2 polarization. RT-PCR analysis indicated a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a reduction in neuroinflammation. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that SPH transformed gut microbiota, increasing Bacteroidetes and decreasing Proteobacteria. The bacterial genera Prevotella, Bacteroidetes and Ruminococcus showed notable increases. Furthermore, SPH intervention can also increase the concentrations of certain short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in aged rats. Additionally, SPH also restored the Th17/Treg balance and decreased peripheral inflammation. This study offers compelling evidence for SPH as a functional food that may mitigate cognitive decline due to aging.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis), one of the most important beverage crops originated from China and is now cultivated worldwide, provides numerous secondary metabolites that account for its health benefits and rich flavor. However, the lack of an efficient and reliable genetic transformation system has seriously hindered the gene function investigation and precise breeding of C. sinensis. In this study, we established a highly efficient, laborsaving, and cost-effective Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated hairy roots genetic transformation system for C. sinensis, which can be used for gene overexpression and genome editing. The established transformation system was simple to operate, bypassing tissue culture and antibiotic screening, and only took two months to complete. We used this system to conduct function analysis of transcription factor CsMYB73 and found that CsMYB73 negatively regulates L-theanine synthesis in tea plant. Additionally, callus formation was successfully induced using transgenic roots, and the transgenic callus exhibited normal chlorophyll production, enabling the study of the corresponding biological functions. Furthermore, this genetic transformation system was effective for multiple C. sinensis varieties and other woody plant species. By overcoming technical obstacles such as low efficiency, long experimental periods, and high costs, this genetic transformation will be a valuable tool for routine gene investigation and precise breeding in tea plants.

AB  - This study evaluated quality attributes and in vivo antioxidant activity of Auricularia cornea var. Li polysaccharide (ACP)-fortified set yogurt during 21 days of storage (4 degrees C). Set yogurt was manufactured using a commercial yogurt culture, and 3% (w/v) ACP was added. Physicochemical (pH, titratable acidity, and water - holding capacity), textural, rheological, microstructural, flavor, and antioxidant properties of set yogurt were investigated. The results showed that the addition of ACP significantly enhanced WHC, viscosity, firmness, and cohesiveness, while inhibiting post-acidification of set yogurt during storage. The yogurt supplemented with ACP showed a larger hysteresis area and higher G ' and G '' values, formed a porous, dense, mesh-like structure and exhibited a unique mushroom flavor. Antioxidant results showed that administration of ACP-fortified yogurt significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activities and malondialdehyde levels, while increasing superoxide dismutase, catalase, phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity in the liver and hippocampus of the mice. ACP-fortified yogurt might alleviate hepatic damage and hippocampal neuroinflammation induced by D-galactose. Additionally, ACP-fortified yogurt downregulated the expression of Keap1 and upregulated the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 in the liver. In conclusion, ACP may be used as an ingredient to produce yogurt with desired properties.

AB  - Here, whole genome sequencing of Microbacterium sp. CIAB417 was conducted to determine its novelty at species level and identification of genes encoding for enzymes for mannan degradation. The draft genome was predicted to have 6.53 mbp length represented by 41 contigs and 6078 genes. However, only 82.35% genes were allocated for their functions. The whole genome phylogeny, ANI score (78.84%), GGDC (genome to genome distance calculations) show probability (DDH >= 70%) equal to 0% and difference in advanced biochemical properties among closely predicted species. The Microbacterium sp. CIAB417 was stipulated to be novel at species level. Isolate was named as Microbacterium camelliasinensis CIAB417 (accession no JAHZUT000000000) based on its isolation from a tea garden soil. Genome was predicted for three novel mannanase coding genes man1 (MZ702740), man2 (MZ702741), and man3 (MZ702737) that belong to the GH5 and GH113 family. Besides that, mannan side chain hydrolysing enzymes alpha-galactosidase (gla1; MZ702739) and beta-glucosidase (glu1; MZ702738) were also predicted.

AB  - This study aims to develop and evaluate a novel therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by overcoming the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limitations of Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). NT-3, a critical neurotrophic factor, plays essential roles in hippocampal neuron growth, survival, and synaptic plasticity, making it a promising candidate for AD treatment. However, its clinical application is hindered by its inability to cross the BBB. To address this, we utilized genetic engineering techniques to fuse the TAT transmembrane peptide with NT-3, producing a recombinant NT-3 (T-NT-3) with enhanced membrane-penetrating capability. Protein characterization confirmed that T-NT-3 possesses good stability and the ability to cross the BBB. In vitro experiments demonstrated that T-NT-3 inhibits oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory responses in neural cells by activating TrkC receptors and suppressing M1 microglial activation. In vivo, T-NT-3 improved cognitive and memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice and reduced AD-associated pathological changes. These findings highlight the mechanisms by which T-NT-3 alleviates hippocampal neurotoxicity, providing a foundation for its future application as a recombinant protein therapy for AD.

AB  - Radiation-induced brain injury (RBI) is a common complication of radiotherapy for head and neck tumors while its mechanism is not fully understood. Animal whole-brain radiation (WBR) models are of key importance in experimental radiation research, and an appropriate radiation source is essential. Previous animal WBR models were administered by clinical linear accelerator to induce the pathophysiological changes of RBI. In the current study, we adopted Faxitron MultiRad 225 X-ray irradiation system to construct a mouse WBR model with a single dose of 30 Gy. In the acute phase of this mouse WBR model, brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage were found mild. However, two months later, the results of immunofluorescence showed that astrocytes and microglia were activated continuously, and the number of immature neurons in dentate gyrus (DG) area of hippocampus was significantly reduced, in accordance with the features of chronic pathophysiological changes. Besides, data of MRI scans and behavior tests illustrated the structural changes of brain tissue and cognitive impairment in the chronic phase. To sum up, this mouse WBR model using the Faxitron MultiRad 225 irradiation system with a single dose of 30 Gy is feasible to simulate the RBI-related chronic pathophysiological changes.

AB  - Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) play a major economic role in many countries in Africa and Asia. Although they are resistant to harsh environmental conditions, they are susceptible to a wide range of zoonotic agents. This study aimed to provide an overview on the prevalence of selected zoonotic pathogens in blood and tissues of camels in central Iran. Blood, liver, portal lymph node, and brain were collected from 100 apparently healthy camels at a slaughterhouse in Qom city to assess the presence of DNA of Brucella spp., Trypanosoma spp., Coxiella burnetii, and Bartonella spp. PCR products were sequenced bidirectionally and phylogenetic analyses were performed. Eleven percent of camels tested positive for Brucella abortus (3%) and Trypanosoma evansi (8%). Coxiella burnetii and Bartonella spp. DNA was not detected. Our data demonstrate that camels from Iran contribute to the epidemiology of some zoonotic pathogens. Performing proper control strategies, such as vaccination of camels and humans in contact with them, test-and-slaughter policy, and education of the general population is necessary for minimizing the risk of zoonotic infection.

AB  - Theanine is a non-protein amino acid that accumulates only in the tea plant and has high economic value and unique health benefits. Recently some theanine synthases have been identified, but the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of theanine anabolism remains largely unclear. In this work, transcription factor CsTCP2, which belonged to the CIN subclass of the TCP gene family, was cloned from cDNA of Yinghong 9,and found that the CsTCP2 localized in nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activation activity in tobacco and yeast cells. Moreover, Dual luciferase, Y1H, and EMSA analysis revealed that CsTCP2 can promote CsGS1b expression by binding to the MeJA-responsive cis-acting element of proCsGS1b. Overexpression or knockdown of CsTCP2 significantly increased or decreased the expression of CsGS1b and the accumulation of theanine in callus, respectively. In addition, it was found that CsTCP2 is involved in the photosynthesis pathway and various free amino acid synthesis pathways, which can regulate theanine synthesis by influencing the photosynthesis, as well as the accumulation of free amino acids can positively determine the quality of tea plants.

AB  - Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP) has received an increasing amount of attention as it could alleviate AD-related cognitive impairment via the regulation of microglial activation. However, the modulatory mechanism of DOP on circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) and related cognitive impairment needs further investigation. In our study, the circadian rhythm disruption mice showed a deficit in recognition and spatial memory. DOP treatment reshaped the perturbation of gut microbiota caused by CRD, including up-regulated the abundance of Akkermansia and Alistipes, down-regulated the abundance of Clostridia. In addition, DOP restored histopathological changes, reduced inflammatory cells infiltration and strengthened mucosal integrity. Mechanistically, DOP ameliorated intestinal barrier dysfunction by up-regulating tight junction protein expression, which in turn improved the invasion of lipopolysaccharide to blood and brain. The change of these contributes to inhibiting the NF-kappa B activation and neuroinflammation, and thus attenuating hippocampus neuronal damage and the deposition of A beta. Meanwhile, our results revealed that DOP could reverse the levels of metabolites derived related to cognitive function improvement, and these metabolites were closely associated with the key microbiota. Therefore, we speculated that DOP has the potential to provide neuroprotection against cognitive impairment by modulating the gut microbiota.

AB  - This study explores the eco-friendly biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) utilizing Camellia sinensis leaf extract. We assess their antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Furthermore, we impregnated AgNPs into 2 % chitosan (CHS) gel and assessed their wound-healing potential in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus infected wounds. Optimized AgNPs demonstrated a mean particle size of 36.90 +/- 1.22 nm and a PDI of 0.049 +/- 0.001. Green-synthesized AgNPs exhibited enhanced free radical inhibition (IC50: 31.45 mu g/mL, 34.01 mu g/mL, 27.40 mu g/mL) compared to leaf extract (IC50: 52.67 mu g/mL, 59.64 mu g/mL, 97.50 mu g/mL) in DPPH, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide free radical scavenging assays, respectively. The MIC/MBC values of AgNPs against E. coli and S. aureus were 5 ppm/ 7.5 ppm and 10 ppm/ 15 ppm, respectively. Furthermore, our study showed that green-synthesized AgNPs at MIC significantly reduced the biofilm production of E. coli (70.37 %) and S. aureus (67.40 %). The CHS/AgNPs gel exhibited potent wound healing activities, comparable to a commercial cream with the re-epithelialization period of 8.16 +/- 0.75. Histological analysis demonstrated enhanced skin regeneration with a thicker epidermal layer, well-defined papillary dermal structure, and organized collagen fibers. In summary, these findings hold promise for addressing bacterial infections, particularly those associated with biofilms-related wound infections.

AB  - A novel tailor-made enzyme cocktail comprising five recombinant crude enzymes was designed for hydrolysis of alkaline hydrogen peroxide pretreated elephant grass (AHPpEG). D-optimal design approach is employed to optimize the proportion of individual enzymes within the enzyme cocktail. The enzyme cocktail comprising chimera (endoglucanase and (3-glucosidase), cellobiohydrolase, endo-1,4-(3-xylanase, (3-xylosidase and arabinofuranosidase having ratio (9:4:2:2:3) was developed. The crude enzyme cocktail was stable at 35 degrees C for 24 h, retaining over 60 % relative activity and displayed t1/2 of 55 h. The saccharification of AHPpEG at 15 % (w/v) solid loading, the developed enzyme cocktail gave total reducing sugar yield of 465 mg/g.AHPpEG. The addition of 2.0 g/L TritonX-100 to the crude enzyme cocktail for saccharification of 15 % (w/v) AHPpEG caused a significant enhancement (17 %) in TRS yield (544 mg/g.AHPpEG) with glucose 435 mg/g.AHPpEG and xylose 106 mg/g.AHPpEG yields. The formulated tailor-made crude enzyme cocktail for AHPpEG gave saccharification efficiency of 76 % underscoring the potential of the enzyme cocktail for application in lignocellulosic biomass based biorefineries.

AB  - The microRNAs and phasiRNAs of plant are small non-coding RNAs with important functions through regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. However, identifying miRNAs, phasiRNAs and their target genes from numerous sequencing raw data requires multiple software and command-line operations, which are timeconsuming and labor-intensive for non-model plants. Therefore, we present CsMPDB (miRNAs and phasiRNAs database of Camellia sinensis), an interactive web application with multiple analysis modules developed to visualize and explore miRNA and phasiRNA in tea plants based on 259 sRNA-seq samples and 24 degradome-seq samples in NCBI. The source code for the CsMPDB was written in R/shiny. It is compatible, extendable, and portable to be easily set up on different operating systems, and can be accessed at http://myshiny.cpolar. io/CsMPDB. This application plays an important role in accelerating the functional study of sRNAs in the transcriptional regulation of tea plants, and has important reference value for the development of sRNA databases of other species.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is obtained from organic and inorganic selenium food content, which mainly depends on the regional soil selenium content. Selenium deficiency and decreased selenoprotein functions have been shown to associate with the progression of cognitive decline and neurodegenerations including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and Huntington's disease (HD). Selenoproteins are well recognized for their anti -oxidative activities. Given the high oxygen consumption, mammalian brains preferent@ially supplied with Se. Here, we propose a beneficiary role for dietary supplementation of sodium selenite (300 ng per gram of body weight) in ameliorating neuroinflammation induced by bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of 1 mu L LPS (1 mu g/mu L), evidenced by the significantly reduced oxidative stress, downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, improved integrity of blood-brain barrier, as well as suppressed glial activation and shifted microglial MI/M2 polarization in Se-sup mouse brain. Se intake also reduced neural cell death and significantly improved the cognition in Se-sup mice following LPS challenge. The neuroprotective role for supplementary Se is likely to be ascribed to the overall elevated expression of selenoproteins, especially Selenoprotein P (SELENOP) and Glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), ranking on top of the change in selenoprotein expression hierarchy. The regional hierarchy of Se induced elevation of SELENOP expression was further characterized. The SELENOP expression in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, dendric gyrus (DG) and cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) of hippocampus and lateral habenular nucleus was highly sensitive to dietary Se intake.

AB  - Shark-like rays (order Rhinopristiformes) are among the most threatened cartilaginous fish globally. Despite this, unresolved taxonomic issues still exist within the group. To date, no studies have used complete mitochondrial genomes to assess the phylogenetic placement of Acroteriobatus within the non-monophyletic family Rhinoba-tidae. The current study reports the first complete mitochondrial genomes for Acroteriobatus annulatus and A. blochii. Similar to other rhinopristiforms, the complete sequences of A. annulatus (16,773 bp) and A. blochii (16,771 bp) were circular molecules with gene organisations identical to that of the typical vertebrate mitoge-nome. The A + T content was higher than the G + C content, with a bias towards A and C nucleotides observed in all complete mitogenomes. The stem-and-loop secondary structures of the putative origin of light-strand repli-cation were found to have highly conserved synthesis and stem regions, with all substitutions and indels restricted to the loop structure. The ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates indicated that purifying selection has been the dominant driver of evolution in rhinopristiform mitogenomes. Phylogenetic reconstructions placed Acroteriobatus as a sister-group to Rhinobatos, confirming its affiliation with the family Rhinobatidae. However, based on its apparent polyphyly with the aforementioned genera, the familial assign-ment of Pseudobatos is not fully resolved and requires further investigation.

AB  - The analysis of alterations in the expression and functionality of brain-derived exosomal miRNAs within ischemic stroke lesions provides significant insights into the mechanisms that contribute to disease recovery. We assessed spontaneous motor function in a rat model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) using motor function scores and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Brain-derived exosomes from the infarcted brain tissue of the animal model were extracted and high-throughput sequencing of them was performed followed by bioinformatics analysis for differentially expressed miRNAs target genes. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure expression levels of differentially expressed miRNAs at various time points. The oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) model was established to investigate gene function through the assessment of cell proliferation and apoptosis using EdU proliferation and JC-1 apoptosis assay. The rat model demonstrated a spontaneous recovery of motor function and a reduction in cerebral infarction area from day 1 to day 14 post-operation. Over the course of the recovery period, miR-24-3p, miR-129-1-3p, and miR-212-5p maintained consistent expression levels, reaching their peak on the initial day following surgery. In the cell model, EdU detection indicated that miR-129-1-3p promoted cellular proliferation, while JC-1 detection revealed its suppressive impact on cellular apoptosis. The current research findings indicated the presence of spontaneous motor function restoration in a rat model of ischemic stroke. MiR-24-3p, miR-129-1-3p, and miR-212-5p were identified as pivotal genes in this recovery process, with miR-129-1-3p potentially influencing the restoration of spontaneous motor function in ischemic stroke through the regulation of neuronal proliferation and apoptosis.

AB  - Allium ampeloprasum L., elephant garlic, is a plant that is cultivated and notable for its usage for medical and nutritional purposes. From this point, the present work presents the phenolic profiles of methanol extracts from the flowers, leaves, and bulbs of A. ampeloprasum collected in the wild in Izmir, Turkey, using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique. Among the 30 quantified phenolic compounds, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid was the major component in A. ampeloprasum from Cambel (AA2) with a value of 3505 +/- 12.8 mu g/g extract, while the bioactive flavonols, quercetin (98.37 +/- 1.75 mu g/g extract), and kaempferol (173.20 +/- 1.3 mu g/g extract) were notable molecules in samples of A. ampeloprasum from Armutlu (AA1). Additionally, antioxidant activity by ferric-reducing antioxidant power and cupric ion-reducing assays, and the total phenolic, and flavonoid content were determined for all extracts. Finally, the samples' capacity to inhibit the enzymes acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and tyrosinase was evaluated using a 96-well microplate reader, the flowers of both samples generally had stronger inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the relationship between enzyme inhibition potency and the main phenolic components was expounded by molecular modeling studies. Consequently, these experiments were achieved to investigate the prospective usage of A. ampeloprasum both in pharmaceutical and nutraceutical fields.

AB  - The role of inflammation and immunity in the pathomechanism of neurodegenerative diseases has become increasingly relevant within the past few years. In this context, the NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a crucial role in the activation of inflammatory responses by promoting the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-18. We hypothesized that the interplay between nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) may play a critical role in the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent inflammatory responses. After priming mixed glial cultures with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cells were stimulated with ATP, showing a significant reduction of IL1-beta release in NOX4 and Nrf2 KO mice. Importantly, NOX4 inhibition using GKT136901 also reduced IL-1 beta release, as in NOX4 KO mixed glial cultures. Moreover, we measured NOX4 and NLRP3 expression in wild-type mixed glial cultures following LPS treatment, observing that both increased after TLR4 activation, while 24 h treatment with tert-butylhydroquinone, a potent Nrf2 inducer, significantly reduced NLRP3 expression. LPS administration resulted in significant cognitive impairment compared to the control group. Indeed, LPS also modified the expression of NLRP3 and NOX4 in mouse hippocampus. However, mice treated with GKT136901 after LPS impairment showed a significantly improved discrimination index and recovered the expression of inflammatory genes to normal levels compared with wild-type animals. Hence, we here validate NOX4 as a key player in NLRP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting NOX4 pharmacological inhibition as a potent therapeutic approach in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Background: Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) is a small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis. The anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies' (ANCA) role in defining clinical EGPA phenotypes is well established. Although the role of eosinophils in disease pathogenesis has been clearly demonstrated, the value of blood eosinophil count (BEC) as a biomarker of disease phenotypes is currently uncertain. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed EGPA patients referred to our Immunology Clinic. Demographic, laboratory and clinical features were retrieved from clinical records, and a Logistic Regression was fitted to evaluate the predictive power of all baseline clinical and laboratory features to define EGPA phenotypes. Results: 168 patients were recruited. BEC <= 1500 cells/mL was predictive of a clinical involvement characterized by asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) and lung opacities (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.43; respiratory-limited phenotype); BEC > 3500/mL was predictive of extrapulmonary organ involvement (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.7-7.1; systemic phenotype). BEC was also predictive of peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement, with a positive trend with increasing BEC (<1500/mL: OR 0.17, 95%CI, 0.06-0.47; >3500/mL: OR 2.8, 95% CI, 1.5-5.28). ANCA positivity was also predictive of extrapulmonary involvement (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.9-11.99). Conclusions: according to BEC and irrespective of the ANCA status, two EGPA phenotypes could be identified, named systemic and respiratory-limited phenotypes, with different organ involvement and possibly different prognoses.

AB  - Brain frailty may be related to the pathophysiology of poor clinical outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study examines the relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and frailty and depressive symptoms, and their combined association with quality of life (QOL) in patients with COPD. The study involved 40 patients with COPD. Frailty, depressive symptoms and QOL were assessed using Kihon Checklist (KCL), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment (WHO/QOL-26). Anatomical MRI data were acquired, and volumes of the hippocampal subfields were obtained using FreeSurfer (version 6.0). Statistically, HADS score had significant association with WHO/QOL-26 and KCL scores. KCL scores were significantly associated with volumes of left and right whole hippocampi, presubiculum and subiculum, but HADS score had no significant association with whole hippocampi or hippocampal subfield volumes. Meanwhile, WHO/QOL-26 score was significantly associated with volume of the left CA1. There was a significant association between frailty, depression, and QOL. Hippocampal pathology was related to frailty and, to some extent, with QOL in patients with COPD. Our results suggest the impact of frailty on hippocampal volume and their combined associations with poor QOL in COPD.

AB  - This study was conducted to assess the disparities in camel activities such as eating, drinking, sitting, standing, and sleeping between primiparous and multiparous females before parturition using computer vision. Also, any extraordinary behaviours during the final 2 h before parturition and the necessary manual interventions were meticulously recorded. Five primiparous (age: 4.5-7 years) and 7 multiparous (age: 8-14 years; parity: 2.1 +/- 1.5) dromedary camels, were included in this study. Pre-partum females were housed double in a parturition pen provided with two Reolink RLC-810A cameras and the data were collected and recorded for each female. Two primiparous and 1 multiparous female required assistance in pulling the calf from both forelimbs to complete their parturition (27.3%). The drinking and sleeping activities were similar in primiparous and multiparous females during the recorded 32 h leading up to calving. Only eating activity exhibited a longer period in primiparous females compared to multiparous females specifically during the 12-h before calving. Sitting activity was longer, and standing activity was shorter in multiparous than in primiparous females during the 24, 12, and 6 h before calving. All parturient camels, whether primiparous or multiparous, exhibited signs of distress. Some extraordinary behaviours were observed, such as two multiparous females attempting to deter their primiparous counterparts from eating. Additionally, three females displayed a distinctive standing position on their knees while their hind limbs were in a complete standing position for 3-5 min before transitioning to sitting or standing positions. Furthermore, one primiparous female stood while the head and forelimbs of the calf partially protruded from her vulva. In conclusion, the application of computer vision and deep learning technology proves valuable for observing prepartum camels under farm conditions, potentially reducing economic losses stemming from delayed human intervention in dystocia cases.

AB  - Background: Accumulations of stressful life events result in the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD). Comprehensive genomic analysis is required to elucidate pathophysiological changes and identify applicable biomarkers. Methods: Transcriptomic analysis was performed on different brain parts of a chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced MDD mouse model followed by systemic analysis. QPCR and ELISA were utilized for validation in mice and patients. Results: The highest numbers of genes with significant changes induced by CMS were 505 in the amygdala followed by 272 in the hippocampus (twofold changes; FDR, p < 0.05). Enrichment analysis indicated that the core-enriched genes in CMS-treated mice were positively enriched for IFN-gamma response genes in the amygdala, and hedgehog signaling in the hippocampus. Transthyretin (TTR) was severely reduced in CMS-treated mice. In patients with diagnosed MDD, serum concentrations of TTR were reduced by 48.7% compared to controls (p = 0.0102). Paired samples from patients with MDD demonstrated a further 66.3% increase in TTR at remission compared to the acute phase (p = 0.0339). Conclusions: This study provides comprehensive information on molecular networks related to MDD as a basis for further investigation and identifies TTR for MDD monitoring and management. A clinical trial with bigger patient cohort should be conducted to validate this translational study.

AB  - Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the most common human prion disorder, may occur as "pure" neurodegeneration with isolated prion deposits in the brain tissue; however, comorbid cases with different concomitant neurodegenerative diseases have been reported. This retrospective study examined correlations of clinical, neuropathological, molecular-genetic, immunological, and neuroimaging biomarkers in pure and comorbid CJD. A total of 215 patients have been diagnosed with CJD during the last ten years by the Czech National Center for Prion Disorder Surveillance. Data were collected from all patients with respect to diagnostic criteria for probable CJD, including clinical description, EEG, MRI, and CSF findings. A detailed neuropathological analysis uncovered that only 11.16% were "pure" CJD, while 62.79% had comorbid tauopathy, 20.47% had Alzheimer's disease, 3.26% had frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and 2.33% had synucleinopathy. The comorbid subgroup analysis revealed that tauopathy was linked to putaminal hyperintensity on MRIs, and AD mainly impacted the age of onset, hippocampal atrophy on MRIs, and beta-amyloid levels in the CSF. The retrospective data analysis found a surprisingly high proportion of comorbid neuropathologies; only 11% of cases were verified as "pure" CJD, i.e., lacking hallmarks of other neurodegenerations. Comorbid neuropathologies can impact disease manifestation and can complicate the clinical diagnosis of CJD.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is an important cause of neonatal neurological deficits. Our previous study demonstrated that dexmedetomidine (Dex) provided neuroprotection against neonatal hypoxic brain injury; however, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. Overactivation of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) can cause neuronal apoptosis and neurological deficits. Hence, we aimed to investigate the role of neuronal NOX2 in Dex-mediated neuroprotection and to explore its potential mechanisms. Hypoxic injury was modeled in neonatal rodents in vivo and in cultured hippocampal neurons in vitro. Our results showed that pre- or post-treatment with Dex improved the neurological deficits and alleviated the hippocampal neuronal damage and apoptosis caused by neonatal hypoxia. In addition, Dex treatment significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced neuronal NOX2 activation; it also reduced oxidative stress, as evidenced by decreases in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, malondialdehyde, and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, as well as increases in the antioxidant enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in neonatal rat hippocampi and in hippocampal neurons. Lastly, the posthypoxicneuroprotective action of Dex was almost completely abolished in NOX2-deficient neonatal mice and NOX2-knockdown neurons. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that neuronal NOX2-mediated oxidative stress is involved in the neuroprotection that Dex provides against apoptosis and neurological deficits in neonates following hypoxia.

AB  - Stress can elicit glucocorticoid release to promote coping mechanisms and influence learning and memory performance. Individual memory performance varies in response to stress, and the underlying mechanism is not clear yet. Peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) is a multifunctional enzyme participating in both physiological and pathological conditions. Several studies have demonstrated the correlation between PRDX6 expression level and stress-related disorders. Our recent finding indicates that lack of the Prdx6 gene leads to enhanced fear memory. However, it is unknown whether PRDX6 is involved in changes in anxiety response and memory performance upon stress. The present study reveals that hippocampal PRDX6 level is downregulated 30 min after acute immobilization stress (AIS) and trace fear conditioning (TFC). In human retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19) cells, the PRDX6 expression level decreases after being treated with stress hormone corticosterone. Lack of PRDX6 caused elevated basal H2O2 levels in the hippocampus, basolateral amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex, brain regions involved in anxiety response and fear memory formation. Additionally, this H2O2 level was still high in the medial prefrontal cortex of the knockout mice under AIS. Anxiety behavior of Prdx6(-/-) mice was enhanced after immobilization for 30 min. After exposure to AIS before a contextual test, Prdx6(-/-) mice displayed a contextual fear memory deficit. Our results showed that the memory performance of Prdx6(-/-) mice was impaired when responding to AIS, accompanied by dysregulated H2O2 levels. The present study helps better understand the function of PRDX6 in memory performance after acute stress.

AB  - Theasaponin derivatives, which are reported to exert antitumor activity, have been widely reported to exist in edible plants, including in the seed cake of Camellia oleifera (C.), which is extensively grown in south of China. The purpose of this study was to isolate new theasaponin derivatives from C. seed cake and explore their potential antitumor activity and their underlying molecular mechanism. In the present study, we first isolated and identified four theasaponin derivatives (compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4) from the total aglycone extract of the seed cake of Camellia oleifera by utilizing a combination of pre-acid-hydrolysis treatment and activity-guided isolation. Among them, compound 1 (C1) and compound 4 (C4) are newly discovered theasaponins that have not been reported before. The structures of these two new compounds were characterized based on comprehensive 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and high-resolution mass spectrometry, as well as data reported in the literature. Secondly, the cytotoxicity and antitumor property of the above four purified compounds were evaluated in selected typical tumor cell lines, Huh-7, HepG2, Hela, A549, and SGC7901, and the results showed that the ED50 value of C4 ranges from 1.5 to 11.3 mu M, which is comparable to that of cisplatinum (CDDP) in these five cell lines, indicating that C4 has the most powerful antitumor activity among them. Finally, a preliminary mechanistic investigation was performed to uncover the molecular mechanism underlying the antitumor property of C4, and the results suggested that C4 may trigger apoptosis through the Bcl-2/Caspase-3 and JAK2/STAT3 pathways, and stimulate cell proliferation via the NF-kappa B/iNOS/COX-2 pathway. Moreover, it was surprising to find that C4 can inhibit the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, which indicates that C4 has the potency to overcome the resistance to cancer drugs. Therefore, C1 and C4 are two newly identified theasaponin derivatives with antitumor activity from the seed cake of Camellia oleifera, and C4 is a promising antitumor candidate not only for its powerful antitumor activity, but also for its ability to function as an Nrf2 inhibitor to enhance the anticancer drug sensitivity.

AB  - Due to their susceptibilities, neonates and infants face unique SARS-CoV-2 challenges. This retrospective study will compare the illness course, symptoms, biomarkers, and lung damage in neonates and infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection from February 2020 to October 2023. This study was conducted at two hospitals in Timisoara, Romania, using real-time multiplex PCR to diagnose and lung ultrasonography (LUS) to assess lung involvement. Neonates had a more severe clinical presentation, an increased immune response, and greater lung involvement. Neonates had more PCR-positive tests (p = 0.0089) and longer hospital stays (p = 0.0002). In neonates, LDH, CRP, and ferritin levels were higher, indicating a stronger inflammatory response. Reduced oxygen saturation in neonates indicates respiratory dysfunction. The symptoms were varied. Infants had fever, cough, and rhinorrhea, while neonates had psychomotor agitation, acute dehydration syndrome, and candidiasis. This study emphasizes individualized care and close monitoring for neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections. Newborn lung ultrasonography showed different variances and severity levels, emphasizing the need for targeted surveillance and therapy. Newborns have high lung ultrasound scores (LUSS), indicating significant lung involvement. Both groups had initial lung involvement, but understanding these modest differences is crucial to improving care for these vulnerable populations.

AB  - In emotional processing, dopamine (DA) plays an essential role, and its deterioration involves important consequences. Under physiological conditions, dopamine exhibits brain asymmetry and coexists with various neuropeptides that can coordinate the processing of brain functions. Brain asymmetry can extend into a broader concept of asymmetric neurovisceral integration, including behavior. The study of the activity of neuropeptide regulatory enzymes (neuropeptidases, NPs) is illustrative. We have observed that the left and right brain areas interact intra- and inter-hemispherically, as well as with peripheral tissues or with physiological parameters such as blood pressure or with behaviors such as turning preference. To obtain data that reflect this integrative behavior, we simultaneously analyzed the impact of left or right brain DA depletion on the activity of various NPs in corticolimbic regions of the left and right hemispheres, such as the medial prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, as well as on the plasma activity of the same aminopeptidase activities (APs) and on systolic blood pressure (SBP). Intra- and inter-hemispheric interactions as well as the interactions of NPs from the left or right hemispheres were analyzed with the same plasma APs and the SBP obtained from sham and from left or right lesioned rats. The results demonstrate a complex profile depending on the hemisphere considered. They definitively confirm an asymmetric neurovisceral integration and reveal a higher level of inter-hemispheric corticolimbic interactions including with SBP after left dopamine depletion.

AB  - The present study was conducted to test a new super-agonist recombinant bovine FSH (rbFSH) to induce superovulation (SOV) in dromedary camels. In experiment I, a single IM injection of 40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 mu g rbFSH was administered (4 donors per group) to determine the effective dose resulting in acceptable multiple ovulation and embryo yield. Administration of 40 mu g was ineffective, while 100 and 120 mu g were associated with increased numbers of developed follicles, corpora lutea, and recovered embryos compared to administration of 60 and 80 mu g. In experiment II, donors were divided into treatment groups to compare rbFSH with two conventional protocols for SOV. Donors received a single dose of 2000 IU eCG in combination with 400 mg porcine follicle-stimulating hormone (pFSH; Folltropin-V (R); Group 1, n = 29) or 500 mu g of pFSH with 100 mu g of pLH (Stimufol (R); Group 2, n = 16). Group 3 (n = 19) received a single dose of 100 mu g rbFSH. No difference was found in the size and number of follicles per donor. Response time, ovulation rate, and the number of corpora lutea and recovered embryos per donor were similar in all groups. The number of medium-sized and transparent embryos decreased while the number of small-sized and semi-transparent embryos increased in Group 3 (rbFSH) compared to the other two groups. The pregnancy rate of the recipients at 10 days post-ET, at two months of gestation, and the rate of early pregnancy loss (EPL) did not differ among the groups. In conclusion, a single IM administration of 100 mu g rbFSH induces a successful superovulation in dromedary camels and has the advantage of reducing stress associated with multiple FSH administration of the conventional protocols.

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP), an important effector protein of the Hippo signaling pathway, acts as a molecular switch in controlling cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, a YAP-targeted isogenic sub-clone of the MUSIe002-A was generated, designated as MUSIe002-A-1. The MUSIe002-1 cell line had normal pluripotent stem cell characteristics and karyotype. Its ability to differentiate into three germ layers was confirmed. As reduction of YAP does not disturb the pluripotency of hESCs, this cell line serves as a valuable model to extrapolate the functional role of YAP in stem cell biology and its applications.

AB  - The molecular basis of amyloid toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains controversial. Amyloid beta (A beta) oligomers promote Ca2+ influx, mitochondrial Ca2+ overload and apoptosis in hippocampal neurons in vivo and in vitro, but the primary Ca2+ entry pathways are unclear. We studied Ca2+ entry pathways induced by A beta oligomers in rat hippocampal and cerebellar neurons. A beta oligomers induce Ca2+ entry in neurons. Ca2+ responses to A beta oligomers are large after synaptic networking and prevented by blockers of synaptic transmission. In contrast, in neurons devoid of synaptic connections, Ca2+ responses to A beta oligomers are small and prevented only by blockers of amyloid channels (NA7) and NMDA receptors (MK801). A combination of NA7 and MK801 nearly abolished Ca2+ responses. Non-neuronal cells bearing NMDA receptors showed Ca2+ responses to oligomers, whereas cells without NMDA receptors did not exhibit Ca2+ responses. The expression of subunits of the NMDA receptor NR1/ NR2A and NR1/NR2B in HEK293 cells lacking endogenous NMDA receptors restored Ca2+ responses to NMDA but not to A beta oligomers. We conclude that A beta oligomers promote Ca2+ entry via amyloid channels and NMDA receptors. This may recruit distant neurons intertwisted by synaptic connections, spreading excitation and recruiting further NMDA receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, leading to excitotoxicity and neuron degeneration in AD.

AB  - Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) mediates neuronal death through several events involving many molecular pathways, including the glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity for excessive stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), producing activation of death signaling pathways. However, the contribution of NMDARs (distribution and signaling-associated to the distribution) remains incompletely understood. We propose a critical role of STEP61 (Striatal-Enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase) in TBI; this phosphatase regulates the dephosphorylated state of the GluN2B subunit through two pathways: by direct dephosphorylation of tyrosine-1472 and indirectly via dephosphorylation and inactivation of Fyn kinase. We previously demonstrated oxidative stress's contribution to NMDAR signaling and distribution using SOD2(+/-) mice such a model. We performed TBI protocol using a controlled frontal impact device using C57BL/6 mice and SOD2(+/-) animals. After TBI, we found alterations in cognitive performance, NMDAR-dependent synaptic function (decreased synaptic form of NMDARs and decreased synaptic current NMDAR-dependent), and increased STEP61 activity. These changes are reduced partially with the STEP61-inhibitor TC-2153 treatment in mice subjected to TBI protocol. This study contributes with evidence about the role of STEP61 in the neuropathological progression after TBI and also the alteration in their activity, such as an early biomarker of synaptic damage in traumatic lesions.</p>

AB  - Yes-associated protein (YAP) regulates numerous cellular homeostasis processes and malignant transformation. We found that YAP influences ZO-1-mediated cell migration using E-cadherin-restored EC96 cells derived from gastric malignant AGS cells. Ectopic expression of E-cadherin enhanced straightforward migration of cells, in comparison to the meandering movement of parental AGS cells. In EC96 cells, YAP and ZO-1 expression increased but nuclear YAP levels and activity were reduced. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) mediated the increase in ZO-1 expression, possibly stabilizing cytoplasmic YAP post-translationally. Downregulation of YAP expression using siYAP RNA or stable knock-down inhibited straightforward cell migration by fragmenting ZO-1 containing tight junctions (TJs) but not adherens junctions, implying involvement of YAP in ZO-1-mediated cell migration. The association of YAP with ZO-1 was mediated by angiomotin (AMOT) because downregulation of AMOT dissociated YAP from ZO-1 and reduced cell migration. E-cadherin restoration in malignant cancer cells induced NF-kappa B signaling to enhance ZO-1 expression and subsequently stabilize YAP. At high expression levels, YAP associates with ZO-1 via AMOT at TJs, influencing ZO-1-mediated cell migration and maintaining TJ integrity.

AB  - Crystal structures of hemoglobin (Hb) from two flightless birds, ostrich (Struthio camelus) and turkey (Meleagris gallopova), were determined. The ostrich Hb structure was solved to a resolution of 2.22 angstrom, whereas two forms of turkey Hb were solved to resolutions of 1.66 angstrom (turkey monoclinic structure; TMS) and A 1.39 angstrom (turkey orthorhombic structure; TOS). Comparison of the amino-acid sequences of ostrich and turkey Hb with those from other avian species revealed no difference in the number of charged residues, but variations were observed in the numbers of hydrophobic and polar residues Amino-acid-composition-based computation of various physical parameters, in particular their lower inverse transition temperatures and higher average hydrophobicities, indicated that the structures of ostrich and turkey Hb are likely to be highly ordered when compared with other avian Hbs. From the crystal structure analysis, the liganded state of ostrich Hb was confirmed by the presence of an oxygen molecule between the Fe atom and the proximal histidine residue in all four heme regions. In turkey Hb (both TMS and TOS), a water molecule was bound instead of an oxygen molecule in all four heme regions, thus confirming that they assumed the aqua-met form. Analysis of tertiary- and quaternary-structural features led to the conclusion that ostrich oxy Hb and turkey aqua-met Hb adopt the R-/R-H state conformation.

AB  - Chemical exchange saturation transfer with glutamate (GluCEST) imaging is a novel technique for the non-invasive detection and quantification of cerebral Glu levels in neuromolecular processes. Here we used GluCEST imaging and 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to assess in vivo changes in Glu signals within the hippocampus in a rat model of depression induced by a forced swim test. The forced swimming test (FST) group exhibited markedly reduced GluCESTweighted levels and Glu concentrations when examined using 1H MRS in the hippocampal region compared to the control group (GluCEST-weighted levels: 3.67 +/- 0.81% vs. 5.02 +/- 0.44%, p < 0.001; and Glu concentrations: 6.560 +/- 0.292 <mu>mol/g vs. 7.133 +/- 0.397 mu mol/g, p = 0.001). Our results indicate that GluCEST imaging is a distinctive approach to detecting and monitoring Glu levels in a rat model of depression. Furthermore, the application of GluCEST imaging may provide a deeper insight into the neurochemical involvement of glutamate in various psychiatric disorders.

AB  - This is the first study to test the embryo transfer (ET) of hybrid embryos in Old World camelids and produces a live calf from a dromedary recipient. Hybrid embryos were collected from 7 dromedary and 10 Bactrian donors, with or without ovarian super-stimulation, and transferred to dromedary recipients. Pregnancy diagnosis was conducted on Day 10 post-ET by using the progesterone-ELISA test and trans-rectal ultrasonography at 1 and 2 months of gestation. The date of abortion, stillbirth, or normal calving for each pregnant recipient was recorded. Without ovarian super-stimulation, two and one recipients were pregnant at 10 days post-ET, from. Bactrian X. dromedary and. dromedary X. Bactrian, respectively. While at 2 months of gestation, only one recipient was diagnosed pregnant from. Bactrian X. dromedary. Response to ovarian super-stimulation was successful in all 4 of the tested dromedary donors and in 8 out of 10 Bactrian donors. Additionally, 4 super-stimulated Bactrian donors (40%) showed failure of ovulation. The number of super-stimulated developed follicles and recovered embryos was higher in dromedary donors compared to Bactrian donors. Ten and two recipients were diagnosed pregnant at 10 days post-ET for. Bactrian X. dromedary and. dromedary X. Bactrian, respectively. At 2 months of gestation, the number of pregnant recipients from. Bactrian X. dromedary was reduced to eight, while the two pregnant recipients from. dromedary X. Bactrian remained pregnant. Total early pregnancy loss at 2 months gestation for all transferred hybrid embryos, obtained with or without ovarian super-stimulation, was 4/15 (26.6%). One healthy male calf was born from a recipient, with a total gestation period of 383 days, that received an embryo from a Bactrian male and a dromedary donor. Stillbirth was observed in six cases after 10.5-12 months of gestation and three cases aborted between 7 and 9 months of gestation due to trypanosomiasis. In conclusion, ET of hybrid embryos in Old World camelids is successful. However, further studies are required to improve the outcome of this technology to be used for meat and milk production in camels.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS), a major genetic cause of intellectual disability, is characterized by numerous neurodevelopmental defects. Previous in vitro studies highlighted a relationship between bioenergetic dysfunction and reduced neurogenesis in progenitor cells from the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS, suggesting a critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodevelopmental alterations in DS. Recent in vivo studies in Ts65Dn mice showed that neonatal supplementation (Days P3-P15) with the polyphenol 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) fully restored hippocampal neurogenesis. The current study was aimed to establish whether brain mitochondrial bioenergetic defects are already present in Ts65Dn pups and whether early treatment with 7,8-DHF positively impacts on mitochondrial function. In the brain and cerebellum of P3 and P15 Ts65Dn pups we found a strong impairment in the oxidative phosphorylation apparatus, resulting in a deficit in mitochondrial ATP production and ATP content. Administration of 7,8-DHF (dose: 5 mg/kg/day) during Days P3-P15 fully restored bioenergetic dysfunction in Ts65Dn mice, reduced the levels of oxygen radicals and reinstated the hippocampal levels of PGC-1 alpha. No pharmacotherapy is available for DS. From current findings, 7,8-DHF emerges as a treatment with a good translational potential for improving mitochondrial bioenergetics and, thus, mitochondria-linked neurodevelopmental alterations in DS.

AB  - BackgroundNeural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation in the mammalian brain decreases to minimal levels postnatally. Nevertheless, neurogenic niches persist in the adult cortex and hippocampus in rodents, primates and humans, with adult NSC differentiation sharing key regulatory mechanisms with development. Adult neurogenesis impairments have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Addressing these impairments by using neurotrophic factors is a promising new avenue for therapeutic intervention based on neurogenesis. However, this possibility has been hindered by technical difficulties of using in-vivo models to conduct screens, including working with scarce NSCs in the adult brain and differences between human and mouse models or ethical limitations.MethodsHere, we use a combination of mouse and human stem cell models for comprehensive in-vitro characterization of a novel neurogenic compound, focusing on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. The ability of ENT-A011, a steroidal dehydroepiandrosterone derivative, to activate the tyrosine receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor was tested through western blotting in NIH-3T3 cells and its neurogenic and neuroprotective action were assessed through proliferation, cell death and Amyloid-beta (A beta) toxicity assays in mouse primary adult hippocampal NSCs, mouse embryonic cortical NSCs and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from three human induced pluripotent stem cell lines from healthy and AD donors. RNA-seq profiling was used to assess if the compound acts through the same gene network as BDNF in human NPCs.ResultsENT-A011 was able to increase proliferation of mouse primary adult hippocampal NSCs and embryonic cortical NSCs, in the absence of EGF/FGF, while reducing A beta-induced cell death, acting selectively through TrkB activation. The compound was able to increase astrocytic gene markers involved in NSC maintenance, protect hippocampal neurons from Alpha beta toxicity and prevent synapse loss after A beta treatment. ENT-A011 successfully induces proliferation and prevents cell death after A beta toxicity in human NPCs, acting through a core gene network shared with BDNF as shown through RNA-seq.ConclusionsOur work characterizes a novel BDNF mimetic with preferable pharmacological properties and neurogenic and neuroprotective actions in Alzheimer's disease via stem cell-based screening, demonstrating the promise of stem cell systems for short-listing competitive candidates for further testing.

AB  - Cancer is considered as one of the main causes of human deaths and a global health challenge. Despite the therapeutic and diagnostic progresses, there is a high rate of mortality among cancer patients. Late diagnosis is one of the most important reasons of high mortality rate, which is mainly due to the lack of efficient and noninvasive diagnostic methods to monitor cancer patients. Therefore, the introduction of non-invasive markers can play an effective role in the early diagnosis and better therapeutic management in these patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have critical functions in regulation of various physiological and pathophysiological cellular processes. Deregulation of miRNAs has been frequently reported in different tumor types. On the other hand, due to the high stability of these factors in body fluids, these factors can be used as the non-invasive tumor markers. In this study, for the first time, we discussed the role of miR-185 during tumor progression. It has been reported that miR-185 mainly functions as a tumor suppressor through the regulation of PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, TGF-& beta;, Hippo, and WNT signaling pathways as well as the transcription factors and cell cycle components. PI3K/AKT was reported as the main oncogenic signaling pathway that can be inhibited by miR-185 during tumor progression. Therefore, miR-185/PI3K/AKT axis can be suggested as a probable target in tumor therapy that requires further animal studies. The present review can be an effective step towards introducing the miR-185 as a non-invasive diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target in cancer patients.

AB  - The hippo signaling pathway plays an essential role in controlling organ size and balancing tissue homeostasis. Its two main effectors, yes-associated protein (YAP) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1, WWTR1 or TAZ, have also been shown to regulate endothelial cell functions and angiogenesis. In this study, the functions of YAP and TAZ in human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were investigated by a loss-of-function study using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockdown (KD). Depletion of either YAP or TAZ reduced EPC survival and impaired many of their critical functions, including migration, invasion, vessel-formation, and expression of pro-angiogenic genes. Notably, TAZ-KD EPCs exhibited more severe phenotypes in comparison to YAP-KD EPCs. Moreover, the conditioned medium derived from TAZ-KD EPCs reduced the survivability of human lung cancer cells and increased their sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. The overexpression of either wild-type or constitutively active TAZ rescued the impaired phenotypes of TAZ-KD EPCs and restored the expression of pro-angiogenic genes in those EPCs. In summary, we demonstrate the crucial role of Hippo signaling components, YAP and TAZ, in controlling several aspects of EPC functions that can potentially be used as a drug target to enhance EPC functions in patients.

AB  - The extraction process of alcohol-insoluble polysaccharides from exhausted Moradyn cob (Zea mays L. cv. Moradyn) (EMCP), camelina cake (Camelina sativa L. Crantz) (CCP), and common bean seeds (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) (CBP) was investigated and optimized by Response Surface Methodology. Each fraction was tested at different core/carrier ratios in the encapsulation of Moradyn cob extract (MCE), a rich source of antioxidant anthocyanins, and the obtained ingredients were screened for their encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and extraction process sustainability. The ingredients containing 50% and 75% CCP had EE% higher than 60% and 80%, respectively, and were selected for further studies. Preliminary structural analysis indicated CCP was mostly composed of neutral polysaccharides and proteins in a random-coiled conformation, which was also unchanged in the ingredients. CCP-stabilizing properties were tested, applying an innovative stress testing protocol. CCP strongly improved MCE anthocyanins solid-state stability (25 degrees C, 30% RH), and therefore it could be an innovative anthocyanins carrier system.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on healthcare systems worldwide, with severe consequences on the global economy and society. The clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe disease and death. Coinfection with other respiratory pathogens in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals may exacerbate symptom severity and lead to poorer clinical outcomes. Background/Objectives: This study is the first to investigate the prevalence of viral and bacterial co-infections in SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals in Cyprus. Methods: A total of 1111 SARS-CoV-2-positive nasopharyngeal swab samples collected from non-hospitalized patients were analyzed for the presence of 18 viral and 3 bacterial respiratory pathogens. Results: Of these, 51 samples (4.6%) were found to have at least one additional respiratory pathogen. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 28; 2.5%) and adenovirus (n = 8; 0.7%), while the bacterial pathogens identified were Legionella pneumophila (n = 1; 0.1%) and Bordetella pertussis (n = 1; 0.1%). The highest proportion of co-infections was observed in the youngest age group (<10 years), where 52.9% of co-infections were identified, followed by the 30-39 age group, which accounted for 15.7% of cases. Among single respiratory virus co-infections, rhinovirus/enterovirus (27.5%) and adenovirus (13.7%) were the most frequently detected in the <10 age group, followed by RSV (3.9%), bocavirus, influenza B, HMPV A + B, and coronavirus NL63 (each at 2%). Conclusions: The current study underscores the importance of simultaneous testing for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens, as this may have significant implications for both individual patient care and healthcare services.

AB  - Epilepsies are neurological disorders characterized by chronic seizures and their related neuropsychiatric comorbidities, such as anxiety. The Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid type-1 (TRPV1) channel has been implicated in the modulation of seizures and anxiety-like behaviors in preclinical models. Here, we investigated the impact of chronic epileptic seizures in anxiety-like behavior and TRPV1 channels expression in a genetic model of epilepsy, the Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain. WARs were submitted to audiogenic kindling (AK), a preclinical model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and behavioral tests were performed in the open-field (OF), and light-dark box (LDB) tests 24 h after AK. WARs displayed increased anxiety-like behavior and TRPV1R expression in the hippocampal CA1 area and basolateral amygdala nucleus (BLA) when compared to control Wistar rats. Chronic seizures increased anxiety-like behaviors and TRPV1 and FosB expression in limbic and brainstem structures involved with epilepsy and anxiety comorbidity, such as the hippocampus, superior colliculus, and periaqueductal gray matter. Therefore, these results highlight previously unrecognized alterations in TRPV1 expression in brain structures involved with TLE and anxiogenic-like behaviors in a genetic model of epilepsy, the WAR strain, supporting an important role of TRPV1 in the modulation of neurological disorders and associated neuropsychiatric comorbidities.

AB  - Background: Frequent episodes of nasal symptoms are the usual clinical manifestations (CM) of allergic rhinitis (AR) and have a significant negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adolescents. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to test the hypothesis that cytokines in nasal mucus may be associated with HRQoL in adolescents with AR. Methods: European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 3 Level Version (EQ-5D-3L), "The Adolescent Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire" (AdolRQLQ) and the Total 4 Symptom Score (T4SS) scoring system were administered to 113 adolescents with AR, nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) and to healthy control subjects. Nasal secretions were sampled and tested for 13 cytokines using a multiplex flow cytometric bead assay. Results: The AR group had significantly lower EQ-5D-3L (0.661 +/- 0.267 vs. 0.943 +/- 0.088; p < 0.001) and higher AdolRQLQ total scores (2.76 +/- 1.01 vs. 1.02 +/- 0.10; p < 0.001) compared to the control group. The AR group had higher concentrations of IL-1 beta (p = 0.002), IL-6 (p = 0.031), IL-8 (p < 0.001), IL17-A (p = 0.013) and IL-18 (p = 0.014) compared to the control group, and IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL17-A and IL-18 were significantly (p < 0.050) increased with disease progression. Cytokines IL-1 beta, IL-6, as well as severe CM, were identified as significant predictors of lower HRQoL in adolescents with AR. Conclusions: This study identified IL-1 beta, IL-6, as well as severe CM, as predictors of lower HRQoL in adolescents with AR. However, these results should only serve as a starting point for additional confirmation research.

AB  - Purpose: The goal of regenerative medicine is to replace or restore missing, dysfunctional, or damaged cells, tissues and organs of a person to reproduce their normal function. The main approaches are cell therapy, tissue engineering, and gene therapy. Postnatal neural crest-derived multipotent stem cells (NC-MSC) are a promising cell type for use in regenerative medicine. This is due to the specific features of their embryonic origin and the role of the neural crest in phylogeny and ontogeny of vertebrates.Methods: The study used research in vitro culture (monolayer cell culture, 3D culture based on hydrogels, organotypic culture of hippocampal slices, spherogenesis, directed differentiation); flow cytometry; cytochemical, immune-cytochemical and histomorphometric analysis; molecular genetic (RNA (ribonucleic acid) isolation, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) with reverse transcription, real-time PCR, nucleic acid electrophoresis); microscopy (transmitted light, phase contrast, fluorescent, confocal laser scanning); microsurgical; statistical analysis.Results: In this systematic review, the results showed that recently the neural crest-derived cells have been isolated from a wide range of tissues and organs of mammals at the postnatal stage of development. These cells, at least in vitro, demonstrate the ability to self-repair and multilinear differentiation into neurons, Schwann cells, melanocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and other types of cells, that is, according to their functional characteristics, they are multipotent stem cells.Conclusion: According to the obtained results, tissue sources of postnatal neural crest-derived multipotent stem cells differ considerably in the degree of invasiveness of biopsy sampling, as well as the possibility of obtaining a homogeneous population of NC-MSCs, which is important for further clinical use.

However, delineating structural amygdala plasticity in both normal and disease-related contexts using neuroimaging has been hampered by the difficulty of unequivocally identifying the boundaries of the BLA. This challenge is a result of the poor contrast between BLA and the surrounding gray matter, including other amygdala nuclei. Here, we describe a novel diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) approach to enhance contrast, enabling the optimal identification of BLA in the rodent brain from magnetic resonance (MR) images. We employed this methodology together with a slice-shifting approach to accurately measure BLA volumes. We then validated the results by direct comparison to both histological and cellular-identity (parvalbumin)-based conventional techniques for defining BLA in the same brains used for MRI. We also confirmed BLA connectivity targets using DTI-based tractography. The novel approach enables the accurate and reliable delineation of BLA. Because this nucleus is involved in and changed by developmental, degenerative and adaptive processes, the instruments provided here should be highly useful to a broad range of neuroimaging studies. Finally, the principles used here are readily applicable to numerous brain regions and across species.

AB  - Background: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of drug-resistant epilepsy, often associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS), which involves selective neuronal loss in the Cornu Ammonis subregion 1 CA1 and CA4 regions of the hippocampus. Granule cells show migration and mossy fiber sprouting, though the mechanisms remain unclear. Microglia play a role in neurogenesis and synaptic modulation, suggesting they may contribute to epilepsy. This study examines the role of microglia and axonal guidance molecules in neuronal reorganization in TLE. Methods: Nineteen hippocampal samples from patients with TLE undergoing epilepsy surgery were analyzed. Microglial activity (M1/M2-like microglia) and neuronal guidance molecules were assessed using microscopy and semi-automated techniques. Gene expression was evaluated using the nCounter Expression Profiling method. Results: Neuronal cell loss was correlated with decreased activity of the M1 microglial phenotype. In the CA2 region, neuronal preservation was linked to increased mossy fiber sprouting and microglial presence. Neuronal markers such as Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) and Synaptopodin were reduced in areas of cell death, while Netrin-1 was elevated in the granule cell layer, potentially influencing mossy fiber sprouting. The nCounter analysis revealed downregulation of genes involved in neuronal activity (e.g., NPAS4, BCL-2, GRIA1) and upregulation of I kappa B, indicating reduced neuroinflammation. Conclusions: This study suggests reduced neuroinflammation in areas of neuronal loss, while regions with preserved neurons showed mossy fiber sprouting associated with microglia, Netrin-1, and DCC.

AB  - Nitric oxide (NO) is a key diffusible messenger in the mammalian brain. It has been proposed that NO may diffuse in retrograde into presynaptic terminals, contributing to the induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). Here, we present novel evidence that NO is selectively required for the synaptic potentiation of the interhemispheric projection in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Unilateral low-frequency stimulation (LFS) induced a short-term synaptic potentiation on the contralateral ACC through the corpus callosum (CC). The use of the antagonists of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), or the inhibitor of the L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCCs), blocked the induction of this ACC-ACC potentiation. In addition, the inhibitor of NO synthase, or inhibitors for its downstream signaling pathway, also blocked this ACC-ACC potentiation. However, the application of the NOS inhibitor blocked neither the local electric stimulation-induced LTP nor the stimulation-induced recruitment of silent responses. Our results present strong evidence for the pathway-selective roles of NO in the LTP of the ACC.

AB  - Background: the general lifespan has been prolonged greatly during the past century, and the incidence of age-associated diseases, including neurodegenerative ones, has increased as well. However, modelling of age-related pathologies is mostly conducted on adult rodents. We studied morphofunctional changes in the brain and peripheral blood of adult Wistar rats in comparison with old Wistar rats to determine age-related physiological changes and differences in adaptive reactions to AlCl3 exposure. Methods: the work was performed on adult and old male Wistar rats. The animals consumed a 100 mg/kg solution of AlCl3 each day for 60 days. Morphological changes of neurons and microglia, mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation markers, amyloid-related proteins, and hallmarks of cellular senescence, monocyte, and lymphocyte subpopulations in the peripheral blood were examined. Results: old rats showed increasing hyperchromic neurons in the hippocampus; activation of microglia; upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cellular senescence markers; downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines; and Hif-1a and a decrease in B-cells and monocyte in peripheral blood. Conclusion: compared to young animals, aged rats respond to aluminum exposure with a severe decline of most cells' function and irreversible neuronal loss. Regarding all reported data, neurodegeneration modelling and investigating of factors capable of accelerating or preventing it should be performed in experimental work on aged animals.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and long bone fractures are a common injury pattern in polytrauma patients and modulate each other's healing process. As only a limited number of studies have investigated both traumatic sites, we tested the hypothesis that brain-bone polytrauma mutually impacts neuro- and osteopathological outcomes. Adult female C57BL/6N mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI), and/or osteosynthetic stabilized femoral fracture (FF), or sham surgery. Neuromotor and behavioral impairments were assessed by neurological severity score, open field test, rotarod test, and elevated plus maze test. Brain and bone tissues were processed 42 days after trauma. CCI+FF polytrauma mice had increased bone formation as compared to FF mice and increased mRNA expression of bone sialoprotein (BSP). Bone fractures did not aggravate neuropathology or neuroinflammation assessed by cerebral lesion size, hippocampal integrity, astrocyte and microglia activation, and gene expression. Behavioral assessments demonstrated an overall impaired recovery of neuromotor function and persistent abnormalities in anxiety-related behavior in polytrauma mice. This study shows enhanced bone healing, impaired neuromotor recovery and anxiety-like behavior in a brain-bone polytrauma model. However, bone fractures did not aggravate TBI-evoked neuropathology, suggesting the existence of outcome-relevant mechanisms independent of the extent of brain structural damage and neuroinflammation.

AB  - Background: We sought to investigate the interaction between signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the Yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathway in human small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells. Methods: The STAT3-overexpressing SCLC cell lines H146 and H446 were established by plasmid DNA transfection for in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results: Overexpression of STAT3 increased YAP protein expression in H146 and H446 cells. STAT3 overexpression significantly increased YAP mRNA expression and the mRNA expression of the YAP signaling downstream genes CTGF and CYR61 in H146 and H446 cells (p < 0.05). We showed that STAT3 overexpression promoted EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) with increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP9 expression. Transwell assays showed that STAT3 overexpression increased the invasion ability of H146 and H446 cells. In addition, STAT3-overexpressing H146 cells grew significantly more rapidly than control H146 cells in the xenograft mouse model (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and Western blotting (WB) showed that STAT3-overexpressing H146 tumors had increased p-STAT3 and YAP staining and protein expression compared with control tumors. Increased EMT was also observed in STAT3-overexpressed xenograft tumors. Conclusions: The results of our study suggest that the overexpression of STAT3 promotes SCLC EMT, invasion, and proliferation through the activation of the YAP signaling pathway.

AB  - A novel, eco-friendly, and biocompatible method was applied to form silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in great water dock (Lapathi radix) (KB) and pu-erh (Camellia sinensis) (PE) extracts. The surface plasma resonance peak of green synthesized AgNPs at 451.8 nm for AgNPs+KB and 440.8 nm for AgNPs+PE was observed via spectral analysis of UV absorbance. In this study, double-layered biopolymer films (FUR/CHIT+HGEL) with AgNPs incorporated in KB solution (AgNPs+KB) and AgNPs in PE solution (AgNPs+PE), were successfully prepared using the casting method. The SEM, XRD, zeta potential and size analyses confirmed the presence of AgNP in the films. The addition of AgNPs in plant extracts improved antimicrobial and antioxidant activity and thermal stability, whereas WVTR experienced a decrease. The nanocomposite films' orange-brown colour may aid in the protection of food products against UV rays. The composite films demonstrated antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens and may offer potential in food packaging applications.

AB  - The key to preventing mCRPC progression is understanding how androgen-dependent PCa cells progress to independence and modify their transcriptional repertoire accordingly. We recently identified a novel axis of the Hippo pathway characterized by the sequential kinase cascade induced by androgen deprivation, AR(-)>TLK1B>NEK1>pYAP1-Y407, leading to CRPC adaptation. Phosphorylation of YAP1-Y407 increases upon ADT or induction of DNA damage, correlated with the known increase in NEK1 expression/activity, and this is suppressed in the Y407F mutant. Dominant expression of YAP1-Y407F in Hek293 cells reprograms the YAP1-mediated transcriptome to reduce TEAD- and p73-regulated gene expression and mediates sensitivity to MMC. NEK1 haploinsufficient TRAMP mice display reduced YAP1 expression and, if castrated, fail to progress to overt prostate carcinomas, even while displaying reduced E-Cadherin (E-Cad) expression in hyperplastic ductules. YAP1 overexpression, but not the Y407F mutant, transforms LNCaP cells to androgen-independent growth with a mesenchymal morphology. Immunohistochemical examination of prostate cancer biopsies revealed that the pYAP1-Y407 nuclear signal is low in samples of low-grade cancer but elevated in high GS specimens. We also found that J54, a pharmacological inhibitor of the TLK1>NEK1>YAP1 nexus leading to degradation of YAP1, can suppress the transcriptional reprogramming of LNCaP cells to androgen-independent growth and EMT progression, even when YAP1-WT is overexpressed.

AB  - A specific predictive tool of allergen immunotherapy (AIT) outcome has not been identified yet. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a disease score referred to as Predictive Response to Immunotherapy Score (PRIS) to predict the response to AIT and identify eligible patients. A total of 110 patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis with or without concomitant asthma were enrolled in this study. Before beginning sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT), patients were evaluated by analyzing clinical and laboratory parameters. A specific rating was assigned to each parameter to be combined in a total score named PRIS. At baseline (T0) and follow-up [after 12 (T12) and 24 months (T24) of SLIT], a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to calculate a mean symptom score (MSS). Finally, the percentage variation between the MSS at T0 and at T12 [Delta MSS-12(%)] and T24 [Delta MSS-24 (%)] was measured. We observed a significant improvement of symptoms at T12 and T24 compared to T0 in all groups undergoing SLIT. PRIS was effective in predicting Delta MSS-24 (%) in patients treated with single-allergen SLIT. In addition, PRIS was effective in predicting Delta MSS-24 (%) in both patients with only rhinitis and with concomitant asthma. PRIS assessment can represent a useful tool to individuate potential responders before SLIT prescription.

AB  - Tandem of P domains in a weak inwardly rectifying K+ channel (TWIK)-related acid sensitive K+-1 channel (TASK-1) is an outwardly rectifying K+ channel that acts in response to extracellular pH. TASK-1 is upregulated in the astrocytes (particularly in the CA1 region) of the hippocampi of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and chronically epilepsy rats. Since levetiracetam (LEV) is an effective inhibitor for carbonic anhydrase, which has a pivotal role in buffering of extracellular pH, it is likely that the anti-epileptic action of LEV may be relevant to TASK-1 inhibition, which remains to be elusive. In the present study, we found that LEV diminished the upregulated TASK-1 expression in the CA1 astrocytes of responders (whose seizure activities were responsive to LEV), but not non-responders (whose seizure activities were not controlled by LEV) in chronically epileptic rats. ML365 (a selective TASK-1 inhibitor) only reduced seizure duration in LEV nonresponders, concomitant with astroglial TASK-1 downregulation. Furthermore, ML365 co-treatment with LEV decreased the duration, frequency and severity of spontaneous seizures in non-responders to LEV. To the best of our knowledge, our findings suggest, for the first time, that the up-regulation of TASK-1 expression in CA1 astrocytes may be involved in refractory seizures in response to LEV. This may be a potential target to improve responsiveness to LEV.

AB  - Potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) include amyloid beta(1-42) (A beta(1-42)), t-Tau, p-Tau(181), neurofilament light chain (NFL), and neuroimaging biomarkers. Their combined use is useful for diagnosing and monitoring the progress of AD. Therefore, further development of a combination of these biomarkers is essential. We investigated whether plasma NFL/A beta(1-42) can serve as a plasma-based primary screening biomarker reflecting brain neurodegeneration and amyloid pathology in AD for monitoring disease progression and early diagnosis. We measured the NFL and A beta(1-42) concentrations in the CSF and plasma samples and performed correlation analysis to evaluate the utility of these biomarkers in the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD spectrum disease progression. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to analyse the associations between the fluid biomarkers and neuroimaging data. The study included 136 participants, classified into five groups: 28 cognitively normal individuals, 23 patients with preclinical AD, 22 amyloid-negative patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment, 32 patients with prodromal AD, and 31 patients with AD dementia. With disease progression, the NFL concentrations increased and A beta(1-42) concentrations decreased. The plasma and CSF NFL/A beta(1-42) were strongly correlated (r = 0.558). Plasma NFL/A beta(1-42) was strongly correlated with hippocampal volume/intracranial volume (r = 0.409). In early AD, plasma NFL/A beta(1-42) was associated with higher diagnostic accuracy than the individual biomarkers. Moreover, in preclinical AD, plasma NFL/A beta(1-42) changed more rapidly than the CSF t-Tau or p-Tau(181) concentrations. Our findings highlight the utility of plasma NFL/A beta(1-42) as a non-invasive plasma-based biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of AD spectrum disease progression.

AB  - The present study aimed to characterize the microstructure of a temporary 3D printing polymer-based composite material (Resilab Temp), evaluating its optical properties and mechanical behavior according to different post-curing times. For the analysis of the surface microstructure and establishment of the best printing pattern, samples in bar format following ISO 4049 (25 x 10 x 3 mm) were designed in CAD software (Rhinoceros 6.0), printed on a W3D printer (Wilcos), and light-cured in Anycubic Photon for different lengths of time (no post-curing, 16 min, 32 min, and 60 min). For the structural characterization, analyses were carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The mechanical behavior of this polymer-based composite material was determined based on flexural strength tests and Knoop microhardness. Color and translucency analysis were performed using a spectrophotometer (VITA Easy Shade Advanced 4.0), which was then evaluated in CIELab, using gray, black, and white backgrounds. All analyses were performed immediately after making the samples and repeated after thermal aging over two thousand cycles (5-55 degrees C). The results obtained were statistically analyzed with a significance level of 5%. FT-IR analysis showed about a 46% degree of conversion on the surface and 37% in the center of the resin sample. The flexural strength was higher for the groups polymerized for 32 min and 1 h, while the Knoop microhardness did not show a statistical difference between the groups. Color and translucency analysis also did not show statistical differences between groups. According to all of the analyses carried out in this study, for the evaluated material, a post-polymerization time of 1 h should be suggested to improve the mechanical performance of 3D-printed devices.

AB  - Because there is a lack of wood resources in many countries, this work focused on pulp and paper production from the waste and agricultural residues of non-wood plants. The work aimed to pulp the nitrate-alkaline of black mustard (Brassica Nigra L.) and camelina (Camelina Sativa L.). The black mustard and the camelina were selected due to the expanding planted areas of these crops in the Czech Republic. To characterize the chemical composition of black mustard and camelina, cellulose, lignin, ash, and extractives were determined. Raw alpha-cellulose, beta-cellulose, and gamma-cellulose were also measured. The results showed that the content of lignin in non-wood plants is lower than that in softwoods. The cooked pulp was characterized by the delignification degree-Kappa number. Additionally, handsheet papers were made for selected samples of pulp. The handsheet papers were characterized by tensile index, breaking length, and smoothness and compared with commonly available papers.

AB  - The danger from the content of dyes produced by textile-industry waste can cause environmental degradation when not appropriately treated. However, existing waste-treatment methods have not been effective in degrading dyes in textile waste. Zero-valent iron (ZVI), which has been widely used for wastewater treatment, needs to be developed to acquire effective green production. Tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves contain many polyphenolic compounds used as natural reducing agents. Therefore, this study aims to synthesize ZVI using biological reducing agents from tea-leaf extract and apply the Fenton method to degrade the color mixture of rhodamine B and methyl orange. The results show that the highest polyphenols were obtained from tea extract by heating to 90 degrees C for 80 min. Furthermore, PSA results show that ZVI had a homogeneous size of iron and tea extract at a volume ratio of 1:3. The SEM-EDS results show that all samples had agglomerated particles. The ZVI 1:1 showed the best results, with a 100% decrease in the color intensity of the dye mixture for 60 min of reaction and a degradation percentage of 100% and 66.47% for rhodamine B and methyl orange from LC-MS analysis, respectively. Finally, the decrease in COD value by ZVI was 92.11%, higher than the 47.36% decrease obtained using Fe(II).

AB  - With the increasing requirement for asphalt modification, a new environmentally friendly asphalt modifier is needed. In this study, three varieties of biomass, cotton seed (CO), camelia seed shell (CA), and coffee ground (CG), were chosen for biochar preparation and asphalt modification to find an environmentally friendly asphalt modifier. A segregation test was applied to evaluate the storage stability of the modified asphalt. A dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) temperature sweep and frequency sweep were used to characterize the high-temperature performance. The low-temperature performance was evaluated by the bending beam rheometer (BBR) test. The DSR results indicate that the rutting factor increase for modified asphalt at high temperatures is CO approximate to CG > CA, and a high temperature could reflect the biochar's properties better in modified asphalt. Furthermore, the low-temperature deterioration is well controlled in CO and CA biochar-modified asphalt. Finally, the volatile organic compound (VOC) emission behavior was evaluated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

AB  - Aims: IL-12B, a subunit of the IL-23 family of cytokines, plays a crucial role in various diseases such as viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and tumors. This study aimed to identify high-affinity nanobodies that bind to distinct epitopes of IL-12B to and assess their potential for therapeutic and diagnostic applications, particularly through fluorescence resonance energy transfer(FRET) to evaluate their ability to target IL-12B. Methods: IL-12B protein was expressed in eukaryotic cells and used to immunize camels to induce an immune response. Camel-derived anti-IL-12B nanobodies were isolated and screened via phage display to identify those with high specificity and affinity for IL-12B. Binding affinity and epitope interactions were further analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ForteBio Octet assays. A FRET-based assay was developed to evaluate protein interactions for precise therapeutic targeting. Results: Several high-affinity nanobodies targeting IL-12B were successfully generated. These nanobodies exhibited strong binding to various epitopes of IL-12B. Screening by HPLC and ForteBio Octet confirmed their high specificity and affinity, while fluorescence analysis demonstrated efficient energy transfer between thenanobodies, indicating successful interactions. Conclusions: This study identified high-affinity nanobodies against IL-12B and used FRET to characterize their interactions. These nanobodies show promise for therapeutic potential targeting IL-12B-related diseases, including viral infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. However, further clinical studies are needed to fully explore their potential for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

AB  - Anaerobic fungi (Neocallimastigomycetes) found in the guts of herbivores are biomass deconstruction specialists with a remarkable ability to extract sugars from recalcitrant plant material. Anaerobic fungi, as well as many species of anaerobic bacteria, deploy multi-enzyme complexes called cellulosomes, which modularly tether together hydrolytic enzymes, to accelerate biomass hydrolysis. While the majority of genomically encoded cellulosomal genes in Neocallimastigomycetes are biomass degrading enzymes, the second largest family of cel-lulosomal genes encode spore coat CotH domains, whose contribution to fungal cellulosome and/or cellular function is unknown. Structural bioinformatics of CotH proteins from the anaerobic fungus Piromyces finnis shows anaerobic fungal CotH domains conserve key ATP and Mg2+ binding motifs from bacterial Bacillus CotH proteins known to act as protein kinases. Experimental characterization further demonstrates ATP hydrolysis activity in the presence and absence of substrate from two cellulosomal P. finnis CotH proteins when recombinantly pro-duced in E. coli. These results present foundational evidence for CotH activity in anaerobic fungi and provide a path towards elucidating the functional contribution of this protein family to fungal cellulosome assembly and activity.

AB  - IL(interleukin)-6 is a multifunctional cytokine crucial for immunological, hematopoiesis, inflammation, and bone metabolism. Strikingly, IL-6 has been shown to significantly contribute to the initiation of cytokine storm-an acute systemic inflammatory syndrome in Covid-19 patients. Recent study has showed that blocking the IL-6 signaling pathway with an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (mAb) can reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and enhance patient survival. However, the mAb has several drawbacks, such as high cost, potential immunogenicity, and invasive administration due to the large-molecule protein product. Instead, these issues could be mitigated using small molecule IL-6 inhibitors, but none are currently available. This study aimed to discover IL-6 inhibitors based on the PPI with a novel camelid Fab fragment, namely 68F2, in a crystal protein complex structure (PDB ID: 4ZS7). The pharmacophore models and molecular docking were used to screen compounds from DrugBank databases. The oral bioavailability of the top 24 ligands from the screening was predicted by the SwissAMDE tool. Subsequently, the selected molecules from docking and MD simulation illustrated a promising binding affinity in the formation of stable complexes at the active binding pocket of IL-6. Binding energies using the MM-PBSA technique were applied to the top 4 hit compounds. The result indicated that DB08402 and DB12903 could form strong interactions and build stable protein-ligand complexes with IL-6. These potential compounds may serve as a basis for further developing small molecule IL-6 inhibitors in the future.

AB  - Peony seed meal is a very important feed protein raw material with a high potential for development; however, the presence of some anti-nutritional factors, such as saponins, reduces its reusability. This study aimed to establish ideal microbial fermentation conditions for the degradation of saponins in peony seed meal for its subsequent use in poultry feed. First, saponins were extracted via two methods: ethanol extraction and reflux. Then, response surface methodology and orthogonal array testing were used to establish the optimal conditions for the degradation of saponins by (a) liquid fermentation of single bacteria, (b) liquid fermentation of compound bacteria, and (c) solid-state fermentation. The degradation efficiencies were 40.21% (+/- 1.62), 59.82% (+/- 1.54), and 69.31% (+/- 2.95), respectively. The maximum degradation was obtained via solid-state fermentation, and the soluble protein content for this fermentation product was found to be 14% higher than that of unfermented peony seed meal.

AB  - The Hippo signaling pathway inhibits cell growth, and its components and functions are highly conserved in mammals. LATS1 is a core component of the Hippo signaling pathway associated with lymphatic invasion, astrogliosis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Nevertheless, the role of Hippo/LATS1 in osteogenesis remains unclear. In this study, we used ribonucleic acid (RNA) lentiviruses to inhibit the expression of Lats1 in bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) and distraction osteogenic regions in rats. Increased osteogenic, proliferative, and migratory abilities of BMSCs were observed in Lats1-inhibited BMSCs, while these phenotypes were partially reversed by YAP1 inhibition. In vivo, we found that the LATS1/YAP1 axis promoted osteogenesis during distraction osteogenesis (DO). beta-catenin was positively correlated with YAP1 expression in vivo and in vitro. When YAP1 was strongly positive in the nucleus, beta-catenin expression was upregulated; when YAP1 expression was inhibited by verteporfin, beta-catenin was not expressed in the nucleus. These findings suggest that the LATS1/YAP1 signaling axis promotes DO by activating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanism of osteogenesis and a potential therapeutic strategy for bone regeneration in DO by associating with LATS1/YAP1-beta-catenin.

AB  - Aims To date, stroke remains one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Nearly three-quarters of all strokes occur in the elderly (>65-years-old), and a vast majority of these individuals develop debilitating cognitive impairments that can later progress into dementia. Currently there are no therapies capable of reversing the cognitive complications which arise following a stroke. Instead, current treatment options focus on preventing secondary injuries, as opposed to improving functional recovery. Methods We reconstituted aged (20-month-old) mice with Sca-1 (+) bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells isolated from aged or young (2-month-old) EGFP (+) donor mice. Three months later the chimeric aged mice underwent cerebral ischemia/reperfusion by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (BCCAO), after which cognitive function was evaluated. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to evaluate host and recipient cells in the brain following BCCAO. Results Young Sca-1 (+) cells migrate to the aged brain and give rise to beneficial microglial-like cells that ameliorate stroke-induced loss of cognitive function on tasks targeting the hippocampus and cerebellum. We also found that young Sca-1 (+) cell-derived microglial-like cells possess neuroprotective properties as they do not undergo microgliosis upon migrating to the ischemic hippocampus, whereas the cells originating from old Sca-1 (+) cells proliferate extensively and skew towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype following injury. Conclusions This study provides a proof-of-principle demonstrating that young BM Sca-1 (+) cells play a pivotal role in reversing stroke-induced cognitive impairments and protect the aged brain against secondary injury by attenuating the host cell response to injury.

AB  - Secondary metabolites in plants influence the health of herbivores such as Japanese rock ptarmigans that feed on the leaves and fruits of alpine plants. Thus, it is important to understand the secondary metabolites of alpine plants and their biological activities for conserving Japanese rock ptarmigans. We isolated C-methylflavone from the leaves of Kalmia procumbens, on which Japanese rock ptarmigans feed. Although its structure was deduced to be 8-demethyleucalyptin by comparing its nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data with the reported ones, the possibility that the isolated compound is 6-demethyleucalyptin cannot be ruled out. Thus, both isomers were synthesized. The isolated compound was unambiguously determined to be 8-demethyleucalyptin by comparing its NMR data with those of the synthetic ones. Cytotoxic evaluation of 8- and 6-demethyleucalyptins revealed that only the former showed cytotoxicity against HCT116 and MRC-5 cells. The present study provides not only easy access to 8- and 6-demethyleucalyptins, but also their biological information.

AB  - The high spread rate of SARS-CoV-2 virus has put the researchers all over the world in a demanding situation. The need of the hour is to develop novel learning algorithms that can effectively learn a general pattern by training with fewer genome sequences of coronavirus. Learning from very few training samples is necessary and important during the beginning of a disease outbreak when sequencing data is limited. This is because a successful detection and isolation of patients can curb the spread of the virus. However, this poses a huge challenge for machine learning and deep learning algorithms as they require huge amounts of training data to learn the pattern and distinguish from other closely related viruses. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm - Neurochaos Learning (NL) for classification of coronavirus genome sequence that addresses this specific problem. NL is inspired from the empirical evidence of chaos and non-linearity at the level of neurons in biological neural networks. The average sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for NL are 0.998, 0.999 and 0.998 respectively for the multiclass classification problem (SARS-CoV-2, Coronaviridae, Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus and Influenza) using leave one out crossvalidation. With just one training sample per class for 1000 independent random trials of training, we report an average macro F1-score > 0.99 for the classification of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 genome sequences. We compare the performance of NL with K-nearest neighbours (KNN), logistic regression, random forest, SVM, and naive Bayes classifiers. We foresee promising future applications in genome classification using NL with novel combinations of chaotic feature engineering and other machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Many neurological diseases are characterized by gradual deterioration of brain structure and function. Large longitudinal MRI datasets have revealed such deterioration, in part, by applying machine and deep learning to predict diagnosis. A popular approach is to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract informative features from each visit of the longitudinal MRI and then use those features to classify each visit via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Such modeling neglects the progressive nature of the disease, which may result in clinically implausible classifications across visits. To avoid this issue, we propose to combine features across visits by coupling feature extraction with a novel longitudinal pooling layer and enforce consistency of the classification across visits in line with disease progression. We evaluate the proposed method on the longitudinal structural MRIs from three neuroimaging datasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N = 404), a dataset composed of 274 normal controls and 329 patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and 255 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). In all three experiments our method is superior to other widely used approaches for longitudinal classification thus making a unique contribution towards more accurate tracking of the impact of conditions on the brain.

AB  - Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, cognitive impairments, and social withdrawal. It leads to a series of brain abnormalities, particularly the deformation of the hippocampus and amygdala, which are highly associated with emotion, memory, and motivation. Most previous studies have used the hippocampal and amygdaloid volume, whereas surface-based morphometry reflects nuclear deformation more finely, but it is unclear the hippocampal and amygdaloid morphometry relates to schizophrenic pathology and its potential as a biomarker. In this study, we extracted individual multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) of hippocampus and amygdala from MRI images and analyzed the morphometric differences between groups. After dictionary learning and max pooling, we obtain reduced dimensional features and use machine learning algorithms for individual diagnosis. The results showed that the hippocampus of the schizophrenia group was significantly atrophied bilaterally and the atrophied areas were symmetrical. Subregions of the amygdala are both atrophied and expanded, and in particular, the right amygdala shows a greater degree and extent of deformation. Using the random forest classifier, the accuracy of classification using hippocampal and amygdaloid morphometric features are 94.52% and 94.57%, respectively, and the accuracy of classification combining the two morphometric features reached 96.57%. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of MMS in identifying morphometric differences of the hippocampus and amygdala between healthy controls and schizophrenic, and these findings emphasize the potential of MMS as a reliable biomarker for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

TI  - FPLS-DC: functional partial least squares through distance covariance for imaging genetics

AB  - Motivation Imaging genetics integrates imaging and genetic techniques to examine how genetic variations influence the function and structure of organs like the brain or heart, providing insights into their impact on behavior and disease phenotypes. The use of organ-wide imaging endophenotypes has increasingly been used to identify potential genes associated with complex disorders. However, analyzing organ-wide imaging data alongside genetic data presents two significant challenges: high dimensionality and complex relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, nonlinear inference framework designed to partially mitigate these issues.Results We propose a functional partial least squares through distance covariance (FPLS-DC) framework for efficient genome wide analyses of imaging phenotypes. It consists of two components. The first component utilizes the FPLS-derived base functions to reduce image dimensionality while screening genetic markers. The second component maximizes the distance correlation between genetic markers and projected imaging data, which is a linear combination of the FPLS-basis functions, using simulated annealing algorithm. In addition, we proposed an iterative FPLS-DC method based on FPLS-DC framework, which effectively overcomes the influence of inter-gene correlation on inference analysis. We efficiently approximate the null distribution of test statistics using a gamma approximation. Compared to existing methods, FPLS-DC offers computational and statistical efficiency for handling large-scale imaging genetics. In real-world applications, our method successfully detected genetic variants associated with the hippocampus, demonstrating its value as a statistical toolbox for imaging genetic studies.Availability and implementation The FPLS-DC method we propose opens up new research avenues and offers valuable insights for analyzing functional and high-dimensional data. In addition, it serves as a useful tool for scientific analysis in practical applications within the field of imaging genetics research. The R package FPLS-DC is available in Github: https://github.com/BIG-S2/FPLSDC.
