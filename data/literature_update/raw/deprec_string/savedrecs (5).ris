AB  - Human pressures have increasingly placed keystone species, such as large cats, under threat. Together with forest loss, prey depletion is one of the main threats to the survival of jaguars (Panthera onca) and pumas (Puma concolor) throughout the Neotropics. Generally, primates are not considered main prey for jaguar and puma, and their inclusion in the diet could be indicative of ongoing prey species decline. Here, we investigate the effect of habitat type and disturbance on primate predation by large cats. Surveys took place during the dry seasons (March to June) of 2010 and 2011, covering a total of 608.5 km across 24 localities in the Uxpanapa Valley, Mexico. We found 65 felid scat samples with the aid of a wildlife scat detection dog, and then examined them to identify predator species and classify the prey remains they contained. Primates represented the most frequent prey (35%) for both jaguar and puma in our study site and constituted approximately half of the biomass consumed by these felines in the area. Primate remains were more likely to be found in scats surrounded by the lowest percentage of conserved forest or in areas surrounded by more villages, showing the potential effects of human activities on these species' populations. The high proportion of primates found in scats within our study site could be an early indication that populations of ungulates and other "typical" prey are beginning to collapse, and urgent conservation interventions are needed for both large cats and primates before they become locally extinct.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - Marine pollution introduces harmful substances into the ocean, affecting ecosystems, marine life, coastal communities, and the global economy. Classifying these pollutants is essential for identifying their sources and assessing their ecological impact. Computer vision techniques are used to automate analysis and enhance the accuracy of detecting and classifying marine pollutants as visual identification results in underreporting of pollutants. Sentinel-2 Multispectral images have very low visibility of pollutants. The proposed method uses (i)High quality Sentinel-2 multispectral thermal images generated by Stable Diffusion Thermal Image Generator highlights temperature variations for better classification (ii) Transverse Dyadic Wavelet Transform (TxDyWT) to preprocess the thermal images as it retains structural details for classifying pollutants.(iii) Denoising Convolutional Neural Network (DnCNN) optimized with Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm enhances images and Vision transformer (ViT) is employed to classify as microplastics, sediments and oil spills by identifying subtle patterns in pollutants. The proposed methodology identifies fragments of microplastics as small as 0.5 mm, large-scale oil spills, and hydrogenous sediments. The detection accuracy for microplastics, oil spills, and sediments is approximately 95%.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are the most widely applied tool for marine biodiversity conservation, yet many gaps remain in our understanding of their species-specific effects, partly because the socio-environmental context and spatial autocorrelation may blur and bias perceived conservation outcomes. Based on a large data set of nearly 3000 marine fish surveys spanning all tropical regions of the world, we build spatially explicit models for 658 fish species to estimate species-specific responses to protection while controlling for the environmental, habitat and socio-economic contexts experienced across their geographic ranges. We show that the species responses are highly variable, with similar to 40% of fishes not benefitting from protection. When investigating how traits influence species' responses, we find that rare top-predators and small herbivores benefit the most from MPAs while mid-trophic level species benefit to a lesser extent, and rare large herbivores experience adverse effects, indicating potential trophic cascades.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the interaction of EDs with both environmental and housing systems on the immune response of grazing/stall-fed goats. Chemical endocrine disruptors are reported to contaminate food chains. Some examples of ED chemicals are PFOS and glyphosate (GLY); both are reported to weaken immunity. Grazing, compared to stall feeding, results in a greater variety in diet and microorganisms' animals are exposed to, strengthening their immune system. An ex vivo model was used: blood samples from both grazing and stall-fed goats were exposed to EDs to assess their impact on the function of immune cells and cytokine production. Outcomes indicated that goats which were fed under stall, having an immune response that was previously compromised, were more susceptible to the combined effect of PFOS and GLY, reflecting a higher rate of increase in oxidative stress. However, regarding inflammatory cytokines, both grazing and stall-fed groups reflected similar effects. It also shows how important housing systems are to modulate the impact on livestock immunity because of EDs, in the general interest of animal health and the safety of food derived therefrom, since EDs could exert risks to human health through contaminated consumable animal products. Long-term effects of EDs have to be clearly understood among livestock, and methods ought to be worked out concerning how to minimize the presence of these risks.

AB  - Aim of study: To evaluate the response of dermal fibroblasts to heat stress and different time exposures on the cell survival and gene expression.Area of study: Bel & eacute;m city, Par & aacute; state. Brazil.Material and methods: Fibroblasts were isolated from ear skin of bovine (n= 4) and buffalo (n= 4), cultured in vitro until the 3(rd) passage and submitted to heat stress at 42 degrees C for 3, 6 and 12 h, except for the negative control (38.5 degrees C for 24 h). Cell survival was measured using Trypan blue, and RNA isolation was performed using Trizol method following qRT-PCR to quantify the relative expression of the inducible heat shock protein HSPA1A, the pro-apoptotic BAX and pro-inflammatory IFN-gamma genes.Main results: Heat stress induced in vitro affected the cell viability and gene expression in a time-dependent manner. Gene expression was relatively lower in buffalo (p<0.05) than in bovine. Until 3 h of heat stress, HSPA1A showed a slight increase in both bovine and buffaloes, and BAX was 5.82-fold greater in bovine (p<0.05). After 6 h, HSPA1A was 75.81-fold (p<0.0001) and INF-gamma was 20.15-fold greater (p<0.05) in bovine than buffalo. Only after 6 h the cell viability started to decrease significantly (p<0.05) in both species.Research highlights: Dermal fibroblasts of buffaloes and bovine were sensitive to heat stress induced in vitro, which was most detrimental to cell survival after 6 h. The expression of HSPA1A, BAX and INF-gamma genes in response to heat stress indicate a slight sensibility of the dermal fibroblasts of bovine compared to their buffalo counterpart.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to reduce the negative effects of object density when objects are counted via detection in aerial images. A novel image dataset was generated and used to fine-tune an existing object detection architecture. A novel video dataset was also generated and used for the development and testing of the proposed approach. The datasets consist of aerial images and videos of sheep with scenarios of tightly clustered and isolated individuals. This ensures both sparse and dense object distributions within our dataset. The proposed approach is compared to a proven detection-based counting baseline. In this work, it is explicitly shown that object density and classification probability have a linearly inverse relationship and that reductions in classification probabilities, caused by high densities, has a significantly negative impact on counting performance. The proposed approach uses density-based threshold shifting to improve counting performance, i.e. by dynamically adjusting the counting threshold, based on the density, we are able to improve counting performance. The proposed approach reduces the overall mean absolute error by 78.51% compared to the baseline on an unseen test dataset. It seamlessly integrates with most existing object detection or instance segmentation frameworks without any modifications. The proposed approach also reduces the sensitivity of the counting threshold selection, implying that competitive results can be achieved with minimal tuning. The code is made publicly available.(1)

AB  - Simple Summary Supplementation with a low dose (up to 500 FTU/kg feed) of a new 6-phytase, obtained by assembling gene sequences of various phytase-producing bacteria, increases phosphorous and calcium availability in phosphorus-limiting piglet diets. Therefore, this phytase can be used to reduce the use of unsustainable sources of inorganic phosphorous without compromising piglets' performance and bone mineralization and density, and the higher phosphorous utilization will also reduce its excretion to the environment. This study also demonstrates that the effects of phytase on bone density can be evaluated using computed tomography, which may be useful for studies with live animals. Phosphorus (P) is an essential mineral for growing piglets, which is poorly accessible in vegetable feedstuffs as it is stored as phytates. Thus, phytase supplementation is essential to increase P availability. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate a novel 6-phytase (EC 3.1.3.26) in weaned pigs fed low-P diets. In each experiment, one hundred and twenty piglets were fed a positive control (PC; adequate in Ca and P), a negative control (NC; limiting in Ca and P), or NC supplemented with 125, 250, or 500 FTU/kg of phytase (NC125, NC250, and NC500, respectively). P content was lower in diets of Experiment 1 than diets of Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, piglets offered PC or phytase diets had higher growth and efficiency compared with NC diets. In Experiment 2, similar effects were obtained, but the effects were less significant. In both experiments, P and Ca ATTD and bone density were significantly increased with phytase supplementation. Moreover, PC and NC500 had higher P concentrations and lower alkaline phosphatase activity in plasma than NC. To conclude, supplementation with the new 6-phytase at doses up to 500 FTU/kg enhanced P utilization, growth performance, and bone density in piglets fed P-limiting diets.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effects of non-permeable cryoprotectant, cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin, when added at different concentrations into cooled and frozen-thawed semen extended with Tris-citrate-fructose egg yolk glycerol and lecithin-based extenders.
   Methods: A total of 40 ejaculates from four buffalo bulls were collected using artificial vagina. Ejaculates were extended with one of Tris-citrate-fructose egg yolk glycerol and lecithin-based extenders which contained different concentrations [0 (control), 0.75, 1.50, 2.25 and 3.00 mg/mL] of cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin. The extended semen samples were cooled to 5 degrees C and then frozen slowly to -196 degrees C in 0.25 mL ministraws before being stored in liquid nitrogen pending its evaluation. Sperm motility, live sperm, normal sperm morphology, sperm membrane integrity and acrosome morphology were measured.
   Results: Supplementation of cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin improved progressive motility, viability, morphology and acrosome as well as plasma membrane integrities at 1.50-2.25 mg/mL depending upon types of used extenders and stages of pre- and post-freezing process (P<0.01). The best concentration was 1.50 mg/mL at pre-freeze stage and 2.25 mg/mL at post- freezing. However, greater concentration (3.00 mg/mL) of cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin had a detrimental effect compared to the control group with the two evaluated extenders (P<0.01).
   Conclusions: Cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin supplementation at 1.50-2.25 mg/mL concentration could improve pre-frozen and post-thawed buffalo sperm quality. The most suitable concentration is 1.50 mg/mL at pre-freeze stage and 2.25 mg/mL at post-freezing.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol is present in forage crops in concentrations that endanger animal welfare but is also found in cereal-based food. The amphipathic nature of mycotoxins allows them to cross the cell membrane and interacts with different cell organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes. In our study, we investigated the gene expression of several genes in vivo and in vitro that are related to the metabolism. We observed a significantly higher COX5B and MHCII expression in enterocytes of DON-fed pigs compared to CON-fed pigs and a marked increase in GAPDH and SLC7A11 in DON-fed pigs, but we could not confirm this in vitro in IPEC-1. In vitro, functional metabolic analyses were performed with a seahorse analyzer. A significant increase of non-mitochondrial respiration was observed in all DON-treatment groups (50-2000 ng/mL). The oxygen consumption of cells, which were cultured on membranes, was examined with a fiber-glass electrode. Here, we found significantly lower values for DON 200- and DON 2000-treatment group. The effect on ribosomes was investigated using biorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to tag newly synthesized proteins. A significantly reduced amount was found in almost all DON-treatment groups. Our findings clearly show that apical and basolateral DON-treatment of epithelial cell layer results in decreasing amounts of newly synthesized proteins. Furthermore, our study shows that DON affects enterocyte metabolism in vivo and in vitro.

AB  - Due to its superior drought tolerance, high biomass yield, and stress resistance, sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) has emerged as an ideal candidate for sustainable forage production in arid, semi-arid, and mildly saline-alkaline regions. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of replacing corn silage (CS) with either forage sorghum silage (FSS) or sugar sweet sorghum silage (SSS) on goat meat quality, the rumen microbial community, and meat composition. Thirty 3-month-old Boer goats (average body weight: 13.44 +/- 1.67 kg) were randomly assigned to five dietary treatments; the control group contained 50% corn silage (CON), while the experimental groups contained 50% FSS (group I), 70% FSS (group II), 50% SSS (group III), or 70% SSS (group V), with each group receiving the same concentrate diet but different roughage sources. The results showed that compared to the CON group (50% CS), the experimental groups had a significantly increased average daily weight gain (ADG) (p < 0.05) and slaughter rate (SR). It is noteworthy that group III (50% SSS) showed a significant increase of 12.4% in SR (p < 0.01). Analysis of the silage characteristics and changes in the rumen microbial community revealed that feeding SSS and FSS increased the relative abundance of Ruminococcus in the rumen, further enhanced the degradation and conversion of silage neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and promoted the synthesis of fatty acids and amino acids. Specifically, FSS significantly increased the amino acid content in the meat, while SSS effectively improved the crude protein (CP) and crude fat (CF) contents. In conclusion, replacing 50% CS with FSS or SSS can effectively improve the meat quality and growth performance of Boer goats.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, due to industry and market preferences, local animal breeds have been exposed to genetic erosion and extinction risk. Effective strategies for their recovery and conservation are needed. Gentile di Puglia (GdP) is an autochthonous sheep breed, typical of Southern Italy, with an aptitude for wool, meat, and milk production and considerable historical and cultural value. The development of a GdP gamete and embryo cryobank could help to support the numerical reimplementation of this population. Animal germplasm conservation is mainly performed through sperm cryopreservation, whereas strategies on the female side are developed in a limited way. In this study, the dual purpose of monitoring the reproductive efficiency in one pilot GdP farm in the Apulia region and setting up a cryopreservation protocol, by vitrification, of immature cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) recovered from pre-pubertal lambs, followed by an analysis of their in vitro maturation potential and bioenergetic-oxidative status, was pursued. The results indicated that traditional reproductive management leads to progressive offspring reduction and that ex situ biotechnological conservation strategies, through immature oocyte vitrification and in vitro maturation, can support in situ conservation, leading to in vitro embryo production and transfer. Gentile di Puglia (GdP) is an autochthonous sheep breed of Southern Italy included among ovine breeds threatened by genetic erosion and extinction risk, which have been given attention by local and international institutions, thus emphasizing the need for germplasm conservation actions. In the present study, two assisted reproduction approaches, finalized for GdP conservation, were performed: (1) on-farm reproductive efficiency evaluation, expressed as pregnancy rate (PR), twin pregnancy rate (tPR), and body condition score (BCS), for three consecutive breeding cycles and (2) pre-pubertal lambs' immature cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) retrieval, vitrification, in vitro maturation (IVM), and assessment of meiotic stage and bioenergetic-oxidative status compared with those of other Italian and European commercial breeds. PR and tPR were progressively reduced over time. In all clinical examination times, BCS was significantly lower in nonpregnant ewes compared with pregnant ones. Fresh GdP pre-pubertal lamb COCs achieved meiotic maturation and showed healthy bioenergetic-oxidative status after IVM. Vitrification reduced the oocyte maturation rate in all groups. However, mature oocytes retained their cytoplasmic maturity, expressed as a mitochondria distribution pattern and activity, indicating promising developmental competence. In conclusion, clinical- and biotechnological-assisted reproduction approaches can support conservation strategies of GdP and other local sheep breeds in Southern Italy.

AB  - The interest in individual animal welfare has increased in recent years. One of the reasons is a growing awareness of the importance of animals' individual differences in their individual capability to adapt to their environment. However, animal- and individual-based welfare indicators are often time-consuming to record and it is challenging to combine several indicators into a meaningful measure for welfare assessment. Behavioural complexity, including previously proposed features (e.g. number of behaviours, Shannon diversity index) as well as new features (e.g. variances of bout durations within and between behavioural transitions), has the theoretical potential to reflect animal welfare in a valid and relatively simple way. For a first practical validation of the complexity measure, 3912 hours of continuous video data from 163 fattening pigs - recorded on 85 days in three age classes, two seasons, and four housing levels of different intensities - were analysed. Twelve complexity-features were reduced using principal component analysis and the resulting principal components (PCs) were analysed using linear mixed effects models. General complexity (PC 1) was on average higher with higher housing levels (p [housing level] = 0.007; p [global] = 0.003). This pattern was modulated by age, with older pigs having a lower general complexity and a more pronounced relationship with housing levels (p [housing level x age class] = 0.009) but not by season (main effect and interactions: p > 0.422). The transition variability (PC 2) was on average also higher with higher housing levels (p [housing level] = 0.008; p [global] = 0.149) and neither age nor season had a statistically supported effect (p > 0.10). The Shannon diversity index for the frequency of behaviours as possible simplified measure showed the same pattern as the general complexity Moreover, this Shannon-diversity index had a more pronounced relationship with housing level in winter than in summer (p [housing level x season] = 0.012). These results suggest, that behavioural complexity could potentially be used as an individual-based indicator to detect changes in animal welfare if measured longitudinal in order to take age and season into account. Further advances in the automated analysis of video data are needed for practical use on farms. Additionally, further studies will need to correlate individual behavioural complexity against other individual measures of welfare.

AB  - The kinetics of the pyrolysis process of sheep manure were investigated using Thermogravimetric Analysis in this work. It was heated at 30 degrees C to 900 degrees C with a heating rate of 10 degrees C/min. There are two stages of mass degradation, namely dehydration and devolatilization. The temperature dehydration stage is 30 degrees C-140 degrees C while the devolatilization stage is 210 degrees C- 900 degrees C. However, at temperatures >500 degrees C, mass degradation decreases until it reaches 900 degrees C. This indicates that most of the volatile matter has disappeared at this temperature. The devolatilization stage includes the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose (210 degrees C- 900 degrees C) and lignin (>590 degrees C). The calculated activation energy from Friedman's non-conversional method is 21.32 kJ/mol and Coats-Redfern is 26,20 kJ/mol, while the frequency factor value is 9.94.10(18) 1/s for Friedman and 3.42.10(18) 1/s for Coats-Redfern Method which indicates that the pyrolysis process of sheep manure is a complicated phenomenon. The estimated activation energy value is then used to calculate thermodynamic properties e.g., Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy.

AB  - In this study, a virtual reality (VR) simulator to visualise the aerodynamic environment of a fattening pig house was developed as educational materials for farmers and consultants. The aerodynamic environments inside a fattening pig house were firstly analysed according to various environmental conditions using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Using the validated CFD model (Kim et al., 2019), the aerodynamic environment inside the fattening pig house was analysed with 54 cases of environmental conditions in winter and 60 cases of envi-ronmental conditions in summer. And then, the VR simulator was developed by visualising the CFD-computed data of aerodynamic environments in virtual space. The three-dimensional fattening pig house models were designed following the CFD-computed cases, and the three-dimensional pig model was developed with real shape and texture. The virtual space was organized by arranging the three-dimensional image models of the fattening pig house and fattening pig. A C language-based code was also used to extract the CFD-computed results for developing visualisation of the aerodynamic environment inside the fattening pig house. Visualisation was realized using contour plot, two-dimensional vector flow, and smoke effect in the virtual space. In the case of the contour plot, a scalar of air temperature, relative humidity, and gas concentration were expressed using color on the active plane. A two-dimensional vector flow represented two-dimensional flows on the active plane. From streamline data, the smoke effect was developed to describe the airflow from the air inlet. In this study, a tablet-shaped user interface (UI) was created so that the user can directly select the desired cases. Through a perfor-mance test, the optimal number of frames was determined. Finally, the VR simulator was developed to effectively describe the aerodynamic environments inside the fattening pig house.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of the inclusion of Kappaphycus alvarezii (KA), Gracilaria salicornia (GS) and Eucheuma spinosum (ES) as feed additives on the growth, immune and antioxidant status, endocrine variables, nutrient utilization, and nitrogen balance in growing Karan fries calves. Twenty-four growing crossbred calves (body weight 104.00 +/- 2.0 kg) were randomly blocked into four groups, each comprising six animals. The feeding schedule was similar in all the groups except that the treatment groups were supplemented with red seaweed (KA, GS, and ES) at 2.5% of dietary concentrate mixture during 180 days of the trial. No significant difference (p > 0.05) was noticed in body weight, average daily gain, dry matter intake and feed conversion ratio among the groups. Nutrient digestibility and nitrogen balance remained unaffected. There was no effect (p > 0.05) on haemato-biochemical parameters due to red seaweed supplementation. The levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and serum GSH-Px were similar in all the treatment groups. The addition of seaweeds did not exert any effect on mean serum levels of triiodothyronine (T-3), thyroxine (T-4) and cortisol. The serum concentration of immunoglobulin (IgG) was significantly higher among the seaweed-supplemented groups than the control group. Conclusively, the dietary supplementation of tropical red seaweeds at 2.5% in the concentrate mixture may significantly influence immunity without any alteration in hormonal profile, antioxidant status, serum metabolites, enzymes, and performance of growing crossbred calves.

AB  - Human-mediated species dispersal across the Mediterranean stretches back at least 10,000 years and has left an indelible stamp on present-day biodiversity. Believed to be a descendant of the Asiatic mouflon (Ovis gmelini gmelinii), the Corsican mouflon (O. g. musimon) was translocated during the Neolithic as ancestral livestock by humans migrating from the Fertile Crescent to the Western Mediterranean. Today, two geographically limited and disconnected populations can be found in Corsica. Whether they originated from distinct founders or one ancestral population that later split remains unknown, although such information is pivotal for the species' management on the island. We genotyped 109 and 176 individuals at the Cytochrome-b gene and 16 loci of the microsatellite DNA, respectively, to gain insights into the natural history of the Corsican mouflon. We found evidence confirming that the Asiatic was the ancestor of the Corsican mouflon, which should thus be unvaryingly referred to as O. g. musimon, i.e. as a subspecies of the Asiatic mouflon. Haplotype divergence dating and the investigation of genetic structure highlighted a strong and ancient genetic differentiation between the two Corsican populations. Approximate Bayesian Computation pointed to the introduction of a single group of founders as the most reliable scenario for the origin of the entire Corsican population. Later, this ancestral stock would have decreased in number, facing genetic bottlenecks and eventually resulting in two divergent demes. Splitting most likely occurred several hundred years ago. Their shared past notwithstanding, we discuss whether the two relic Corsican mouflon populations should be now considered as distinct management units.

AB  - Garlic oil (GO) and cinnamaldehyde (CIN) have shown potential to modify rumen fermentation. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of GO and CIN on rumen fermentation, microbial protein synthesis (MPS), and microbial populations in Rusitec fermenters fed a mixed diet (50:50 forage/concentrate), as well as whether these effects were maintained over time. Six fermenters were used in two 15-day incubation runs. Within each run, two fermenters received no additive, 180 mg/L of GO, or 180 mg/L of CIN. Rumen fermentation parameters were assessed in two periods (P1 and P2), and microbial populations were studied after each of these periods. Garlic oil reduced the acetate/propionate ratio and methane production (p < 0.001) in P1 and P2 and decreased protozoal DNA concentration and the relative abundance of fungi and archaea after P1 (p < 0.05). Cinnamaldehyde increased bacterial diversity (p < 0.01) and modified the structure of bacterial communities after P1, decreased bacterial DNA concentration after P2 (p < 0.05), and increased MPS (p < 0.001). The results of this study indicate that 180 mg/L of GO and CIN promoted a more efficient rumen fermentation and increased the protein supply to the animal, respectively, although an apparent adaptive response of microbial populations to GO was observed.

AB  - Antagonistic interactions among different functional guilds of nematodes have been recognized for quite some time, but the underlying explanatory mechanisms are unclear. We investigated responses of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) to two functional guilds of nematodes-plant parasite (Meloidogyne javanica) and entomopathogens (Heterorhabditis bacteriophora, Steinernema feltiae below-ground, and S. carpocapsae)-as well as a leaf mining insect (Tuta absoluta) above-ground. Our results indicate that entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs): (1) reduced root knot nematode (RKN) infestation below-ground, (2) reduced herbivore (T. absoluta) host preference and performance above-ground, and (3) induced overlapping plant defence responses by rapidly activating polyphenol oxidase and guaiacol peroxidase activity in roots, but simultaneously suppressing this activity in above-ground tissues. Concurrently, we investigated potential plant signalling mechanisms underlying these interactions using transcriptome analyses. We found that both entomopathogens and plant parasites triggered immune responses in plant roots with shared gene expression. Secondary metabolite transcripts induced in response to the two nematode functional guilds were generally overlapping and showed an analogous profile of regulation. Likewise, we show that EPNs modulate plant defence against RKN invasion, in part, by suppressing active expression of antioxidant enzymes. Inoculations of roots with EPN triggered an immune response in tomato via upregulated phenylpropanoid metabolism and synthesis of protease inhibitors in plant tissues, which may explain decreased egg laying and developmental performance exhibited by herbivores on EPN-inoculated plants. Furthermore, changes induced in the volatile organic compound-related transcriptome indicated that M. javanica and/or S. carpocapsae inoculation of plants triggered both direct and indirect defences. Our results support the hypothesis that plants "mistake" subterranean EPNs for parasites, and these otherwise beneficial worms activate a battery of plant defences associated with systemic acquired resistance and/or induced systemic resistance with concomitant antagonistic effects on temporally co-occurring subterranean plant pathogenic nematodes and terrestrial herbivores.

AB  - The increased demand for agricultural produce can be attained by optimizing the productivity potential and minimizing losses caused by notorious plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) in crops. Given the exacerbation of the environmental pollution problem with pesticides, the use of potential biocontrol agents is the most acceptable way of nematode management by the farming community. This study conducted a survey to evaluate three animal [chicken (3.0 g/plant), sheep (5.0 g/plant), and cow (5 g/plant)] manures on soil nematode communities on cucumber under greenhouse conditions and inoculated with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and their infectivity and the plant growth and crop production of tomato under field conditions compared to oxamyl (0.3 mL/plant). The survey concluded to spread 10 PPN genera, free-living nematodes (FLNs; Genus: Rhabditis), and predacious nematodes (PNs; Order: Mononchida). The root-knot nematode Meloidogyne spp. occupied the highest population density (PD; 60.41%), followed by the lesion nematode Pratylenchus spp. (38.72%) and then the spiral nematodes Helicotylenchus spp. (9.89%) and Tylenchus spp. (9.54%). The frequency of occurrence of phytonematode genera illustrated that Meloidogyne (35.41%), Pratylenchus (17.18%), Tylenchorhynchus (15.62%), and Tylenchus (11.45%) were the most frequent genera of phytonematodes. The higher prominence value was recorded with Meloidogyne, followed by Pratylenchus and Tylenchus. Under greenhouse conditions, an increase in plant growth parameters was recorded in cucumber plants that received the recommended rate of chicken, cow, and sheep manures, with no significant differences between chicken manure and oxamyl in root length and stem diameter. However, chicken manure treatment surpassed oxamyl in fresh root weight. Animal manure effects were extended for a long period in protective cucumber plants compared to control treatment by recording the lowest PD of Helicotylenchus spp., Tylenchorhynchus spp., and Pratylenchus spp. and the maximum decrease in galling and reproduction of Meloidogyne incognita. In the field experiment, test manures and PGPR combinations achieved maximum enhancement in tomato yield/plant compared to animal manures alone. The minimized numbers of M. incognita population coincided with the sustainable numbers of FLNs and PNs. Thus, the application of animal manures mixed with PGPR is a potential alternative to pesticides for the biological control of nematodes.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions mediated by plant-plant signalling have been documented in different species but its within-species variability has hardly been quantified. Here, we tested if herbivore foraging activity on plants was influenced by a prior contact with a damaged plant and if the effect of such plant-plant signalling was variable across 113 natural genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana. We filmed the activity of the generalist herbivore Cornu aspersum during 1 h on two plants differing only in a prior contact with a damaged plant or not. We recorded each snails' first choice, and measured its first duration on a plant, the proportion of time spent on both plants and leaf consumption. Overall, plant-plant signalling modified the foraging activity of herbivores in A. thaliana. On average, snails spent more time and consumed more of plants that experienced a prior contact with a damaged plant. However, the effects of plant-plant signalling on snail behaviour was variable: depending on genotype identity, plant-plant signalling made undamaged plants more repellant or attractive to snails. Genome-wide associations revealed that genes related to stress coping ability and jasmonate pathway were associated to this variation. Together, our findings highlight the adaptive significance of plant-plant signalling for plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Limb autotomy and regeneration are specific adaptations of crustaceans in response to external stress and attacks, which make them a suitable model to investigate the mechanism of organ regeneration in invertebrates. In this study, the Hippo gene of Eriocheir sinensis (EsHPO) was identified, and the effects of Hippo signaling on limb regeneration were evaluated. The expression of EsHPO and other key components of Hippo signaling was down-regulated during the basal growth phase in response to limb autotomy stress and then up-regulated during the proecdysial growth phase. The descending expression patterns of Hippo signal components were correlated with transcriptional activation of YKI and downstream target genes during the blastema formation stage, which suggested that Hippo signaling plays a key role during limb regeneration in E. sinensis. To further test the hypothesis, the transcription factor YKI was blocked via verteporfin injection after autotomy, which disrupted limb regeneration by repressing wound healing and preventing blastema emergence. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that the proliferation of blastema cells was blocked by verteporfin. In addition, the expression of genes related to ECM remodeling, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis resistance was down-regulated following the injection of verteporfin. Our findings therefore indicate that Hippo signaling is essential for successful wound healing and limb regeneration in E. sinensis by inducing ECM remodeling, as well as promoting the proliferation and repressing the apoptosis of blastema cells.

AB  - Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs), the main substrates and energy carriers of plants, play an important role in mediating the source-sink balance of carbon (C). However, the trade-offs in the allocation of NSCs remain unclear at critical stages of fruit development. In this study, we evaluated the dynamic and allometric partitioning characteristics of NSCs at the key stage of fruit development in Camellia oleifera. The seed NSCs pool was the highest in the middle stage of rapid fruit expansion, and an inverted "V" shape appeared from July to September and peaked in August. Notably, although the NSC pool of twigs was the smallest and did not change significantly at each stage, the starch pool was the largest. Significant correlations existed between the NSC content of different organs in C. oleifera in the early stage of slow development and the middle stage of rapid fruit expansion. In particular, NSC components, both of the twigs in the early stage and of the twigs and seeds in the middle stage, showed significant allometric partitioning relationships. In summary, seeds are the main carbon sink for fruit development trade-offs of C. oleifera, and twigs may play an important role in transferring C to seeds at the early and middle stages of fruit development. In the future, attention should be paid to controlling the factors affecting the balance of plant C during the rapid fruit expansion period to ensure high yield.

AB  - The management of manure composting contributes to alleviate the global greenhouse effect. To improve our under-standing of this process, we conducted a meta-analysis of 371 observations from 87 published studies in 11 countries. The results showed that the difference in nitrogen content in feces significantly affected the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient losses of subsequent composting, with NH3-N, CO2-C, and CH4-C losses all increasing with its rise. Windrow pile composting (especially compared to trough composting) had lower GHG emissions and nutrient loss. C/N ratio, aeration rate, and pH value significantly affected NH3 emission, and a decrease in the latter two can reduce it by 31.8 % and 42.5 %, respectively. Decreasing the moisture content or increasing the turning frequency could decrease CH4 by 31.8 % and 62.6 %, respectively. The addition of biochar or superphosphate had a synergistic emission reduction. The emission reduction of N2O and CH4 by biochar was more prominent (44 % and 43.6 %), while superphosphate on NH3 (38.0 %) was better. And the latter was more suitable if added in 10-20 % of dry weight. Dicyandiamide was the only chemical additive (59.4 %) with better N2O emission reduction performance. Microbial agents with different functions had certain effects on NH3-N emission reduction, while the mature compost had a cer-tain effect on N2O-N emissions (67.0 %). In general, N2O had the highest contribution to the greenhouse effect during composting (74.22 %).

AB  - Herewith we present the first detection of Amblyomma lepidum (D & ouml;nitz, 1909) on cattle in Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's smallholder farmers rely heavily on their livestock, mainly cattle and goats. Even though great importance is placed on cattle farming, no systematic surveillance of tick and tick-borne diseases is currently being conducted in the country. Forming part of the Amblyomma genus, A. lepidum is a brightly ornate tick with great vector potential, which could have harmful effects on cattle and cattle farming in Zimbabwe. This report documents the presence of both male and female A. lepidum ticks that were morphologically identified, and with the use of two ribosomal genes, were molecularly characterised as A. lepidum. Hypotheses can be made as to how this tick was introduced into Zimbabwe; however, its presence highlights the need for a systematic surveillance programme to track not only new introductions, such as the aforementioned, but the current distribution of this tick population in Zimbabwe.

AB  - To maximize camouflage across visually heterogeneous habitats, animals have evolved a variety of strategies, including polyphenism, color change, and behavioral background matching. Despite the expected importance of behavioral processes for mediating camouflage, such as selection for matching substrates, behavior has received less attention than color traits themselves, and interactions between color change and behavior are largely unexplored. Here, we investigated behavioral background matching in green and red chameleon prawns (Hippolyte varians) over the course of a color change experiment. Prawns were housed on mismatching green and red seaweeds for 30 days and periodically given a choice test between the same seaweeds in y-choice trials over the experiment. We found that, as prawns change color and improve camouflage (to the perspective of a fish predator), there is a reinforcing shift in behavior. That is, as prawns shift from red to green color, or vice versa, their seaweed color preference follows this. We provide key empirical evidence that plasticity of appearance (color) is accompanied by a plastic shift in behavior (color preference) that reinforces camouflage in a color changing species on its natural substrate. Overall, our research highlights how short-term plasticity of behavior and longer-term color change act in tandem to maintain crypsis over time.
   Many animals change color for camouflage. Similarly, individuals can behaviorally choose substrates that match their color. However, as an animal changes to match a new background its behavioral preference should change too. We demonstrate that red and green variants of the chameleon prawn undergo simultaneous changes in color and background preference for camouflage against seaweeds. Such synergy between physiological and behavioral changes is likely to be critical to successful camouflage in animals inhabiting variable environments.

AB  - Quantifying oxidative stress has garnered extensive interest in evolutionary ecology and physiology since proposed as a mediator of life histories. However, while the theoretical framework of oxidative stress ecology is wellsupported by laboratory-based studies, results obtained in wild populations on oxidative damage and antioxidant biomarkers have shown inconsistent trends. We propose that red blood cell lysis could be a source of bias affecting measurements of oxidative stress biomarkers, distorting the conclusions drawn from them. Using an experimental approach consisting of enriching plasma from roe deer with lysed red blood cells, we show that the values of commonly used oxidative stress biomarkers linearly increase with the degree of haemolysis - assayed by haemoglobin concentration. This result concerns oxidized proteins (carbonyls) and lipids (TBARS), as well as enzymatic (superoxide dismutase) and non-enzymatic (trolox assay, OXY assay) antioxidant markers. Based on 707 roe deer blood samples collected in the field, we next show that the occurrence of haemolysis in plasma samples is negatively related to age. Finally, we illustrate that considering the variance explained by age-related haemolysis improves explanatory models for inter-individual variability in plasma oxidative stress biomarkers, without substantially altering the estimates of the parameters studied here. Our results raise the question of the veracity of the conclusions if the degree of haemolysis in plasma is not considered in animal models such as roe deer, for which the occurrence and severity of haemolysis vary according to individual characteristics. We recommend measuring and controlling for the degree of haemolysis be considered in future studies that investigate the causes and consequences of oxidative stress in ecophysiological studies.

AB  - Clonal invaders can cope with herbivory via clonal integration, but how the impacts of clonal integration are affected by plant-herbivore coevolution history is still poorly understood. Alternanthera philoxeroides (Caryophyllales: Amaranthaceae) is an amphibious clonal invader. The beetle Agasicles hygrophila (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) was introduced to control A. philoxeroides, and also feeds on the native Alternanthera sessilis (Caryophyllales: Amaranthaceae) in China. We grew the apical and basal parts of A. philoxeroides and A. sessilis, connected or disconnected with the stolon, and exposed apical parts to A. hygrophila or the native beetle Cassida piperata (Coleoptera: Cassididae) that also feeds on both plants. Both beetles significantly reduced the stem length, belowground biomass and photosynthesis of both plants without clonal integration, and flea beetles had a stronger negative impact on A. philoxeroides than did tortoise beetles. The stem length, stem diameter, belowground and/or aboveground biomass and photosynthetic parameters of apical parts of plants under attack by their corresponding coevolved beetle were 27% similar to 391% higher with clonal integration compared to without. In contrast, when the two plants were attacked by the corresponding beetle without coevolution, the same parameters in either apical or basal parts were unchanged or significantly lower under clonal integration than no integration. These results indicate that artificial disrupting of clonal integration combined with biological control may suppress clonal plants like A. philoxeroides more effectively. Compared with coevolved monophagous herbivores, some oligophagous herbivores in invaded ranges might have a stronger potential to influence the clonal integration capacity of invasive aliens.

AB  - Sea hares are cryptic, herbivorous sea slugs present on many coral reefs worldwide. Although they are known to consume high quantities of macroalgae, they are rarely considered or quantified in assessing algal suppression. Their role as algal suppressors is not well understood, therefore this study sought to quantify sea hare herbivory on the abundant red algal genus Laurencia. The sea hares Aplysia dactylomela, Dolabella auricularia and Dolabella sp. were collected and used in herbivory trials in aquaria at Heron Island on the Southern Great Barrier Reef to quantify their rate of consumption. A. dactylomela consumed 76.9 g partially dried weight of Laurencia per 24-h, which was significantly more than the other species, with D. auricularia consuming an average of 22.5 g and Dolabella sp. consuming 37.4 g partially dried weight. Consumption of Laurencia by A. dactylomela increased with body size, with the exception of the smallest animals, which ate up to 12.5 times their body weight. D. auricularia consumed significantly more algae than was lost in control tanks. Although we observed Dolabella sp. feeding on Laurencia, the amount consumed was not significantly different to loss of algae in control tanks. The rate of herbivory on Laurencia by A. dactylomela is comparable or greater than that of more commonly studied reef herbivores such as fishes and urchins, which suggests that they may contribute to algal suppression on coral reefs and further studies are warranted to evaluate their possible role in coral-algal phase shift dynamics.

AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia ( E .) coli (ESBL-EC) in the clinical setting have emerged as a major threat to public and animal health. Wildlife, including Rattus spp. may serve as reservoirs and spreaders of ESBL-EC in the environment. Peridomestic rats are well adapted to living in proximity to humans and animals in a variety of urban and agricultural environments and may serve as sentinels to identify variations of ESBL-EC within their different habitats. In this study, a set of 221 rats ( Rattus norvegicus , R. tanezumi , R. andamanensis , and Niviventer huang ) consisting of 104 rats from city areas, 44 from chicken farms, 52 from pig farms, and 21 from stables of horse-riding schools were screened for ESBL-EC. Overall, a total of 134 ESBL-EC were isolated from the caecal samples of 130 (59%) rats. The predominant bla ESBL genes were bla CTX-M-14 , bla CTX-M-15 , bla CTX-M- 55 , and bla CTX-M-65 . Phylogenetic analysis revealed a total of 62 sequence types (STs) and 17 SNP clusters. E. coli ST10 and ST155 were common to ESBL-EC from city areas and chicken farms, and ST44 were found among ESBLEC from city areas and pig farms. Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) ST69, ST131 and ST1193 were found exclusively among rats from city areas, and avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) ST177 was restricted to ESBLEC originating from chicken farms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the populations of rodent ESBL-EC from city areas, chicken farms and pig farms were genetically different, suggesting a certain degree of partitioning between the human and animal locations. This study contributes to current understanding of ESBL-EC occurring in rats in ecologically diverse locations.

AB  - Globally, 10-20% of horticultural wastes are disposed in landfills leading to environmental pollution. Recycling these wastes as animal feedstuff will lessen food-feed competition and minimize environmental hazards. The present study was undertaken to determine the nutritional quality of fresh fruit and vegetable waste (F&VW) and their dietary inclusion on nutrient utilization, antioxidant status, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and potable water sparing efficacy in sheep. Three dietary combinations were formulated i.e. control (C):70% Cenchrus ciliaris hay +30% concentrate mixture (CM), diet with fruit waste (FWD):70% Cenchrus ciliaris hay +20% CM +10% FW and diet with vegetable waste (VWD):70% Cenchrus ciliaris hay +20% CM +10% VW for in vitro and in vivo evaluation of these wastes as potential livestock feed. Twenty-one adult ewes were allocated into 3 groups C, FWD and VWD and fed on the above three diets. Dry matter and crude protein digestibility were significantly enhanced by 5.5 and 7.2%; 7.3 and 7.6% in F&VW supplemented groups, respectively, without affecting feed intake. Plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was improved by 32.2 and 26.3% in F&VW supplemented groups. Inclusion of F&VW biomass reduced annual methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions (kg CO(2)eq/sheep) by 3.12 and 4.55%; 15.18 and 14.92% and thus contributed to lowering of global warming potential by 4.00 and 5.27%, respectively. Furthermore, there was a net reduction of potable water consumption by 21.78 and 13.92% in F&VW supplemented groups, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that F&VW can be a potential feedstuff for ruminants and its efficient reuse would minimize environmental impacts associated with disposal of such waste in the landfills.

AB  - Hyalomma dromedarii ticks are the main hematophagous ectoparasites of camels, harboring a variety of microbes that can affect tick vector competence and pathogen transmission. To better understand the tick microbiome influenced by sex and host habitat, we analyzed the bacterial community of H. dromedarii male and female ticks collected from camel farms, livestock markets, and slaughterhouses, representing the range of major habitats in the UAE, by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Tick samples were collected during 2022 and 2023. A total of 40 ticks (male (15), female (15), and nymph (10)) were selected from tick samples collected from camels and processed for genomic DNA and next-generation sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. We obtained 151,168 read counts, and these formed 237 operational taxonomic units representing 11 phyla, 22 classes, 77 families, and 164 genera. The phyla Actinomycetota, Bacillota, Bacteroidota, Pseudomonadota, and Fusobacteriota were the most abundant. The bacterial genus Corynebacterium dominated the microbiomes of farm-collected female H. dromedarii ticks, while Proteus dominated the microbiomes of farm-collected male H. dromedarii ticks. In comparison, the microbiomes of H. dromedarii ticks collected from slaughterhouse samples were dominated by genus Francisella in both males and females. Our results confirm that the bacterial microbiomes of H. dromedarii ticks vary by sex and habitat settings. Furthermore, recent findings could deliver insight into the differences in the ability of camel ticks to acquire, maintain, and transmit pathogens in various habitats that may impact the tick vector competence of medically and agriculturally important species in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region and Asia.

AB  - Wildlife conservation has the potential to make significant contributions to community development. Despite this potential, the sector faces various challenges, including human-wildlife conflicts (HWC). Communities adjacent to the Ngorongoro, Tarangire, and Manyara protected areas (NTMPAs) are known to experience HWC; however, studies on HWC management strategies concerning the demographic characteristics of these communities are scarce. This study utilized questionnaires and focus group discussions to assess this information within the study area. The findings from this study revealed that respondents over the age of 30 significantly (x((112))(2) = 78.857, p < 0.000) reported the existence of problem animals causing conflicts in their villages. Additionally, respondents engaged in agriculture-related activities demonstrated significant (x((4))(2) = 23.501, p < 0.0001) concern about problem animals and conflicts compared to other groups. Conflict mitigation measure used, varied significantly (Cochran's Q Test ((6)) = 138.539, p = 0.001 and n = 120) across the study area. Respondents reported that different mitigation measures varied significantly across occupation and education levels. The study suggests that while efforts to engage younger individuals in formal and conservation education are important, similar initiatives should also target older individuals, particularly those involved in agriculture, whether as landowners or casual laborers. Wildlife management authorities should prioritize efforts to intensify community awareness, focusing on conservation education, the establishment of buffer zones, and the promotion of alternative crops. These initiatives aim to foster positive attitudes toward wildlife conservation. Ultimately, such efforts will help transform community attitudes and increase tolerance for wildlife, facilitating coexistence and enhancing sustainability in wildlife conservation and community development in areas adjacent to protected areas, including the NTMPAs.

AB  - Research Highlight: Valenzuela-Sanchez, A., Azat, C., Cunningham, A. A., Delgado, S., Bacigalupe, L. D., Beltrand, J., Serrano, J. M., Sentenac, H., Haddow, N., Toledo, V., Schmidt, B. R., & Cayuela, H. (2022). Interpopulation differences in male reproductive effort drive the population dynamics of a host exposed to an emerging fungal pathogen. Journal of Animal Ecology, 00, 1- 12. . Understanding the nuances of population persistence in the face of a stressor can help predict extinction risk and guide conservation actions. However, the exact mechanisms driving population stability may not always be known. In this paper, Valenzuela-Sanchez et al. (2022) integrate long-term mark-recapture data, focal measurements of reproductive effort, a population matrix model and inferences on life-history variation to reveal differences in demographic response to disease in a susceptible frog species (Rhinoderma darwinii). Valenzuela-Sanchez et al. found that demographic compensation via recruitment explained the positive population growth rate in their high disease prevalence population whereas the low disease prevalence population did not compensate and thus had decreasing population growth. Compensatory recruitment was likely due to the high probability of males brooding, and the high number of brooded larvae in the high prevalence population compared to low prevalence and disease-free populations. Valenzuela-Sanchez et al. also document faster generation times in the high prevalence population, which may indicate a faster life history that may be contributing to the population's ability to compensate for reduced survival. Lastly, the authors find a positive relationship between disease prevalence and the proportion of juveniles in a given population that suggest that there may be a threshold for disease prevalence that triggers increased reproductive effort. Altogether, their study provides novel support for increased reproductive effort as the pathway for compensatory recruitment leading to increasing population growth despite strong negative effects of disease on adult survival. Their results also caution the overgeneralization of the effects of stressors (e.g. disease) on population dynamics, where context-dependent responses may differ among host populations of a given species.

AB  - Gamma-Delta (????) T cells represent a prominent lymphocyte subset in pigs. Their role and function, however, remains largely unknown. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are key receptors for the recognition of pathogens, but so far, it is unknown if porcine ???? T cells express TLRs and therefore have the innate ability to recognize pathogens through pattern recognition receptors. In this study, we compared ???? T cells in different age groups of pigs and investigated the functional relevance of TLR7/8 expression. We found that the major ???? T cell phenotype shifts from CD2-CD8??-/dimCD27+ in young pigs to CD2+CD8??highCD27- in 3-year-old pigs impacting their ability to produce IFN-?? upon cytokine and TLR stimulation. Furthermore, we report that stimulation with TLR7/8 ligand R848 increased IFN-?? production in purified ???? T cells upon co-stimulation with IL-2 and IL-12. However, the effect of R848 as a co-activator of ???? T cells was abrogated by the addition of monocytes or within PBMCs, suggesting that ???? T cells respond to multiple direct and indirect stimulations. Thus, our results indicate that ???? T cells express TLRs, are modulated by TLR7/8 ligand R848 and have subset-specific responses.

AB  - The need to find and maximize the use of alternative sources of nutrients for plants and soil environment have been on the forefront of research in sustainable agriculture. These alternatives have to be affordable, accessible, reproduceable, and efficient to compete with established inorganic fertilizers while at the same time reduce any potential negative impacts on the environment. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digestate fertilization in an agricultural system over a period of three years. The digestate utilized in the study consisted of animal waste-based digestates, namely pig manure digestate, chicken manure digestate, and cow manure digestate, and were compared with synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. Every year, the digestate and the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer were split applied at the rate of 90 and 80 kg N ha(-1). The soil chemical composition after three years of fertilization showed a slight decrease, significantly different nitrogen and carbon changes while phosphorus and potassium were significantly higher in the digestate treatments. The third year of digestate application showed higher grain yield than previous years and the yield from the digestate treatments were significantly different from the synthetic nitrogen fertilizer. The nitrogen use efficiency for the three years was in the range of 20-25 percent in the digestate treatments, with a strong correlation between the nitrogen use efficiency and the grain yield. There were varied results in the grain quality and straw quality in the digestate and synthetic nitrogen fertilizer with no clear trend observed. Our results showed a relatively high potential of animal waste digestates over the short to mid-term use with a positive result obtained in comparison to synthetic nitrogen fertilizer under favorable climatic conditions.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effects of heat stress (HS) on growth performance, carcase characteristics and rumen-muscle axis of Hu sheep and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of the actions by establishing a heat-stressed Hu sheep. The results showed that HS significantly decreased growth performance and carcase characteristics, altered metabolic enzyme activities, and induced a shift in muscle energy metabolism towards a more glycolytic and less oxidative fibre type in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle (p < 0.05), thereby affecting the meat quality of Hu sheep. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis of LD muscle found that HS down-regulated the expression of genes (ADIPOQ, ADRA2A, COL6A3, MYOC, PPARGC1A, etc.) involved in fat deposition and muscle development. 16S rDNA analyses of ruminal microbiome revealed that resist adverse environments-related Firmicutes, fatty acid synthesis-related Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, etc. were increased in the heat-stressed Hu sheep, and negatively correlated with genes involved in muscle development and lipid metabolism. However, energy metabolism-related Bacteroidetes and Tenericutes, and protein and carbohydrate cleavage-related Prevotella and Mollicutes were decreased in the heat-stressed Hu sheep and positively correlated with genes involved in muscle development and lipid metabolism. All together, these findings indicated that the rumen microbiota and gene expression profiles of muscle underwent responsive changes to HS, which impaired growth performance, carcase characteristics and meat quality in Hu sheep. Our findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying heat stress-induced effects in sheep, suggesting potential strategies for the prevention and control of HS as well as the development of new heat-resistant varieties in Hu sheep using molecular design breeding.

AB  - The objectives were to determine the effects of dietary deoxynivalenol (DON) on apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of nutrients and to evaluate the efficacy of a bentonite (BEN) and a preservative blend (PB) product for alleviating DON effects on the nutrient digestibility of pigs. Twelve crossbred barrows with an initial body weight of 69.4 kg (standard deviation = 3.5) equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum were allotted a triplicated 4 x 2 incomplete Latin square design with four dietary treatments and two periods. Dietary treatments were (1) an uncontaminated diet, (2) a contaminated diet (CD) mainly based on contaminated wheat with 1.6 mg/kg DON, (3) CD + 0.25% PB consisting of preservation components as major sources, antioxidants, microorganisms, and amino acids (AA), and (4) CD + 0.25% BEN. The AID and ATTD of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, most minerals, and most AA were not affected by DON contamination. Dietary DON decreased the AID and ATTD of sodium (p < 0.05) but were restored by supplementing the PB product (p < 0.05). The AID of zinc was increased (p < 0.05) by dietary DON, but supplementing BEN decreased zinc digestibility (p < 0.05). The AID of Arg, Ile, Thr, and Asp was decreased (p < 0.05) by BEN addition. In conclusion, dietary DON affected the digestibility of some minerals but not AA in pigs. Supplemental BEN can negatively affect the nutrient digestibility of some minerals and AA in pigs. The addition of a PB product in pig diets can restore digestibility of sodium but not of other nutrients. Based on these observations, feed additives for alleviating DON effects on nutrient digestibility of pigs can be carefully selected by swine diet formulators.

AB  - Plants interact with biotic and abiotic environments. Some of these interactions are detrimental including herbivory consumption and infections by microbial pathogens. The COI1 (coronatine insensitive 1) protein is the master controller of JA-regulated plant responses and plays a regulatory role in the plant defense response. However, there is little information on COI1 function in birch (Betula platyphylla x Betula pendula). Herein, we studied the F-box protein BpCOI1 which is located in the nucleus. To validate the function of this protein, we developed transgenic birch plants with overexpression or repression of BpCOI1 gene. Growth traits, such as tree height, ground diameter, number of lateral branches, did not change significantly among transgenic lines. Alternaria alternata treatment experiments indicated that low expression of BpCOI1 reduced disease resistance in birch. Furthermore, our results showed that low expression of BpCOI1 significantly reduced the sensitivity of plants to exogenous MeJA. Co-expression analysis showed gene expression patterns with similar characteristics. These genes may be closely related in function, or members involved in the same signaling pathway or physiological process with BpCOI 1. The results of transcriptome sequencing and co-expression analysis showed that BpCOI1 affects plant defense against Alternaria alternata by regulating jasmonates. This study reveals the role of BpCOI1 in disease resistance and proposes the possibility of controlling diseases through molecular breeding in birch.

AB  - Grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is an intensively cultured and economically important herbivorous fish species in China, but its culture is often impacted by Aeromonas pathogens such as Aeromonas hydrophila and Aeromonas veronii. In this study, healthy grass carp were separately infected with A. hydrophila or A. veronii for 12, 24, 48 or 72 h. The results showed that the mRNA expression levels of intestinal inflammatory factors (tnf-alpha, il-1 beta and il-8), complement factors (c3 and c4), antimicrobial peptides (hepcidin, nk-lysin and beta-defensin-1), immunoglobulins (igm and igt), and immune pathway-related signaling molecules (tlr1, tlr2, tlr4, myd88, irak4, irak1, traf6, nf-kappa b p65 and ap-1) were differentially upregulated in response to A. hydrophila and A. veronii challenge. Additionally, the expression levels of the intestinal pro-apoptotic genes tnfr1, tnfr2, tradd, caspase-8, caspase-3 and bax were significantly increased, whereas the expression of the inhibitory factor bcl-2 was significantly downregulated, indicating that Aeromonas infection significantly induced apoptosis in the intestine of grass carp. Moreover, the expression of intestinal tight junction proteins (occludin, zo-1, claudin b and claudin c) was significantly decreased after infection with Aeromonas. Histopathological analysis indicated the Aeromonas challenge caused severe damage to the intestinal villi with adhesions and detachment of intestinal villi accompanied by severe inflammatory cell infiltration at 12 hand 72 h. The 16S rRNA sequencing results showed that Aeromonas infection significantly altered the structure of the intestinal microflora of the grass carp at the phylum (Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) and genus (Proteus, Cetobacterium, Bacteroides, and Aeromonas) levels. Take together, the findings of this study revealed that Aeromonas infection induces an intestinal immune response, triggers cell apoptosis, destroys physical barriers and alters microflora structure in the intestine of juvenile grass carp; the results will help to reveal the pathogenesis of intestinal bacterial diseases in grass carp.

AB  - The effectiveness of controlling nitrogen (N) to manage eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems remains debated. To understand the mechanisms behind phytoplankton growth in shallow lakes (resource and grazing effects) under contrasting N loading scenarios, we conducted a 70-days mesocosm experiment in summer. The mesocosms contain natural plankton communities deriving from a 10-cm layer of lake sediment and 450 L of lake water. We also added two juvenile crucian carp (Carassius carassius) in each mesocosm to simulate presence of the prevailing omni-benthivorous fish in subtropical lakes. Our results showed that N addition increased not only water N levels but also total phosphorus (TP) concentrations, which together elevated the phytoplankton biomass and caused strong dominance of cyanobacteria. Addition of N significantly lowered the herbivorous zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio and promoted the phytoplankton yield per nutrient (Chl-a: TP or Chl-a: TN ratio), indicating that summer N addition likely also favored phytoplankton growth through reduced grazing by zooplankton. Accordingly, our study indicates that summer N loading may boost eutrophication via both changes in resource and grazing control in shallow lakes. Thus, alleviation of eutrophication in shallow eutrophic lakes requires a strategic approach to control both nutrients (N and P) appropriately.

AB  - Generalist predators can enhance biological control by filling unique niches and complementing other natural enemies, or disrupt it by preying upon other predators and parasitoids, complicating their net value for biological control. We searched for evidence of complementarity and/or interference between native (primarily Eriopis chilensis and E. eschscholtzi) and exotic (primarily Hippodamia variegata and Harmonia axyridis) lady beetles attacking aphids in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) fields near Santiago, Chile. Across 60 fields and three growing seasons, exotic lady beetle adults and larvae reached peak abundance relatively earlier in the growing season than the natives. Furthermore, exotic lady beetle peaks aligned more closely with aphid peak abundance than did native lady beetle peaks. Abundances of native lady beetle adults and larvae were weakly positively correlated with those of exotics, and peak aphid densities were generally lowest in fields where native and non-native lady beetle adults were similarly abundant. Therefore, we did not see evidence of strong interference between exotics and natives. Natural-agricultural habitat edges reduced native, but not exotic, larval lady beetle lag behind aphid peaks and was associated with greater lady beetle and lower aphid densities. Moreover, farms embedded in landscapes with greater natural habitat cover supported more exotic, but not native, lady beetles, and increased the lag between larval lady beetles and aphids for natives but not exotics. These findings support the idea that farms embedded within mosaics of natural and agricultural habitats may provide greater interaction potential between native lady beetles and aphid pests on farms as they move across the landscape, leading to greater top -down control. In contrast, exotic lady beetle lags were unaffected by landscape composition or configuration, but their greater densities in farms surrounded by more natural habitats might reflect a 'concentration effect' whereby exotic lady beetle abundance becomes concentrated in the agricultural habitats that they prefer. Our findings suggest that some lady beetles introduced for biocontrol may be better adapted to intensively managed habitats than natives, possibly leading to spatiotemporal complementarity between native and exotic lady beetles.

AB  - African Swine Fever (ASF) is an infectious disease affecting pigs and wild boars, causing significant economic losses. Epidemiological surveillance plays an important role in minimizing its impact. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of beta-actin DNA and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) levels in determining the age of animal remains from the Suidae family, which could be helpful in epidemiological investigations. The study included selected tissues and internal organs of Sus scrofa domesticus, exposed to natural environmental conditions or kept in stable 4 degrees C conditions, to assess the levels of beta-actin and mtDNA over a period of 18 months. The levels of both tested parameters exhibited the expected decreasing trend over time. However, in most tissues, some discrepancies from this general pattern were observed. The results obtained for bone marrow showed a consistent downward trend and a strong correlation between mtDNA and beta-actin, with long-term detectability (up to the 13th month of the study). Therefore, bone marrow could be considered a matrix of choice for age assessment. However, due to various influencing factors, further studies are required.

AB  - Simple Summary Heterosis has been extensively utilized in the genetic breeding and production of pigs, necessitating further analysis of its potential genetic mechanisms. The objective of this study was to elucidate the genetic architecture of heterosis by employing a hybrid model incorporating commercial and native pigs. In this study, we observed that the growth traits of the Duhua hybrid pigs exhibited significantly superior performance compared with their parents' average performance. Furthermore, we revealed the influence of additive and dominance genetic effects on the growth traits of Duhua hybrid pigs. Our findings provide an insight into the genetic basis of the heterosis of Duhua pigs and offer a reference for the utilization of local pig breeds.Abstract Heterosis has been extensively used for pig genetic breeding and production, but the genetic basis of heterosis remains largely elusive. Crossbreeding between commercial and native breeds provides a good model to parse the genetic basis of heterosis. This study uses Duhua hybrid pigs, a crossbreed of Duroc and Liangguang small spotted pigs, as materials to explore the genetic basis underlying heterosis related to growth traits at the genomic level. The mid-parent heterosis (MPH) analysis showed heterosis of this Duhua offspring on growth traits. In this study, we examined the impact of additive and dominance effects on 100 AGE (age adjusted to 100 kg) and 100 BF (backfat thickness adjusted to 100 kg) of Duhua hybrid pigs. Meanwhile, we successfully identified SNPs associated with growth traits through both additive and dominance GWASs (genome-wide association studies). These findings will facilitate the subsequent in-depth studies of heterosis in the growth traits of Duhua pigs.

AB  - This study analyzed the time- and water content-dependent changes in penetration resistance (PR) profiles of an Andosol at different dry bulk densities under pasture. PR was measured from the soil surface to a soil depth of 80 cm in a soil compaction trial (T0, 0.65 Mgm(-3); T1, 0.75 Mgm(-3); and T3, 0.85 Mgm(-3)) established in May 2019 in a Petroduric Silandic Andosol under pasture grazed by sheep. Both the volumetric water content and matric potential were measured with sensors at the soil surface and at depths of 10, 20, and 60 cm. In addition, undisturbed soil samples were collected to determine the precompression stress. Water retention curves and air permeability (6 kPa matric potential) were measured. The soil compaction events induced an increase in bulk density and a decrease in wide coarse pores as well as air permeability, reflecting an increase in precompression stress and penetration resistance. As the soil water content (WC) decreased, the PR increased at all studied soil depths; under the driest conditions (WC: 28 Vol. %), the highest accumulated PR values were assessed between 0 and 10 cm. At field capacity, the highest registered PR values, after compaction events at the soil surface, did not reach the critical value of 2 MPa; however, they represented the soil with the highest bulk density and precompression stress as well as with a lower volume of macropores and air permeability. Accordingly, as the water content decreased, the maximum values of PR were observed near the soil surface in the densest soil. The initial differences in PR values assessed between treatments at the soil surface, disappeared few months later because of soil drying and animal trampling reflecting that the soil physical properties tended to reach an equilibrium with the applied external stresses.

AB  - Environmental conservation is presented as a success story in Namibia's Zambezi Region where conservation measures have led to an enormous increase in many wildlife populations. Complementary to historically exclusive fortress-conservation strategies, inclusive projects have gained prominence in the past few decades aiming to integrate local populations into conservation projects. Perhaps the most salient approach is community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), which sets ambitious goals of more participation, empowerment, and stewardship of local residents in the process of conservation. Despite its popularity in southern Africa, the CBNRM concept has met with criticism, especially with regard to the situations of many conservancy members. We aim to show that the idea of conservation, and the concept of CBNRM in particular, are in some respects detached from the lives of the conservancy members who are confronted with the effects and regulations of conservation measures. We therefore employ the notion of 'dissonance' to describe the inconsistencies between the intended effects of the CBNRM concept and how it is perceived by conservancy members. Three aspects of dissonance are identified here. First, we draw attention to the limited opportunities conservancy members have to benefit from the thriving safari- and hunting-tourism industry. Second, despite successful conservation leading to increased wildlife populations, impacts of human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) and their repercussions for farming and livestock husbandry aggravate the dissonant relationship between conservancy members and the CBNRM concept. Third, we illustrate the discrepancies between the notion of the 'community' in conservancies and the actual social organisation. Altogether, the inconsistencies between the travelling idea of conservation and its impact on local livelihoods will be demonstrated.

AB  - The Neotropical region is considered a biodiversity hotspot for reptiles, with eight families of terrestrial and freshwater chelonians. Parasites are of great importance to aquatic ecosystems and are essential to host communities. They help understand the patterns and phylogenetic relationships of their hosts and act to control populations. A literature survey on helminth parasites of chelonians in the Neotropical region was conducted, examining the most commonly found groups of helminths, the most parasitized hosts, compiling their biogeographical and political distribution and recording the parasite fauna of Phrynops geoffroanus in the state of Para & iacute;ba, northeastern Brazil. Considering the literature from 1850 to 2024, 202 helminth taxa were recorded. The Mesoamerican dominion had the highest number of helminth taxa, and Brazil was the political unit that recorded the most helminth taxa, followed by Mexico. Nematoda was the group with the highest number of taxa and occurred in all biogeographical units, with the species Spiroxys contortus being the most commonly found, followed by Trematoda, represented by the most commonly found species, Nematophila grandis. Hosts from the Chelidae family had the highest number of helminth taxa, followed by the Kinosternidae family. The most parasitized host species were Chelonoidis denticulatus and Phrynops hilarii. For the host Phrynops geoffroanus, the first occurrence of the nematode helminth Spiroxys contortus was recorded. This is the first study to include all parasitic helminths of terrestrial and freshwater chelonians in the Neotropical region, including a new occurrence in a chelonian host in the hinterland of Para & iacute;ba, Brazil.

AB  - Introduction: Different functional domains can be identified along the longitudinal axis of the mammalian hippocampus. We have recently hypothesized that a similar functional gradient may exist along the longitudinal axis of the avian hippocampal formation (HF) as well. If the 2 gradients are homologous, we would expect the caudal HF to be more responsive to acute stress than the rostral HF. Methods: We restrained 8 adult Dekalb White hens in a bag for 30 min under red-light conditions and compared FOS-immunoreactive (FOS-ir) cell densities in different hippocampal subdivisions to control hens. Results: Although we could find no evidence of an activated stress response in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis of the restrained birds, we did find a significant increase in FOS-ir cell densities in the rostral HF of the restrained birds compared to controls. Conclusion: We speculate that the HF response is not due to an acute stress response, but instead, it is related to the change in spatial context that was part of taking the birds and restraining them in a different room. We see no activation in the caudal HF. This would be consistent with our hypothesis that the longitudinal axis of the avian HF is homologous to the long axis of the mammalian hippocampus.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a strong greenhouse gas, and the emissions from managed soils are increasing. Emissions of N2O are highly variable in time and space, and there are potential triggers for emission peaks both in crop season and no-crop season. The aim of this study was to compare how fertilizer treatments, differing in rate and source of nitrogen (N), influence direct N2O emissions from soil, in crop season as well as in no-crop season, with the use of automated, high-frequency chamber measurements. Emissions were measured from cereal production on a Swedish clay-rich soil fertilized with biogas digestate, pig slurry and two levels of mineral N, as well as from control plots receiving no fertilizer N. The results showed that N2O emissions per unit area were low in all treatments, compared to other studies. Emissions from the treatment with mineral fertilizers at recommended rates were similar to the emissions from the control (0.65 and 0.48 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively). One-year cumulative emissions from a mineral N input rate 50 % higher than recommended were about three times higher than the control. Emissions of N2O from the pig slurry and biogas digestate treatments per unit area were of the same magnitude as from the high mineral N treatment. While the emissions from the high mineral N treatment were associated with elevated concentrations of nitrate in the drainage water, the high emissions from the organic fertilizer treatments were probably a result of large input of ammonium and degradable organic matter both in the year studied and in the preceding year. Most (approximately 75 %) of the N2O emissions occurred between harvest in autumn and sowing in spring, mainly in periods of freeze-thaw cycles. The relative differences between treatments were roughly the same during crop season and no-crop season. This study concludes that it is possible to combine high yields with very low N2O emissions -even on a clay soil in a semi-humid climate -when using mineral fertilizers at recommended rates.

AB  - Prolactin is a polypeptide hormone that plays a critical role in male reproduction. However, the underlying mechanisms of prolactin-regulated testosterone secretion and the roles of lncRNAs in this process remain unclear. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the testicular tissues of cashmere goats with different prolactin levels by means of RNA-sequencing. Then, we constructed a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network by integrating previously submitted testicular mRNA sequencing data. We identified a novel lncRNA named lncRWDD3 and investigated its effects on testosterone synthesis in the Leydig cells of cashmere goat. The primary Leydig cells were used to explore the biological function of lncRWDD3/miR-1388-5p/NPY1R in vitro. This study found that 200 ng/mL of prolactin achieved the highest testosterone secretion in Leydig cells. LncRWDD3 or NPY1R overexpression promoted cAMP levels, testosterone secretion, and related gene expression, while lncRWDD3 or NPY1R interference had the opposite effect. It was found that lncRWDD3 acts on miR-1388-5p as a ceRNA, and neuropeptide Y receptor Y1 (NPY1R) was confirmed to be a target of chi-miR-1388-5p. Our research shows that prolactin regulates the testicular function of cashmere goats via the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network, and lncRWDD3 acts as a ceRNA to activate NPY1R/cAMP signaling via the sponging of miR-1388-5p in order to govern testosterone synthesis in the Leydig cells of cashmere goats. Our results provide insights for future studies on the molecular mechanism of the prolactin regulation of testicular function in goats.

AB  - 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is a crucial metabolic intermediate that affect mitochondrial function in somatic cells. However, the mechanisms by which 5-ALA regulates boar reproductive performance remain unclear. The effect of dietary supplementation of 5-ALA on boar semen quality and reproductive performance were investigated in this study. Forty-five boars were randomly assigned to a control group and four 5-ALA-treatment groups (125, 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/d). After nine weeks of treatment, serum and semen samples were collected from the boars for analysis. Results showed that the supplementation of 5-ALA to boar diet significantly (p < 0.05) increased semen volume, total sperm count, and sperm motility while reducing the proportion of abnormality (p < 0.05). Specifically, 250 mg/kg/d 5-ALA treatment significantly (p < 0.05) reduced sperm DNA oxidative damage and elevated serum testosterone levels. Metabolomic analysis revealed that 250 mg/kg/d 5ALA supplementation significantly increased (p < 0.05) the levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates such as malate and isocitrate, while significantly (p <0.05) reducing harmful metabolites such as Nacetyl phenylalanine that negatively impact sperm quality and fertility. Notably, 250 mg/kg/d 5-ALA supplementation upregulated the protein levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex subunits (NDUFB8, SDHB, UQCRC2, MTCO2, and ATP5A1) and improved sperm mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, and complex IV activity (p < 0.05). Regarding reproductive performance, compared to the control, the percentage of piglets born alive increased by 2.97 %, the farrowing rate improved by 10.59 %, and the occurrence of mummified fetuses decreased by 1.07 % in the 5-ALA-treated groups (p < 0.05). Additionally, 250 mg/kg/d 5-ALA had a long-term beneficial advantage on boar semen quality parameters. Accordingly, dietary supplementation of 5-ALA, specifically, 250 mg/kg/d 5-ALA improved boar semen quality by enhancing seminal plasma metabolome, sperm mitochondrial function and overall reproductive performance.

AB  - The hippocampus plays an important role in spatial navigation and spatial learning across a variety of vertebrate species. Sex and seasonal differences in space use and behavior are known to affect hippocampal volume. Similarly, territoriality and differences in home range size are known to affect the volume of the reptile hippocampal homologues, the medial and dorsal cortices (MC, DC). However, studies have almost exclusively investigated males and little is known about sex or seasonal differences in MC and/or DC volumes in lizards. Here we are the first to simultaneously examine sex and seasonal differences in MC and DC volumes in a wild lizard population. In Sceloporus occidentalis, males display territorial behaviors that are more pronounced during the breeding season. Given this sex difference in behavioral ecology, we expected males to have larger MC and/or DC volumes than females and for this difference to be most pronounced during the breeding season when territorial behavior is increased. Male and female S. occidentalis were captured from the wild during the breeding season and the post-breeding season and were sacrificed within two days of capture. Brains were collected and processed for histology. Cresyl-violet stained sections were used to quantify brain region volumes. In these lizards, breeding females had larger DC volumes than breeding males and non-breeding females. There was no sex or seasonal difference in MC volumes. Differences in spatial navigation in these lizards may involve aspects of spatial memory related to breeding other than territoriality that affect plasticity of the dorsal cortex. This study highlights the importance of investigating sex differences and including females in studies of spatial ecology and neuroplasticity.

AB  - Simple Summary The stress after weaning is the critical problem for nursery pigs. Although antibiotics and zinc oxide (ZnO) could be efficient methods to alleviate weaning stress, the abuse of them might be harmful for the environment. The current study found that live yeast (LY, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain CNCM I-4407, 10(10) CFU/g)) or S. cerevisiae combined with ZnO replacing antibiotics and ZnO could enhance performance and reduce the diarrhea rate in nursery pigs via improving their nutrient utilization, antioxidant capacity, immunoglobulins, fecal volatile fatty acid composition, and microbiota community. The results of this study could be helpful for finding some novel strategies replacing in-feed antibiotics and ZnO to alleviate weaning stress in pigs. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary LY or LY combined with ZnO supplementation on performance and gut health in nursery pigs. 192 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire piglets (weaned on d 32 of the age with 9.2 +/- 1.7 kg BW) were allocated into four treatments with eight replicate pens, six piglets per pen. The treatments included a basal diet as control (CTR), an antibiotic plus ZnO diet (CTC-ZnO, basal diet + 75 mg/kg of chlortetracycline + ZnO (2000 mg/kg from d 1 to 14, 160 mg/kg from d 15 to 28)), a LY diet (LY, basal diet + 2 g/kg LY), and a LY plus ZnO diet (LY-ZnO, basal diet + 1 g/kg LY + ZnO). The results showed that pigs fed LY or LY-ZnO had increased (p < 0.05) average daily gain, serum IgA, IgG, superoxide dismutase, fecal butyric acid, and total volatile fatty acid concentrations, as well as decreased (p < 0.05) feed conversion ratio and diarrhea rate compared with CTR. In conclusion, pigs fed diets with LY or LY combined with ZnO had similar improvement to the use of antibiotics and ZnO in performance, antioxidant status, immunoglobulins, and gut health in nursery pigs.

AB  - Sentinel gardens are a proactive and effective tool for detecting potential pest and pathogen threats before they establish in new regions. By observing interactions between native insects and non-native plants, sentinel gardens provide direct assessments of biological risks posed by these novel interactions. As part of a global sentinel garden network, six ecologically and economically significant Asian tree species were planted in a sentinel garden established by the Forest Entomology Lab at the University of Florida in 2022. The primary goal was to detect local insect species capable of colonizing Asian tree species, which could become serious invasive pests if they are introduced to Asia. This effort complements reciprocal sentinel gardens of American trees planted in Asia. To date, five tree species have successfully established under the conditions in Florida, allowing for herbivory observations. Monitoring revealed frequent, non-lethal herbivory by various Lepidoptera across most tree species, and by sawflies on Chinese pines. Only secondary woodborers were observed colonizing dead twigs and stems, with no evidence of wood borer attacks on living trees or tree mortality.
   Los jardines centinela son una herramienta proactiva y eficaz para detectar posibles amenazas de plagas y pat & oacute;genos antes de que se establezcan en nuevas regiones. Al observar las interacciones entre insectos nativos y plantas no nativas, los jardines centinela proporcionan evaluaciones directas de los riesgos biol & oacute;gicos que presenan estas nuevas interacciones. Como parte de una red global de jardines centinela, se plantaron seis especies de & aacute;rboles asi & aacute;ticos de importancia ecol & oacute;gica y econ & oacute;mica en un jard & iacute;n centinela establecido por el Forest Entomology Laboratory de la University of Florida en 2022. El objetivo principal era detectar especies locales de insectos capaces de colonizar especies de & aacute;rboles asi & aacute;ticos, que podr & iacute;an convertirse en plagas invasoras graves si se introducen a Asia. Este esfuerzo complementa los jardines centinela rec & iacute;procos de & aacute;rboles estadounidenses plantados en Asia. Hasta la fecha, cinco especies de & aacute;rboles se han establecido con & eacute;xito en las condiciones de Florida, permitiendo observaciones de herbivor & iacute;a.

AB  - While many species are affected by trafficking in their products, some take centre stage, including elephants, rhinos, pangolins and helmeted hornbills, and we report an open trade that continued in these items in eastern Myanmar between 2015 and 2020. We surveyed Myanmar's border towns of Tachilek and Mong La, recording volumes, prices, origins and trade routes. We observed c. 16 500 ivory items, 8 helmeted hornbill casques and 264 beads, over 100 African rhino horn items and over 250 pangolins (mainly skins and scales). In 2020, asking prices in Mong La for rhino horn tips were US$10 770, rhino horn bracelets US$5385, helmeted hornbill casques US$2424 and big ivory bangles c. US$800, with prices being stable overall since 2017. We estimate the combined monetary values at US$0.25-0.30 million for Tachilek and US$0.75-2.00 million for Mong La. Mong La's market today far surpasses Tachilek's, being on the border of mainland China. Mobile phones and online trading allow customers to order items without bothering to cross the borders. Commitment to address the illegal wildlife trade across Myanmar's borders requires a greater degree of cooperation and coordination amongst the relevant authorities in Myanmar, China and Thailand.

AB  - Simple Summary Maximizing the combination of biological control by natural enemies and plant resistance is a key strategy for controlling aphids in various crop systems. In our study, some alfalfa cultivars were found to have resistance to the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, a dominant pest in alfalfa fields in northwestern China. In addition, natural enemies were able to significantly suppress this aphid, regardless of the resistance level of the nine cultivars tested. Moreover, the biological control efficacies of predators, parasitoids, and mixed populations of natural enemies were 85%, 42%, and 88%, respectively. Conservation of natural enemies in the field is an ecologically sound and efficient approach to the management of the pea aphid in alfalfa crops. The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, is a major pest of alfalfa in northwestern China. However, the roles of different groups of natural enemies in combination with aphid-resistant cultivars in the suppression of the pea aphid have not been clarified under field conditions. In this study, we used experimental cages to better understand the top-down (natural enemies) and bottom-up (nine alfalfa cultivars) biological processes, as well as the individual roles of the two processes, in the control of the pea aphid. There was a significant difference in resistance among cultivar classes revealed when natural enemies were excluded. The functional contribution of top-down suppression was higher than the bottom-up process, with natural enemies significantly suppressing aphid populations, regardless of the resistance level of different alfalfa cultivars. The mean biological efficacies of predators, parasitoids, and mixed populations of natural enemies were 85%, 42%, and 88%, respectively. Overall, our study indicated that natural enemies play a critical role in suppressing aphid populations, especially in the summer, whereas cultivar resistance did not combine effectively with natural enemies to inhibit the growth of aphids. Conservation biological control (CBC) can be implemented in the alfalfa production regions in northwestern China to reduce the overreliance on insecticides for the control of pests and mitigate their harmful effects on humans, ecosystems, and biodiversity.

AB  - Context Castration of lambs is an old practice for managing reproduction and improving meat quality. However, the traditional method raises welfare concerns. To overcome these limitations, immunocastration has gained attention as an ethical and effective solution to the welfare challenges associated with surgical castration by targeting the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.Aims In this investigation, we study the impact of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) immunocastration by analysing its influence on testosterone levels, colon microorganisms, and metabolomics.Methods The experiment is divided into immunocastrated (IMCF), surgically castrated (ORCCF), and control (EMCF) groups of male sheep. Blood and fecal samples were collected for testosterone measurement, metabolomics and microbiota analysis. Metabolomics was analysed by LC-MS/MS, while microbiota analysis was performed using 16S rRNA sequencing.Key results The testosterone level in both IMCF and ORCCF groups significantly declined compared to the EMCF. Furthermore, the relative abundance of bacteroidota to Firmicutes was higher in the IMCF and ORCCF groups compared to the EMCF group. The IMCF group showed increased levels of beneficial genera, Bacteroides, compared to the ORCCF and EMCF groups. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis revealed that GnRH immunocastration significantly affected some metabolites, such as methyl stearate and 23-nordeoxycholic acid, which were significantly upregulated in the IMCF group relative to the ORCCF group. In contrast, N '-formylkynurenine and 6-aminonicotinamide showed marked downregulation.Conclusions GnRH immunocastration is an effective alternative to surgical castration with added benefits for health and metabolic efficiency, highlighting its potential advantages in animal welfare and productivity.Implications The study highlights the potential of GnRH immunocastration, which contributes to advancing modern techniques. This approach offers ethical livestock management practices.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonize the roots of most plants, forming a near-ubiquitous symbiosis1 that is typically characterized by the bi-directional exchange of fungal-acquired nutrients for plant-fixed carbon.2 Mycorrhizal fungi can form below-ground networks3-6 with potential to facilitate the movement of carbon, nutrients, and defense signals across plant communities.7-9 The importance of neighbors in mediating carbon for-nutrient exchange between mycorrhizal fungi and their plant hosts remains equivocal, particularly when other competing pressures for plant resources are present. We manipulated carbon source and sink strengths of neighboring pairs of host plants through exposure to aphids and tracked the movement of carbon and nutrients through mycorrhizal fungal networks with isotope tracers. When carbon sink strengths of both neighboring plants were increased by aphid herbivory, plant carbon supply to extraradical mycorrhizal fungal hyphae was reduced, but mycorrhizal phosphorus supply to both plants was maintained, albeit variably, across treatments. However, when the sink strength of only one plant in a pair was increased, carbon supply to mycorrhizal fungi was restored. Our results show that loss of carbon inputs into mycorrhizal fungal hyphae from one plant may be ameliorated through inputs of a neighbor, demonstrating the responsiveness and resilience of mycorrhizal plant communities to biological stressors. Furthermore, our results indicate that mycorrhizal nutrient exchange dynamics are better understood as community-wide interactions between multiple players rather than as strict exchanges between individual plants and their symbionts, suggesting that mycorrhizal C-for-nutrient exchange is likely based more on unequal terms of trade than the "fair trade"model for symbiosis.

AB  - We sought to ascertain whether zoonotic strongyloidiasis occurred in vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), non-human primate (NHP) species becoming increasingly common in Southern Malawi. Faecal collection took place in four locations: Nyala Park, a private wildlife reserve adjacent to a sugarcane plantation in Chikwawa District, and three public locations, each near tourist lodges in Mangochi District. Our sampling took place during July 2023, when 32 faecal samples were inspected with parasitological methods. After faecal culture, thread worm larvae were noted in both districts that were confirmed by molecular identification methods as Strongyloides fuelleborni, a first report for Malawi. Given the close spatial proximity of vervets with people, our findings affirm prior disease surveillance concerns of local zoonotic potential. We therefore encourage future targeted helminthological surveys for better local monitoring of strongyloidiasis in NHPs and people.

AB  - Understanding how climate warming will influence species interactions is a key question in ecology and predicting changes in the prevalence of disease outbreaks is particularly challenging. Ectotherms are likely to be more influenced by climatic changes as temperature governs their growth, feeding, development, and behavior. We test the hypothesis that pathogen transmission and host mortality will increase at warmer temperatures using a cyclic forest insect, the western tent caterpillar (WTC), Malacosoma californicum pluviale, and its baculovirus. The virus causes population declines at peak host density. WTC are gregarious and clustering is predicted to increase the risk of within family infection; however, how temperature influences this has not been examined. We investigated the impact of temperature on different components of the transmission process in order to pinpoint the possible mechanisms involved. In the laboratory, leaf consumption increased linearly with rising temperature between 15 and 30 degrees C. Insects died more rapidly from virus infection as temperature increased, but this did not translate into differences in the production of viral transmission stages. To examine the influence of temperature on virus transmission, we created a temperature difference between two greenhouses containing potted red alder trees, Alnus rubra. The cooler greenhouse (mean 19.5 degrees C) was roughly similar to ambient temperatures in the field, while the warmer greenhouse was 10 degrees C higher (mean 29 degrees C). As predicted, both larval movement and feeding were higher at the warmer temperature, while the likelihood of the preinfected, inoculum larvae dying on the tents was twice as high in the cooler greenhouse. This resulted in increased virus mortality and a higher transmission parameter under cooler conditions. Therefore, we suggest that, contrary to our prediction, the reduced movement of infected larvae at colder temperatures increased the risk of infection in these gregarious insects and had a greater impact on virus transmission than the increased activity of the susceptible larvae in warmer conditions. Long-term population data from the field, however, show no relationship between temperature and infection levels, suggesting that local changes in virus transmission might not scale up to population infection levels.

AB  - The bulking agent plays an important role in aerobic composting, but their shape, porosity, and homogeneity need to be optimized. In the present work, a bulking agent with a uniform shape was prepared by 3D printing to explore its influence on physicochemical parameters, microbial community succession, and gene abundance of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in swine manure aerobic composting. The results showed that adding 3D-printed bulking agents can increase maximum temperature, prolong the thermophilic period, and improve the degradation rate of volatile solids, which was attributed to ameliorative air permeability by the porous 3D-printed bulking agent. The abundances of some pathogenic bacteria decreased and CAZymes genes increased respectively in response to the addition of the 3D-printed bulking agent, implying it has a certain positive effect on improving the safety of compost products and promoting the degradation of organic matter. In summary, the 3D-printed bulking agent has good application potential in laboratory-scale aerobic composting.

AB  - Purpose Hydatid disease is one of the neglected and challenging (for diagnosis as well as for treatment) parasitic diseases. Along with adverse effect on animal's health leading to production losses, hydatidosis is also associated with huge economic losses. The present study was envisaged with an aim to assess the phylogeny and pathological changes due to natural hydatid cysts in lungs and liver of slaughtered buffaloes in north India. Methods A total of 137 slaughtered buffaloes intended for human consumption were screened for the presence of cysts. The retrieved cysts were confirmed molecularly based on the amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 gene (mtCO1), exhibiting a product size of approximately 446 bp. The samples collected from infected lungs and liver were subjected to histopathological examination. Results The hydatid cysts were recorded in 25 (18.2%) animals. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the isolated strain to be closely related to Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1) genotype. The nucleotide diversity (pi) obtained was 0.014685, whereas, Tajima's D was negative (- 2.796053), which indicated purifying selection or recent population expansion. Histopathologically, in the infected lungs, fibrosis and inflammatory reaction comprising of mononuclear cells and fibroblasts around the thick coat of granulation tissue were observed. Marked calcified masses and necrosis were also observed in the calcified cysts. However, in case of infected livers, Kupffer cell hyperplasia, degeneration of hepatocytes, fibrosis and inflammatory cells were most commonly observed around the hydatid cysts. Conclusion The findings of the present study are of significant veterinary and medical importance owing to economic and public health impact of G1 genotype of E. granulosus.

AB  - In coastal regions, accurate storm surge prediction is crucial for effective disaster management and risk mitigation. This study presents a comparative analysis between BALSSA (Bidirectional Attention-based LSTM for Storm Surge Architecture) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) numerical storm surge model, focusing on the Saola-induced storm surge in Macao, September 2023. To train and assess the model, we leverage an extensive dataset comprising meteorological and tide level information from more than 80 typhoon occurrences in Macao spanning the period from 2017 to 2023. The results provide evidence of BALSSA's effectiveness in capturing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of storm surges, with a lead time of up to 72 h, as reflected by its MAE of 0.019 and RMSE of 0.024. It demonstrates reliable accuracy in predicting storm surge magnitude, timing, and spatial extent, potentially contributing to more precise and timely warnings for coastal communities. Furthermore, the real-time data assimilation feature of BALSSA ensures up-to-date information, aligned with the latest observations, which is essential for effective emergency preparedness and response. The high-resolution grids enhance risk assessment, highlighting BALSSA's potential for early warnings, emergency planning, and coastal risk management. This study contributes valuable insights to the broader field of storm surge prediction, guiding decision-making processes and supporting the development of effective strategies to enhance coastal resilience.

AB  - We explored the concentration patterns of the bioactive metabolite plumericin produced by Himatanthus tarapotensis (Apocynaceae) under different edaphic conditions and variations in rainfall intensity, as well as its potential role in the chemical defense against insect herbivores. Values of plumericin concentration from leaves were obtained by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, and evaluated as a function of differences in soil types, variation of precipitation, and variation of the abundance of insect herbivores, using first a Repeated Measures Correlation (rmcorr) and then a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) analysis. Plumericin concentration is highly variable among plants, but with a significantly higher concentration in plants growing on clay soil compared to that of the white-sand soil habitat (p < 0.001). Plumericin concentration is not affected by precipitation. The caterpillar of Isognathus leachii (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae) is the most conspicuous herbivore of H. tarapotensis, and its presence is continuous but not related to plumericin concentration, probably because of its capacity to elude the chemical defense of this plant. Nevertheless, our multivariate model revealed that plumericin concentration is related to the abundance of Hymenoptera (Formicidae), and this relationship is significantly influenced by the soil parameters of carbon percentage, clay percentage, and phosphorous percentage (p < 0.001). Plumericin is a mediating agent in the interaction between H. tarapotensis and its natural environment. Variation in plumericin concentration would be induced by the abundance of Hymenoptera (Formicidae), probably as a chemical response against these insects, and by differences in soil nutrient availability.

AB  - Phytochemical defenses, plant-produced compounds that can deter or slow herbivores, are critical in influencing the interactions between herbivores and their host plants-some of the most diverse and abundant organisms on earth. We discuss the foundational findings and theories related to the direct defense of plants against herbivores by these compounds, as well as continuing research questions in this field. We highlight the costs associated with phytochemical defense production and variation within individual plants in the distribution of phytochemicals, both spatially and temporally. We then discuss coevolutionary theory and the adaptations of herbivores to cope with phytochemical defense compounds. Last, we delve into the incredible diversity of phytochemical compounds, the role of diversity in herbivory, and new ways of measuring and understanding phytochemical diversity.

AB  - Herbicide pollution is a main form of water pollution. As a result of additional harms to other non-target organisms, it threatens the function and structure of ecosystems. Previous researches mainly focused on the assessment of the toxicity and ecological effect of herbicides on monotrophic organisms. Responses of mixotrophs as an important component of functional groups are rarely understood in contaminated waters, although their metabolic plasticity and unique ecological functions in ecosystem stability are a major concern. This work aimed to investigate the trophic plasticity of mixotrophic organisms in atrazine-contaminated waters, and a primarily heterotrophic Ochromonas was used as the tested organism. Results showed that the herbicide atrazine significantly inhibited the photochemical activity and impaired the photosynthetic machine of Ochromonas, and photosynthesis activated by light was sensitive to atrazine. However, phagotrophy was unaffected by atrazine and closely correlated with growth rate, indicating that heterotrophy helped population maintenance during herbicide exposure. Mixotrophic Ochromonas upregulated the gene expression level involved in photosynthesis, energy synthesis, and antioxidation to adapt to increasing atrazine after long-term exposure. Compared with bacterivory, herbivory increased atrazine tolerance of photosynthesis under mixotrophic status. This study systematically illustrated the mechanism by which mixotrophic Ochromonas respond to the herbicide atrazine at population, photochemical activity, morphology, and gene expression levels and demonstrated the potential effect of atrazine on the metabolic flexibility and ecological niches of mixotrophs. These findings will provide important theoretical reference for governance and management decision-making in contaminated environments.

AB  - This study provides new species records (NRs) of macroalgal assemblages present in rocky habitats from the South Shetland Islands (SSI) and north-eastern Antarctic Peninsula (EAP), Weddell Sea. Surveys were conducted during the summers of 2013/2014 to 2017/2018 at Elephant, Deception, Half Moon and Vega islands. Data from the present study and those available in the literature from the western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) were combined to provide an updated checklist, giving insights into macroecology and potential changes in thermohaline circulation patterns. A total of 48 macroalgal taxa were identified from our sampling, with eight representing NRs to the EAP sector of the Weddell Sea and five representing NRs to the SSI. Statistical differences among the assemblages from the SSI, WAP and EAP were identified. NRs, including opportunistic species and new information about the biogeographical distributions of species reported here, give insights into ecoregional connectivity and environmental changes. This study updates macroalgal diversity records in regions that are currently experiencing the impacts of climate change. Future and ongoing monitoring for conservation purposes is required to detect non-native species, new dispersal pathways and patterns related to thermohaline anomalies in Antarctic waters.

AB  - Unregulated livestock breeding and grazing can degrade grasslands and damage the ecological environment. The combination of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques is a more convenient and powerful means to acquire livestock information in a large area than traditional manual ground investigation. As a mainstream remote sensing platform, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can obtain high-resolution optical images to detect grazing livestock in grassland. However, grazing livestock objects in UAV images usually occupy very few pixels and tend to gather together, which makes them difficult to detect and count automatically. This paper proposes the GLDM (grazing livestock detection model), a lightweight and high-accuracy deep-learning model, for detecting grazing livestock in UAV images. The enhanced CSPDarknet (ECSP) and weighted aggregate feature re-extraction pyramid modules (WAFR) are constructed to improve the performance based on the YOLOX-nano network scheme. The dataset of different grazing livestock (12,901 instances) for deep learning was made from UAV images in the Hadatu Pasture of Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, China. The results show that the proposed method achieves a higher comprehensive detection precision than mainstream object detection models and has an advantage in model size. The mAP of the proposed method is 86.47%, with the model parameter 5.7 M. The average recall and average precision can be above 85% at the same time. The counting accuracy of grazing livestock in the testing dataset, when converted to a unified sheep unit, reached 99%. The scale applicability of the model is also discussed, and the GLDM could perform well with the image resolution varying from 2.5 to 10 cm. The proposed method, the GLDM, was better for detecting grassland grazing livestock in UAV images, combining remote sensing, AI, and grassland ecological applications with broad application prospects.

AB  - The egg size of insects often exhibits latitudinal trends, which are attributed to local adaptations to temperature or temperature-related ecological factors. Although increased egg size improves offspring fitness, the relationship between size and fitness is influenced largely by environmental variables. Additionally, there is a trade-off between the size and number of eggs if the quantity of reproductive resources is constant. Despite the key associations among offspring size, number and performance, relatively few studies have jointly considered these traits when studying the genetic differentiation of egg size. Here, we examined the effects of latitude on egg size using 14 populations of the univoltine rhinoceros beetle Trypoxylus dichotomus (Coleoptera, Scarabaeidae, Dynastinae) along a 1200-km latitudinal gradient under common garden laboratory conditions. We found that egg size decreased with increasing latitude in a non-linear manner. Geographical variation in egg size was independent of maternal body size, and there was no difference in female lifetime fecundity between the low-latitude (large eggs) and high-latitude (small eggs) populations. Therefore, low-latitude females invest more resources in reproduction compared with high-latitude females. We further found that the larvae of the high-latitude population showed higher mortality than those of the low-latitude population under both nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich conditions. Although the ecological factors that shape the non-linear cline of egg size were not identified in our study, geographical variation in local environments or in female reproductive strategies could have caused the latitudinal trend.

AB  - Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) provide relevant information on wildlife welfare but remain underapplied in conservation due to sample preservation issues. We validated a field-friendly drying and storage method for preserving African elephant faeces, addressing logistical challenges of fGCM quantification, while anticipating the growing interest in considering welfare in conservation management.
   Faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCMs) are a relevant means of non-invasively assessing adrenocortical activity and thus, a key physiological stress response in wildlife populations. However, the widespread use of fGCMs as a stress-related biomarker in conservation biology is often hampered by the logistical challenge of storing collected faecal material frozen until it reaches the laboratory for analysis. Although alternative approaches to minimize potential alteration of fGCM composition post-defecation have been recently identified, there is to our knowledge, no satisfactory alternative method established for the preservation of elephant dung. In this study, we validated a field-friendly protocol for dehydrating African elephant faeces samples using a food dehydrator with desiccant and investigated the stability of fGCM concentrations in the dehydrated faeces when stored at ambient temperature. We collected 40 faecal samples from African elephants and compared fGCM concentrations of freeze-dried and dehydrated sample sub-sets. Samples dried in the field showed a slight but significant overall -6% reduction in fGCM concentration compared with frozen control samples. However, fGCM concentrations following field dehydration protocol match those of control samples with high accuracy, as evidenced by the low bias and strong coefficient of determination between the two approaches (R-2 = 0.88). In addition, over nearly 2 months, storage time at ambient temperature of the dehydrated samples had no effect on the fGCM concentrations compared with those measured in the control samples (F-statistic = 1.82; P = 0.18). Dehydrating the samples in the field thus provides an easy and cost-effective alternative to freezing, especially when working in remote areas with unstable electrical supply. Our results encourage the widespread use of fGCMs by conservationists as non-invasive means of steroid monitoring of African elephants in the current context of a general increase in wildlife welfare research. Future studies are needed to extend the use of this protocol to other species and to other steroid classes.

AB  - Dairy sheep farming is a significant agricultural sector in Mediterranean countries, providing income and employment opportunities in less-favoured areas (LFAs). The economic performance of dairy sheep farms is of significant interest to LFAs. However, relevant literature is scarce. The objectives here were to evaluate the economic performance of dairy sheep farms in LFAs of Greece and perform a comparative analysis based on flock size and farming system. In total, 19 and 26 dairy sheep farms for two production periods were used. Farm technical (flock size, production, grazing and nutritional management) and economic (income and variable costs) data were collected. The economic performance of farms was estimated using Happy Goats, a decision support tool for small ruminant farming. Estimated economic parameters were analysed by flock size (<= 150 ewes vs. >150 ewes) and farming system (intensive/semi-intensive vs. semi-extensive). Results showed that 37% and 31% of farms were operating with losses in each production period, respectively. Based on nutritional management, ewes produced about 50 kg less milk per milking period. Smaller and semi-extensive farms had significantly (p < 0.05) lower incomes and variable costs. A significantly (p < 0.05) lower average gross margin was reported for smaller compared to larger farms. Results suggest a better economic perspective for larger flock sizes.

AB  - Parasitoids are insects that lay eggs in other insects, but before this, they have the remarkable task of locating and successfully attacking a suitable individual. Once an egg is laid, many herbivorous hosts carry defensive symbionts that prevent parasitoid development. Some symbioses can act ahead of these defences by reducing parasitoid foraging efficiency, while others may betray their hosts by producing chemical cues that attract parasitoids. In this review, we provide examples of symbionts altering the different steps that adult parasitoids need to take to achieve egg laying. We also discuss how interactions between habitat complexity, plants and herbivores modulate the way symbionts affect parasitoid foraging, and parasitoid evaluation of patch quality based on risk cues derived from parasitoid antagonists such as competing parasitoids and predators.

AB  - While scavenging has been repeatedly reported for several felid species, surprisingly little information is available on scavenging behavior of the European wildcat (Felis silvestris). To fill this knowledge gap, we used camera traps to document scavenging behavior at the 48 experimentally set deer carcasses at random locations throughout the year. We recorded European wildcats scavenging on 38% of the eight carcasses set in winter and on none set in the other parts of the year. Wildcats fed on two carcasses for extended periods (up to 22 days) with an average of 3.3 visits per day and 7.8-h interval between the visits. We recorded scavenging throughout the day, but analysis indicated a crepuscular pattern. We also recorded caching behavior on 7% of the visits (n = 105), when wildcats used leaves or snow to partly or completely cover the carcasses. Beside wildcats, 12 other vertebrate species of scavengers were recorded at the carcasses. We recorded agonistic interaction with European badger (Meles meles) and despite its smaller size, the wildcat managed to defend the carcass. The extensive feeding, frequent caching behavior and active defense from scavengers indicate that the wildcats recognized the ungulate carcasses as an important food source in winter and that scavenging could be a neglected aspect of the European wildcat ecology. We also suggest that caching behavior could be regularly used by the European wildcat when feeding on larger carcasses, but was likely previously missed due to limited research effort to record scavenging and caching behavior.

AB  - This study employs a thorough methodology to define water sustainability criteria for the development of new pig farms on the karst aquifer of Yucatan, Mexico. The integrated approach entails a field campaign to assess water quality from the aquifer (wells and cenotes) and effluents from designated pig farms to evaluate adherence to environmental regulations, alongside the utilisation of an extensive pig farm database that includes pig populations by the municipality in Yucatan. The water sustainability of pig farming in Yucatan was analysed by evaluating the nitrogen greywater footprint and water pollution levels for this municipality sector. The intensive pig farming practices in Yucatan significantly contribute to water contamination through nutrient runoff, namely nitrogen and phosphorus. Moreover, the breach of environmental regulations concerning pig farm effluents is demonstrated. This highlights the urgent need to regulate and monitor the expansion of new pig farms in Yucatan. Results introduce evidence-based criteria and their thresholds for achieving water sustainability in the pig sector at the municipal level (Pigs/ha = 1.0 and WPL < 1.1). This facilitated a concerted effort between national and state authorities to limit the proliferation of pig farms in order to safeguard the aquifer's water quality.

AB  - Simple Summary This study investigates the autoimmune effects of gold aurothiomalate (AuTM) exposure in genetically different mouse strains to understand how gold triggers autoimmune diseases. We focused on two strains, A.TL and A.SW, which share genetic similarities except for H-2-related genes. Here, we show that A.TL mice, when exposed to AuTM, developed specific immune responses, including increased levels of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) compared to A.SW mice. A.TL mice showed a particularly strong response, especially in females, resembling symptoms of human autoimmune diseases like lupus. These findings suggest that A.TL mice could be a valuable model for studying environment-induced autoimmunity, helping to explore the genetic mechanisms behind these conditions and potentially leading to improved diagnosis and treatment of autoimmune diseases in humans.Abstract To demonstrate causation or/and assess pathogenic mechanisms of environment-induced autoimmunity, various animal models that mimic the characteristics of the human autoimmune diseases need to be developed. Experimental studies in mice reveal the genetic factors that contribute to autoimmune diseases. Here, the immune response of two mouse strains congenic for non-H-2 genes, A.TL (H-2tl) and A.SW (H-2s), was evaluated after 15 weeks' exposure to gold aurothiomalate (AuTM). AuTM-treated A.TL mice showed anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) with homogenous and/or fine speckled staining patterns and serum autoantibodies to ds-DNA, chromatin, histones, and ribonucleoproteins (RNP). Female A.TL mice showed a stronger immune response than males, as well as an increase of B cells in their spleen after 15 weeks of gold exposure. A.SW exposed for AuTM showed the induction of anti-nucleolar antibodies (ANoA) with a clumpy staining pattern, as well as an increase in splenic B and T cells. The serum autoantibodies levels in A.SW mice were limited compared to those of A.TL mice. Overall, A.TL presents a stronger immune response after gold exposure than A.SW. The immune response developed in A.TL presents similarities with the clinical manifestations in human autoimmune diseases. Thus, gold-exposed A.TL could constitute a potential experimental mouse model for the study of autoimmunity.

AB  - The effect of internal parasites on goats is of major concern, particularly in the tropics where there are limited resources and financially constrained farmers. The ethnic knowledge on controlling and treating internal parasites is of value to sustainable and organic product production which are essential for long-term prosperity of goat farmers. Using participatory approaches, this study identified and documented popular plants used by farmers to control internal parasites in goats in the Ngamiland region of Botswana. A total of 120 communal farmers were interviewed using a structured questionnaire consisting of demographic parameters and ethnobotanical information. The data was analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and the most popular plants were identified using fidelity levels (FL). Most of the informants were secondary educated males of 50 to 60 years and relied on livestock for their livelihoods. It was recorded that a total of 13 local plant species from 11 families are commonly used in the treatment of intestinal parasites in goats. The plant family Fabaceae (27.3 %) was common among the farmers. The roots (76.9 %) were the most frequently used plant part while decoction (46 %) was popular in medicinal preparations. The prepared plant-based medicine is often administered orally. The highest FL values were found for the following plant species; Terminalia sericea, Gnidia capitata and Aloe ferox, scoring 89.3 %, 88.0 % and 86.3 %, respectively. The safety and efficacy of these plants should be validated to inform strategic utilization and alternative cost-effective strategy in managing internal parasites in Botswana. (c) 2024 SAAB.

AB  - Paleontological occurrences of helodermatid lizards (Helodermatidae) are relatively uncommon and scattered in the North American fossil record. A recently discovered concentration of vertebrate fossils was exposed in a karstic fissure filling in an active rock quarry in southwestern Oklahoma. Underwater screening of the ancient cave fill yielded numerous isolated and fragmentary skeletal elements of a diversity of small, and a few large, vertebrates including unexpected remains of Heloderma sp. as well as extinct large mammals (horse, peccary, Dwarf Pronghorn), indicating Pleistocene age. Radiometric dating of the locality is not possible because of the leaching, but fossils of the Prairie Vole, Microtus ochrogaster, from the locality help to constrain the age of the deposit between 1.21 Ma and 0.01 Ma. The fossils are the first of Heloderma in the Pleistocene of Oklahoma and the southern Great Plains. Based on taphonomic evidence and the relative abundance of rodent teeth, we infer that the fossils accumulated at least partly as the remains of vertebrates fed upon by Ringtails (Bassariscus; Procyonidae) and other small carnivorous mammals. The Pleistocene occurrence of Heloderma in the southern Great Plains of North American has potential implications for the paleobiogeography of the genus and begs further investigation of fossil herpetofaunas in North America.

AB  - Blowflies and beetles are among the invertebrate species that are attracted to dead bodies and can provide valid evidence in cases of murder or suspicious death investigation. An important consideration is the quality of the evidence which partly depends on the accurate identification of invertebrates. The morphological identification of blowflies has some limitations, especially in relation to damaged samples, or immature stages of the flies. DNA-based techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis have been applied to overcome the shortfalls of the classical identification methods. The present study combined the use of classical and PCR methods to identify invertebrates associated with pig carrions in Nigeria. Adult invertebrates were collected on and around pig carcasses in Nigeria. A total of 416 invertebrates belonging to Diptera; Calliphoridae (n = 160), Sarcophagidae (n = 26) and Muscidae (n = 72) while Coleopterans; Dermestidae (n = 52), Histeridae (n = 63), Cleridae (n = 25) and Silphidae (n = 18) families collected from pig carrions in Nigeria were identified. The cytochrome oxidase 1 (cox1) gene from selected specimens was amplified and sequenced. Nucleotide sequence analysis and phylogenetic trees confirmed the presence of dipterans and coleopterans of forensic importance in Nigeria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to use the mitochondrial cox1 gene coupled with sequence analysis to identify and characterize arthropods of forensic importance in Nigeria. This study provides reliable baseline data for further use in forensic entomology within the country and other regions where these arthropod species exist.

In order to provide new data, this study was carried out in the protected area of the Maiella National Park (Central Italy) sampling wild and domestic ungulates that share or do not share grazing lands. The analysis was realized by combining the georeferenced data of animals and the microbiological investigations starting from fresh fecal samples. The Escherichia coli isolates were tested for antibiotics particularly relevant in human health. Even if the selected molecules are not currently used in veterinary medicine, evidence of resistant bacteria was found in sympatric wild and domestic animals, as well as in non-sympatric domestic animals. The detection of colistin resistance gene mcr-4 and carbapenems resistance genes OXA-48 was reported for the first time in wild ungulates in Italy and in Europe. More investigations are necessary, but these preliminary results highlight the importance of continuing studies for the early detection of emerging resistance patterns. The aim of this study was to determine and characterize potential resistance mechanisms against selected Critically Important Antibiotics in Escherichia coli isolates collected from wild and domestic ruminants living in the Maiella National Park, in Central Italy. A total of 38 isolates were obtained from red deer, Apennine chamois, cattle, sheep, and goats grazing in lands with different levels of anthropic pressure. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by Minimal Inhibitory Concentration testing, showing phenotypic resistance to colistin, meropenem, or ceftazidime in 9 isolates along with one bacterial strain being resistant to three of the tested antibiotics. In addition, the biomolecular assays allowed the amplification of the genes conferring the colistin (mcr-4), the carbapenems (OXA-48), penicillins and cephalosporins (TEM, SHV, CMY-1, CMY-2) resistance. In order to describe the potential pathogenicity of isolates under study, virulence genes related to Shiga toxin-producing (STEC) and enteropathogenic (EPEC) pathovars were identified. This study is the first report of mcr-4 and OXA-48 genes in resistant E. coli harboring virulence genes in Italian wildlife, with special regard to Apennine chamois and red deer species. The multidisciplinary approach used in this study can improve the early detection of emerging antibiotic resistance determinants in human-animal-environment interfaces by means of wildlife monitoring.

AB  - Simple Summary Vitrification is a commonly used cryopreservation technique that has played an important role in the preservation of animal genetic resources and assisted reproduction in humans. However, the effect of vitrification on embryonic genome activation remains to be elucidated. This study found that vitrification reduced the developmental efficiency of pig blastocysts. Further studies found that vitrification reduced transcriptional activity during embryonic genome activation and disrupted gene expression. Our findings suggest that vitrification impairs genome activation in pig embryos, and our results can provide new insight into improving the developmental efficiency of vitrified embryos. Zygotic genome activation (ZGA) plays an essential role in early embryonic development. Vitrification is a common assisted reproductive technology that frequently reduces the developmental competence of embryos. However, the effect of vitrification on porcine ZGA and gene expression during ZGA remains largely unclear. Here, we found that vitrification of pronuclear zygotes derived from parthenogenetic activation (PA) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) resulted in a significant reduction in the rates of 2-cell, 4-cell, and blastocysts, but did not affect the quality of blastocysts. Functional research revealed that RNA polymerase II Inhibitor (alpha-amanitin) treatment significantly reduced global transcriptional activity and developmental efficiency of both 4-cell and 8-cell embryos, implying an essential role of ZGA in porcine early embryonic development. Furthermore, vitrification did not affect the synthesis of nascent mRNA of 2-cell embryos, but significantly inhibited global transcriptional activity of both 4-cell and 8-cell embryos, suggesting an impaired effect of vitrification on porcine ZGA. Correspondingly, the single-cell analysis showed that vitrification caused the downregulation or upregulation expression of maternal genes in 4-cell embryos, also significantly decreased the expression of zygotic genes. Taken together, these results indicated that vitrification of pronuclear zygotes impairs porcine zygotic genome activation.

AB  - To improve the energy absorption of the traditional tube, a bionic tube was proposed based on the structure and mechanical properties of yak horn. The specific energy absorption of bionic tube is 1.25, 0.89 and 1.02 times higher than that of circular tube, square tube, tapered tube. The taper(beta)and the ratio of wall thickness(alpha) have an effect on the energy absorption. 11 kinds of bionic tubes were evaluated with the Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS). The energy absorption characteristics of BT-7 are better than those of other tubes. Finally, the Design-expert software was used to analyze the test results, and the optimal combination was obtained when alpha = 2 and beta = 82 degrees.

AB  - In situ remediation of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) (Cd&As) contaminated soil using iron-based materials has been extensively investigated. Simultaneous immobilizing Cd&As with iron-based materials while maintaining soil health poses a significant challenge. This study examined the effects of sepiolite-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (S-nZVI) combined with organic amendments (RS: Rice straw; PM: Pig manure) on Cd&As uptake by rice and soil quality. Grain Cd (0.134 mg kg(-1)) and inorganic As (iAs) (0.099 mg kg(-1)) levels in S-nZVI+PM treatment were reduced by 78.95 % and 68.69 % compared to CK (P < 0.05), and decreased by 52.62 % and 17.50 % compared to S-nZVI treatment (P < 0.05), significantly lower than the Chinese Food Safety Standard (<0.20 mg kg(-1)). The elevated soil pH, increased amorphous iron (Feox), and PM complexation co-contributed to Cd immobilization in S-nZVI+PM treatment; concurrently, the higher Feox maintained lower available As levels in paddy soil. In addition, S-nZVI+PM improved soil fertility, functional enzyme activity, soil bacterial community diversity, and increased brown rice yield. However, S-nZVI+RS facilitated the reductive dissolution of Fe(oxy)(hydro) oxides and As methylation in paddy soil, significantly increasing the total As and organic As content in grains by 113.13 % and 236.79 %, respectively, compared to S-nZVI treatment. Caution should be exercised in the application of S-nZVI+RS in As-contaminated paddy soil. S-nZVI+PM proved more effective in immobilizing Cd&As and provided greater benefits to soil quality compared to S-nZVI+RS. Overall, S-nZVI+PM represents an eco-friendly approach for alleviating Cd&As accumulation in rice grains while concurrently improving soil health.

AB  - High temperature and drought are the main factors restricting the increase in Camellia oleifera Abel production that can seriously harm its physiological and biochemical functions. This study aimed to explore the effect by which Ca2+ enhances the drought resistance of C. oleifera. Four-year-old potted plants of the 'Xianglin 210' variety were treated with four levels of CaCl2 solution (0, 10, 20, and 40 mmol/L) and subjected to natural drought stress. The drought levels were categorized as CS (non-drought), LD (light drought), MD (moderate drought), and SD (severe drought). The effects of drought stress on the growth and physiological-biochemical characteristics of C. oleifera were measured. Under drought stress, spraying CaCl2 solution on leaves could significantly increase the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), endogenous hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and gibberellic acid (GA) content in organs and tissues; enhance the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity; and decrease the concentration of intercellular carbon dioxide (Ci) and number of dehiscence fruits. Spraying 10 mmol/L CaCl2 effectively alleviates the damage of drought stress to tung oil trees. The study provides references for alleviating drought stress and increasing economic benefits in C. oleifera production.

AB  - Simple Summary Competition and predation are the main factors shaping interspecific coexistence in wildlife communities. Species reappearance and introductions may alter these dynamics. The Eurasian beaver Castor fiber is a widespread species in Europe, and it is part of the diet of many birds and mammalian carnivores of all sizes. Additionally, competition with other herbivorous mammals at feeding sites could occur. For this reason, we computed the overlap of activity rhythms among the recently reappeared Eurasian beaver and its potential predators (red fox Vulpes vulpes and grey wolf Canis lupus) and competitors (coypu Myocastor coypus) in Central Italy. The beaver was confirmed as a mostly crepuscular species, avoiding the bright moonlight nights and the activity of its predators, which is potentially shaped by the behaviour of their main prey. Analyses of temporal partitioning and overlaps in activity rhythms are pivotal to shed light on interspecific coexistence between similar species or prey and predators. In this work, we assessed the overlap of activity rhythms between the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber and its potential competitors and predators through camera trapping in an area in Central Italy. Interspecific overlaps of temporal activity patterns were estimated for the beavers, potential predators (the red fox Vulpes vulpes and the grey wolf Canis lupus), and a potential competitor, the coypu Myocastor coypus. The beavers showed a mostly crepuscular behaviour. Although high temporal overlap was observed between the Eurasian beavers and the red foxes and grey wolves, the activity of the beavers did not overlap with that of the predators. Accordingly, the beavers were more active on the darkest nights, i.e., avoiding bright moonlight.

AB  - The overuse of antibiotics has led to the enhanced resistance of many pathogenic bacteria, posing a threat to human health. Therefore, there is a need to develop green and safe alternatives to antibiotics. Beta-defensins play a crucial role in host defense against pathogens and have multifunctional properties, exerting key roles in innate and adaptive immunity, as well as non-immune processes. In this study, a 210 bp long cDNA sequence of yak DEFB114 gene was amplified and successfully expressed in a prokaryotic system. The DEFB114 protein exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus in vitro. When co-cultured with yak macrophages, DEFB114 protein enhanced macrophage phagocytic activity and increased nucleic acid fluorescence intensity (P < 0.05). DEFB114 protein also enhanced the activity of yak macrophages stimulated by inactivated Aspergillus fumigatus spores, increased the release of nitric oxide (NO), and promoted the expression of genes such as gamma-actin, Lgals, Man2b, and Capg (P < 0.05). In mice experiments, DEFB114 protein promoted resistance against Aspergillus fumigatus infection, by regulating the NOD1/2-ATG16L1-NF-kappa B pathway to modulate the host immune response and exert its anti-infective effects. In summary, the yak DEFB114 protein could inhibit the growth of Aspergillus fumigatus and enhance the animal's resistance to pathogenic microorganisms, thereby having significant implications in the treatment and prevention of fungal infections.

AB  - The genus Metarhizium (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) is mostly composed of entomopathogenic fungal species. Many of these species are anamorphic and difficult to distinguish morphologically. Furthermore, most isolates of this genus have a broad host range, making classification based on host-insect species uncertain. Molecular phylogenetic analysis based on DNA sequence information distinguishes these species well and revises the taxonomy of Metarhizium. However, in the revisions, the major groups within the genus, such as M. anisopliae complex, were classified regardless of their phenotypic differentiation. Therefore, the characteristics of the individual species remain unclear. To explore the species-specific characteristics of Metarhizium spp., the author performed a phylogenetic analysis and characterization of Metarhizium spp. in Japan. The results showed that strains of the M. brunneum and M. pemphigi clades exhibited cold-active growth characteristics and preferred forested environments over M. pingshaense. In the M. majus clade, a specialist of scarab beetles, isolates from different Scarabaeidae species, including the coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes spp.) and flower chafer beetle (Protaetia orientalis), formed separate subclades and showed strong virulence against their original hosts. This review describes the current state of understanding of the taxonomy and species-specific characteristics of the genus Metarhizium, and includes the author's own previous study.

AB  - Zoo conditions are unique for reindeer, since domestic reindeer are not kept in captive facilities like cattle. In the zoo, reindeer are usually surrounded by many different animals that they would never encounter naturally. Thus, they might be infected with new helminths. Numerous petting zoos raise concerns about the safety of tactile interactions for human visitors. Our study is the first large-scale one. Qualitative and quantitative fecal analyses were carried out for 233 reindeer distributed over 50 Russian zoos according to the National Standard of the Russian Federation (GOST R 54627-2011) Ruminant animals-Methods of Laboratory Helminthological Diagnostics. Where possible, DNA analyses of helminths were performed targeting internal transcribed spacer region. As a result, F. hepatica, Paramphistomum sp., Moniezia sp. (including M. expansa), gastrointestinal strongylids (including Nematodirus spp.), Dictyocaulus sp., E. rangiferi, Trichuris sp., and Capillaria sp. were found in 106 (45%) zoo reindeer. All these helminths were previously reported in reindeer and pose no direct danger for humans. The intensity of invasions was mostly low. Fecal examination might be considered as an indirect method for mange diagnostics, as Chorioptes and Demodex mites were found in reindeer fecal samples. The latter may represent a novel species of mite specific for reindeer.

AB  - Illegal hunting and trade might be reduced by devaluing the commodities of live animals. However, theory and anecdote suggest that the tactic's success depends on the proportion devalued and may also generate unintuitive and counter-productive outcomes. Unfortunately, the difficulty of researching criminals limits empirical and experimental tests of theory and practice. We overcame those constraints by designing and conducting a competitive game; simulating criminal hunting of protected wildlife where the proportion of animals devalued across a meta-population increases at a cost to investment in security. We conducted 33 games each with 10 different volunteers from the public visiting five public events (fairs, gala, and carnivals) in different communities of the Wellington metropolitan area, New Zealand. Games confirmed the relative effectiveness of security over devaluation tactics. Even moderate security protected the majority of commodities, but only when devaluation reached extraordinary levels (>= 90%) was it protective, and even then only partially. When the risk of hunting is low, reduced rewards were enough to still motivate hunting. Games also revealed that when security and devaluation tactics are mixed across a meta-population, elevated risk caused hunters to revise their valuation of devalued commodities upwards and hunt and harvest them anyway. Counter-intuitively, more valuable devalued commodities were preserved but those of lesser value harvested, then sometimes discarded but at other times their value claimed. And lastly, hunters choose to take greater risks, shifting their activities to adjacent populations where the returns could be greater even though known to be better protected. The survival of wildlife in those populations deteriorated, even as the number of hunters caught increased. In all these ways, our games demonstrated how the addition of devaluation tactics to strategies for protecting wildlife can incentivise and exacerbate, rather than mitigate, the illegal hunting and trade of wildlife, consistent with theory and anecdote.

AB  - Mercury is a widespread pollutant of increasing global concern that exhibits a broad range of deleterious effects on organisms, including birds. Because the developing brain is well-known to be particularly vulnerable to the neurotoxic insults of mercury, many studies have focused on developmental effects such as on the embryonic brain and resulting behavioral impairment in adults. It is not well understood how the timing of exposure, for example exclusively in ovo versus throughout life, influences the impact of mercury. Using dietary exposure to environmentally relevant methylmercury concentrations, we examined the role that timing and duration of exposure play on spatial learning and memory in a model songbird species, the domesticated zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis). We hypothesized that developmental exposure was both necessary and sufficient to disrupt spatial memory in adult finches. We documented profound disruption of memory for locations of hidden food at two spatial scales, cage- and room-sized enclosures, but found that both developmental and ongoing adult exposure were required to exhibit this behavioral impairment. Methylmercury-exposed birds made more mistakes before mastering the spatial task, because they revisited unrewarded locations repeatedly even after discovering the rewarded location. Contrary to our prediction, hippocampal volume was not affected in birds exposed to methylmercury over their lifetimes. The disruption of spatial cognition that we detected is severe and would likely have implications for survival and reproduction in wild birds; however, it appears that individuals that disperse or migrate from a contaminated site might recover later in life if no longer exposed to the toxicant.

AB  - We present here a new Upper Miocene vertebrate locality, Kayaca, from the Beya & gbreve;a & ccedil; Basin in southwestern T & uuml;rkiye that was discovered after surface survey and was subsequently systematically excavated. The locality yielded a diverse and rich vertebrate fauna notably including several complete cranial specimens. In this article we provide the first results on the taxonomy of the large mammal assemblage, and we discuss the biochronological implications. The Kayaca large mammal assemblage is dominated by hipparionine horses (Hipparion dietrichi morphotype, Cremohipparion sp.) and bovids (Gazella cf. ancyrensis, Sporadotragus parvidens, Tragoportax sp., Palaeoryx pallasi and the rare Gangraia), but includes also rhinocerotids (Miodiceros neumayri, Diceros sp.), suids (Hippopotamodon major), giraffids (Palaeotragus rouenii, Samotherium major), hystricids (Hystrix sp.), orycteropodids (Amphiorycteropus gaudryi), proboscideans (Deinotherium sp., Elephantimorpha indet.) and carnivorans. The latter are identified by some well-preserved specimens belonging to ictitheres (Protictitherium sp.), hyaenids (Adcrocuta eximia), felids (Pontosmilus sp. and a medium-sized felid) but also to the rare mustelid Parataxidea maraghana. The preliminary comparison with already known and well-studied faunal assemblages of T & uuml;rkiye and the wider region, particularly the neighboring localities of Samos in Greece, suggest an age of ca. 7.4, close to the transition of early/middle Turolian (MN 11/12). Located at the western corner of Asia, Kayaca comprises a key location linking the vertebrate faunas of Asia and Europe and offers valuable insights into the Late Miocene terrestrial ecosystems of the eastern peri-Mediterranean region.

AB  - Simple Summary Flystrike is a major ectoparasitic disease of sheep and it creates both an economic impact and welfare issue for the sheep industry. Several factors control the responses of sheep to flystrike, and among these, immune response is regarded as an important factor. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) plays a crucial role in the innate immune system by recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from various microbes. Of these receptors, TLR9 recognises unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs that are known to be prevalent in bacterial genomes and are also reported in Dipteran insects, including Lucilia cuprina, one of the main species associated with flystrike in sheep. In this study, we used a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique to investigate TLR9 variation in sheep with and without flystrike, and found that variation in a gene region containing the coding sequence of the putative CpG-DNA binding domain was associated with the likelihood of flystrike occurrence. This suggests that variation in ovine TLR9 may affect a sheep's response to flystrike. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of proteins that play a role in innate immune responses by recognising pathogen-associated molecular patterns derived from various microbes. Of these receptors, TLR9 recognises bacterial and viral DNA containing unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) motifs, and variation in TLR9 has been associated with resistance to various infectious diseases. Flystrike is a problem affecting the sheep industry globally and the immune response of the sheep has been suggested as one factor that influences the response to the disease. In this study, variation in ovine TLR9 from 178 sheep with flystrike and 134 sheep without flystrike was investigated using a polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) approach. These sheep were collected from both commercial and stud farms throughout New Zealand and they were of 13 different breeds, cross-breds and composites. Four alleles of TLR9 were detected, including three previously identified alleles (*01, *02 and *03) and a new allele (*04). In total six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found. Of the three common alleles in the sheep studied, the presence of *03 was found to be associated with a reduced likelihood of flystrike being present (OR = 0.499, p = 0.024). This suggests that variation in ovine TLR9 may affect a sheep's response to flystrike, and thus the gene may have value as a genetic marker for improving resistance to the disease.

AB  - Manure composting in traditional small-scale pig farms leads to the migration and diffusion of antibiotics and antibiotics resistance genes (ARGs) along the chain of transmission to the surrounding environment, increasing the risk of environmental resistance. Understanding the transmission patterns, driving factors, and health risks of ARGs on small-scale pig farms is important for effective control of ARGs transmission. This study was conducted on a small pig farm and its surrounding environment. The cross-media transmission of ARGs and their risks in the farming habitat were investigated using Metagenomic annotation and qPCR quantitative detection. The results indicate that ARGs in farms spread with manure pile-soil-channel sediment-mudflat sediment. Pig farm manure contributed 22.49 % of the mudflat sediment ARGs. Mobile genetic elements mediate the spread of ARGs across different media. Among them, tnpA and IS26 have the highest degree. Transmission of high-risk ARGs sul1 and tetM resulted in a 50 % and 116 % increase in host risk for sediment, respectively. This study provides a basis for farm manure management and control of the ARGs spread.

AB  - Simple Summary Dried orange pulp can conveniently replace cereals in ruminant diets; however, no published reports have considered a similar substitution for the goat diet throughout lactation. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effects of cereal replacement (40% and 80%) by dried orange pulp in the diet of Payoya breed goats during the entire lactation period (180 days) on milk yield and composition, blood metabolites and production economics. Also evaluated, in mid-lactation, were the nutrient utilisation and ruminal fermentation of the dried orange pulp diets. Milk production and gross composition did not change in goats fed diets that included dried orange pulp. A decrease in nitrogen availability and retention was observed, while an increase detected in the digestibility of cellulose likely boosted rumen microbial protein synthesis. No pathological effects of dried orange pulp supplementation were detected in blood metabolites. The partial substitution of cereals for dried orange pulp reduced costs and raised economic profits. In conclusion, the partial replacement of cereals by dried orange pulp is a profitable and healthy nutritional strategy in dairy goats that does not compromise their productivity and is suitable for the entire lactation period. Dried orange pulp (DOP) can be incorporated into ruminant diets, but no reports have considered this strategy during the entire lactation period in goats. Two experiments were performed using lactating Payoya goats. In experiment 1, to study the effect, over 180 days, of DOP on milk yield and composition, blood metabolites and economic values, 44 primiparous goats were allocated into three groups: control diet (concentrate plus lucerne) and DOP40 and DOP80 diets, in which DOP replaced 40% and 80%, respectively, of the cereals. Nutrient digestibility and rumen fermentation were also studied (experiment 2). The DOP diets did not affect milk yield and composition. DOP triggered lower intake and digestibility of ether extract and crude protein. Ruminal fermentation was unaffected by DOP, except for a decrease in butyrate for DOP80. The energy balance was unaltered by diet while the balance and retention of nitrogen decreased. Regarding plasma biochemistry, DOP supplementation caused changes that could indicate an improvement in hepatic function and reduced muscular damage and oxidative muscular stress. Moreover, DOP80 provided a profit increase of EUR 3.27/goat. In conclusion, the partial replacement of cereals by DOP is a profitable and healthy nutritional strategy in dairy goats and is suitable for the entire lactation period without compromising productivity.

AB  - Early life adversity has been suggested to affect neuroendocrine responses to subsequent stressors and accordingly vulnerability for behavioral disorders. This is the first work to study the effects of maternal separation (MS) stress on the co-occurrence of depression and cognitive impairments along with hippocampal inflammatory response under chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) in young adult male rats. During the first two postnatal weeks, the male pups were either exposed to MS or left undisturbed with their mothers (Std). Subsequently, starting on postnatal day 50, the animals of each group were either left undisturbed in the standard group housing (Con) or underwent CSDS for three weeks. Totally, there were four groups (n = 10/group), namely Std-Con, Ms-Con, StdCSDS, and MS-CSDS. Pup retrieval test was performed on daily basis from PND1 to PND14. During the last week of the CSDS exposure, in the light phase, the behavioral tests and the retro-orbital blood sampling were performed to assess basal plasma corticosterone levels. Afterwards, the hippocampus of the animals was removed to measure the interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) content. Exposure to CSDS increased the plasma corticosterone levels and induced social avoidance along with memory deficit. Maternal separation intensified hippocampal IL-1 beta contents as well as the plasma corticosterone levels in response to CSDS. Meanwhile, it facilitated the spatial learning and potentiated resilience to social avoidance and memory deficit. In conclusion, although maternal separation increased the basal plasma corticosterone levels, it could facilitate the learning process and induce resilience to the onset of depression and memory deficit in response to CSDS, probably through the compensatory increase in maternal care and the induction of mild hippocampal inflammatory response.

AB  - A total of 228 well-preserved fossil leaves have been discovered from the Middle Jurassic Haifanggou Formation in Baimashi Village, Lianshan District, Huludao, Liaoning. To gain insights into the plant-insect interaction during the Middle Jurassic in western Liaoning, this paper aims to identify and quantitatively analyse evidence of insect damages on fossil leaves from the Haifanggou Formation based on previous taxonomic research. Seven insect damage types (DTs) assigned to three functional feeding groups (FFGs) are identified. Margin feeding is the most prevalent FFG, followed by hole feeding and surface feeding, suggesting that Orthoptera and Hymenoptera with chewing mouthparts were dominant during the Middle Jurassic in this area, with Hemiptera and Coleoptera also playing a significant role. The primary plant groups targeted by insects are Ginkgophytes, followed by Pteridophytes, Cycadophytes and Czekanowskiales, with Cycadophytes exhibiting the highest average percentage of damaged leaf perimeter and area. This could be attributed to the physical insect resistance mechanism of conifers, as well as the chemical defense capabilities of Pteridophytes and Ginkgophytes during the Middle Jurassic. Plants and insects from the Haifanggou Formation are highly diverse, and approximately 17.54% of the observed fossil leaves show traces of insect damage, probably indicating the presence of active insects in the area and a close relationship between plants and insects during the Middle Jurassic. Considering the floristic composition and the climate-indicative plant groups, it can be inferred that the climate in the study area during the Middle Jurassic was warm and humid, potentially accompanied by intermittent droughts.

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide hormone that modulates several social behaviors and can affect the anxiety and stress response. The aim of this study was to determine if administration of intranasal OT affects the stress response to social isolation in sheep. Twenty adult Merino ewes were assigned to two groups; 1) Control group (CG, n = 10), which received an intranasal administration of isotonic saline and 2) Oxytocin-treated group (OTG, n = 10), which received an intranasal administration of OT (24 IU) 40 min before the animals were placed in the social isolation test. During the social isolation test (10 min), the behavior of the sheep was recorded, and blood samples were obtained before and after the test for the determination of cortisol, glucose and serum proteins, and heart rate and surface temperature were recorded. The OTG ewes had a higher cortisol concentration (P = 0.04) after social isolation, tended to vocalize more (P = 0.06) during isolation, and tended to have lower globulin concentrations (P = 0.10) than the CG ewes. Contrary to what we expected, the administration of intranasal OT increased the stress response to social isolation in ewes, which was evidenced by endocrine (greater increase in cortisol concentration), physiological (a tendency to present lower concentration of globulins in blood) and behavioral (a tendency to vocalize more) indicators. This study suggests that the administration of intranasal OT increased the stress response to isolation possibly by strengthening the social bond among ewes.

AB  - An increase in respiration (R-SDA) associated with food ingestion (I) was estimated from routine rates (R-routine) determined in the absence of food with sealed-chamber methods. Based on regression analyses of R-SDA on I for metazooplankton in the laboratory, the fraction of I allocated to R-SDA was calculated to be 0.10. Likely food ingestion of metazooplankton in the field (I-field) was derived from "basic balanced equations" in which parameters such as R-routine, laboratory-obtained food absorption efficiency (AE) and gross growth efficiency (K-1) were incorporated (I&M model). Based on differences in AE values, metazooplankton were separated into particle-feeders (herbivores, omnivores) and carnivores and R-SDA was computed to be 0.37 times R-routine for the former and 0.25 times R-routine for the latter. Hence, realistic respiration rates of metazooplankton feeding in the field (R-field = R-SDA + R-routine) accounted for 1.37 times R-routine for particle-feeders and 1.25 times R-routine for carnivores. The increase in ammonia excretion (E-SDA) accompanied by SDA in particle-feeders and carnivores was calculated from R-SDA coupled with carbon-to-nitrogen (C:N by mass) ratios of possible natural foods (6.5 for the former and 4.5 for the latter). Results indicated that E-SDA is 0.080 times R-SDA for particle-feeders, and 0.116 times R-SDA for carnivores.

AB  - Navua sedge (Cyperus aromaticus), a perennial monocot plant native to tropical Africa, is a major weed in pasture and cropping areas in the wet tropical regions of Australia and South Pacific countries. In grazing pasture lands, rapid growth and reproduction of unpalatable Navua sedge leads to displacement of co-occurring pasture species and depletion of livestock carrying capacity and production. Understanding the interspecific competitive ability of Navua sedge with co-occurring desirable grasses and in response to varying ecological scenarios (e.g., grazing and plant density) is critical for the management of the weed in pasture situations. In a glasshouse setting, two co-occurring pasture species-humidicola (Urochloa humidicola) and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) were grown with Navua sedge, in pots using a replacement series model. For each Navua sedge weed-pasture species pair, the experimental setup comprised of four ratios in two densities under simulated grazing and nongrazing conditions of the pasture grasses. Navua sedge growth and reproduction was highest when it grew as a monoculture or when co-occurring pastures were exposed to simulated grazing as this action, reduced the competitiveness of the pasture grasses. Overall and using biomass gained, tiller production and relative yield as indices of growth dynamics, Rhodes grass was more competitive against Navua sedge than humidicola in both grazed and nongrazed conditions especially under high plant density. These results suggest the potential to include competitive pastures in integrated management strategies for Navua sedge, but species selection and grazing practices may influence the effectiveness of this approach.

AB  - Although the marine megafauna often strands on beaches around the world, such as sea turtles and whales, stranding data are poorly managed and incorporated into management and conservation strategies. Here we use a knowledge value chain framework to call attention for the urgent need to improve our data architecture and knowledge management on marine megafauna strandings. We use Brazil, a continental megadiverse federative republic, as study model. After describing the main components and identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the current Brazilian data architecture, we propose 10 practical measures for its improvement involving researchers, companies, non-governmental organizations, legislators, policy makers, public agents, citizen scientists, and local communities. Although Brazil has notable strengths such as comprehensive environmental legislation, hundreds of scientists and dozens of prestigious research institutions, stranding data is not translated into technical-scientific knowledge; technical-scientific knowledge is not transformed into effective public regulations; deficient regulations lead to bad decisions and limited actions, which in turn result in ineffective management and conservation strategies. In light of the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030), we propose (1) expanding standardized beach monitoring projects to the entire Brazilian coast; (2) creating a governmental database with FAIR principles; (3) encouraging the development of broad citizen science initiatives; (4) funding scientists and research institutions; (5) boosting outreach activities among researchers to popularize the scientific knowledge; (6) raising awareness among legislators and policy makers on the problem of strandings; (7) updating the existing legal provisions on the environmental licensing of activities developed at sea; (8) hiring new environmental analysts and inspectors and improving the infrastructure of executing environmental agencies; (9) strengthening existing conservation networks with multiple stakeholders; and (10) making the results of the management and conservation strategies broadly accessible to society. These recommendations may also apply to other coastal countries around the world.

AB  - Genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) play important roles in vertebrate immunocompetence. MHC genes thus offer females indirect benefits to mate choice through the production of offspring of an optimal MHC genotype. Females may choose males with specific MHC haplotypes, dissimilar MHC genotypes, MHC heterozygous males or MHC-diverse males. We tested these four alternatives for both female social and paternal choice in wild golden snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana) by examining overall genetic variability (via microsatellites) and four MHC-genes (DRB1, DRB2, DQA1 and DQB1). Monte Carlo randomization tests showed that MHC dissimilarity was favoured for social choice (males to which females were socially affiliated) and intermediate MHC dissimilarity was favoured in paternal choice (fathers of offspring). No evidence of inbreeding avoidance was found for either social or paternal mates. We found that MHC heterozygotes, higher microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity and higher microsatellites diversity were favoured for social mates, and higher microsatellite diversity was favoured for paternal mates. Independent of male age, we found that the formation of male-female social pairings is significantly predicted by compatibility based on the sharing of MHC haplotypes. However, we found no evidence of independent genetic effects on the duration of male-female social pairings, male social status (achieving OMU leader male status or not), the number of females with which individual leader males paired, the likelihood of potential male-female pairings producing offspring, or whether males fathered offspring or not. Overall, our findings suggest different genetic factors are involved in social and paternal choice in R. roxellana.

AB  - Rice plants have evolved defense mechanisms against insect attacks, leading to induced defense responses that can influence the composition of arthropod communities in rice fields. Inducing defense responses not only reduces rice pest population densities but also helps minimize the use of insecticides. Both herbivore-induced plant volatiles and elicitors are crucial in controlling insect pests and attracting natural enemies. The volatile profiles of insect-infested and uninfested rice plants were studied under screen house and open field conditions. GC MS/MS analysis of volatile samples of rice plants grown under screen houses and in the field revealed that at different growth stages of the crop (tillering, panicle initiation, and grain maturation), herbivore-infested rice crops contained a higher number of compounds (9 to 34 compounds) when compared to uninfested rice plants. The chemical profiles of infested and uninfested rice plants showed similarity in the presence of Eicosane, which was found in higher quantities in infested rice plants, particularly in the tillering stage. The composition of herbivore-induced plant volatiles varied depending on the growth stage of the rice crop. At the tillering and panicle initiation stages, Eicosane, Tetradecane, and Tridecane dominated the volatile blend in herbivore-infested plants. In contrast, at the grain maturation stage, Tetradecanoic acid and N-Hexadecanoic acid were more prevalent. The number of volatiles released by rice plants also varied across growth stages, with more compounds being released during the tillering stage compared to panicle initiation and grain maturation stages.

AB  - Simple Summary Traditional and regional cheeses are becoming more and more popular among consumers. Usually, they are produced in small dairy plants which are characterized by a unique microbiota of the processing area. The unique microbiota determines both the microbial quality and safety of the final products. Another issue related to the microbiological safety of food products is the presence of antibiotic resistance (AR) in microbiota, which is a potential health issue for humans. The AR was mainly investigated in pathogenic bacteria as a direct risk for effective antimicrobial therapy. However, the AR phenomenon is also present in desired food bacteria participating in the production of dairy products. These bacteria can be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the environment, therefore monitoring AR in LABs seems to be an urgent need for ensuring the safety of food. In this work, we investigated the microbial diversity of ripened and unripened cheeses produced from cow, ewe, and goat milk in Poland, and identified LAB typical for cheeses and microbiota characteristic of the investigated types of cheese. Moreover, we assessed the phenotypic AR and the presence of ARG in lactic acid bacteria. (1) Unique sensory values of traditional and regional dairy products made them more and more popular among consumers. Lactic acid bacteria naturally occurring in these products can express antibiotic resistance and be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in the environment. The aim of the study was to characterize the microbial diversity of twenty regional cheeses produced from non-pasteurized cow, goat and ewe milk, and investigate the phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance (AR) of lactic acid bacteria isolated from these products. (2) Conventional microbiological methods were applied for the enumeration of lactic acid bacteria (lactobacilli and lactococci) and their isolation, and for the enumeration of Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Enterobacteriaceae and spores. The disc diffusion method was applied for phenotypic AR. The PCR-based methods were used for strain identification, microbiological diversity of cheeses (PCR-DGGE), and for AR gene detection. (3) Among 79 LAB isolates the most frequent species were L. plantarum (n = 18), Leuc. lactis (n = 17), Lc. lactis (n = 11), Leuc. mesenteroides (n = 9) and L. pentosus (n = 8). Additionally, by using the PCR-DGGE method, DNA of L. casei was found in nine products. Lactobacilli (5.63-8.46 log cfu/g) and lactococci (6.15-8.41 log cfu/g) predominated over Enterococcus (max. 4.89 log cfu/g), Staphylococcus (max. 4.18 log cfu/g), and Enterobacteriaceae (mostly up to 4.88 log cfu/g). Analysis of phenotypic resistance to tetracycline (30 mu g), erythromycin (15 mu g), and chloramphenicol (30 mu g) showed that 29% of LAB isolates were resistant to one antibiotic, 8%-to two, and 12%-to all tested antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes (AGR) for tetracycline (tet(M), tet(L), tet(W)), erythromycin (erm(B)) and chloramphenicol (cat-TC) were detected in 30 (38%), 29 (36.7%) and 33 (43.4%) LAB isolates, respectively. Among 31 LAB isolates phenotypically susceptible to all tested antibiotics, only 5 (16%) had no ARGs. (4) The results obtained in our work shed light on the potential threat posed by the widespread presence of ARGs in LAB present in regional cheeses.

AB  - Objectives: The mortuary record at Middle Period site Kalawwasa Rummeytak (CA-SCL-134) (2600-1225 cal BP) in California's southern Santa Clara Valley shows pronounced wealth inequality; Olivella shell bead wealth, as well as other grave goods, are concentrated in the burials of several older adult females. The concentration of wealth among women, along with regional strontium isotopic evidence of male-biased residential shifts in early adulthood, suggests a matrilineal kinship system that practiced matrilocal post-marital residence patterns. We suggest local resource enhancement effects incentivized keeping women in their natal communities and investing more in female offspring.
   Materials and Methods: With the consent of, and in collaboration with, the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe of the San Francisco Bay Area, this paper employs isotopic analysis (delta N-15 and delta C-13, Sr-86/Sr-87) to examine duration of exclusive breastfeeding, weaning age (complete cessation of breastmilk consumption), early childhood diet, and lifetime residential mobility of individuals interred at Kalawwasa Rummeytak to test the assumption that the site inhabitants favored matrilocality and that female offspring received greater levels of investment in groups with female wealth/status attainment. First molars, third molars, and bone was sampled from 22 individuals.
   Results: The average weaning age for females at Kalawwasa Rummeytak is 36.3 months +/- 9.7 (1 SD), or just over 3 years. The average weaning age for males is 31.2 +/- 7.9 months (1 SD), or about 2.6 years. Infants at the site were provisioned with supplemental foods dominated by C-3 plants and terrestrial herbivores, as well as anadromous fish. After weaning, individuals consumed a diet dominated by acorns, C-3 plants, and terrestrial herbivores, with periodic inclusion of anadromous fish. 30% of the sampled population of females exhibit local first molar Sr-87/Sr-86 values, suggesting that Kalawwasa Rummeytak is their natal community. None of the males interred at the site are locals.
   Discussion: Despite the small sample size often unavoidable in archaeological contexts, we find possible female-biased parental investment strategies. Cessation of breastfeeding (weaning) was, on average, 5 months earlier for males compared to females. There are no differences between females and males in the consumption of supplemental or post-weaning foods. Strontium data suggest a flexible postmarital residence system that favored matrilocality. This may have incentivized greater investment in female offspring.

AB  - Simple Summary Herbivorous mammals are considered to eat plants with high nutrition but to avoid those with harmful chemical components. Leaf chemical components differ between plant species, conspecific individuals, leaves of the same individual, and the parts of a single leaf; therefore, food selection by herbivores (particularly browsers) occurs in these hierarchical structures. However, the effects of plant chemicals on food selectivity are not well known in the tree-leaf-eating mammals such as arboreal primates, rodents, and marsupials, as compared with other mammals eating herbaceous plants, seeds, nuts, and fruits. Moreover, the effects of the microscale chemical distribution within the single leaf on their partial feeding have been little examined. The Japanese giant flying squirrel (Petaurista leucogenys) is an arboreal herbivorous mammal that feeds on mostly tree leaves. In our study site, the three tree species, evergreen Phonitia serratifolia, deciduous Quercus acutissima, and evergreen Q. sessilifolia, were used by this flying squirrel as main food. In comparisons of feeding preference and chemical (phenolic, glucose, and water) contents of leaves among these tree species, leaf glucose concentration was an important factor determining which species of tree leaves they eat. In comparisons between favorite parts of consumption and chemical contents within the single leaf, the central consumption was frequent when the water contents were higher at the leaf center than the margin. Phenolic contents in the central and marginal parts of the single leaf differed among the three tree species, but clear tendency to avoid eating the part with high phenolic contents was not detected.Abstract To examine the effect of leaf chemical composition on selective herbivory by the Japanese giant flying squirrels (Petaurista leucogenys), we measured and compared the total phenolic, glucose, and water contents of leaves among their main food tree species, deciduous Quercus acutissima, and evergreen Q. sessilifolia and Phonitia serratifolia. Leaves of these three tree species were available in the warm season (April to October), but the flying squirrels mostly preferred the leaves of Q. acutissima, having higher glucose and water contents than those of the other two tree species. In the cold season (November to the next March), the two evergreen tree species were available, and the flying squirrels used both leaves without any apparent influence of the chemical compositions. On the other hand, the favorite parts of a single leaf differed among the three tree species. Flying squirrels dropped the individual leaves after partial consumption. Their feeding marks on the dropped leaves were distinguished into four types: apical, basal, central, and marginal parts of consumption. The basal parts of consumption were most frequent in Q. acutissima leaves in which more water was contained at the basal part, and the central part consumption followed, which may be related to a lower phenolic content and more glucose and water at the leaf center than its margin. In contrast, the apically consumed leaves dominated in Q. sessilifolia, with relatively homogeneous leaf chemical distribution except for more water at the center. In P. serratifolia, leaves consumed at the center were frequent, but those with marginal consumption were also observed, which may be related to its specific chemical distribution with less phenolics and more glucose at the leaf margin.
   Thus, the chemical distributions within the single leaf differ among tree species, and the flying squirrel's selectivity of the tree species and the part of each leaf depends partly on the relative compositions of preferable glucose and water and unpreferable phenolics.

AB  - Background and aims Biochar is a carbon source employed to improve soil properties, promoting plant health and nutrition in agroecosystems. Root associated microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are also used as bioinoculants in combination with biochar to provide eco-friendly alternatives for crop production under unfavorable growth conditions. However, information on the effects of biochar on multitrophic interactions of plants with herbivorous insects is limited. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of biochar and arbuscular mycorrhizae on plants and herbivorous insects. Methods We established a multifactorial experiment with maize plants, AMF (two strains, Rizhophagus irregularis and a native consortium) and the Fall Armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda with and without soil application of biochar. Variables of biomass, plant nutrition, mycorrhizal colonization and performance of herbivorous insects were measured. Results We found that biochar reduced insect herbivory and promoted mycorrhizal association in maize. However, plant growth was reduced. Additionally, AMF increased the weight of fall armyworm larvae. Conclusion Our results show that biochar influences maize plant development, AMF, and fall armyworm performance, but did not affect interactions between these below- and above ground components.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the variations of certain biochemical parameters in postpartum goats in two seasons (spring and winter). A total of fifty goats of local cross breeds in their twentieth days after parturition were used in the experiment from 2019 to 2020 Animals were reared in Tiaret region in the north-west of Algeria (35 degrees 22' N, 1 degrees 19' E) under semi-arid environment. Two blood samples were taken in heparin vacuum tubes, 25 samples in each season winter and spring, the blood was centrifuged at 3000 round for 10 minutes, The assay of the biochemical substrates was carried out with a "Beckman coutter" biochemical analyzer. Our results show that all the mean values recorded during this study were within the range of standards cited in the literature and the season had a significant influence (p <0.05) on creatinine and calcium with high values in winter and decreases in spring, while the values of triglycerides, total protein and globulin were higher in winter and lower in spring without any significant difference, unlike the average values of urea, albumin, and phosphorus that increase in spring and decrease in winter. The results of this study could serve as reference values for local Algerian goats in postpartum and goats from other regions or countries with similar climatic and physiological conditions.

AB  - Sexual signals in animals encompass a variety of forms including visual, acoustic, and chemical signals that are fundamental for intra- and interspecific communication, including sexual selection processes. Among these, odor signals play a critical role. Chemical compounds involved in sexual signaling vary in nature, with lipids and proteins being particularly important. In the male Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus), the dark ventral patch has been identified as a key sexual signal during mating competition, associated with specific chemical compounds deposited during urination. Hair plays a significant role in this signaling due to its ability to retain compounds on the scales of the hair cuticle. In this study, we used a shotgun proteomic approach to investigate whether the ventral patch hair retains proteins on its surface that could reveal metabolic and cell-signaling adaptations potentially related to reproductive activity. Characterization of the origin and functionality of the proteins found in the hair of the dark ventral patch of male red deer, and their relationship to distinct metabolic pathways, provides an initial understanding of the potential role of these compounds in chemical communication in red deer intrasexual competition for mates.

AB  - Bluetongue (BT) is a well-known vector-borne disease that infects ruminants such as sheep, cattle, and deer with high mortality rates. Recent outbreaks in Europe highlight the importance of understanding vector-host dynamics and potential courses of action to mitigate the damage that can be done by BT. We present an agent-based model, entitled 'MidgePy', that focuses on the movement of individual Culicoides spp. biting midges and their interactions with ruminants to understand their role as vectors in BT outbreaks, especially in regions that do not regularly experience outbreaks. The results of our sensitivity analysis suggest that midge survival rate has a significant impact on the probability of a BTV outbreak as well as its severity. Using midge flight activity as a proxy for temperature, we found that an increase in environmental temperature corresponded with an increased probability of outbreak after identifying parameter regions where outbreaks are more likely to occur. This suggests that future methods to control BT spread could combine large-scale vaccination programs with biting midge population control measures such as the use of pesticides. Spatial heterogeneity in the environment is also explored to give insight on optimal farm layouts to reduce the potential for BT outbreaks.

AB  - In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms were used to investigate kinship and philopatry for the Critically Endangered green sawfish, Pristis zijsron, in Western Australia. Sampling was conducted in an important nursery area: the Ashburton River estuary and adjacent tidal creeks. Kinship was inferred from the genotypes of 104 sawfish sampled between 2011 and 2014 (n = 31), and 2020 and 2022 (n = 73).<br /> The total number of dams contributing across all sites and time periods was estimated to be between 50 and 56.<br /> Fifty-two full sibling dyads, 90 half sibling dyads and 72 third-degree dyads were detected, involving 58, 67, and 46 P. zijsron, respectively. Of these, 34 half sibling dyads were related maternally and 56 related paternally, including multiple maternal and paternal half siblings pupped in different years, suggesting both female and male philopatry. Catch data indicated that two groups of maternal half siblings were littermates, demonstrating multiple paternity. A high degree of relatedness was found across the study area, with 88% of P. zijsron related to at least one other individual up to the third-degree.<br /> Evidence for female philopatry in P. zijsron highlights the importance of protecting nursery areas for this species. The occurrence of philopatric behaviour in male and female P. zijsron suggests that dispersal might be limited in both sexes of this species, highlighting the need to investigate the amount of genetic diversity and incidence of inbreeding within remaining populations.

AB  - A field experiment was carried out in mudflats adjacent to the Yellow Sea, China, amended with sewage sludge and vermicompost by one-time input at different rates to reveal the fates of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) and their potential hosts in the soils. Quantitative PCR results showed that soils added with either sludge or vermicompost had more abundant TRGs compared with the non-fertilized soil. This situation was more obvious in sludge fertilized soils especially at high application rates. Vermicompost exhibited a promising outlook for improvement of the mudflats. The abundances of intI1 in the non-fertilized soils were significantly higher than those in fertilizers and fertilized soils. The potential hosts for intI1 were not shared with other TRGs-contained hosts, indicating that intI1 had little effects on the dissemination of TRGs in the mudflats. Moreover, the exclusive hosts for TRGs in fertilizers were not higher than those in the non-fertilized soils, illustrating little effects of fertilization on the introduction of exogenous TRGs into soil. The shared hosts between soil and fertilizers were highest among four possible sources, contributing vastly to the bloom of TRGs following fertilization. It was also shown that different organic fertilizers caused distinct categories of shared potential hosts for TRGs. RDA analysis further indicated that the abundances of the shared potential hosts were affected by soil nutrients. These results suggested that the development of TRGs in soil following fertilization depended on the shared potential hosts with similar ecological niches between soil and fertilizers.

AB  - Background The tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze) is one of the most economically important woody crops. Plastic greenhouse covering cultivation has been widely used in tea areas of northern China. Chlorophyll is not only the crucial pigment for green tea, but also plays an important role in the growth and development of tea plants. Currently, little is known about the effect of plastic greenhouse covering cultivation on chlorophyll in tea leaves. Results To investigate the effect of plastic greenhouse covering cultivation on chlorophyll in tea leaves, color difference values, chlorophyll contents, gene expression, enzyme activities and photosynthetic parameters were analyzed in our study. Sensory evaluation showed the color of appearance, liquor and infused leaves of greenhouse tea was greener than field tea. Color difference analysis for tea liquor revealed that the value of triangle L, triangle b and b/a of greenhouse tea was significantly higher than field tea. Significant increase in chlorophyll content, intracellular CO2, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and net photosynthetic rate was observed in greenhouse tea leaves. The gene expression and activities of chlorophyll-metabolism-related enzymes in tea leaves were also activated by greenhouse covering. Conclusion The higher contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll in greenhouse tea samples were primarily due to higher gene expression and activities of chlorophyll-metabolism-related enzymes especially, chlorophyll a synthetase (chlG), pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO) and chlorophyllide a oxygenase (CAO) in tea leaves covered by greenhouse. In general, our results revealed the molecular basis of chlorophyll metabolism in tea leaves caused by plastic greenhouse covering cultivation, which had great significance in production of greenhouse tea.

AB  - Estuarine mangroves are crucial for trapping microplastics and contributing to coastal protection; however, their effectiveness during extreme weather events remains unclear. This study investigated the effects of typhoons on microplastic dynamics within the watershed-estuary-offshore system and the changes in the role of estuarine mangroves. Surface water from the Shenzhen River and sediments from estuarine mangroves were sampled after typhoons (Saola and Haikui) and during periods of stable hydrodynamic conditions. Our findings indicated that after typhoons, the microplastic content in estuarine water was the lowest at 363 n/m3 compared to upstream and downstream locations, while it was the highest at 812 n/m3 during the dry season. Additionally, microplastic abundance in sediments was higher during low-flow conditions (11,153 n/kg) than after typhoons (1134 n/kg), with only about 10 % retained. Considering river flow, the microplastic flux in the estuary during the typhoon season reached its highest value of 21,816 n/s, indicating that riverine microplastics could be washed downstream and diluted due to increased flow. Polypropylene was the dominant type of microplastic (29.9 %), while synthetic rubber also accounted for a significant proportion, especially after typhoons, likely due to traffic from vehicles and boats around the watershed. Correlation analyses revealed that strong hydrodynamic forces led to a more uniform distribution of microplastics along the river, re-releasing those deposited in estuarine mangroves during the dry season and contributing to marine microplastic pollution. This study highlights how extreme weather shifts urban estuarine mangroves from microplastic sinks to sources, providing new insights into pollution dynamics under climate change.

AB  - Simple Summary The CSN1S1 gene encodes for one of the primary milk proteins in goats. Its polymorphism strongly affects & alpha;s(1)-casein levels and plays a crucial role in determining both milk quality and quantity. The study aimed to evaluate whether a different energy intake level (70%, 100% and 150% of the total requirements indicated by INRA) could unveil any interactions with the genotype at the & alpha;s(1)-casein gene with respect to milk yield and casein profile. The results demonstrated that the higher energy input, along with the presence of the strong allele at the CSN1S1 locus, improved milk production and casein concentrations, highlighting the existence of an interaction between & alpha;(s1)-casein polymorphisms and diet on the dairy performance of goats. A total of twenty-seven Rossa Mediterranea lactating goats, consisting of nine homozygous for strong alleles (AA), twelve heterozygous (AF) and six homozygous for weak alleles (FF) at the CSN1S1 locus, were used to evaluate the effect of genotype, diet and genotype x diet interaction on goat milk traits and casein profile. The goats were used in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments, with three genotypes (AA, AF and FF) and three different energy intake levels: high (H), medium (M) and low (L). The diets supplied a complete pelleted feed containing 65% of alfalfa hay, respectively, at 150%, 100% and 70% of the total energy requirements. Milk yield was significantly affected by the genotype and diet: Lower levels were found in FF goats than in AA and AF genotypes (673.7 vs. 934.5 and 879.8 d/g, respectively; p = 0.002) as well as in goats fed with the L diet (651.5 vs. 1041 and 852.9 g/d for H and M diet, respectively, p < 0.001). The genotype influenced the casein profile. Specifically, AA goat milk exhibited higher concentrations of total casein and & alpha;(s1)-casein compared to AF and FF genotypes (for total casein and & alpha;s1-casein, respectively: 24.9 vs. 20.4 and 19.8 g/kg, p = 0.001; 7.2 vs. 3.7 and 0.7 g/kg, p < 0.001), while the FF genotype showed higher values for & alpha;(s2)-casein concentrations compared to homozygous AA and heterozygous AF goats (3.1 vs. 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg, respectively, p < 0.001). A significant genotype x diet interaction occurred for & alpha;s2-casein levels (g/kg) (p = 0.034) and & alpha;s(1)-casein yields (p = 0.027): The & alpha;s(2)-casein level was not affected by the diet in AA goats, whereas it increased with energy intake in AF and FF genotypes. Conversely, the & alpha;s(1)-casein yield gradually increased with energy intake in AA and AF groups, whereas the diet in FF goats did not modify it. The results demonstrated that high energy input, as well as the strong allele at the CSN1S1 locus, enhanced milk production and casein concentrations. Furthermore, they confirmed the existence of an interaction between & alpha;(s1)-casein polymorphism and diets, influencing the milk casein composition and yield.

AB  - Bone Morphogenetic Proteins play a significant role in ovarian physiology and contribute to the reproductive fitness of mammals. The BMPR-1B/FecB mutation, a loss of function mutation increases litter size by 1-2 with each number of mutated alleles in sheep. Considering demand-supply gap of the meat industry, and low replacement rate of indigenous caprine species, the conservative BMPR-1B locus can be explored, and FecB mutated goats can be produced. The experiment one produced CRISPR/Cas mediated KO transferable caprine embryos, and experiment two generated caprine embryos with desired FecB mutation using Easi-CRISPR strategy. In the KO experiment, Cas9 and BMPR-1B guide RNA (100:100ng/ul) were electroporated into single stage caprine zygotes at 750V, 10 ms and 1pulse using Neon transfection system. In the second experiment, phosphorothioate (PS) modified single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN) was used as an HDR template along with CRISPR components (100:100ng/ul, ssODN 100ng/ul). The precise time and method of electroporation, RNP format of CRISPR components and PS modified asymmetric ssODN were the factors that affected the production of mosaicism free BMPR-1B edited caprine embryos. The editing efficiency of KO and KI experiments was 68.52 and 63.16% respectively, and successful production of goats with higher mean ovulation rate can be realized with addition of embryo transfer technology to these experiments.

AB  - Extensive epigenetic reprogramming occurs during preimplantation embryonic development. However, the impact of DNA methylation in plateau yak preimplantation embryos and how epigenetic reprogramming contributes to transcriptional regulatory networks are unclear. In this study, we quantified gene expression and DNA methylation in oocytes and a series of yak embryos at different developmental stages and at single- cell resolution using single-cell bisulfite-sequencing and RNAseq. We characterized embryonic genome activation and maternal transcript degradation and mapped epigenetic reprogramming events critical for embryonic development. Through cross-species transcriptome analysis, we identified 31 conserved maternal hub genes and 39 conserved zygotic hub genes, including SIN3A, PRC1, HDAC1/2, and HSPD1. Notably, by combining single-cell DNA methylation and transcriptome analysis, we identified 43 candidate methylation driver genes, such as AURKA, NUSAP1, CENPF, and PLK1, that may be associated with embryonic development. Finally, using functional approaches, we further determined that the epigenetic modifications associated with the histone deacetylases HDAC1/2 are essential for embryonic development and that the deubiquitinating enzyme USP7 may affect embryonic development by regulating DNA methylation. Our data represent an extensive resource on the transcriptional dynamics of yak embryonic development and DNA methylation remodeling, and provide new insights into strategies for the conservation of germplasm resources, as well as a better understanding of mammalian early embryonic development that can be applied to investigate the causes of early developmental disorders.

AB  - The excessive use of antimicrobials in animal rearing and the associated environmental hazards have become a pressing issue. Animal agriculture is often viewed as a significant contributor to environmental degradation due to the residues of antimicrobials. It is a common practice to use livestock waste as a soil enhancer in farming. Despite some research into antimicrobials, there is room for more comprehensive data regarding these pollutants in animal farming environments. A handful of earlier studies have identified antimicrobials in animal waste. This research undertook the task of examining and evaluating soils amended with animal waste (from chickens, cows, and pigs) for the presence of seven specific antimicrobials. The antimicrobials under scrutiny included trimethoprim (TRI), ormethoprim (ORM), ofloxacin (OFL), norfloxacin (NOR), tetracycline (TET), chlortetracycline (CTE), and tylosin (TLS). Soil samples were collected from areas surrounding breeding farms located upstream of the Sai Gon River. These samples were then subjected to laboratory analysis, which involved solid-phase extraction using ultrasonic waves and the application of high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) to identify the antimicrobials. TRI, which had the highest average concentration (2.603-91.304 mu g/kg), and OFL, with the second highest average concentration (1.815-15.832 mu g/kg), were detected in all soil samples amended with manure. CTE, with the third highest average concentration, was found in soils amended with cow and pig waste (1.625-15.486 mu g/kg). ORM and TE, with lower average concentrations (0.595-1.318 mu and 11.537-13.569 mu g/kg, respectively), were only detected in soils amended with chicken waste, while NOR was only found in soils amended with cow waste. These findings indicate that the use of antimicrobials in animal farming can negatively impact the soil ecosystem. Consequently, these results can contribute to the creation of guidelines for monitoring antimicrobial residues in agricultural ecosystems.

AB  - The cholinergic system is a critical regulator of Pavlovian fear learning and extinction. As such, we have begun investigating the cholinergic system's involvement in individual differences in cued fear extinction using a transgenic ChAT::Cre rat model. The current study extends behavioral phenotyping of a transgenic ChAT::Cre rat line by examining both freezing behavior and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) during a Pavlovian cued fear learning and extinction paradigm. Freezing, 22 kHz USVs, and 50 kHz USVs were compared between male and female transgenic ChAT::Cre+ rats and their wildtype (Cre-) littermates during fear learning, contextual and cue-conditioned fear recall, cued fear extinction, and generalization to a novel tone. During contextual and cued fear recall ChAT::Cre+ rats froze slightly more than their Cre- littermates, and displayed significant sex differences in contextual and cue-conditioned freezing, 22 kHz USVs, and 50 kHz USVs. Females showed more freezing than males in fear recall trials, but fewer 22 kHz distress calls during fear learning and recall. Females also produced more 50 kHz USVs during exposure to the testing chambers prior to tone (or shock) presentation compared with males, but this effect was blunted in ChAT::Cre+ females. Corroborating previous studies, ChAT::Cre+ transgenic rats overexpressed vesicular acetylcholine transporter immunolabeling in basal forebrain, striatum, basolateral amygdala, and hippocampus, but had similar levels of acetylcholinesterase and numbers of ChAT+ neurons as Cre- rats. This study suggests that variance in behavior between ChAT::Cre+ and wildtype rats is sex dependent and advances theories that distinct neural circuits and processes regulate sexually divergent fear responses.

AB  - Globally, huge amounts of crop residues are generated that are either fed to animals or are used for other purposes. Recycling crop residues opens new options for converting wastes into valuable products that can be used in farms for meeting crop nutrient requirements, maintaining soil health, crop productivity, and improving soil quality. Composting offers a proven avenue for best utilization of crop residues. Additives are materials that consist of nutrients, readily available forms of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or other elements, enzymes, and microbial formulations that enhance microbial activity when in contact with the waste material. These materials, apart from modifying physical, chemical, and microbial properties, also help in improving the final quality of the compost. In this review, we summarize the importance of the additives during composting process. The first part of the review describes the composting process in general. Next part explains how the use of organic, inorganic, and biological additives results in various modifications in composting process by changing aeration, porosity, enhancing thermophilic phase, maturity, and nutritive value of compost. The last part explains how decomposed and nutritionally rich composts result in improvement of plant growth, development and modification in soil physical, chemical, and biological properties. Although the use of additives have mixed outputs, their use in composting provides new insights into modification of the composting environment.

AB  - To examine whether females and males of Chinese seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. sinensis Rousi) differ in their responses to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and temperature, we examined gender-specific physiological and growth responses of H. rhamnoides, exposed to elevated temperature (ET), elevated CO2 concentration (EC), and their interaction (ECT) in environmentally controlled growth chambers. We found that ET significantly decreased the high growth rate (HGR) in both sexes. There were gender differences in biomass accumulation, photosynthetic capacity, nutrient absorption, and nonstructural carbohydrate (NSCs) contents under ET condition. The growth of females was more inhibited by ET than did males. EC significantly increased HGR, net photosynthetic rate (P-n), and biomass accumulation in both sexes, especially for males. Moreover, physiological and biochemical parameters, such as root nodule biomass and N content, showed greater gender differences under ECT than under EC and ET conditions. For both females and males, ECT increased HGR, biomass accumulation, P-n, and water use efficiency (WUE). We conclude that H. rhamnoides males and females exhibited sexually differential responses to climate change.

AB  - Arbutin is a naturally present antioxidant derived from plants. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of arbutin on boar sperm during storage at 17 degrees C and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that the addition of arbutin to extenders markedly enhanced the sperm (progressive) motility and plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity on Days 9 and 13 of preservation (p < 0.05), with the most pronounced effect of arbutin at the concentration of 100 mu mol/L. The addition of 100 mu mol/L arbutin also reduced the level of ROS and elevated the levels of ATP and MMP in boar sperm on Days 9 and 13 of preservation (p < 0.05). The subsequent sperm oxidative damage experiment showed that the addition of 100 mu mol/L arbutin significantly alleviated the decrease in sperm (progressive) motility and in plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity caused by H2O2 (p < 0.05), whereas increased the T-AOC content and the activities of CAT and GPx antioxidant enzymes after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees C (p < 0.05). Further, the metabolomic analysis revealed that the addition of arbutin principally influenced lipid metabolism, and the Western blot analysis demonstrated that arbutin increased the sperm quality and the antioxidant capacity via the NRF2/GPX4 signalling. Together, arbutin preserves boar sperm during storage at 17 degrees C by enhancing the antioxidant capacity via the NRF2/GPX4 signalling, laying the theoretical foundation for optimisation of the boar semen preservation diluent therefore facilitating the dissemination of superior porcine germplasm resources and improving the economic value.

AB  - To support the development of advanced steel alloys tailored to withstand extreme conditions, it is imperative to account for the mechanical performance of components, while considering the influence of local microstructure on the macroscopic response. To this end, this study focuses on the development of microstructure-sensitive constitutive models for the mechanical response of Grade 91 steel exposed to extreme thermo-mechanical environments. Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogates are used to emulate high-fidelity polycrystal simulations of the viscoplastic response of Grade 91 steel as a function of the microstructure fingerprint (e.g., dislocations and precipitates). To cover a wide temperature-stress domain, two separate PCE surrogates-one that captures softening and the other that captures hardening behavior-are combined using another (sparse) Gaussian process regression model. The resulting constitutive creep surrogate model is integrated within the MOOSE finite element framework to simulate the intricate effects of microstructure, in particular MX-phase precipitates, on a component with a graded microstructure. Surrogate sensitivity analysis is applied to quantify the relevant impact of spatially varying microstructure on the creep response in a test-case involving a Grade 91 alloy with a prototypical weld.

AB  - Technological advances in the field of animal tracking have greatly expanded the potential to remotely monitor animals, opening the door to exploring how animals shift their behaviour over time or respond to external stimuli. A wide variety of animal-borne sensors can provide information on an animal's location, movement characteristics, external environmental conditions and internal physiological status. Here, we demonstrate how piecewise regression can be used to identify the presence and timing of potential shifts in a variety of biological responses using multiple biotelemetry data streams. Different biological latent states can be inferred by partitioning a time-series into multiple segments based on changes in modelled responses (e.g. their mean, variance, trend, degree of autocorrelation) and specifying a unique model structure for each interval. We provide six example applications highlighting a variety of taxonomic species, data streams, timescales and biological phenomena. These examples include a short-term behavioural response (flee and return) by a trumpeter swan Cygnus buccinator following a GPS collar deployment; remote identification of parturition based on movements by a pregnant moose Alces alces; a physiological response (spike in heart-rate) in a black bear Ursus americanus to a stressful stimulus (presence of a drone); a mortality event of a trumpeter swan signalled by changes in collar temperature and overall dynamic body acceleration; an unsupervised method for identifying the onset, return, duration and staging use of sandhill crane Antigone canadensis migration; and estimation of the transition between incubation and brood-rearing (i.e. hatching) for a breeding trumpeter swan. We implement analyses using the mcp package in R, which provides functionality for specifying and fitting a wide variety of user-defined model structures in a Bayesian framework and methods for assessing and comparing models using information criteria and cross-validation measures. These simple modelling approaches are accessible to a wide audience and offer a straightforward means of assessing a variety of biologically relevant changes in animal behaviour.

AB  - It is now broadly admitted that female reproductive senescence - a decline in reproductive performance with increasing age - occurs in most species, at least among birds and mammals. Although information is more limited, male reproductive senescence has been regularly inferred from the decline in the size or performance of phenotypic traits that underly male reproductive success, particularly secondary sexual traits. However, the degree to which environmental conditions influence the pattern of senescence in sexual traits remains largely unknown. From the analysis of two long-term studies of populations of European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) subjected to markedly different environmental contexts in the wild, we tested the hypothesis that harsh natal and/or current conditions should lead to earlier and/or stronger rates of senescence in the length of fully-grown antlers than good natal and/or current conditions. We found evidence of similar patterns of antler length senescence in both populations, with an onset of senescence around 7 years of age and a decrease of length by about 1-1.5 cm per additional year of life from 7 years of age onwards. We found that good early-life conditions delay senescence in antler length in roe deer. Our results also revealed that senescent males seem to be unable to allocate substantially to antler growth, confirming that antler size is, therefore, an honest signal of male individual quality. By modulating age-specific allocation to secondary sexual traits, natal and current conditions could influence female mate choice and male-male competition over mates, and as a result age-specific reproductive success, and should be accounted for when studying the dynamics of sexual selection.

AB  - A-kinase-anchoring protein 13 (AKAP13) is a member of the AKAP protein family that has been found to be associated with bone formation. Thus, we investigated the AKAP13 gene as a potential candidate gene for molecular-marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding. Our aim was to explore genetic variations (InDel and CNV) within the AKAP13 gene of Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats and analyze their relationship with growth traits. Ultimately, we identified three InDel loci (16-bp deletion, 15-bp insertion, and 25-bp deletion) and three CNVs, and the 16-bp and 15-bp loci were significantly associated with goat body length (p < 0.05). Both the 16-bp deletion variant and the 15-bp insertion variant facilitated an increase in body length in goats. In addition to this, there was a certain superposition effect between 16-bp and 15-bp loci, although there was no linkage. Additionally, the CNV1 locus was significantly correlated with body height and body length of goats (p < 0.05), and CNV2 was significantly correlated with chest depth, chest circumference, and cannon circumference of goats (p < 0.05). Individuals with gain type showed excellent growth performance. In conclusion, the InDel and CNV loci that we have identified could possibly serve as effective molecular markers in goat breeding, which is very essential for improving efficiency and success of breeding. Moreover, our findings provide a new avenue for further research into the function of the AKAP13 gene.

AB  - The Samoan swallowtail butterfly (Papilio godeffroyi) has become restricted to Tutuila Island, American Samoa. Factors driving its extirpation on other islands may be partly due to the availability and suitability of habitat, given the singular association we observed of P. godeffroyi with its host plant, Micromelum minutum. We expected that as a host plant specialist, P. godeffroyi might respond to variation in the physical traits and habitat context of M. minutum, which could help identify conservation opportunities throughout its present and former range. Because the ecology of P. godeffroyi is largely unknown, we conducted systematic surveys during 15 months in 2013 and 2014 on Tutuila to investigate its reproductive response to the physical and phenological variability of individual host trees and to the structural and geographical variability of the stands in which they occurred. We searched foliage for eggs, larvae, and pupae and monitored seasonal trends in herbivory and production of leaves, flowers, and fruits on 117 host trees in 8 rainforest stands, mostly within the National Park of American Samoa (NPSA), starting in March 2013 and ending in August 2014. We observed high variability in butterfly reproductive output between individual trees and stands, due largely to a strong negative relationship between leaf biomass (at both tree and stand levels) and oviposition density (number of eggs per foliar biomass) and frequency (number of eggs per survey). Distribution patterns of larvae and pupae were less distinct but generally followed trends in oviposition. Our findings indicate that the butterfly is reproducing widely across Tutuila and is likely to respond positively to management to increase the availability of small host trees in low-density stands. Thus, the species is a good candidate for conservation management focusing on habitat.

AB  - Purpose Tape worm infection is common among sheep at SRRC, Mannavanur, Palani hills, Tamil Nadu, India. The aim of the present study is to find out the cestode species infecting the sheep being maintained at SRRC, Mannavanur, by means of molecular method. Methods During the second week of June 2021, the hogget flock of sheep (comprising both Bharat Merino and Avikalin sheep breeds) was drenched on empty stomach with commercial preparation of anthelmintic drug containing Niclosamide plus Albendazole, as per the standard dose specified by the manufacturer (Niclozole (TM): each 5 ml contains 500 mg of Niclosamide and 150 mg of Albendazole: dose for sheep-10 ml/15 kg body weight). The tapeworms expelled in dung by the drug-treated sheep were collected, washed in PBS (pH 7.2), and fixed in between two glass slides using 10% formalin. Furthermore, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (Cox-I) gene-based PCR was carried out. Only partial sequence (1593 bp) of Cox-I gene of Moniezia expansa from Sheep at SRRC, Mannavanur, Tamil Nadu, India was obtained by PCR. The PCR amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T vector and the recombinant plasmid was sequenced. The obtained nucleotide sequences of Cox-I gene of the M. expansa from Indian sheep were analysed with that of 27 more cestode species from different mammalian species (available in GenBank) using bioinformatics tools. Results The species of the tapeworm was identified as Moniezia species by the Department of Veterinary Parasitology, VC& RI, Orathanadu, TANUVAS by the standard Acidic alum carmine staining method. Due to the ambiguity in the conventional method, Cox-I gene-based PCR and subsequent gene sequencing protocols were used for the identification of the species of cestode infecting sheep at SRRC, Mannavanur, and it was confirmed as M. expansa upon BLAST analysis. Moniezia expansa from SRRC, Mannavanur is having 100% sequence identity at nucleotide level with that of M. expansa from Sengal/Ethiopia. M. benedeni shared 87-88% nucleotide identity with Indian M. expansa. With taenids, the share of percent nucleotide identity of Indian M. expansa ranged from 79 to 81%. M. expansa from Indian sheep was clustering with other anaplocephalids from various mammalian species in the analysis of phylogenetic tree based on Cox-I nucleotide sequences. Conclusion From the present study, it is concluded that M. expansa is the anoplocephalid cestode infecting the sheep at Mannavanur, Tamil Nadu, India. To our knowledge, this is the first report on partial nucleotide sequences of Cox-I gene of M. expansa from Sheep of Indian peninsula. An investigation on the involvement of oribatid mites as the vector in the transmission of M. expansa among sheep at SRRC, Mannavanur needs to be carried out.

AB  - The potential regulatory role of N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A), the most prominent mRNA modification in eukaryotes, has recently been identified in mammals, plants, and yeast. However, whether and how m(6)A methylation is involved in sexual maturation in mammals remains largely unexplored. In this study, testicular tissue was obtained from yaks before and after sexual maturation, and m(6)A maps were generated via preliminary experiments and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing. Only spermatogonial cells and a few primary spermatocytes were observed in the testicular tissue of yaks before sexual maturation, while spermatogenic cells at different stages of maturity could observed after sexual maturation. Experiments examining the expression of methylation-related enzymes and overall methylation levels showed that the methylation levels in yak testes increased after sexual maturation. Overall, 1,438 methylation peaks were differentially expressed before and after sexual maturation; 1,226 showed significant up-regulation and 212 showed significant down-regulation after sexual maturation. Annotation analysis showed that the differential methylation peaks were most commonly concentrated in the exon region, followed by the 3 ' UTR and finally the 5 ' UTR region. KEGG pathway analysis demonstrated that homologous recombination, the Notch signaling pathway, growth hormone synthesis, and other signaling pathways may be involved in testicular development and maturation in yaks. Levels of most m(6)A modifications were positively correlated with mRNA abundance, suggesting that m(6)A plays a regulatory role in mammalian sexual maturation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an m(6)A transcriptional map of the yak testes, and our study lays the foundation for elucidating the function of m(6)A in the development of yak testes.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms determining the emergence timing of herbivorous insects is ecologically important. However, little is known about the effect of climatic factors and the presence of conspecific individuals on their emergence in the field. In particular, it is challenging to investigate the seasonal emergence of cicadas because these insects have a long life-cycle and subterranean larval stages. We assembled a time-series dataset that consists of daily counts of emerging cicadas together with meteorological factors, using long-term collection of cicada exuviae by elementary and junior-high-school students. We then performed a non-linear time-series analysis, empirical dynamic modelling, to identify factors behind the timing of cicada emergence. Our findings are three-fold: (1) emergence of individuals of the opposite sex constitute a major driver of the number of individuals emerging per day, and this effect is stronger in males than in females, (2) as in other insect species, air temperature consistently affects cicada emergence, but its effects are relatively weak and (3) precipitation and humidity were causally related to emergence. These results are consistent with the theory of sexual selection as well as the fact that it is hard for the subterranean cicada larvae to use information about air temperature. Significantly, the findings are based on long-term field data collected by non-expert citizens.

AB  - Lactase persistence (LP) is a well-studied example of a Mendelian trait under selection in some human groups due to gene-culture coevolution. We investigated the frequencies of genetic variants linked to LP in Sudanese and South Sudanese populations. These populations have diverse subsistence patterns, and some are dependent on milk to various extents, not only from cows but also from other livestock such as camels and goats. We sequenced a 316-bp region involved in regulating the expression of the LCT gene on chromosome 2, which encompasses five polymorphisms that have been associated with LP. Pastoralist populations showed a higher frequency of LP-associated alleles compared with nonpastora list groups, hinting at positive selection also among northeast African pastoralists. Among the LP variants, the -14009:G variant occurs at the highest frequency among the investigated populations, followed by the -13915:G variant, which is likely of Middle Eastern origin, consistent with Middle Eastern gene flow to the Sudanese populations. There was no incidence of the "East African" LP allele (-14010:C) in the Sudanese and South Sudanese groups, and only one heterozygous individual for the "European" LP allele (-13910:T), suggesting limited recent admixture from these geographic regions. The Beja population of the Beni Amer show three different LP variants at substantial and similar levels, resulting in one of the greatest aggregation of LP variants among all populations across the world.

AB  - Natural Trap Cave (NTC) preserves abundant late Pleistocene herbivore remains including equids (Equus and Haringtonhippus) and the sheep Ovis. The NTC equid sample contains a minimum of two taxa, while other large herbivore genera are represented by single species. In modern communities, sympatric herbivores partition re-sources by feeding on different plants or different plant parts. Previous dental isotopic studies indicated that most NTC herbivores consumed C3 plants, including grasses. To test the hypothesis that resource partitioning occurred among grass-feeders at NTC, we collected mesowear data from both equids as well as Ovis, using samples collected by teams from the University of Kansas between 1974 and 1985.Assessed on upper cheek teeth, mesowear derives from either attritional (tooth on tooth) or abrasional (tooth on abrasive food) wear. The paracone and metacone were examined on each specimen to determine cusp shape (sharp, rounded, or blunt) and occlusal relief (high or low). A diet of non-abrasive material yields high and sharp cusps and one of heavily abrasive materials results in low and blunt cusps, while rounded cusps indicate in-termediate levels of abrasion. A large sample (N = 143) of equid teeth included two morphs. A smaller sample (N = 10) of Ovis teeth provided comparison with the equid teeth. Data collected consisted of individual variables of cusp heights and shape, as well as stages of mesowear combining both variables. Upper adult M1/2s and P4s were used.Results from the equid sample revealed that 8% exhibited high and sharp/rounded cusps, indicating little dietary abrasion; 58% had low and rounded cusps; and 34% had low and blunt cusps. The latter grouping is evidence for a highly abrasive diet. In the sample of Ovis, the results are strikingly different: 40% had high and sharp cusps and 60% had high and rounded cusps. Even though mountain sheep are often interpreted to be grass feeders, their mesowear suggests they did not eat an abrasive diet at NTC.The distribution of mesowear scores among the equid fossils conforms with an interpretation of two equid taxa at NTC, as well as supporting our hypothesis that these taxa partitioned grass resources. The very different nature of the mesowear signature seen in Ovis, compared to the equid fossils, also supports our hypothesis that these grass-feeders either consumed a more mixed or browse-dominated diet with different overall levels of abrasion, or else ate different parts of grass plants. As observed in the Serengeti grazing succession, we propose that equids may have moved through the area first, consuming taller, older, more abrasive parts of grass plants, followed by mountain sheep eating softer, younger plants.

AB  - Animal movements are major determinants of energy expenditure and ultimately the cost-benefit of landscape use. Thus, we sought to understand those costs and how grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) move in mountainous landscapes. We trained captive grizzly bears to walk on a horizontal treadmill and up and down 10% and 20% slopes. The cost of moving upslope increased linearly with speed and slope angle, and this was more costly than moving horizontally. The cost of downslope travel at slower speeds was greater than the cost of traveling horizontally but appeared to decrease at higher speeds. The most efficient walking speed that minimized cost per unit distance was 1.19 +/- 0.11 m s(-1). However, grizzly bears fitted with GPS collars in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem moved at an average velocity of 0.61 +/- 0.28 m s(-1) and preferred to travel on near-horizontal slopes at twice their occurrence. When traveling uphill or downhill, grizzly bears chose paths across all slopes that were similar to 54% less steep and costly than the maximum available slope. The net costs (J kg(-1) m(-1)) of moving horizontally and uphill were the same for grizzly bears, humans and digitigrade carnivores, but those costs were 46% higher than movement costs for ungulates. These movement costs and characteristics of landscape use determined using captive and wild grizzly bears were used to understand the strategies that grizzly bears use for preying on large ungulates and the similarities in travel between people and grizzly bears that might affect the risk of encountering each other on shared landscapes.

AB  - Alpha(2) receptor agonists (alpha(2)-agonists) are useful sedative and analgesic agents in sheep, but have adverse pulmonary effects, which are reportedly similar between different alpha(2)-agonists. This randomized crossover study compared pulmonary function after intravenous administration of an alpha(2)-agonist, either xylazine or an equipotent dose of medetomidine in 34 female sheep anaesthetized twice. Pulmonary function was assessed using spirometry, volumetric capnography, arterial blood gas analysis 1 min prior to, and 5 and 10 min after administration of the allocated alpha 2 agonist drug. Pulmonary structural changes were subsequently assessed using computed tomography (CT). Tachypnoea or hypoxaemia prompted reversal with atipamezole and exclusion of data. Data were analysed for a fixed effect of drug using a mixed effect linear model with significance set at p < 0.05. Ten sheep administered xylazine required atipamezole while none of sheep receiving medetomidine did. Xylazine produced significantly higher respiratory frequency, airway pressures, airway resistance and arterial carbon dioxide (CO2), and lower dynamic compliance, tidal volume, CO2 elimination and end tidal CO2 tension and arterial oxygen tension than medetomidine. This was associated with a significantly lower % of aerated tissue and higher % poorly and non-aerated tissue in CT images of sheep receiving xylazine versus medetomidine. In conclusion, xylazine administration produced marked decreases in pulmonary function, in ventilated isoflurane anaesthetized sheep, when compared to an equipotent dose of medetomidine when administered as an intravenous bolus supporting the use of medetomidine when alpha(2)-agonists are required.

AB  - Background/Objectives: The Xizang sheep is a unique breed of sheep in the highland regions of China that has gradually developed physiological characteristics adapted to the plate environment through long-term natural selection and artificial breeding. However, little is known about the molecular basis of metabolic adaptation to seasons in Xizang sheep. Methods: In this study, liver tissues from Xizang sheep in summer (SL) and autumn (AL) were selected for transcriptome sequencing to explore the metabolic adaptability of Xizang sheep to seasons. Results: The results showed that a total of 12,046 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with 1123 genes significantly upregulated and 951 genes significantly downregulated in autumn. The top five pathways enriched for DEGs were Metabolic pathways, Phagosome, Valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation, Propanoate metabolism, and Fatty acid metabolism, which are involved in immune regulation, fat oxidation, and synthesis. The reduction in lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and fat breakdown metabolism promotes gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) and Phosphoinositide 3-kinase- Protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) signaling pathways. Conclusions: This process helps to maintain the whole-body energy homeostasis of Xizang sheep, facilitating their adaptation to the seasonal changes in the extreme high-altitude environment. These findings provide foundational data for studying the molecular mechanisms of metabolic adaptation to seasons in ruminants.

AB  - Positive-reinforcement training of laboratory pigs can reduce the reliance on forced manual restraint and anaesthesia for sample collection, reducing stress and physiological disruption. Training regimens for laboratory pigs typically rely on specialised equipment for restraint, such as Panepinto slings, with a time investment that may not be justified for short-term studies. These training regimens also commonly rely on pigs being lifted into sling restraints, which is not practical for studies involving large pigs. We developed and assessed a rapid, three-phase, positive-reinforcement training regimen for both individually housed and group-housed laboratory pigs to facilitate the collection of minimally invasive samples consciously and voluntarily. The time to complete each phase of training in both individually housed and group-housed pigs was recorded. The behaviour of the individually housed pigs was assessed via an ethogram of behaviours exhibited during a human approach test, and stress response was assessed by analysing salivary corticosterone. The rapid, positive-reinforcement training regimen successfully facilitated oral swabbing, rectal swabbing and rectal thermometer insertion from individually housed (within 18 days) and group-housed (within 6 days) pigs. The trained pigs displayed increasing positive behaviours, no or very few negative behaviours and corticosterone levels within normal limits throughout the study. This training regimen provides a practical and welfare-positive tool for the collection of minimally invasive samples from both small and large laboratory pigs, with a low time investment of 2-5 min/pig/day without the need for specialised restraint equipment.

AB  - The Amazon and neighboring South American river basins harbor the world's most diverse assemblages of freshwater fishes. One of the most prominent South American fish families is the Serrasalmidae (pacus and piranhas), found in nearly every continental basin. Serrasalmids are keystone ecological taxa, being some of the top riverine predators as well as the primary seed dispersers in the flooded forest. Despite their widespread occurrence and notable ecologies, serrasalmid evolutionary history and systematics are controversial. For example, the sister taxon to serrasalmids is contentious, the relationships of major clades within the family are inconsistent across different methodologies, and half of the extant serrasalmid genera are suggested to be non-monophyletic. We analyzed exon capture to reexamine the evolutionary relationships among 63 (of 99) species across all 16 serrasalmid genera and their nearest outgroups, including multiple individuals per species to account for cryptic lineages. To reconstruct the timeline of serrasalmid diversification, we time-calibrated this phylogeny using two different fossil-calibration schemes to account for uncertainty in taxonomy with respect to fossil teeth. Finally, we analyzed diet evolution across the family and comment on associated changes in dentition, highlighting the ecomorphological diversity within serrasalmids. We document widespread non-monophyly of genera within Myleinae, as well as between Serrasalmus and Pristobrycon, and propose that reliance on traits like teeth to distinguish among genera is confounded by ecological homoplasy, especially among herbivorous and omnivorous taxa. We clarify the relationships among all serrasalmid genera, propose new subfamily affiliations, and support hemiodontids as the sister taxon to Serrasalmidae.

AB  - The complex action of environmental factors often triggers the biomass formation in forest plantations, which is crucial for carbon balance and environmental monitoring, especially in the context of climate change. In this article, we present data on the aboveground biomass accumulation for black locust and common pine ( Pinus sylvestris and Robinia pseudo- acacia) ) as the two most common forest-forming species in the steppe zone. For this purpose, we propose a reliable approach to monitoring of aboveground forest biomass with combining Sentinel-2 multispectral imaging techniques (with Lband) and biometric processing data from coniferous and deciduous stands obtained from field surveys. We represent the results of field surveys with established indicators of aboveground biomass of forest plantations in the field experiment, which averaged 159.9 +/- 9.0 t/ha in the studied region. The biometric indexes obtained from the field experiments were used to develop models for predicting biomass using the remote method. Based on the processing of satellite image data, forest vegetation indices were analysed, among which the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) was the best predictor to assess biomass. The multiple regression method was found to be the best for predicting and mapping the aboveground biomass in P. sylvestris and R. pseudoacacia within the studied area (RMSE - 23.46 t/ha). Based on the results obtained, we created a map of the aboveground biomass distribution in black locust and common pine stands within the studied region. We established reliable correlations between biometric parameters (mean diameter at breast height, mean height) and aboveground biomass of stands with indicators of spectral bands in satellite images. This enables us to use the constructed models to estimate the overall productivity of coniferous and deciduous forest stands for large areas.

AB  - Biochar has attracted worldwide attention owing to its potential for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, improving soil properties, increasing plant growth and so on. While, the assessment of a substantial amount of security is required to determine before biochar is more extensively applied. Our goal was to evaluate the security of biochar by determining the effect of biochar on the preference of soil arthropods for microhabitats. In this study, we examined the effect of varying amounts of biochar on the preference of the Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus) to microhabitats. In addition, we analyzed key soil characteristics to explore their relevance to the termite preferences. Our results found that when compared with 0% (control soil), there was no preference when 2.5% and 5% of biochar were applied. The application of >5% biochar repelled the termites, which then left these soils. Their fresh weight and rates of survival also decreased. The soil pH increased, but the humidity decreased when >5% of biochar was applied. Soil bacteria composition when biochar was amended at 20% also differed from 0% and 2.5% applications. The relative abundance of Cellvibrio and Flavisolibacter in 20% were significantly higher than 0% and 2.5%, while the relative abundance of Burkholderia, Candidatus_Solibacter, Dyella, Edaphobacter, Fulvimonas and Occallatibacter were significantly lower than them. And the functional results predicted by Bugbase suggested that biochar application can cause an increase in the soil potentially pathogen phenotype. In conclusion, our research indicated that biochar can affect the preference of termites for microhabitats and changes in the characteristics of soil might cause changes in these preferences. In addition, our results suggest that soil that has been amended with >10% biochar has the potential to control termites.

AB  - The sleeping sickness focus of Bonon was the last one still active at a low endemic level in C & ocirc;te d'Ivoire. An entomological survey carried out in June 2015 during the rainy season using "Vavoua" traps guided subsequent control activities. Indeed, it improved knowledge of tsetse fly ecology. All the tsetse flies caught (i.e. 1909) belonged to the subspecies Glossina palpalis palpalis (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830), the major vector of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in C & ocirc;te d'Ivoire. In this paper, we looked at the relationship between the apparent density (AD, flies/trap/day) and biotopes. The AD significantly varied according to biotopes, with high density around villages. The trypanosomes overall infection rate (mature and immature) according to microscopic observation was 23.2%. When considering mature infections, the infection rate was 5.5 %. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses confirmed the presence of Trypanosoma brucei s.l. and Trypanosoma congolense "forest type". Blood meals analysis using cytochrome b gene sequences revealed that tsetse flies fed on pigs. The edges of the villages seem to constitute preferred habitats for tsetse flies where they are protected from insecticide pressure in the fields, and where they can easily take bloodmeals from free-ranging pigs. The findings of this study provided a baseline in decision-making for subsequent vector control activities.

AB  - Key Message Neolithus fasciatus gall affected the host's efficiency to absorb and use the available light and functioned as a sink source for photoassimilates, water, and nutrients that would be allocated to plant development and reproduction of Sapium glandulatum. The knowledge on the effects of galls on the redistribution of resources and reproductive performance of the host is fragmentary. We used a combined approach of physiological and biochemical analyses to investigate the impact of galling on host ecophysiology and performance to aid in the bridging of this gap. We determined the frequency of galled hosts on 155 individuals of Sapium glandulatum in the field. The following ecophysiological parameters: oxidative stress, gas exchange, contents of chlorophyll, flavonoids, water, and total carbohydrates were recorded on galled and ungalled individuals. In addition, the impact of galling was recorded through the number of lateral shoots and fruit production. Approximately 75% of the studied host population had at least one galled shoot, and galls were most abundant on younger leaves. While galled and ungalled individuals did not differ in their oxidative stress, galled individuals showed higher stomatal conductance, internal carbon concentration, and flavonoid production, but lower net photosynthetic rate and effective quantum yield of PSII. Total carbohydrate and content of water were higher in galled tissues compared to healthy tissues of galled and ungalled host leaves. Galling induced attacked shoots to produce ca. four lateral shoots while ungalled shoots did not produce any lateral shoots. Last, while ungalled shoots produced an average of six fruits each, galled shoots did not bear any fruits. The presence of Neolithus fasciatus galls affected the host's efficiency to absorb and use the available light and functioned as a sink source for photoassimilates, water, and nutrients that would be allocated to plant development and reproduction. These data support the hypothesis that galling insects are important herbivores and their negative effects on the hosts can spread into several organs and functioning systems of the hosts.

AB  - Through the whole process of large-scale pig production, feed production puts great environmental pressure in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nitrogen (N) emission. Additionally, different feedstuffs will have different results. While previous studies seldom analyzed carbon footprint and nitrogen footprint from feed components or diet choices. Thus, we selected China, the largest producer and consumer of pork in the world, to analyze both nitrogen footprint and carbon footprint through the life cycle of pig production with different feed components. We used life-cycle environmental footprint and scenario analysis to compare carbon footprints, nitrogen footprints, and feed prices of large-scale pig production with different feedstuffs in China. The life cycle of the pig production includes feed crop cultivation, feed processing, pig raising, and manure management. The functional unit is the weight of 1 kg of live pig. The results showed that the carbon footprints, nitrogen footprints, and feed prices ranged from 1.67 kg CO2-eq FU-1 to 1.70 kg CO2-eq FU-1, 35.3 g Nr FU-1 to 38.9 g Nr FU-1, and 1.42 CNY kg-1 to 2.15 CNY kg-1, respectively. Feed crop production and manure management contributed the largest carbon footprint (54%) and the largest nitrogen footprint (64%), respectively. The four scenarios exhibited various results. Scenario 3 (S3), substituting soybean meal in the original feed with distillers dried grains with soluble (DDGS), presented amore favorable outcome with respect to carbon and nitrogen footprints as well as feed prices. This was mainly attributed to feed crop cultivation, manure management, crude protein contents of feeds, and prices of the feed crops. Concerning the uneven feed crop production, number of pig farrowed, feed consumption, and inter-provincial transportation across China, we conducted the spatial analysis under the optimal S3. It revealed that the northern provinces in China exhibited both higher carbon and nitrogen footprints than the southern provinces, due to the northern regions cultivating the crop feed. Finally, we proposed recommendations from perspectives of cultivation practice, feed adjustment, manure management, and strategic zoning. The study not only highlighted the importance of environmental footprint for analyzing environmental impacts of pig production, but also provided the implications for enhancing the sector's environmental sustainability from perspective of feed adjustment.

AB  - Elephant grass genotypes display a variety of morphological differences, influencing the nutritive value of the forage. This study evaluated the histological arrangements of the leaves and stems of different elephant-grass genotypes, two tall-sized (Elephant B and IRI-381) and two dwarfs (Mott and Taiwan A-146 2.37), during a two-year trial. The grasses were harvested at 60-day intervals for two years. Biometric analyses of the stems and leaves were performed based on histological measurements. An in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) assay of the forage was performed. Among the elephant grass genotypes, the lignified cells and vascular bundles of the stems had higher variation than the leaves. Tall-sized genotypes displayed more lignified tissues in stems than the dwarfs. The transversal area occupied by vascular bundles and lignified cells were higher in Elephant B (44 911 mu m(2) and 35 895 mu m(2)) (p < 0.05), compared to the dwarfs. Forage IVDMD was higher in leaves (699 g kg(-1) of dry matter [DM]) than in the stems (678 g kg(-1) of DM), considering all genotypes (p < 0.05). We did not observe any direct influence of genotype on forage digestibility, despite some differences in the histological arrangements.

AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii has become a prominent nosocomial pathogen, primarily owing to its remarkable ability to rapidly acquire resistance to a wide range of antimicrobial agents and its ability to persist in diverse environments. However, there is a lack of data on the molecular epidemiology and its potential implications for public health of A. baumannii strains exhibiting clinically significant resistances that originate from non -clinical environments. Therefore, the genetic characteristics and resistance mechanisms of 80 A. baumannii-calcoaceticus (ABC) complex isolates, sourced from environments associated with poultry and pig production, municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and clinical settings, were investigated. In total, our study classified 54 isolates into 29 previously described sequence types (STs), while 26 isolates exhibited as -yet -unassigned STs. We identified a broad range of A. baumannii STs originating from poultry and pig production environments (e.g., ST10, ST238, ST240, ST267, ST345, ST370, ST372, ST1112 according to Pasteur scheme). These STs have also been documented in clinical settings worldwide, highlighting their clinical significance. These findings also raise concerns about the potential zoonotic transmission of certain STs associated with livestock environments. Furthermore, we observed that clinical isolates exhibited the highest diversity of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). In contrast to non -clinical isolates, clinical isolates typically carried a significantly higher number of ARGs, ranging from 10 to 15. They were also the exclusive carriers of biocide resistance genes and acquired carbapenemases ( bla OXA-23 , bla OXA-58 , bla OXA-72 , bla GIM-1 , bla NDM-1 ). Additionally, we observed that clinical strains displayed an increased capacity for carrying plasmids and undergoing genetic transformation. This heightened capability could be linked to the intense selective pressures commonly found within clinical settings. Our study provides comprehensive insights into essential aspects of ABC isolates originating from livestockassociated environments and clinical settings. We explored their resistance mechanisms and potential implications for public health, providing valuable knowledge for addressing these critical issues.

AB  - Under the climate change context, warming Southern Ocean waters may allow mercury (Hg) to become more bioavailable to the Antarctic marine food web (i.e., ice-stored Hg release and higher methylation rates by mi-croorganisms), whose biomagnification processes are poorly documented. Biomagnification of Hg in the food web of the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the world's fastest-warming regions, was examined using carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) stable isotope ratios for estimating feeding habitat and trophic levels, respectively. The stable isotope signatures and total Hg (T-Hg) concentrations were measured in Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and several Antarctic predator species, including seabirds (gentoo penguins Pygoscelis papua, chinstrap penguins Pygoscelis antarcticus, brown skuas Stercorarius antarcticus, kelp gulls Larus dominicanus, southern giant petrels Macronectes giganteus) and marine mammals (southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina). Significant differences in delta C-13 values among species were noted with a great overlap between seabird species and M. leonina. As expected, significant differences in delta N-15 values among species were found due to interspecific variations in diet-related to their trophic position within the marine food web. The lowest Hg concentrations were registered in E. superba (0.007 +/- 0.008 mu g g(-1)) and the highest values in M. giganteus (12.090 +/- 14.177 mu g g(-1)). Additionally, a significant positive relationship was found between Hg concentrations and trophic levels (reflected by delta N-15 values), biomagnifying nearly 2 times its concentrations at each level. Our results support that trophic interaction is the major pathway for Hg biomagnification in Southern Ocean ecosystems and warn about an increase in the effects of Hg on long-lived (and high trophic level) Antarctic predators under climate change in the future.

AB  - The forage cactus cultivar Mexican elephant ear (MEE) [Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw.] has been widely used in the semi-arid of Brazil because of its resistance to carmine mealybug. Therefore, it is necessary to establish planting and harvesting management strategies for this cultivar. This study evaluated the effect of cutting intensity (preservation mother cladode, and mother + primary cladodes) and different planting densities (55 555; 27 777; 13 888 and 6 944 plants ha(-1)) on the morphology and productivity of the forage cactus cv. MEE, in 10-year-old cultivation under rainfed conditions. A split-plot design was used where planting density was allocated to the main plots and harvesting intensity to the sub-plots. Each treatment combination was replicated four times. The data were submitted to ANOVA, Tukey's test, and principal component analysis at 5% (p < 0.05). Post-harvesting preservation of the primary cladodes promoted greater dry matter production (9.2 t ha(-1) year(-1)), crop water accumulation (86.6 t ha(-1) year(-1)), and rainwater use efficiency (11.4 kg of DM mm(-1)) (p < 0.01). Primary cladodes preservation positively influenced the productive characteristics of the forage cactus, and the planting density of 13 888 plants ha(-1) (0.72 m(2)) favoured the productivity of this cultivar. These findings can guide planting and harvesting strategies for cultivating MEE cactus.

AB  - The Saharan Striped Polecat (Carnivora, Mustelidae, Poecilictis libyca) is a small mustelid for which comprehensive biological studies and demographic data across its geographic range are lacking. Throughout 2018, we investigated the distribution, abundance, and threats to this species in Tunisia by means of a questionnaire survey, spotlighting, and collection of other field-based evidence. Our study resulted in 32 new records, including 1 outside the previously known range in the south, while a contraction of its northern limits was determined from historical records (literature, museum samples, online databases). Roughly defined, the distribution of P. libyca extends from the Saharan to the subhumid bioclimatic zones. This semifossorial species tends to favor sandy soil but can be found in a wide range of habitats including deserts, oases, riverbeds, coastal dunes, forests, bushclumps, grasslands, sebkhas, and cultivated areas. Interviewees reported a significant decline in most polecat populations located near human settlements. Identified threats include widespread capturing for trade; drought-induced prey depletion; habitat loss due to agricultural expansion; road mortalities; use of rodenticides, pesticides, and insecticides in agricultural land; and attacks by domestic dogs and other predators. Additionally, population expansion and human encroachment have led to increased habitat loss, resulting in the extirpation of polecats from certain northern regions. To safeguard this locally threatened species in Tunisia, we recommend the protection of 3 key populations located in Dar Chichou, Metbasta, and Ez Zebara. We also advocate for further research to improve baseline ecological data and encourage awareness campaigns aimed at educating local communities residing near polecat populations, garnering support for their conservation.
   A study reports 32 new records of the little-known Saharan Striped Polecat in Tunisia, expanding its range southward but revealing a contraction in the north. Found in various habitats, it faces numerous threats including poaching and habitat loss. The protection of key populations and awareness campaigns are urgently needed.

AB  - The valorisation of vegetal waste as a source of crop nutrients constitutes a circular strategy to improve the sustainability of intensive horticultural production systems. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of organic amendments derived from vegetal residues on the yield and quality of tomato. The following fertilisation treatments were carried out: fresh vegetal residues (4 kg m(-1)), compost (3 kg m(-1)), and vermicompost at two different doses (3 and 9 kg m(-1)), all derived from previous tomato crop vegetal residues, an organic treatment with goat manure (3 kg m(-1)), and a control mineral fertigation treatment. The highest yield was obtained with conventional mineral fertigation management, followed by vermicompost treatments at two different doses (3 and 9 kg m(-1)), with no statistical differences. The organic treatments with fresh crop residues, compost and goat manure resulted in lower yield. Regarding quality parameters, the lycopene content was higher in the mineral fertilisation and vermicompost at 3 kg m(-1) treatment, while the other antioxidants measured were more concentrated in tomatoes fertilised with vermicompost treatment at 9 kg m(-1) and goat manure. The plant nutrient management with vermicompost is the best circular solution, as it allows to reintegrate the residues generated in previous crop cycles into the soil, obtaining a yield equal to chemical input management and tomatoes with high nutritional quality.

AB  - The family Tabanidae (Diptera: Brachycera) is composed of flies commonly known as horse flies and deer flies. The family is cosmopolitan and possesses both economic and conservation interests. The females are hematophagous attacking a variety of animals, including cattle, but both females and males from several genera are flower visitors. Despite the fauna of S & atilde;o Paulo being largely explored due to historical factors, several species of Tabanidae in the state are still poorly known. Several are known only from the type series, and information from the literature is limited to old, sometimes inadequate descriptions and drawings. Herein we provide an illustrated list, based on the literature and specimens collected in thirteen localities from S & atilde;o Paulo state. For all the identified specimens we provide high-definition images from different views. Important diagnostic features for each species are supplied to facilitate the identification of the species in the region. We report five new records for S & atilde;o Paulo state: Catachlorops (Amphichlorops) flavus (Wiedemann), Dichelacera rubricosa (Wulp), Leucotabanus sebastianus Fairchild, Phaeotabanus aphanopterus (Wiedemann), Tabanus schadei Fairchild and one for Brazil: D. rubricosa. Also, C. flavus is redescribed along with the description of the male.

AB  - This study explores the potential of seabuckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), a vital shrub species of cold desert region of Ladakh, India, emphasising its provisioning services. Known as the 'Wonder Plant,' it is essential for fuelwood, medicinal use, and berries that significantly contribute to local income. The research focuses on Nubra Valley, where field surveys were conducted across ten villages, collecting data from 163 households and 22 berry processing centers of seabuckthorn. The study reveals the extent of seabuckthorn's contribution to local economies. Results indicate that the average collection of fuelwood per household is similar to 930 kg per year valued at 189.52 USD, resulting in an estimated total economic value of 0.68 million USD for the entire valley. Additionally, the processing of berries yields 464.25 metric tons of pulp, generating a market value of 1.14 million USD annually. Findings indicate that community members are more aware of provisioning services than regulating or cultural services, highlighting their direct reliance on seabuckthorn resources. However, the increasing demand puts huge pressure on seabuckthorn ecosystems. Hence, the study emphasises the urgent need for sustainable management approaches to ensure the conservation of seabuckthorn forests, which are vital for Nubra Valley residents' livelihoods and the region's ecological stability.

AB  - Slurries are one of the main NH3 emission sources. Nitrogen losses impact air quality, and they constrain the sustainability of farming activities. In a rainfed Mediterranean agricultural system, the aim was to quantify NH3 emissions at a time when plants do not yet cover the soil surface and according to fertilization practices. One treatment was slurry from fattening pigs (PSF) applied before cereal sowing and incorporated into the soil; two treatments were PSF or from sows (PSS) applied at the cereal tillering stage (topdressing); and two more treatments received slurries twice, before sowing and as topdressing. Ammonia emissions were quantified with semi-static chambers during 145 h (before sowing) and 576 h (at cereal tillering) after slurry application. Before sowing, tillage after slurry application controlled NH3-N emissions, but they accounted for 14% of the total NH4-N applied. At tillering, average NH3-N emissions also accounted for ca. 14% of total NH4-N applied as PSF or PSS, respectively. Slurry dry matter from 84 kg m-3 (PSS) up to 127 kg m-3 (PSF), combined with low soil moisture content (below 30% of water holding capacity) at application time, helped in NH3 emission control. Slurry applications before sowing did not enhance later NH3-N emissions at topdressing.

AB  - The residue of chemicals can affect the maturation of livestock oocytes, thereby affecting the quality of embryos. Research has shown that imidacloprid, a systemic neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in agriculture, can damage the reproductive system of mammals, and it is unclear whether imidacloprid will affect oocyte maturation and how to reduce its toxicity. The results of this study show that imidacloprid can affect oocyte maturation, and melatonin supplementation can restore oocyte maturation by alleviating oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and offset the toxic effect of imidacloprid on pig oocytes, which indicates that Melatonin may be a promising drug to improve the quality of oocytes exposed to imidacloprid in animals.
   Imidacloprid (IMI) is an endogenous neonicotinoid insecticide widely used in agriculture and has attracted researchers' attention because of its risks to the environment and human health. Melatonin (MT) is an antioxidant hormone produced by the pineal gland of the brain. Studies have shown that it has a variety of physiological functions and plays a crucial role in the development of animal germ cells and embryos. The potential protective effects of MT against oocyte damage caused by neonicotinoid pesticide toxicity remain unclear. In this study, we report the toxicity of IMI against, and its effects on the quality of, porcine oocytes and the protective effect of MT on IMI-exposed oocytes. The results show that IMI exposure adversely affected oocyte maturation, while MT supplementation ameliorated its toxic effects. Specifically, IMI exposure increased oxidative stress (OS), endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and apoptosis, which may affect polar body expulsion rates and blastocyst formation. Also, IMI exposure reduced oocyte cleavage rates and the number of cells in blastocysts. However, all of these toxic effects can be restored after a melatonin supplementation treatment. In conclusion, these results suggest that melatonin has a protective effect on IMI-induced defects during porcine oocyte maturation.

AB  - Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is an important growth factor that supports the culture and maintenance of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) by suppressing spontaneous differentiation. Different LIF sequences may lead to differences in function. The protein sequences of buffalo LIF and mouse LIF differed by 65.5% according to MEGA software analysis. The PB-LIF-GFP-Puro vector was constructed, and the CHO-K1 cell line was established. The final LIF protein concentration in the CHO-K1 cell culture medium was approximately 4.268 ng/mL. Here, we report that buffalo LIF effectively maintains the self-renewal of buffalo spermatogonia during culture. Buffalo spermatogonia were cultured in conditioned medium containing no LIF (0 ng/mL), mouse LIF (1 ng/mL), mouse LIF (10 ng/mL), or buffalo LIF (1 ng/mL). Furthermore, the effects of mouse LIF and buffalo LIF culture on the maintenance of buffalo spermatogonia were determined by analyzing cell colony formation, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, cell immunofluorescence, and cell counting. The buffalo LIF (1 ng/mL) group showed similar maintenance of the proliferation of buffalo spermatogonia to that in the mouse LIF (10 ng/mL) group. These results demonstrated that the proliferation of buffalo spermatogonia can be maintained in vitro by adding a low dose of buffalo LIF. This study provides a foundation for the further optimization of in vitro buffalo SSC culture systems.

AB  - Simple Summary Milk is a valuable source of proteins and other nutrients. Changes in milk production toward systems that obtain increased milk yield have resulted in a change in milk composition in large and small ruminants, such as goats. A better characterisation of breeds that undergo a limited formal crossbreeding, such as the Teramana goat is pivotal in order to obtain useful data that could be applied for the management of the breed. Proteomic technologies have brought significant advances in the characteristion of new proteins. In this study, this technology was used to compare the proteome of the autochthon Teramana and Saanen breeds, which are commonly used by the industry to allow for the identification of a cohort of proteins that were able to discriminate the two goat breeds. Proteomics offered the potentiality for a deeper investigation of the biological differences of the breeds under study in a substrate easy to obtain. Goat's milk is an excellent source of nutrients, with greater benefits compared to cow's milk. Limited information is available on autochthon goat breeds, which are important for biodiversity preservation. In this study, the aim of using label-free quantification was to investigate the milk proteome of two goat breeds, the autochthon Teramana and Saanen breeds, which are commonly used by the industry. Utilising label-free proteomic analysis, 749 and 666 proteins, respectively were identified and quantified from the Teramana and Saanen goat milk. Moreover, utilising statistical analysis, 29 proteins were able to discriminate the two goat breeds, with many of the identified proteins involved in complement and coagulation cascades. This work enhances our understanding of the goat milk proteome and shows differences between the two breeds, leading to an important contribution toward a more detailed molecular-view of this unique substrate. Additionally, charactersation of the milk proteins can help in guiding genetic improvements in the goat herds, and thus increasing its use in human nutrition.

AB  - The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism is associated with reduced activity-dependent BDNF release in the brain and has been implicated in fear and anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder. Exercise has been shown to have benefits in affective disorders but the role of BDNF Val66Met remains unclear. Male and female BDNF Val66Met rats were housed in automated running-wheel cages from weaning while controls were housed in standard cages. During adulthood, all rats underwent stan-dard three-day fear conditioning testing, with three tone/shock pairings on day 1 (acquisition), and extinction learning and memory (40 tones/session) on day 2 and day 3. Expression of BDNF and stress-related genes were measured in the frontal cortex. Extinction testing on day 2 revealed significantly lower freezing in response to initial cue exposure in control Met/Met rats, reflecting impaired fear memory. This deficit was reversed in both male and female Met/Met rats exposed to exercise. There were no genotype effects on acquisition or extinction of fear, however chronic exercise increased freezing in all groups at every stage of testing. Exercise furthermore led to increased expression of Bdnf in the prefrontal cortex of females and its isoforms in both sexes, as well as increased expression of FK506 binding protein 51 (Fkpb5) in females and decreased expression of Serum/ glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (Sgk1) in males independent of genotype. These results show that the Met/ Met genotype of the Val66Met polymorphism affects fear memory, and that chronic exercise selectively reverses this genotype effect. Chronic exercise also led to an overall increase in freezing in all genotypes which may contribute to results.

AB  - Simple Summary This study determined the effect of feeding Moringa oleifera (MO) leaf extracts to lactating ewes on the physicochemical composition of their milk and yogurt during storage (4 degrees C for 14 days) and the sensory acceptance of the yogurt. The supplementation of MO in lactating ewes' diets improved the contents of protein, ash, acidity, and leucine in their milk. The effect of MO in yogurt showed an increase in nonfat solids, protein, and leucine during storage at 4 degrees C for 14 days. The MO had a positive effect on the overall acceptance of yogurt at a higher MO level of supplementation in sheep diets. Therefore, adding MO leaf extracts to sheep diets could be a feasible nutritional strategy to improve the physicochemical characteristics of yogurt from sheep. This study determined the effect of feeding Moringa oleifera (MO) leaf extracts to lactating ewes on the physicochemical composition of their milk and yogurt during storage (4 degrees C for 14 days) and the sensory acceptance of the yogurt. Over 45 days, 24 multiparous lactating Pelibuey and Katahdin ewes (two days in lactation) were randomly assigned to four groups: MO-0, basal diet (BD) + 0 mL MO; MO-20, BD + 20 mL MO; MO-40, BD + 40 mL MO; and MO-60, BD + 60 mL MO. In the milk, an increase of 6% in protein, 26% in leucine, 14% in ash, and 1% in the pH (6.71) was observed with MO-60. The density values decreased by 0.3% at a higher dose of MO compared to MO-0, while the nonfat solids (NFS) in the milk were similar between the treatments. In the yogurt, an increase of 5% in protein, 113% in leucine (MO-20), 9% in NFS, and a reduction of 2% in moisture with MO-60 was observed. The acidity reflected an inverse relationship to the pH, as did the moisture and NFS with MO-60. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with MO in lactating ewes did not have negative effects on the chemical composition of their yogurt during storage (14 days). Overall, feeding sheep with 20 mL of MO positively influenced the physicochemical composition of their milk and yogurt during storage.

AB  - Tea plantations in Karst regions suffer from the serious effects of frequent temporary karst droughts, leading to a decline in tea production and quality in the region. The close relationship between growth and electrical parameters of plants, including physiological capacitance, resistance and impedance, can be used to accurately monitor their plant water status online, quickly, accurately, timely and nondestructively. In this study, three tea tree cultivars of Zhonghuang No.2 (ZH), Wuniuzao (WNZ), and Longjing 43 (LJ) with different levels of drought resistance were selected as experimental materials, and experiments were carried out under controlled conditions according to control (soil water content of 40-45%, D0), (keeping D0 no watering to 5 days, D5), (keeping D0 no watering to 10 days, D10), (the first day after D10 is rehydrated to D0 is regarded as R1) and (the fifth day after D10 rehydration to D0 is regarded as R5), to determine intracellular water metabolism and nutrient translocation characteristics based on intrinsic electrical parameters. The photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were also determined to investigate the response of water metabolism to simulated karst drought in the three tea tree cultivars. The results indicated that the water metabolism patterns responded to environmental water changes with a medium water-holding capacity, medium water transport rate, and low water-use efficiency, and the nutrient patterns in those tea tree varieties demonstrated with a high nutrient flux per unit area, low nutrient transfer rate, and high nutrient transport capacity. After rehydration, only the electrical characteristics of WNZ returned to the D0 levels, but the net photosynthetic rate of all varieties returned to or even exceeded the D0 levels. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters could not be used to characterize the recoverability of metabolism in tea trees. The electrical characteristics quickly reflected the response of the water metabolism in plants to environmental changes, and the fusion of electrical characteristics and photosynthetic characteristics was able to more quickly, accurately, and comprehensively reflect the response of water metabolism to temporary karst drought.

AB  - 1. After non-native herbivores arrive in a novel habitat and establish, they must then disperse to new host plants to continue invading. While flight-capable insect herbivores can expand their non-native ranges by flying to new hosts, insects that lack wings, such as female scale insects, are often aided in their spread by wind and phoretic dispersal vectors such as birds and mammals.
   2. After being detected in 2004 in a Texas nursery, crapemyrtle bark scale (CMBS), Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), has established in 15 different states across the Southeast and Middle Atlantic regions of the USA.
   3. We quantified the wind speeds leading to scale insect dislodgement and, in the laboratory and field, evaluated the willingness of CMBS nymphs to crawl onto vector proxies (bird feathers and mammal fur).
   4. Our findings demonstrate that CMBS nymphs can become dislodged from ecologically relevant substrates at low wind speeds (similar to 7 m/s) and provided evidence that CMBS nymphs willingly, though not preferentially, crawl onto vector proxies, a final step before dispersing phoretically. Our results indicate that trees with high-density infestations of CMBS are frequent sources of propagules, given that (i) wind speeds that shake small tree branches are likely to dislodge active crawlers and (ii) active crawlers appear willing to walk onto birds and mammals.
   5. The apparent ease of between-tree spread by CMBS via multiple modes of dispersal presents challenges for preventing the spread of this insect, but field confirmation of these mechanisms is needed to understand their relative importance.

AB  - The North Bohemian Brown Coal Basin (Czech Republic) is suggested as a source of significant pollution in the surrounding environment with various pollutants, including risk elements. A total of 53 sampling points were selected within the North Bohemian region. The selected sampling points represented either the basin areas (affected by the coal mining and related activities) or the mountain areas (an area unaffected by the coal mining but characterized by the geogenic sources of the risk elements). At each of the sampling points, soils and respective dominant indigenous plant samples were collected. A suite of ecological indices, namely, individual pollution index (Ii), Nemerow index (PN), bioaccumulation factor (BAF), translocation factor (TF), and hazard quotient (HQ), were applied to estimate the environmental risk of As, Be, Cd, and Zn levels in soils, potential soil-plant transfer, and soil-plant-animal transport of these stated elements. The results from Ii showed that the maximum values of As, Be, Cd, and Zn in the investigated soils exceeded the preventive values, where the Ii value was up to 58 for As in the mountain areas, indicating severe pollution. At the same time, mild pollution was recorded in the case of Cd. For Be in the researched soils, its Ii assessment result was a wide range, varying between a clean environment and severe pollution. Whereas As and Be uptake by plants was limited and these elements were retained in the plant's roots, relatively high mobility and soil to plant shoots transport ability of Cd were recorded and documented by the TF values. The HQs calculated for selected herbivorous mammals in the area showed that the potential health risk of As and Be was limited to only plant roots in the hotspots with extreme As and Be contents. In comparison, substantial health risk of Cd was observed in the aboveground biomass of plants. Therefore, the potential remediation of the coal mining areas should be focused on (i) identification of the As and Be hotspots and (ii) to reduce the mobility and plant availability of Cd in the whole investigated area.

AB  - The body size of an adult insect is strongly determined by the environmental factors to which it is exposed during growth and development. Insect species confronted with a high environmental variability across their geographical range (i.e. wide ecological niche breadth) may therefore reveal broader variation in body size than those species which are more specialised (i.e. narrow ecological niche). In this study, we aim to investigate whether characteristics related to the ecological niche breadth of a holometabolous insect species (i.e. its ecological specialisation) affect its intraspecific variation in adult body size. By using European geometrid moths as a model group, we specifically tested whether latitudinal range size, larval resource use and voltinism affect intraspecific body size variation. We hypothesised that body size variation will increase along with latitudinal range and larval diet breadth. We further expected that univoltine species reveal a lower body size variation compared to those with multiple generations per year. To test these hypotheses, we compiled a comprehensive trait database for 631 species of European geometrid moths from literature, including information on adult body size, life history and distribution. We further reconstructed a molecular phylogeny including all analysed geometrid species and applied phylogenetic comparative methods in order to test our predictions. In support of our hypotheses, we found that intraspecific size variation is positively related to latitudinal range size and larval diet breadth, and that multivoltine species reveal a higher heterogeneity in body size than taxa with a strictly univoltine life style. Based on our results, we demonstrated that intraspecific body size variation in geometrid moths is negatively related to ecological specialisation. We further suggest that increased variation in body size with increasing niche breadth is a general pattern, which likely applies to many other insect groups as well. This assumption, however, demands further empirical scrutiny.

AB  - In vitro capacitation allows for a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying fertilization and the development of improved reproductive techniques for improving fertility rates in porcine. Tyrodes albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP) and modified Krebs Ringers Broth (m-KRB) are two medias that are commonly used in research experiments to induce capacitation in boar spermatozoa (Ca & ntilde;& oacute;n-Beltr & aacute;n et al., Theriogenology, 198, 2023 and 231; Oberlender et al., Archivos de Medicina Veterinaria, 44, 2012 and 201; Sahoo et al., International Journal of Biological Macromolecules, 241, 2023 and 124502). Moreover, understanding the morphological and functional changes in boar spermatozoa at different hours of capacitation periods might aid in the development of novel techniques for improving sperm quality and increasing the litter size. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of Tyrode albumin lactate pyruvate and modified Krebs Ringers Broth media on in vitro capacitation of HD-K75 boar spermatozoa at three different periods of incubation. A total of 24 ejaculate from four clinically healthy, 10-12 months aged HD-K75 boars, maintained at ICAR-All India Coordinated Research Project (AICRP) on pig were selected. Semen was collected by 'Simple fist' method using a portable dummy. The semen samples having 200 mL volume, 10(3) x 10(6) spermatozoa/ml concentration and 70% initial motility were selected and split into two parts and suspended in TALP and m-KRB media, respectively, and incubated for 5 h at 37 degrees C. Seminal parameters viz. sperm viability, plasma membrane integrity and acrosomal integrity were estimated in the samples at 0, 3 and 5 h of incubation. This study revealed that there was significant variation between media in live acrosome-reacted (p < .05) and HOST-reacted (p < .01) spermatozoa, while between capacitation periods significant (p < .01) variation was observed in hyperactivated spermatozoa, live acrosome-reacted spermatozoa, HOST-reacted spermatozoa, FITC-labelled PSA, extracellular protein and sperm cholesterol. Non-significant variation was observed in total phospholipid. TALP showed overall better consequence on sperm viability, plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity of boar spermatozoa. From this study, it could be concluded that both TALP and m-KRB media were virtuous to induce capacitation in HD-K75 boar spermatozoa. TALP media, however, had a better effect on sperm viability, plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity of boar spermatozoa. Out of the three different periods, 3 h capacitation period resulted in significantly (p < .01) higher incidence of sperm viability, plasma membrane and acrosomal integrity in HD-K75 boar spermatozoa.

AB  - The hypoxia-induced stress response constitutes a physiological disorder that poses a significant, life-threatening risk. This study aims to investigate the anti-hypoxic brain injury effects of peptides derived from yak milk residue and elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Peptidomic analysis identified three bioactive peptides (YPFPGPIPN, PVVPPFLQPEVMGVSK, and T3-LVYPFPGPIPN (T3)) associated with anti-hypoxic activity. In vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB) modeling demonstrated that T3 exhibited significant time- and concentration-dependent permeability. Under hypoxic stress, T3 effectively inhibited neuronal inflammation and apoptosis. Integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses revealed that T3 mitigates hypoxia-induced neuroinflammation by regulating l-glutamine metabolism through the RAS/TNF-alpha/MAPK signaling pathway. These findings underscore the potential of yak milk residue-derived peptide (T3) as a neuroprotective agent against hypoxic injury. The insights gained from this research are instrumental in utilizing yak milk byproducts and developing functional foods with anti-hypoxia properties, thereby addressing the market needs of specific demographic groups.

AB  - In the hippocampus, environmental changes elicit rearrangement of active neuronal ensembles or remapping of place cells. However, it remains elusive how the brain ensures a consistent representation of a certain environment itself despite salient events occurring there. Here, we longitudinally tracked calcium dynamics of dorsal hippocampal CA1 neurons in mice subjected to contextual fear conditioning and extinction training. Overall population activities were significantly changed by fear conditioning and were responsive to footshocks and freezing. However, a small subset of neurons, termed environment cells, were consistently active in a specific environment irrespective of experiences. A decoder modeling study showed that these cells, but not place cells, were able to predict the environment to which the mouse was exposed. Environment cells might underlie the constancy of cognition for distinct environments across time and events. Addition-ally, our study highlights the functional heterogeneity of cells in the hippocampus.

AB  - With the widespread promotion of the green feeding concept of "substitution and resistance", there is a pressing need for alternative products in feed and breeding industries. Employing lactic acid bacteria represents one of the most promising antimicrobial strategies to combat infections caused by pathogenic bacteria. As such, we analyzed the intestinal tract of Anhui local pig breeds, including LiuBai Pig, YueHei Pig, and HuoShou Pig, to determine the composition and diversity of intestinal microbiota using 16S rRNA. Further, the functionality of the pigs' intestinal microbiota was studied through metagenomic sequencing. This study revealed that lactic acid bacteria were the primary contributors to the functional composition, as determined through a species functional contribution analysis. More specifically, the functional contribution of lactic acid bacteria in the HuoShou Pig group was higher than that of the LiuBai Pig and YueHei Pig. Subsequently, the intestinal contents of the HuoShou Pig group were selected for the screening of the dominant lactic acid bacteria strains. Out of eight strains of lactic acid bacteria, the acid-production capacity, growth curve, and tolerance to a simulated intestinal environment were assessed. Additional assessments included surface hydrophobicity, the self-aggregation capability, co-agglutination of lactic acid bacteria with pathogenic bacteria, and an in vitro bacteriostatic activity assay. Lactobacillus johnsonii L5 and Lactobacillus reuteri L8 were identified as having a strong overall performance. These findings serve as a theoretical basis for the further development of pig-derived probiotics, thereby promoting the application of lactic acid bacteria to livestock production.

AB  - The flax weevil Anagotus fairburni is a large flightless beetle, that is one of the members of the endemic insect 'megafauna' of New Zealand. It is a protected species that currently persists only on predator-free islands or in remote and difficult to access alpine areas. Little is documented about the ecology of the flax weevil. In this study we estimated the number of instars in the A. fairburni life cycle by measuring the head capsule widths of larvae collected in the field on Mana Island Scientific Reserve. We used kernel density function estimates to predict average head-capsule widths and the number of larval instars. We then used Brooks-Dyar's law on the head capsule width data and analysed Brooks and Crosby indexes to refine the estimated number of instars based on imperfect data. Results from sampling of 86 larvae suggested four instar groupings, but further analysis based on Brooks-Dyar's law found that A. fairburni likely passes through 6 or 7 larval stages prior to pupation, with some uncertainty for smaller instars. Our method provides new data on ecology of an endemic species and provides a framework for further work on similar endangered species where data is imperfect or difficult to gather.

AB  - Cicadellidae (leafhoppers) may be the most diverse and abundant insect herbivores in terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, with more than 23,000 described species in 20 extant subfamilies. Although prior studies have supported the monophyly of most recognized subfamilies, relationships among these groups remain inconsistently resolved and previous molecular phylogenies have failed to support the monophyly of a few subfamilies. To help address this deficiency, we combined 24 new complete mitogenomes representing 6 previously unsequenced subfamilies and 13 tribes with previously available data to create a dataset of 79 cicadellid taxa representing 16 subfamilies for phylogenetic analysis. The new analyses confirm that leafhopper mitochondrial genomes are highly conservative in overall structure, with only a few rare rearrangements of tRNAs. All phylogenetic analyses consistently supported the monophyly of previously recognized cicadellid tribes for which more than 1 representative was included and all of the included subfamilies were also consistently recovered as monophyletic with the exception of Aphrodinae and Eurymelinae. Bayesian inference and Maximum Likelihood analyses with site-homogeneous models are only slightly affected by nucleotide compositional heterogeneity and yield more stable phylogenetic relationships of family-group taxa than analyses with a heterogeneous-site mixture model using PhyloBayes. Molecular divergence time estimates indicate that the main lineages of Cicadellidae, most corresponding to recognized subfamilies, diverged during the Cretaceous period (93-121 Mya).

AB  - Simple Summary: Cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic environmental contaminant, negatively affects human and animal fertility in females. In sheep, Cd displays age-dependent bioaccumulation at ovarian level. At environmental nanomolar concentrations, it reduces oocyte fertilization by inducing oxidative stress on cumulus cells (CCs), a cell population of the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) supporting oocyte growth, functional maturation and fertilization. In this study, the modifications induced by Cd exposure to all the genes expressed in CCs of in vitro matured COCs, recovered from the ovaries of adult and prepubertal sheep, were analysed by RNA sequencing. A set of genes significantly dysregulated upon Cd exposure was identified. Effects of Cd were more relevant in CCs from adult than from prepubertal COCs. Most genes were upregulated while a minority of them were downregulated. Some genes were already known as involved in ovarian activity or Cd-induced effects, whereas others were completely new in these fields. These findings identify in the sheep, an important livestock species with translational relevance in human reproduction, the set of genes controlling oocyte functional competence, altered by Cd. These biomarkers will make it possible to identify oocytes that cannot be fertilized to evaluate whether they are to be discarded or recovered with detoxifying treatments.
   Cadmium (Cd), a highly toxic pollutant, impairs oocyte fertilization, through oxidative damage on cumulus cells (CCs). This study analysed the transcriptomic profile of CCs of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) from adult and prepubertal sheep, exposed to Cd nanomolar concentration during in vitro maturation. In both age-groups, CCs of matured oocytes underwent RNA-seq, data analysis and validation. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in adult (n = 99 DEGs) and prepubertal (n = 18 DEGs) CCs upon Cd exposure. Transcriptomes of adult CCs clustered separately between Cd-exposed and control samples, whereas prepubertal ones did not as observed by Principal Component Analysis. The transcriptomic signature of Cd-induced CC toxicity was identified by gene annotation and literature search. Genes associated with previous studies on ovarian functions and/or Cd effects were confirmed and new genes were identified, thus implementing the knowledge on their involvement in such processes. Enrichment and validation analysis showed that, in adult CCs, Cd acted as endocrine disruptor on DEGs involved in hormone biosynthesis, cumulus expansion, regulation of cell signalling, growth and differentiation and oocyte maturation, whereas in prepubertal CCs, Cd affected DEGs involved in CC development and viability and CC-oocyte communications. In conclusion, these DEGs could be used as valuable non-invasive biomarkers for oocyte competence.

AB  - Aluminum (Al) is an important factor that limits plant growth under acidic soil conditions. However, several plant species developed distinct mechanisms that limit the damage caused by high Al concentrations. In highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), the Al resistance mechanisms are not fully understood. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of Al toxicity on roots and leaves of highbush blueberry genotypes with contrasting Al resistance [Star (Al-sensitive) and Camellia and Cargo (Al-resistant)] and identify the main molecular and physiological strategies underpinning adaptive Al stress responses in nutrient solution. After 48 h of Al treatment, the reduced form of ascorbate (ASC) was higher in roots, but unchanged in leaves of Cargo and Camellia genotypes compared to the control. We also observed decreased root exudation of oxalate in the Al-treated sensitive cultivar Star throughout the treatment period. However, in the resistant cultivar (Camellia), the exudation of oxalate increased 2.4- and 2.8-fold at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Al treatment differentially affected the enzyme activity and gene expression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes. NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH) expression in roots of cultivar Cargo was reduced at 24 h and increased at 48 h, whereas in leaves the expression was higher at 24 h and decreased at 48 h compared to the control. Citrate synthase (CS) activity in Al-resistant Cargo roots diminished at 24 h, increasing afterwards, without variation in the CS gene expression, compared with the initial time point (t = 0). In Al-resistant Camellia roots, the gene expression and the activity of CS decreased during Al exposure. NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) activity showed increased activity and gene expression at 24 h, in the leaves of cultivar Cargo, whereas in roots the gene expression decreased, but the activation state of NADP-MDH increased. The expression of genes encoding TCA cycle enzymes did not differ significantly in the Al-sensitive cultivar Star during Al exposure. In conclusion, the exudation of organic acid anions, particularly oxalate, plays an important role in Al resistance of highbush blueberry genotypes whilst elevated levels of ASC in roots, also contribute to the Al-resistance mechanisms exhibited by genotypes Camellia and Cargo.

AB  - In pigs (Sus scrofa), the initial immunoglobulin rearrangement of the kappa light chain is replaced by lambda before the heavy chains rearrange, and the light chains may rearrange even later. This study investigates whether these developmental differences are reflected in the usage of IGK and IGL genes. We found large differences between peripheral B cells and those developing in the bone marrow, and between B cells in germ-free piglets and conventional pigs. During early B cell development in the bone marrow, more 3' V and 5'J gene segments for both light chains are used. However, in the peripheral naive repertoire, more 5' IGLV and 3' IGLJ genes are used. A similar shift toward the use of more 5' IGKV and 3' IGKJ genes is observed later after antigen exposure in conventional pigs. The expression profile showed that most lambda(+) B cells are generated earlier, while kappa+ B cells develop from late precursors that already contain the lambda rearrangement. The initial lambda rearrangement is retained in both lambda(+) and kappa(+) B lymphocytes, and multiple lambda transcripts can be found in individual cells. The overall pool of the IGLV repertoire is therefore much larger and more diversified than for IGKV. The kappa repertoire is further restricted to the preferential use of only two major IGKV genes, reflecting the limitation for only two consecutive rearrangements. Tracing of silenced lambda transcripts in kappa(+) B cells further confirmed the unconventional mechanism of differential rearrangements in pigs. Our results underline the diversity of the immune system among mammals.

AB  - Floral gender in angiosperms often varies within and among populations. We conducted a field survey to test how predispersal seed predation affects sex allocation in an andromonoecious alpine herb Peucedanum multivittatum. We compared plant size, male and perfect flower production, fruit set, and seed predation rate over three years among nine populations inhabiting diverse snowmelt conditions in alpine meadows. Flowering period of individual populations varied from mid-July to late August reflecting the snowmelt time. Although perfect flower and fruit productions increased with plant size, size dependency of male flower production was less clear. The number of male flowers was larger in the early-flowering populations, while the number of perfect flowers increased in the late-flowering populations. Thus, male-biased sex allocation was common in the early-flowering populations. Fruit-set rates varied among populations and between years, irrespective of flowering period. Fruit-set success of individual plants increased with perfect flower number, but independent of male flower number. Seed predation by lepidopteran larvae was intense in the early-flowering populations, whereas predation damage was absent in the late-flowering populations, reflecting the extent of phenological matching between flowering time of host plants and oviposition period of predator moths. Seed predation rate was independent of male and perfect flower numbers of individual plants. Thus, seed predation is a stochastic event in each population. There was a clear correlation between the proportion of male flowers and the intensity of seed predation among populations. These results suggest that male-biased sex allocation could be a strategy to reduce seed predation damage but maintain the effort as a pollen donor under intensive seed predation.

AB  - Simple Summary Animal breeders are always interested in improving the economically important traits such as growth by selecting and breeding genetically superior animals. The Lohi sheep is one of Pakistan's most important meat type breeds as it significantly contributes to the country's total mutton production. To fulfil the higher demands of mutton production, there is a need to define optimum breeding strategies for improving growth in this breed. This study reported the moderate heritabilities for growth traits in Lohi sheep and significant influences of sex, year of birth and type of birth on these traits. The results might be useful for designing a breeding program for higher mutton production in Lohi sheep. Estimating genetic parameters for growth traits is crucial to plan breeding strategies for improving meat production in indigenous sheep breeds. The study first tested the effects of environmental and maternal effects on five growth traits, including birth weight (BWT), weight at 120 days (WT120), weight at 180 days (WT180), weight at 270 days (WT270) and weight at 365 days of age (WT365) and then estimated genetic parameters for these traits using data obtained in 1215 Lohi sheep. The effects of factors, including year (YOB), season (SOB) and type of birth (TOB), age of dam (AOD) and sex on growth traits of Lohi sheep, were examined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) in R software. Sex, TOB and YOB significantly affected all studied traits. The estimates of direct and maternal heritability for BWT and WT120 were 0.15 +/- 0.08 and 0.20 +/- 0.06, and 0.45 +/- 0.16, 0.21 +/- 0.08, respectively. The direct heritability estimates for WT180, WT270 and WT365 were 0.20 +/- 0.07, 0.21 +/- 0.07 and 0.19 +/- 0.08, respectively. Due to the high heritability estimate obtained for WT120 compared to other studied traits, and its strong genetic correlation (>0.9) with post-weaning growth traits, it is recommended that selection must be practiced on WT120 to improve the growth performance of Lohi sheep. The results could be used for the development of genetic/genomic selection programs aiming to improve the production performance of the Lohi sheep.

AB  - Aerobic metabolism underlies vital traits such as locomotion and thermogenesis, and aerobic capacity influences fitness in many animals. The heart is a key determinant of aerobic capacity, but the relative influence of cardiac output versus other steps in the O2 transport pathway remains contentious. In this Commentary, we consider this issue by examining the mechanistic basis for adaptive increases in aerobic capacity (thermogenic V O2,max; also called summit metabolism) in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) native to high altitude. Thermogenic V O2,max is increased by acclimation to cold hypoxia (simulating high-altitude conditions), and high-altitude populations generally have greater V O2,max than their low-altitude counterparts. This plastic and evolved variation in V O2,max is associated with corresponding variation in maximal cardiac output, along with variation in other traits across the O2 pathway (e.g. arterial O2 saturation, blood haemoglobin content and O2 affinity, tissue O2 extraction, tissue oxidative capacity). By applying fundamental principles of gas exchange, we show that the relative influence of cardiac output on V O2,max depends on the O2 diffusing capacity of thermogenic tissues (skeletal muscles and brown adipose tissues). Functional interactions between cardiac output and blood haemoglobin content determine circulatory O2 delivery and thus affect V O2,max, particularly in high-altitude environments where erythropoiesis can increase haematocrit and blood viscosity. There may also be functional linkages between cardiac output and tissue O2 diffusion due to the role of blood flow in determining capillary haematocrit and red blood cell flux. Therefore, the functional interactions between cardiac output and other traits in the O2 pathway underlie the adaptive evolution of aerobic capacities.

AB  - Purpose Bovine theileriosis, caused by Theileria annulata, presents a significant economic challenge to India's livestock industry. This study investigates the molecular epidemiology of T. annulata in bovine populations from Haryana, India, focusing on the genetic diversity of the Tams1 gene (785 bp). Methods The prevalence of T. annulata was evaluated in 800 blood samples using microscopy and PCR techniques, specifically targeting SSU rRNA and Tams1 genes. Genetic diversity among T. annulata isolates was analyzed through DNA sequencing and phylogenetic studies. Additionally, the impact of various risk factors on T. annulata infection was assessed. Results Microscopy revealed that 29.25% (117/400) of cattle and 2.75% (11/400) of buffalo were detected positive for Theileria spp. in Giemsa-stained blood smears. The Theileria genus-specific primers amplified a 1098 bp fragment of the SSU rRNA gene in 39.5% (158/400) cattle and 6% (24/400) buffalo. The T. annulata-specific PCR targeting the partial Tams1 gene revealed a prevalence rate of 37% (148/400) in cattle and 3.5% (14/400) in buffalo. A genetic analysis of the Tams1 gene in 389 sequences, including 14 T. annulata isolates from Haryana (8 from cattle, 6 from buffaloes), revealed significant variation within Indian T. annulata parasites. Analysis of Tams1 gene sequences (389 from 16 countries) revealed 35 haplotypes globally, with four identified from the 14 isolates sequenced in this study. Nucleotide homology among 14 northern Indian isolates ranged from 89.46-100%, compared to a broader range of 78.42-100% when global sequences were included. Among 35 haplotypes, Hap_1 is the most dominant and shows geographic clustering. Globally, low genetic distance (Fst < 0.15) and high gene flow (Nm > 1) were observed among the five populations (South Asia, East Asia, West Asia, Europe, and Africa), suggesting minimal genetic differentiation among T. annulata populations. Negative values in Tajima' s D (-1.21941) and Li's F (-2.97801) tests suggest recent population expansion. Risk factors such as age, sex, and host species are significantly associated with T. annulata infection. Conclusion This study offers comprehensive insights into T. annulata genetic diversity, population structure, and haplotype networks using the Tams1 gene.

AB  - Marine plastic abundance has increased over the past 60 years and microplastics (< 5 mm) constitute a primary component of such litter. Filter-feeding megafauna, such as the whale shark, might be particularly affected by microplastic pollution as their feeding mode requires filtration of up to thousands of cubic meters of water. In addition, the habitat range of whale sharks intersects with several recognized microplastic pollution hotspots, among which is the Coral Triangle. Direct evidence for microplastic ingestion in whale sharks however, has not yet been presented. Here we show that whale shark scat collected in the Philippines from 2012 to 2019 contained a mean of 2.8 microplastics g(- 1). Contrary to our expectations, the microplastic concentration in the scat remained consistent from 2012 to 2019. Water samples from the study site in 2019 indicated that the local microplastic pollution (5.83 particles m(- 3)) was higher than in surface waters in other whale shark habitats, but well below other pollution hot-spots found in Southeast Asia and China (range: 100-4100 particles m(- 3)). With the predicted growth in plastic use, leading to increased plastic marine pollution, whale sharks are expected to become more exposed to this form of pollution. To what extent microplastic ingestion impacts the overall health status of this endangered species remains an open question.

AB  - Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in livestock (cattle and farmed deer) is the focus of an in-progress eradication program in New Zealand. The program includes intensive brushtail possum population control as this species is a bTB host and could compromise eradication at a national level. Ten causal criteria (strength of association, experiment, temporality, plausible mechanism, biological gradient, consistency, coherence, specificity, analogy, validated causal predictions) were used to evaluate annual changes in bTB status in livestock herds relative to costs of possum population control and livestock bTB disease control. Hypotheses were evaluated using a model selection framework of the causal relationship between efforts (costs) and outcomes (bTB-infected herds) following management. The 10 causal criteria were demonstrated empirically. Experiments used designs from the simplest pretest-posttest comparison to a before-after-control-impact design, though lacked random allocation of treatments to experimental units and some studies lacked statistical analyses. As hypothesised, the annual changes in bTB-infected herds were positively related to annual costs. The predicted damped oscillations across years in annual changes in bTB-infected herds were observed. The implications are that eradication of livestock bTB appears likely, though there is a risk that eradication may not be achieved by 2026, unless annual control expenditure is higher and/or more efficient in the future.

AB  - Sexual variation in elephant feeding niche has been attributed to body size differences, primarily studied in areas with spatial overlap between females and males. We studied African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) foraging strategies in Makgadikgadi Pans National Park, Botswana, a population almost entirely composed of male elephants. In this context, we explored the influences of age and physical condition on the foraging strategy of males. We recorded feeding data by direct observation of different age classes and physical conditions. Younger males (10-20 years) exhibited more selective feeding behaviour (i.e., selected smaller branches, browsed for shorter periods and consumed fewer mouthfuls per feeding bout) than older males. Elephants with good physical condition exhibited a more selective feeding approach than elephants with poor physical condition. Age and physical condition did not affect the height at which they were feeding or the height of plants they were feeding on. The younger males (10-20 and 21-25 years) focused on feeding areas with their preferred species, while the oldest males selected areas that offered a high density of edible species. All-male elephant populations provide clearer insights into how males primarily adapt their individual foraging strategies to their size and physical condition.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions dominate food web links in terrestrial settings, thereby shaping ecosystem structure and functioning. Within a given plant, both primary and secondary metabolites mediate the interplay between above- and below-ground herbivores. Here, we investigate how root feeding by larvae of the turnip moth Agrotis segetum (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) affects development and feeding behavior of an above-ground sap-feeder i.e., the large cotton aphid Acyrthosiphon gossypii (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on cotton. We further draw upon transcriptomics, metabolomics and in-vitro bioassays to elucidate how plant metabolites mediate these interactions. Root feeding reduces A. gossypii adult survival and fecundity by 35.1%. Aphids on A. segetum-infested cotton spend 7% longer probing cells than on un-infested plants. Root and stem herbivory by A. segetum larvae alters gene transcripts and metabolites in leaves, inducing biosynthesis of three flavonoids i.e., dihydromyricetin, phloridzin and dihydroquercetin. In-vitro bioassays show that the latter two compounds markedly decrease A. gossypii adult survival and fecundity. Below-ground herbivory thus elicits biosynthesis and systemic translocation of phloridzin and dihydroquercetin, with antagonistic effects on above-ground sap-feeders. Our study sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of herbivore-triggered plant defenses in cotton and reveals the interplay between herbivore guilds across ecological realms. We discuss the implications of these findings for pest management.

AB  - DNA demethylase (DML) is involved in plant development and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses; however, its role in plant-herbivore interaction remains elusive. Here, we found that herbivory by the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella, rapidly induced the genome-wide DNA methylation and accumulation of DML gene transcripts in potato plants. Herbivory induction of DML transcripts was suppressed in jasmonate-deficient plants, whereas exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) improved DML transcripts, indicating that the induction of DML transcripts by herbivory is associated with jasmonate signaling. Moreover, P. operculella larvae grew heavier on DML gene (StDML2) knockdown plants than on wild-type plants, and the decreased biosynthesis of jasmonates in the former may be responsible for this difference, since the larvae feeding on these two genotypes supplemented with MeJA showed similar growth. In addition, P. operculella adult moths preferred to oviposit on StDML2 knockdown plants than on wild-type plants, which was associated with the reduced emission of beta-caryophyllene in the former. In addition, supplementing beta-caryophyllene to these two genotypes further disrupted moths' oviposit choice preference for them. Interestingly, in StDML2 knockdown plants, hypermethylation was found at the promoter regions for the key genes StAOS and StAOC in the jasmonate biosynthetic pathway, as well as for the key gene StTPS12 in beta-caryophyllene production. Our findings suggest that knocking down StDML2 can affect herbivore defense via jasmonate signaling and defense compound production in potato plants.
   The DNA demethylase gene StDML2 is involved in potato plant's herbivore defense response via affecting jasmonate signaling and defense compound production in plants.

AB  - PurposeDairy farming is accountable for increased greenhouse gas emissions. Life cycle analysis constitutes a valuable tool determining the primary factors that increase carbon footprint and other important environmental indicators, under the prism of developing methods to reduce the environmental impact of the farms. The purpose of this study was to measure and evaluate the carbon footprint of raw milk production of sheep farming in Western Macedonia, Greece, for the first time, along with the environmental performance of the farming systems.MethodsTo achieve this goal, data on inputs and outputs were collected from 10 semi-intensive and 3 intensive farming systems of the Regional Units of Florina and Kozani. Data were collected using specifically configured questionnaires, which included questions concerning the amounts of fossil fuels, water, feed, electricity used in a year, as well as farm demographics and outputs. Life cycle analysis was carried out using the SimaPro 9.4.0.2 software.ResultsAccording to the results, the average carbon footprint of semi-intensive dairy sheep farming in Western Macedonia was 3.41 kg of CO2-eq/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk, while the corresponding value for intensive sheep farming was 3.58 kg of CO2-eq/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk. The results also indicate that in intensive systems, higher milk production is not consistent with a larger environmental footprint compared to semi-intensive farming systems. The use of soybean and maize for animal feed, along with emissions from enteric fermentation, is the main hotspots in milk production process.ConclusionsThe above findings can contribute to drawing conclusions concerning the management of the production hotspots, in an attempt to reduce the carbon footprint of the farms and propose a more sustainable plan for rearing animals.

AB  - SCARB1 belongs to class B of Scavenger receptors (SRs) that are known to be involved in binding and endocytosis of various pathogens. SRs have emerging role in regulating innate immunity and host-pathogen interactions by acting in co-ordination with Toll-like receptors.Query Little is known about the function of SCARB1 in milk-derived mammary epithelial cells (MECs). This study reports the role of SCARB1 in infection and its potential association in TLR4 signaling on bacterial challenge in Goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). The novelty in the establishment of MEC culture lies in the method that aims to enhance the viability of the cells with intact characteristics upto a higher passage number. We represent MEC culture to be used as a potential infection model for deeper understanding of animal physiology especially around the mammary gland. On E.coli challenge the expression of SCARB1 was significant in induced GMECs at 6 h. Endoribonuclease-esiRNA based silencing of SCARB1 affects the expression of TLR4 and its pathways i.e. MyD88 and TRIF pathways on infection. Knockdown also affected the endocytosis of E.coli in GMECs demonstrating that E.coli uses SCARB1 function to gain entry in cells. Furthermore, we predict 3 unique protein structures of uncharacterized SCARB1 (Capra hircus) protein. Overall, we highlight SCARB1 as a main participant in host defence and its function in antibacterial advances to check mammary gland infections.

AB  - PurposeThe purpose of using circularity indicators is to show the effect of changes from linear to more circular systems. This paper contributes to highlighting the importance of methodological aspects of circularity indicators in the agricultural sector when using a life cycle thinking approach. Selected circularity indicators have been explored and compared with LCA impact categories by using them to evaluate the circularity of a livestock system.MethodsCircularity indicators were tested on a theoretical pig production system where several circularity strategies and associated mitigation actions were applied. The strategies and mitigation actions were as follows: anaerobic digestion of manure (closing resource loops), anaerobic digestion of bread waste (closing resource loops), precision fertilization (narrowing resource loops), use of cover crops in feed production (regenerating resource flows), and use of bread waste as feed (slowing resource loops). The functional unit was 1 kg pork as carcass weight, and the treatment of 1.1 kg bread waste for all impact categories and indicators. For each mitigation action, relevant circularity indicators were tested. Based on this, the functionality and suitability of these indicators were discussed.Results and discussionFour of the circularity indicators were based on nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) substances: N recycling index, partial N balance, consumption of fossil-P fertilizers, and emissions to water bodies (P). Even if the indicators do not capture the impact of emissions of N and P as the eutrophication impact categories, they provide a useful indication of the circularity of a system. The other three circularity indicators tested were as follows: renewable energy production, soil organic carbon, and land use ratio. The renewable energy production indicator is easy to understand and communicate and provides unique information. Soil organic carbon presents a potential for soil carbon sequestration. Land use ratio is based on the same data as land occupation but provides an assessment of whether feed production competes for the suitable area for food production by including production of human-digestible protein.ConclusionsCircularity indicators provide valuable information about the circularity of an agricultural product system. The circularity indicators and LCA impact categories can be used either separately or together, or to complement each other. The choice of indicators depends on the questions raised, i.e., goals and scope, and it is therefore important to have a number of circular indicators to choose from in order to achieve a comprehensive assessment.

AB  - Disturbances at the conceptus-maternal interface can have detrimental effects on pregnancy outcome. Additionally, changes in body condition and exogenously administered gonadotropins could affect ovarian and uterine function, including cell proliferation and ovulation rates, and alter endometrial receptivity. In ruminants, endometrial caruncles maintain placental function via interaction with fetal chorionic cotyledons. Here, the effects of feeding regimens on the expression of selected genes known to be involved in uterine receptivity were investigated in the caruncles of control and FSH-superovulated ewes. Sheep were grouped according to their diet: control fed (CF), overfed (OF) or underfed (UF), and were either superovulated with FSH (SOV) or untreated (CON, naturally cycling) (n 1/4 3e5/group). Caruncular samples for the assessment of the transcript levels of 11 target genes were collected at either the early (day 5) or mid-luteal (day 10) phases of the luteal lifespan, resulting in 12 groups of animals. The day of the estrous cycle affected the expression of ITGAV, ITGB3, FGF10 and IGFBP3 mRNA. There was lower expression of MUC1, and higher expression of FGF10, ITGB3 and FN1, on day 10 in CF_SOV animals. Compared with CF, expression of integrins (ITGB3, ITGA5 and ITGA4) was higher in OF and UF, and higher transcript levels of HGF and IGFBP3 in UF animals on day 10. Expression of ITGA5, ITGB1, -3, -5 and MUC1 was greater in OF_SOV than CF_SOV at day 10. In conclusion, it appears that imbalanced nutrition, by altering the expression of genes responsible for intercellular communication, cell adhesion, and encoding for growth factors, could affect the uterine responsiveness to exogenously applied hormonal stimulation and, likely, uterine receptivity.

AB  - Purpose Biogas slurry (BS) is widely used as a valuable fertilizer for crop production. However, little is known about the effects of long-term BS application on potential pollution risk of heavy metals and bacterial community in paddy field. This study aimed to determine the accumulation and rice plant uptake of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu, and Zn), as well as soil bacterial community composition following repeated BS application in a single rice cropping system. Materials and methods In this study, four treatments were included in a long-term field experiment: CK, no fertilizers; MF, mineral fertilizers, 270 kg urea-N ha(-1); and two application rates of BS (BS1, 270 kg N ha(-1) and BS2, 540 kg N ha(-1)). The heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu, and Zn) in soils and rice plants were measured by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer and the soil bacterial community composition was analyzed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S rRNA. Results and discussion Soil Zn concentrations were significantly greater in the BS treatments than in the MF treatment. Biogas slurry application significantly increased the heavy metals concentrations in rice plants, compared to the CK treatment. The concentrations of Cd and Pb in grain, and Cu and Zn concentrations in straw were significantly increased by the BS2 treatment compared to the MF treatment, respectively. However, the Cd, Cr, Pb, Cu, and Zn concentrations in grain and soil were all within the safety limits after long-term BS application. Application of BS and of MF resulted in similar bacterial alpha-diversities, and both increased them compared to the CK treatment. Fertilization significantly enhanced the relative abundances of phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Myxococcota but reduced that of Planctomycetota compared to the CK. While, there were no significant differences in those phyla among fertilized treatments. The relative abundances of genera Thiobacillus and Ellin6067 was decreased by the BS2 treatment compared to the MF treatment. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil organic carbon, available phosphorus and available potassium were the main factors shaping soil bacterial community composition. Spearman's correlation demonstrated that soil Cd concentration had stronger correlation with some bacterial genera of Bryobacter, Vicinamibacteraceae, and Ellin6067. Conclusions Overall, we conclude that BS application can be considered to substitute mineral fertilizers for rice production. However, the accumulation of heavy metals in paddy soil, especially for Zn, should be considered after long-term BS application.

AB  - Livestock manure is widely applied onto agriculture soil to fertilize crops and increase soil fertility. However, it is difficult to provide real-time manure nutrient data based on traditional lab analyses during application. Manure sensing using near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an innovative, rapid, and cost-effective technique for inline analysis of animal manure. This study investigated a NIR sensing system with reflectance and transflectance modes to predict N speciation in dairy cow manure using a spiking method. In this study, 20 dairy cow manure samples were collected and spiked to achieve four levels of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH4-N) and organic nitrogen (Org-N) concentrations that resulted in 100 samples in each spiking group. All samples were scanned and analyzed using a NIR system with reflectance and transflectance sensor configurations. NIR calibration models were developed using partial least square regression analysis for NH4-N, Org-N, total solid (TS), ash, and particle size (PS). Coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were selected to evaluate the models. A transflectance probe with a 1 mm path length had the best performance for analyzing manure constituents among three path lengths. Reflectance mode improved the calibration accuracy for NH4-N and Org-N, whereas transflectance mode improved the model predictability for TS, ash, and PS. Reflectance provided good prediction for NH4-N (R-2 = 0.83; RMSE = 0.65 mg mL(-1)) and approximate predictions for Org-N (R-2 = 0.66; RMSE = 1.18 mg mL(-1)). Transflectance was excellent for TS predictions (R-2 = 0.97), and provided good quantitative predictions for ash and approximate predictions for PS. The correlations between the accuracy of NH4-N and Org-N calibration models and other manure parameters were not observed indicating the predictions of N contents were not affected by TS, ash, and PS.

AB  - Farming sectors' resilience has been built over decades with the aid of policies and institutions. However, its actual standing can be assessed in times of crises when farms have to overcome particular challenges. We use a large-scale farming sectors dataset FADN spanning 2006-2015 in which two major economic crises occurred-the global economic crisis of 2008 and the Russian embargo of 2014-to exemplify our approach to resilience's assessment based on the Polish farming sectors. We introduce a distinction between "potential resilience" versus "revealed resilience" where the former is assessed based on resilience capacities (robustness, adaptability and transformability), while the latter is assessed based on the observed decomposition of total factor productivity (TFP) changes in response to the adverse economic shocks. Hence, the proposed framework directly links productivity with the two types of resilience. We applied the Fare-Primont method of TFP decomposition, into technological change and various types of efficiency changes and a detailed farm survey to distinguish between the drivers of technological changes in each farming sector such as specific innovations and ecosystem services. Our findings show that farms differ in their revealed resilience both among the sectors and between two different shock events. Only field crop farms and granivores farms (pig and poultry) maintained their resilience to both crises, staying robust and/or adaptable. The former had the most productive technology and were leaders in applying innovations while the latter were second best in innovations and fairly good in their application of ecosystem-based services into their technology. Other farm types failed to be resilient to the first crisis but proved robust during the second. The outcomes of the study have implications for sustainability oriented policies.

AB  - Glutamate has been widely used in the feed industry to promote animal growth and enhance meat quality. However, its application in crustacean aquaculture remains relatively underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate a correlation between plasma glutamate increased the total hemocyte counts in shrimp within two hours, an effect that was reversed by co-injection with a Grik2 inhibitor. Subsequent feeding trials showed that incorporating 0.25 % glutamate into shrimp diets significantly raised the glutamate concentration in muscle tissue, resulting in a 7 % increase in glutamate content. Moreover, feeding experiments combined with differential transcriptome analysis revealed that shrimp fed a diet supplemented with 0.25 % glutamate exhibited enhanced resistance to Vibrio infections, likely through the upregulation of immune-related genes. These findings suggest that glutamate not only improves the anti-Vibrio defenses of shrimp but also enhances their flavor profile. Therefore, glutamate could serve as a beneficial feed supplement to promote disease resistance in shrimp aquaculture.

AB  - The objective of the study was to characterize the adaptive profile of Ibero-American sheep of the Canaria breed, evaluating the possible changes in thermoregulatory responses and coat characteristics to which the animals are exposed in the different seasons of the year. Data collected over a period of 12 months were analyzed, with information being observed in the interval of 15 days of each month, in 23 adult ewes kept in an intensive breeding system. The rectal temperature (RT) of Canaria ewes was higher (P < 0.001) in the summer and spring seasons. In contrast, the respiratory rate (RR) of the animals was higher in autumn. The surface temperature (ST) of the herd was lower during the spring. It was observed that the hair length (HL) and the hair density (NH) did not vary during the seasons. However, the hair diameter (HD) and the coat thickness (CT) varied, being in the spring, the season in which the animals had the highest HD and autumn, the season in which they had the lowest. The performance was similar throughout the seasons (P > 0.05). The morphological variables of the coat presented 63.8% of original cases grouped, which may characterize the morphological responses of the coat of these animals as an important trait of the adaptive profile of the breed, whereas the opposite occurred for thermoregulatory responses. The variables most used by the herd and that were most important were autumn (CT, NH, HD, HR, RT, and HL), summer (ST and RR), spring (RR, ST, and RT), and winter (RT, HD, HR, and RR). Sheep of the Canaria breed have an adaptive profile that dynamically uses thermoregulatory and morphological responses, molding themselves according to climate changes resulting from seasonal periods on the Island of Tenerife, Spain. The Canaria sheep stood out for the modification of the morphological characteristics of the coat, especially during autumn and spring, and can be considered an excellent genetic resource with excellent adaptive characteristics for arid environments such as those found in the Canary Islands.

AB  - Based on the random encounter model, the population densities of species that are potentially prey or competitor to the leopard (Panthera pardus) were estimated in Hyrcan National Park, Azerbaijan. Data obtained from 18 camera traps were processed, 11 of which were installed in the southern part of the park, and seven of which are in the northern part. The total operating time of the cameras amounted to 3950 traps per day for the period from April 2018 to December 2019. A very high wild boar population density was revealed in the southern part of the park (32.5 ind./1000 ha). On the contrary, no roe deer were recorded in the southern part, while it had a rather low density in the northern part (4.4 ind./1000 ha). The population densities of the golden jackal (0.6 ind./1000 ha), the gray wolf (0.1 ind./1000 ha), the jungle cat (6.7 ind./1000 ha), and the raccoon (46.9 ind./1000 ha ) ranged within the normal limits characteristic of similar populations in other parts of their global distribution. The population densities of the Indian porcupine (9.7 ind./1000 ha) and the brown bear (0.4 ind./1000 ha) seem to have also corresponded to the mountain forest conditions of the study area. From the view point of food supply, the territory of the Hyrcan National Park is quite suitable for permanently supporting 3-4 leopard individuals.

AB  - Many publications make use of opportunistic data, such as citizen science observation data, to infer large-scale properties of species' distributions. However, the few publications that use opportunistic citizen science data to study animal ecology at a habitat level do so without accounting for spatial biases in opportunistic records or using methods that are difficult to generalize. In this study, we explore the biases that exist in opportunistic observations and suggest an approach to correct for them. We first examined the extent of the biases in opportunistic citizen science observations of three wild ungulate species in Norway by comparing them to data from GPS telemetry. We then quantified the extent of the biases by specifying a model of the biases. From the bias model, we sampled available locations within the species' home range. Along with opportunistic observations, we used the corrected availability locations to estimate a resource selection function (RSF). We tested this method with simulations and empirical datasets for the three species. We compared the results of our correction method to RSFs obtained using opportunistic observations without correction and to RSFs using GPS-telemetry data. Finally, we compared habitat suitability maps obtained using each of these models. Opportunistic observations are more affected by human access and visibility than locations derived from GPS telemetry. This has consequences for drawing inferences about species' ecology. Models naively using opportunistic observations in habitat-use studies can result in spurious inferences. However, sampling availability locations based on the spatial biases in opportunistic data improves the estimation of the species' RSFs and predicted habitat suitability maps in some cases. This study highlights the challenges and opportunities of using opportunistic observations in habitat-use studies. While our method is not foolproof it is a first step toward unlocking the potential of opportunistic citizen science data for habitat-use studies.

AB  - A first hand study on guild structure of fish species (n = 148) in Ashtamudi Estuary, a Ramsar Site of Interna-tional importance, was carried out from May 2019 to April 2020 based on temporal (monsoon, pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons) and spatial (upper, middle and lower zones) data. Guild composition consisted of eight estuarine use guilds (marine estuarine opportunist, marine estuarine dependent, estuarine resident species, anadromous species, freshwater migrants, freshwater stragglers, catadromous and marine stragglers) and eight feeding guilds (zooplanktivore, zoobenthivore, carnivores, herbivores, invertebrate feeders, omnivores, detritus feeders and piscivores). The most dominant estuarine use guilds comprised of marine migrants (marine estuarine opportunist and marine estuarine dependent), whereas carnivore, omnivore and zooplanktivore formed the dominant feeding guilds in Ashtamudi Estuary. The species diversity decreased from upper to lower zone and was highest during the post-monsoon period. The present study has seen a decrease in estuarine resident and freshwater species due to reduced freshwater inflow, saltwater intrusion, unsustainable fishing and inadequate environmental management practices. Hence, we propose a management framework to improve the ecosystem of Ashtamudi Estuary with a special focus on its fish species and their estuarine use.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that nutrition plays a crucial part in improving the reproductive potential of farm animals; however, there is currently no research on the transcription and expression profiling of genes in yaks under different feeding conditions. Therefore, this research was planned to compare the transcription and expression profiles of TEX11, ESR alpha, and BOLL in yaks under natural grazing with concentrate supplementation (NG + CS) and NG without concentrate supplementation. The transcription and expressional levels of TEX11, ESR alpha, and BOLL mRNA were explored from the testes of yaks using qPCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunochemistry. The results of the qPCR illustrated that the transcription levels of TEX11, ESR alpha, and BOLL were upregulated in the NG + CS group compared to those in the NG group. Moreover, the results of the immunochemistry and immunofluorescence showed that the expression of TEX11, ESRa, and BOLL proteins increased after concentrate supplementation. Meanwhile, ESR a protein levels were lower in the testes and epididymides of yaks in the NG group than in those in the NG + CS group. Similarly, BOLL protein expression was higher in the testes and epididymides of the NG + CS group, but its expression was lower in the epididymides of the NG group. Furthermore, Western blotting showed that the molecular weights of ESR alpha and BOLL proteins were 64 kDa and 31 kDa, respectively. Finally, in the conclusion we summarize how a proper level of dietary energy supplementation can improve the reproductive potential of yaks by upregulating genes related to reproduction.

AB  - Objectives. To assess A-kinase anchor protein 95 (AKAP95), B-Raf, extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), and Elk-1 expression in colon cancer tissue, and characterize AKAP95 associations with B-Raf, ERK1/2, Elk-1, and colon cancer clinicopathological indices. Methods. The immunohistochemistry streptavidin-perosidase (SP) method was used to determine protein expression levels in 64 colon cancer and 32 para-carcinoma tissue specimens. Results. (1) Positive AKAP95 expression rates in colon cancer tissue were higher when compared with para-carcinoma tissue (92.19% vs. 59.38%, P < 0.05). Similar findings were determined for B-Raf (76.56% vs. 25%, P < 0.05), ERK1/2 (90.63% vs. 31.25%, P < 0.05), and Elk-1 levels (92.19% vs. 40.63%, P < 0.05). (2) No significant associations were identified between AKAP95, B-Raf, ERK1/2, and Elk-1 protein expression and degree of differentiation, histological type, and lymph node metastasis in colon cancer samples (P > 0.05); however, in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, AKAP95 was closely related to immune infiltration, and highly expressed AKAP95 was negatively associated with overall survival and relapse free survival rates in colon cancer patients. (3) Correlations were observed between AKAP95 and ERK1/2, AKAP95 and Elk-1, B-Raf and ERK1/2, B-Raf and Elk-1, and ERK1/2 and Elk-1 (all P < 0.05), but no correlation was observed between AKAP95 and B-Raf (P > 0.05). Conclusions. AKAP95 may affect immune infiltration levels in colon cancer by participating in ERK1/2-Elk-1 signal transduction.

AB  - This study determined the effects of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) supplementation on the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, nitrogen (N) utilisation and plasma amino acid profiles of Liaoning cashmere goats during cashmere fibre growth. Twenty-four yearling male cashmere goats (body weight: 35.41 +/- 1.13 kg) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: a corn-soybean meal basal diet deficient in methionine (negative control, NC) and a basal diet supplemented with 1, 2 and 3 g/kg of RPM. The RPM supplementation quadratically increased the average daily gain (ADG) and decreased the feed to gain ratio (p = 0.001) without affecting the final body weight and dry matter intake. In particular, compared to NC, 2 g/kg RPM supplementation increased the ADG by 35 g/d (p < 0.001) and resulted in the lowest feed to gain ratio (p < 0.001). RPM increased the apparent total tract digestibility of N and decreased the faecal N levels, both in a linear fashion (p = 0.005). Urinary N levels did not have an effect, but the N retention levels increased linearly with PRM (p = 0.032). Moreover, the RPM decreased the plasma urea N levels (p < 0.001) and increased the plasma Met levels quadratically (p < 0.001). In conclusion, RPM supplementation in the diet of cashmere goats can enhance the utilisation of N and improve ADG during the cashmere fibre growing period, and 2 g/kg of RPM in the diet is suggested.

AB  - Simple Summary The changing climate, particularly the temperature increase, can affect both herbivorous insects and plants. Aphids, being poikilothermal organisms, are directly exposed to an increase in temperature that, in turn, affects their biology. An increase in temperature can also indirectly affect aphids by changing the quality of the host plant tissues. This work focused on investigating the effects of climate change on plant-insect interaction. In particular, it was analyzed how an increase in ambient temperature can affect the condition of Macrosiphum rosae and its host Rosa rugosa, and how it correlates with the activity of oxidative stress-related enzymes (SOD, CAT, POD, beta-glucosidase, GST, and PPO) both in insect and plant tissues. Thermal stress ranging from 25 to 28 degrees C has a significant impact on M. rosae-R. rugosa interaction, affecting aphid fitness and the activity of enzymes related to oxidative stress in both insect and plant. Thermal stress in living organisms causes an imbalance between the processes of creating and neutralizing reactive oxygen species (ROS). The work aims to explain changes in the aphid-host plant interaction due to an increase in temperature. Tests were carried out at three constant temperatures (20, 25, or 28 degrees C). Firstly, changes in development of Macrosiphum rosae were determined. Secondly, the activity of enzymatic markers (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST), beta-glucosidase, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), and peroxidase (POD)) in aphid M. rosae tissues and host plant were analyzed at all temperatures. An increase in temperature to 28 degrees C had a negative effect on the biology of M. rosae by shortening the period of reproduction and longevity, thus reducing the demographic parameters and fecundity. Two stages of the aphid's defensive response to short-term (24-96 h) and long-term (2 weeks) thermal stress were observed. Aphid defense responses varied considerably with temperature and were highest at 28 degrees C. In turn, for the plants, which were exposed to both abiotic stress caused by elevated temperature and biotic stress caused by aphid feeding, their enzymatic defense was more effective at 20 degrees C, when enzyme activities at their highest were observed.

AB  - The success of market-based mechanisms in reducing conflicts and internalizing externalities depends on their ability to clarify property rights amongst heterogenous resource users. We investigate the effectiveness of novel markets in achieving their goals using the case study of grazing markets in Laikipia County, Kenya. In this system, sheep- and goat (shoat)- and cattle-rearing pastoralists negotiate land access for cattle with neighboring cattle ranchers. Using data on pastoralists' livestock and contracting preferences and a model of pastoral herd management, we show that contracting for cattle grazing access on private property alters relative input shadow prices for grazing resources in communal pastoral lands, ultimately resulting in relieved cattle grazing pressure. However, the permitting process is less attractive to pastoralists who prefer rearing shoats instead of cattle. These shoat-rearing pastoralists instead fill some of the vacated space with shoats instead of purchasing permits themselves. This leakage offsets some of the conservation benefits arising from the contracting program and results in a greater share of shoats in the communal herd mix. Approximately 0.59 cows' worth of free space persists on the commons per permit sold, indicating reduced grazing pressure, but this represents a small proportion (3.8%) of the total livestock in the system. The narrow introduction of the cattle-focused permit market and lack of strong management institutions on the commons dampen the permitting program's conservation benefits, necessitating further interventions. Alleviating these factors and dramatically scaling up the program has the potential to turn the permitting system into a successful conservation tool.

AB  - The Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) is the most important livestock animal in arid and semi-arid regions and provides basic necessities to millions of people. In the current context of climate change, there is renewed interest in the mechanisms that enable camelids to survive in arid conditions. Recent investigations described genomic signatures revealing evolutionary adaptations to desert environments. We now present a comprehensive catalogue of the transcriptomes and proteomes of the dromedary kidney and describe how gene expression is modulated as a consequence of chronic dehydration and acute rehydration. Our analyses suggested an enrichment of the cholesterol biosynthetic process and an overrepresentation of categories related to ion transport. Thus, we further validated differentially expressed genes with known roles in water conservation which are affected by changes in cholesterol levels. Our datasets suggest that suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis may facilitate water retention in the kidney by indirectly facilitating the AQP2-mediated water reabsorption. Fernando Alvira-Iraizoz and Benjamin T. Gillard et al. comprehensively catalogue the kidney transcriptome and proteome of dromedary camels in response to chronic dehydration stress and subsequent acute rehydration. Their results suggest that the suppression of the cholesterol biosynthesis may facilitate water retention in the dromedary camel kidney, providing further insight into how these animals survive in arid conditions.

AB  - Socially affected traits in pigs are controlled by direct genetic effects and social genetic effects, which can make elucidation of their genetic architecture challenging. We evaluated the genetic basis of direct genetic effects and social genetic effects by combining single-locus and haplotype-based GWAS on imputed whole-genome sequences. Nineteen SNPs and 25 haplotype loci are identified for direct genetic effects on four traits: average daily feed intake, average daily gain, days to 100kg and time in feeder per day. Nineteen SNPs and 11 haplotype loci are identified for social genetic effects on average daily feed intake, average daily gain, days to 100kg and feeding speed. Two significant SNPs from single-locus GWAS (SSC6:18,635,874 and SSC6:18,635,895) are shared by a significant haplotype locus with haplotype alleles 'GGG' for both direct genetic effects and social genetic effects in average daily feed intake. A candidate gene, MT3, which is involved in growth, nervous, and immune processes, is identified. We demonstrate the genetic differences between direct genetic effects and social genetic effects and provide an anchor for investigating the genetic architecture underlying direct genetic effects and social genetic effects on socially affected traits in pigs. Pingxian Wu and Kai Wang et al. perform single-locus and haplotype-based GWAS in Yorkshire pigs to evaluate genetic factors involved in socially affected traits, like feed intake and weight gain. These results indicate several genetic factors that may ultimately be targeted to improve livestock breeding.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is a vital element of life, which has an important impact on the growth, development, production performance and stress-tolerance of animals. However, it is not entirely clear that how exactly Se works during these processes. Herein, we investigate the role of Se in regulating the functions of goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) under heat-stress condition. We found that heat stress caused ferroptosis-like death in GMECs, manifested by a robust increase in iron ion concentration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death ratio, and a decrease in the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and expression level of glutathione peroxidases 4 (GPX4). Se incubation had no obvious effect on GMEC viability, but alleviated heat-stress-induced ferroptosis-like cell death and improved GPX4 expression and SOD activity in a dose-dependent manner. Also, we found that overexpression of GPX4 could improve the activity of SOD. And Se incubation inhibited activation of mTOR signaling in heat-stress-induced GMECs, which could be eliminated by the mTOR activator MHY1485, and treatment with mTOR inhibitor AY-22989 had the same effect as Se. In conclusion, Se improves GPX4 expression and SOD activity and inhibits the activation of mTOR to alleviate heat-stress-induced ferroptosis-like death in GMECs, which may be a protective agent for heat stress in goats.

AB  - The complement system, composed of complement components and complement control proteins, plays an essential role in innate immunity. Complement system molecules are expressed at the maternal-conceptus interface, and inappropriate activation of the complement system is associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans and rodents. However, the expression, regulation, and function of the complement system at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs have not been studied. In this study, we investigated the expression, localization, and regulation of complement system molecules at the maternal-conceptus interface in pigs. Complement components and complement control proteins were expressed in the endometrium, early-stage conceptus, and chorioallantoic tissues during pregnancy. The expression of complement components acting on the early stage of complement activation increased in the endometrium on Day 15 of pregnancy, with greater levels on that day compared with the estrous cycle. Localization of several complement components and complement control proteins was cell-type specific in the endometrium. The expression of C1QC, C2, C3, C4A, CFI, ITGB2, MASP1, and SERPING1 was increased by IFNG in endometrial explant tissues. Furthermore, cleaved C3 fragments were detected in endometrial tissues and uterine flushings on Day 15 of the estrous cycle and Day 15 of pregnancy, with greater levels on Day 15 of pregnancy. These results suggest that complement system molecules in pigs expressed at the maternal-conceptus interface play important roles in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy by regulating innate immunity and modulating the maternal immune environment during pregnancy.

AB  - The current agricultural system is in search of new strategies to achieve a more sustainable production while keeping or even increasing crop yield and quality. In this scenario, the application of biostimulants constitutes a potent solution. In the current study, the impact of a blue-green microalgal extract (MB) and a pig tissue hydrolysate (PTH) on rapeseed plants' development was characterized. Obtained results revealed a positive effect on yield parameters of plants treated with MB and, especially, PTH; this was associated to an improvement on the photosynthetic performance. Moreover, this study remarked the effects of biostimulants on plant phenology through their pivotal role in modulating developmental processes. More specifically, proteomic, metabolomic, and hormone content analyses revealed distinct alterations associated with the acceleration of phenology induced by biostimulant application. Additionally, some antioxidant enzymes and stress-related compounds were up-regulated upon MB and PTH treatments, indicating enhanced plant defense mechanisms in response to accelerated phenological transitions. Such findings highlight the intricate interplay between biostimulants and plant physiology, wherein biostimulants orchestrate rapid developmental changes, ultimately influencing growth dynamics. Altogether, the current study reveals that the application of both MB and PTH biostimulants promoted rapeseed plant phenology and productivity associated with an improvement in the photosynthetic machinery while boosting other physiological and molecular mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of iron deficiency has posed significant public health risks. Animal-derived collagen peptides have been recognized for their potent metal ion-chelating capabilities, which can greatly enhance the bioavailability of iron. Yak skins, typically discarded during production and processing, serve as a valuable resource. Based on yak skin collagen peptide (YSP), we have developed a novel iron-chelating peptide: yak skin collagen iron-chelating peptide (YSP-Fe).
   RESULTS: The maximum level of iron chelation of YSP-Fe achieved was 42.72 +/- 0.65 mg g(-1). Structural analysis indicated that YSP-Fe was primarily formed from amino, carboxyl and carbonyl groups combined with ferrous ions. Through examination of the amino acid composition, molecular docking and peptide sequence identification, it was determined that Gly, Asp and Arg played crucial roles in the chelation of ferrous ions by YSP. Furthermore, YSP-Fe was more stable in simulated gastrointestinal digestion compared to FeSO4.
   CONCLUSION: YSP-Fe demonstrated dual benefits of iron supplementation and antioxidant effects. These significant findings provide a foundation for the development of novel iron supplements and the effective utilization of yak skin as a valuable resource. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - The Southern Ocean (SO) is known for its atypical bio-optical regime. This complicates the interpretation of proxies measured from satellite and in situ platforms equipped with optical sensors, which occupy an important niche for monitoring the vast and remote SO. A ship-based field study in concert with time series observations from BioGeoChemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) profiling floats were used to investigate spatial and temporal variations in bio-optical relationships in the open ocean waters surrounding the Kerguelen Plateau in the Indian sector of the SO. Compared to other regions with similar chlorophyll concentrations, chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption in the blue waveband presented a consistent negative anomaly. The anomaly was uniform over deep mixed layers and correlated with phytoplankton size, photoacclimation and atypically high concentrations of fucoxanthin. The BGC-Argo observation-based proxies revealed that the blue absorption anomaly increased with chlorophyll concentration both spatially and temporally and, while particularly pronounced in the naturally iron-fertilized waters, was also found in the High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll region. While phytoplankton size was an important driver of the anomaly, photoacclimation associated with self-shading of phytoplankton cells was also involved during intense booms. The backscattering coefficient exhibited negative and positive anomalies in the low and high biomass regimes, respectively. The large positive anomaly in high biomass regimes was attributed to the variable non-algal particles characteristics associated with a relatively high production of bloom by-products. With clear understanding of the bio-optical anomalies, BGC-Argo floats stand as unique tools for monitoring the bio-optical spatio-temporal complexity of the SO.
   The Southern Ocean (SO) plays a key role in Earth's climate. However, its remoteness and harsh climate necessitate remote sensing approaches such as optical sensors on profiling floats and satellites. These require optical measurements and shipboard samples to relate optical signals to biological properties, called optical proxies. The SO optical proxies have been found to be very different from those measured in other oceanic regions. Here the proxies in the Kerguelen region are investigated along a ship's track crossing from subtropical to subpolar latitudes. The Kerguelen Plateau impedes both wind and currents such that deep waters upwell to the surface providing nutrients to primary producers. This region in the Indian sector of the SO provides a tremendous range in ecosystem properties from nutrient-starved to nutrient-rich, making these results applicable to other SO areas. The authors find that the differences in optical proxies can be explained by the presence of different phytoplankton communities and their responses to being mixed to depths where light is limited. This explains why the proxies vary so significantly across this region and change over the seasons. This knowledge makes the observations obtained by floats and satellites invaluable for understanding the entire SO.
   Contribution by large diatoms and photoacclimation are major drivers of a negative anomaly in the blue chlorophyll-specific phytoplankton absorption coefficientBioGeoChemical-Argo observations indicate a bio-optical anomaly exists over the entire year with maximal values associated with seasonal bloomsThe Indian Southern Ocean shows a large seasonal and regional variability in bio-optical regimes that lie outside the global means

AB  - IntroductionAs anthropogenic change alters and fragments habitats, it is apparent that evolutionary change can co-occur with ecological change, though the scale and consequences of this contemporary evolution remain unclear. In coastal salt marshes of eastern North America, the flood tolerant low elevation marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora), is displacing Spartina patens, the flood intolerant high elevation marsh grass. Rising seas restrict S. patens, once occupying large areas of many hectares, to increasingly small patches, some as small as a few square meters. MethodsUsing nine microsatellite loci, we examined the genetic diversity and population structure of Tumidagena minuta, a minute, flightless planthopper and specialist herbivore of S. patens. We sampled T. minuta from S. patens habitat patches of varying radius (3-82 meters) and distances (54-1,100 meters) to test how landscape variation affects population genetic parameters associated with microevolutionary processes. We sampled and genotyped 142 T. minuta individuals across six S. patens patches in a single marsh in New Jersey, USA. ResultsWe observed high polymorphism, observing between 7 and 28 alleles per locus and an average of 13.3 alleles per locus. We observed no genetic differentiation among sampled patches (R-ST = -0.0109). The contemporary genetic effective population size (N-e) was estimated at approximately 360 (95% confidence interval: 208-1325) based on two-locus linkage disequilibrium. Based on an estimate of N(e)m = 32.4 in the finite island model, the estimated gene flow rate among these patches was 0.09 migrants per generation. DiscussionThese estimates, which are rarely produced for non-model insects, suggest that, despite rapid and precipitous decreases in habitat size and connectivity, T. minuta populations have remained large and have experienced little genetic differentiation due to drift. Ecological changes in patch size and isolation at this scale have not influenced population genetic processes like effective migration rate for T. minuta, consistent with our expectations for an insect with a large population size.

AB  - Plants perceive the presence and defence status of their neighbours through light and volatile cues, but how plants integrate both stimuli is poorly understood. We investigated if and how low Red to Far red light (R:FR) ratios, indicative of shading or canopy closure, affect maize (Zea mays) responses to herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs), including the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate. We modulated light signalling and perception by using FR supplementation and a phyB1phyB2 mutant, and we determined volatile release as a response readout. To gain mechanistic insights, we examined expression of volatile biosynthesis genes, hormone accumulation, and photosynthesis. Exposure to a full blend of HIPVs or (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate induced maize volatile release. Short-term FR supplementation increased this response. In contrast, prolonged FR supplementation or constitutive phytochrome B inactivation in phyB1phyB2 plants showed the opposite response. Short-term FR supplementation enhanced photosynthesis and stomatal conductance and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate-induced JA-Ile levels. We conclude that a FR-enriched light environment can prompt maize plants to respond more strongly to HIPVs emitted by neighbours, which might be explained by changes in photosynthetic processes and phytochrome B signalling. Our findings reveal interactive responses to light and volatile cues with potentially important consequences for plant-plant and plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Simple Summary Birth weight and nutrient utilization are thought to have significant effects on intestinal development in neonatal pigs. The present study evaluated the impact of low and normal birth weight with and without nutrient restriction during the neonatal period on jejunal development. The results observed suggest that during the first 28 d of life, birth weight had greater effects on intestinal development than nutrient level, however, at d 56, the nutrient level was a significant contributor to intestinal function and enzyme activity compared to birth weight. Taken together, both birth weight and nutrient restriction have effects on intestinal development, but may have a greater impact in early life (d 28). Significant variation in the birth weight of piglets has arisen due to increased sow prolificacy. Intestinal development and function may be affected by birth weight. Low birth weight (LBW) pigs may also have reduced feed intake, leading to further impairment of intestinal development. The objective of this study was to examine the intestinal development pattern of LBW and normal birth weight (NBW) piglets with normal nutrition (NN) or restricted nutrition (RN) in the pre-weaning period. Jejunal intestinal samples were analyzed for target gene expression and enzyme activity at d 28 (weaning) and d 56 (post-weaning). At d 28, excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAC1) and sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter (B(0)AT1) were downregulated in LBW compared to NBW pigs (p < 0.05). On d 56, B(0)AT1 and ASCT2 (glutamine transporter) were downregulated in RN compared to NN pigs (p < 0.05), regardless of birth weight. Peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) expression was downregulated in LBW compared to NBW pigs at 28 d (p < 0.05), with no effects of treatments at 56 d. Sodium-glucose transporter-1 (SGLT1) was upregulated in NBW-NN compared to LBW-NN pigs (p < 0.05) at 28 d. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was upregulated in LBW-RN at d 28. At d 56, claudin-3 (CLDN-3) and Zonular occludin-1 (ZO-1) were upregulated in NN compared to RN pigs (p < 0.05). There were no treatment effects on ALP, maltase, or sucrase activity at 28 d. However, at 56 d, ALP was upregulated in NBW-NN pigs while sucrase activity was upregulated in NN pigs (p < 0.05). The results demonstrate differences in jejunal gene expression associated with birth weight, with reduced gene expression of amino acid transporters (PepT1, EAAC1, B(0)AT1) in LBW compared to NBW pigs (p < 0.05). While neonatal nutrient restriction had minimal effects at 28 d and d 56 for tight junction protein transcript abundance, neutral amino acid transporter abundance was upregulated in NN pigs compared to RN piglets (p < 0.05).

AB  - The effects of elevated CO2 concentration on the defensive ability of two Alnus species (A. maximowiczii, A. hirsuta) against herbivory attacks (alder leaf beetle; Agelastica coerulea) were investigated using a free-air CO2 enrichment. Elevated CO2 significantly affected consumed leaf area index (CLI) of A. maximowiczii but soil fertility did not, while more significant effects on CLI of A. hirsuta were found in both CO2 and soil fertility. As found in natural conditions, A. hirsuta was grazed five times more than A. maximowiczii in both CO2 levels, which was explained with the low condensed tannin (CT) concentration of the leaves. The value of leaf mass per area in fertile soil was 10 g m(-2) lower than that in infertile soil under ambient CO2 in July. Leaf C/N ratio was not affected by elevated CO2 for both species but that of A. hirsuta was little higher in infertile soil when compared to fertile soil in July. CT of A. maximowiczii tended to increase in September under elevated CO2. CT of A. hirsuta was higher in infertile soil than in fertile soil in July and showed an overall decrease in September compared to July. Nitrogen-fixing activity by a nodule of Frankia sp. on A. maximowiczii was higher in elevated CO(2)treatments than in ambient CO(2)independent of soil fertility. As a result of changes in these parameters, except for fertile soil, the peak of the herbivorous damage was later in elevated CO2 for the Alnus species than in the control.

AB  - Antlers are hallmark organ of deer, exhibiting a relatively high growth rate among mammals, and requiring large amounts of nutrients to meet its development. The rumen microbiota plays key roles in nutrient metabolism. However, changes in the microbiota and metabolome in the rumen during antler growth are largely unknown. We investigated rumen microbiota (liquid, solid, ventral epithelium, and dorsal epithelium) and metabolic profiles of sika deer at the early (EG), metaphase (MG) and fast growth (FG) stages. Our data showed greater concentrations of acetate and propionate in the rumens of sika deer from the MG and FG groups than in those of the EG group. However, microbial diversity decreased during antler growth, and was negatively correlated with short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels. Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Schaedlerella and Stenotrophomonas were the dominant bacteria in the liquid, solid, ventral epithelium, and dorsal epithelium fractions. The proportions of Stomatobaculum, Succiniclasticum, Comamonas and Anaerotruncus increased significantly in the liquid or dorsal epithelium fractions. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed that the metabolites also changed significantly, revealing 237 significantly different metabolites, among which the concentrations of gamma-aminobutyrate and creatine increased during antler growth. Arginine and proline metabolism and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism were enhanced. The co-occurrence network results showed that the associations between the rumen microbiota and metabolites different among the three groups. Our results revealed that the different rumen ecological niches were characterized by distinct microbiota compositions, and the production of SCFAs and the metabolism of specific amino acids were significantly changed during antler growth.

AB  - Along with the rising population of wild boars (Sus scrofa scrofa Linnaeus, 1758) in Slovakia, a higher rate of exposition to Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) was noted. The high density of animals is one of the main influencing factors of ADV persistence. Wild boar tissue samples were obtained by local hunters from different locations of Central and Eastern Slovakia. In total, muscle tissue samples from 139 individual wild boars were collected. Muscle fluid was obtained from these samples and subjected to serological analysis; a commercial ADV Ab-ELISA kit was used. In total, 53 samples were proved to be seropositive; out of these 19 samples of piglets, 13 samples of juveniles and 21 samples of adults. Out of 139 samples tested by ELISA, 53 were seropositive, which represents 38.12 % of positive samples. No significant difference was found between the two sexes; however, piglets have shown to have a significantly higher occurrence compared to adults. Our study confirmed the presence of ADV antibodies in the wild boar population in central and eastern Slovakia.

AB  - Prolactin (PRL) has recently been found to play a role in lipid metabolism in addition to its traditional roles in lactation and reproduction. However, the effects of PRL on lipid metabolism in liver and adipose tissues are unclear. Therefore, we aimed to study the role of PRL on lipid metabolism in goats. Twenty healthy eleven-month-old Yanshan cashmere goats with similar body weights (BWs) were selected and randomly divided into a control (CON) group and a bromocriptine (BCR, a PRL inhibitor, 0.06 mg/kg, BW) group. The experiment lasted for 30 days. Blood was collected on the day before BCR treatment (day 0) and on the 15th and 30th days after BCR treatment (days 15 and 30). On day 30 of treatment, all goats were slaughtered to collect their liver, subcutaneous adipose, and perirenal adipose tissues. A portion of all collected tissues was stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological observation, and another portion was immediately stored in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction. The PRL inhibition had inconclusive effects found on BW and average daily feed intake (ADFI) in goats (p > 0.05). PRL inhibition decreased the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) levels on day 30 (p < 0.05), but the effects were inconclusive on days 0 and 15. PRL inhibition had inconclusive effects found on total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), fatty acid synthase (FAS), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) on days 0, 15, and 30 (p > 0.05). Furthermore, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of the liver, subcutaneous adipose, and perirenal adipose sections showed that PRL inhibition had inconclusive effects on the pathological changes in their histomorphology (p > 0.05), but measuring adipocytes showed that the area of perirenal adipocytes decreased in the BCR group (p < 0.05). The qPCR results showed that PRL inhibition increased the expression of PRL, long-form PRL receptor (LPRLR), and short-form PRL receptor (SPRLR) genes, as well as the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, including sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1); sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2); acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA); fatty acid synthase (FASN); 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR); 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7); peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG); and lipase E, hormone-sensitive type (LIPE) in the liver (p < 0.05). In the subcutaneous adipose tissue, PRL inhibition increased SPRLR gene expression (p < 0.05) and decreased the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, including SREBF1, SREBF2, ACACA, PPARG, and LIPE (p < 0.05). In the perirenal adipose tissue, the inhibition of PRL decreased the expression of the PRL, SREBF2, and HMGCR genes (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inhibition of PRL decreases the serum HSL levels in cashmere goats; the effects of PRL on lipid metabolism are different in different tissues; and PRL affects lipid metabolic activity by regulating different PRLRs in liver and subcutaneous adipose tissues, as well as by decreasing the expression of the PRL, SREBF2, and HMGCR genes in perirenal adipose tissue.

AB  - Methane is one of the greenhouse gases (GHG), the increase in the concentration of which in the atmosphere is of particular concern to environmentalists and climatologists. The main sources of CH4 emissions are the extraction and processing of hydrocarbon raw materials, cattle and sheep breeding, and rice cultivation. To reduce CH4 emissions, various countries are making commitments aimed at reducing production volumes in their respective sectors of the economy. However, our estimates show that the contribution of methane to global warming accepted by the IPCC is greatly exaggerated. The simplest model of the greenhouse effect, presented in the works of S.M. Semenov, was used as the main tool for theoretical analysis. The values of the GHG absorption spectra are taken from the HITRAN database. The results obtained showed that the greenhouse effect and the formation of the average global temperature of the Earth's surface are caused almost exclusively by two substances - water and carbon dioxide, while the total contribution of CH4 and N2O does not exceed 1.4%. The results of the calculations provide grounds for a critical assessment of the widespread opinion about the high risk of current CH4 emissions from the point of view of global warming and the observed climate changes.

AB  - High greenhouse gas emissions, high water demand, and waste with high pollution potential are critical points for waste management generated in animal production. With significant contributions in global emissions of air pollutants, sustainable practices for agriculture are fundamental to mitigate global climate change, besides ensuring protection to water resources, which is as critical as climate issues. Despite the importance of these issues, some gaps exist in the literature to develop practices capable of fostering water security and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. In this sense, the present study aimed to evaluate the impacts of reusing NO3- rich effluents inside the facilities for cleaning the swine houses and consequent atmospheric emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). In swine manure, the generation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) was strongly influenced by temperature; a change in temperature from 10 to 18 ? increased by ten times the rate of VFA production, reflecting directly in methane emission and availability of organic carbon for the denitrification process. The effluent reuse practice, rich in nitrate, considering the organic carbon bioavailability in the pit storage, decreased methanogenic activity with a consequent VFA use as a bioavailable carbon source for denitrification, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and consequently, the environmental impacts of swine production. In this way, the water reuse of 40% can mitigate up to 80% of GHG emission, with a minimum C/N ratio of 20, to ensure that at all temperatures the denitrifying process occurs efficiently since the carbon limitation negatively affected the N2O emission due to incomplete denitrification. Therefore, our results demonstrate the importance of this practice for swine sustainability and the capacity to adopt simple measures in favor of circularity in the swine production chain.

AB  - Biogas digesters are commonly used to treat animal manure/slurry, and abundant digested slurry is generated during the digestion process. Gas emissions from digested and raw slurry may vary with the change in slurry parameters after digestion, but the mechanism is not well understood. Gas emissions from raw dairy slurry (RS) and digested dairy slurry (BS) during 98 days of storage were investigated in this study to evaluate the effects of anaerobic digestion on reactive nitrogen emissions from slurry storage. Results showed that much higher N2O and NO emission and lower NH3 emission was achieved in BS than in RS. The mean gaseous emission of RS and BS accounted for 27.8% +/- 6.9% and 17.1% +/- 2.3% of the initial TN for NH3, 0.1% +/- 0.1% and 3.5% +/- 1.6% of the initial TN for N2O, and 0.0% +/- 0.0% and 0.2% +/- 0.0% of the initial TN for NO, respectively. Among all detected N2O-forming and reducing microbial genes, the abundance of amoA genes was the most closely related to N2O flux (r = 0.54, p < 0.01). More aerobic conditions occurred in BS, and dissolved oxygen (DO) increased to 0.4-1.6 mg L-1 after 35 days because the low organic matter of BS resulted in good infiltration of surface air into the slurry. The increased DO stimulated the growth of Nitrosomonas and the increase in amoA gene copies and contributed to the high N2O and NO emissions in BS through the nitrification process. Vulcanibacillus, Thauera, Castellaniella, and Thermomonas were the major denitrifying bacteria that occurred in BS and caused an incomplete denitrification process, which could be another reason for the increase in N2O and NO emissions from BS. Our study indicated that anaerobic digestion reduced the organic matter content of the slurry and caused an active microbial environment that facilitated the transformation of slurry N to N2O in BS storage, thus lowering the NH3 emission compared with RS storage. Therefore, aside from NH3, N2O should also be preferentially mitigated during BS storage because N2O is a greenhouse gas with high global warming potential.

AB  - Polygynous mating systems result in intense competition between males for access to females. We tested hypotheses related to costs and benefits of multimale groups in free-roaming feral horses, Equus caballus, in relation to individual reproductive success. We observed horses in two populations in Utah, U.S.A. (Conger and Frisco Herd Management Areas) between 2017 and 2020. We obtained genetic confirmation of foal parentage from hair and faecal samples and had known sire status at conception for 119 foals from 35 males at Conger and 40 foals from 17 males at Frisco. We found high reproductive skew: 44% of foals in our sample were sired by 7% (N = 5) of males at Conger and 45% of foals were sired by 12% (N = 5) of males at Frisco. We determined four adult male statuses: harem stallion (associating with females), lieutenant (associating with a harem), tag (following a harem but not associating with them) and bachelor (associating with other males). Most males moved between statuses, including 27 castrated males at Conger. Harem stallions were sires of 86% and 95% of foals at Conger and Frisco, respectively; only 3% of foals at Conger and none at Frisco were sired by lieutenants or tags; over 96% of paternity was by single-male group harem stallions. Female reproductive success was not affected by group size or being in a multimale group. Harem stallion tenure length and reproductive success were positively correlated with affiliative interactions between adult males and females but not with agonistic interactions. We found more support for limited control than concession models of reproductive skew and partial support for the consort hypothesis explaining presence of multimale groups. Differences between horse populations relative to male roles may reflect local adaptations within polygynous systems, and multimale groups may arise from social bonds between individuals.

AB  - The risk-benefit trade-off theory is a fundamental concept in the study of animal behavior strategies and remains a prominent topic in animal ecology. Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) foraging alongside ungulates has garnered considerable attention. Previous research has highlighted the impact of ungulates on disturbing grassland insects, leading to increased foraging success for Cattle Egrets. However, the risk-benefit relationship from an antipredator perspective remains underexplored. This study, conducted in Yang County, Shaanxi Province, China, focused on Cattle Egrets and compared the foraging efficiency and flight initiation distance (FID) when foraging alongside cattle (Bos spp.) versus foraging alone. Additionally, our study analyzed the impact of increasing cattle numbers on the FID to assess whether foraging with cattle enhances the perceived safety. We hypothesized that, with more cattle, Cattle Egrets would be less vigilant if they can gain vigilance advantages from cattle. The results indicated significantly higher foraging efficiency and lower FID for Cattle Egrets when foraging with cattle compared to foraging alone, suggests that the presence of cattle enables Cattle Egrets to better tolerate potential predation risks. However, more cattle did not significantly affect the FID, indicating that the perceived predation risk of Cattle Egrets did not reduce with more cattle. The lower FID of Cattle Egrets when foraging with cattle is more likely attributed to higher foraging efficiency rather than lower perceived predation risk in their risk-benefit trade-off. This study explores the mechanism of Cattle Egrets foraging with cattle from an antipredation perspective, enhancing understanding of this phenomenon and contributing to the risk-benefit trade-off hypothesis.

AB  - Animal fertility is the result of a combination of genetic, physiological and environmental factors. Assessment of semen quality plays a key role in determining the reproductive performance of boars. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of two seasons of the year on the morphology, morphometry, cell membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity of sperm during storage of liquid boar semen at 17 degrees C. The study was carried out using 20 boars. Four ejaculates were collected from each boar in each of two seasons of the year. All tests were carried out five times: at 1, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h during storage. The results showed that sperm in ejaculates collected in summer are more sensitive to storage conditions than those from ejaculates obtained in winter. The percentage of sperm with morphological defects was shown to increase with the storage time of the diluted ejaculates, particularly between 96 and 168 h of preservation. In summer, the percentage of sperm with an intact cell membrane and the percentage with high mitochondrial membrane potential are much lower than in winter, at every hour of semen preservation. In the case of boars used for artificial insemination, it is worth taking into account the season when the semen is collected, especially if it is to be stored in liquid form. Assessment of sperm cell structures during storage of liquid semen should be implemented at insemination stations and should be carried out more often in summer.

AB  - Plants have evolved with various effective mechanisms to defend themselves against herbivores, and one such mechanism is the production of protease inhibitors that disrupt digestion of the insects. Plant protease inhibitors (PPIs) interact with the target proteases of the insect gut, forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex that impairs normal enzymatic activity, leading to indigestion, reduced food intake, retarded growth, reproduction abnormalities, and sometimes mortality of the insect. Insects responses to these anti-nutritional compounds through remarkable physiological adaptations rendering this vast array of PPIs ineffective. Several molecular and biotechnological tools enable us to modify the expression of desired genes. CRISPR-Cas tools could cause complete knock-out of the gene, and RNA interference can cause gene knock-down. Transgenic plants overexpressing highly efficient PI genes are being developed for the management of crop pests. Although few, the reports of marginal detrimental effects of PPI-transgenic plants on non-target beneficial arthropods should be taken into consideration. Research suggests that insect-gut-associated microbes can affect insect protease levels or elicit plant defense responses and play a significant role in changing the dynamics of plant-insect interaction. Knowledge of protease gene regulation in herbivore insects can be used to deploy PPIs for the development of effective and alternate pest management strategies.

AB  - Cranial endocasts are one of the most direct tools available to obtain information about the endocranial cavity of fossil mammals, but few anatomical comparisons have analyzed endocranial data within a phylogenetic framework. Our study combines analyses of new digital endocasts from high-resolution X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) for two notoungulates, Cochilius sp. and Notostylops murinus, with data from published anatomical descriptions and endocasts (prior mu CT digital endocasts and natural and extracted plaster endocasts), resulting in 22 endocranial characters (11 new) scored on 20 notoungulates and five outgroups. These data permitted a comparative study of cranial endocasts of notoungulates, an enigmatic group of extinct South American mammals, shedding light on several important issues concerning their phylogenetic relationships. The new endocranial data were integrated into a craniodental and postcranial matrix, resulting in 259 characters across 65 taxa, the most comprehensive character and taxon sampling to date and the only one including a substantial suite of endocranial characters. We further performed ancestral state reconstructions for endocranial characters using parsimony optimization on the resulting phylogenetic trees. Body mass estimates and endocranial volumes were used to calculate Encephalization Quotients (EQs) and Phylogenetic Encephalization Quotients (PEQs), which then were optimized onto the phylogenies. Endocast data from ancestral character state reconstructions bear on relationships among meridiungulates, revealing that many endocast characters may be synapomorphies for Notoungulata and other clades within the group. Notoungulates, in general, display relatively low EQs when compared with Holarctic herbivorous mammals, potentially due to their long history of evolution in isolation in South America during the Cenozoic.

AB  - Beetles typically use their protective wing coverings or elytra to shield their membranous hindwings from the environment. Elytra in some terrestrial species have evolved a greater protective role capable of shielding the organism from powerful antagonistic predators. The structure-function relationships of these biological composites identify how architectural and chemical variations of the cuticle are tuned to create light-weight, impact resistant composites. Specifically, the elytral structures of a tree dwelling beetle capable of flight, Trypoxylus dichotomus, and a terrestrial beetle incapable of flight, Phloeodes diabolicus, are compared to understand how their varied environmental needs forged the elytra to facilitate fight or resist fatal predator strikes. Mechanical and microstructural analysis reveals P. diabolicus has a harder, stiffer elytra that incorporate through-thickness fibers to resist greater mechanical stresses imposed by bending and puncture. Conversely, the elytra of T. dichotomus have a compliant structure with large voids that facilitates localized deformation. Variations in flexural strength and puncture resistance remain attributed to P. diabolicus possessing a thicker cuticle with a greater degree of cross-linking and an increased amount of endocuticular layers. These findings may provide useful insight into the design and manufacturing of composite materials for use in light-weight or energy-absorbing applications.

AB  - Golden camellia is a highly valued commercial plant owing to its flowers' medicinal substances. One species of golden camellia, Camellia quephongensis Hakoda et Ninh, is used as a non-timber forest product for value-chain forestry (VCF) in Que Phong District, Nghe An Province, North-Central Vietnam; its production and sale is an important business activity which contributes substantially to local livelihood improvement. According to previous studies and in situ observation, golden camellias, including C. quephongensis, inhabit regenerated forests, especially along streams and rivers. This encourages VCF with C. quephongensis to function as a driver of forest regeneration and conservation. However, the ecological aspect of this species in regenerated forests is poorly understood. Thus, this study aimed to determine this species' growth patterns and population expansion during forest regeneration. We surveyed the morphological characteristics of this species at different ages in several populations, and revealed that the plants reached a tree height of 150 cm and started blooming eight years after germination. Comparing C. quephongensis-populations inhabiting different succession-staged forests, we observed that the population in long-term regenerated forests was significantly larger and had a pyramid-shaped age distribution pattern to possibly expand its population size. Based on this, we conclude that C. quephongensis is a good indicator of forest regeneration and contributes to local livelihoods and forest regeneration and conservation.

AB  - Flores represents a unique insular environment with an extensive record of Pleistocene fossil remains and stone artefacts. In the So'a Basin of central Flores these include endemic Stegodon, Komodo dragons, giant tortoises, rats, birds and hominins, and lithic artefacts that can be traced back to at least one million years ago (1 Ma). This comprehensive review presents important new data regarding the dating and faunal sequence of the So'a Basin, including the site of Mata Menge where Homo floresiensis-like fossils dating to approximately 0.7 Ma were discovered in 2014. By chemical fingerprinting key silicic tephra originating from local and distal eruptive sources we have now established basin-wide tephrostrati-graphic correlations, and, together with new numerical ages, present an update of the chronostratig-raphy of the So'a Basin, with major implications for the faunal sequence. These results show that a giant tortoise and the diminutive proboscidean Stegodon sondaari last occurred at the site of Tangi Talo-1.3 Ma, and not 0.9 Ma as previously thought. We also present new data suggesting that the disap-pearance of giant tortoise and S. sondaari from the sedimentary record occurred before, and/or was coincident with, the earliest hominin arrival, as evidenced by the first records of lithic artefacts occurring directly below the 1 Ma Wolo Sege Tephra. Artefacts become common in the younger layers, associated with a distinct fauna characterized by the medium-sized Stegodon florensis and giant rat Hooijeromys nusatenggara. Furthermore, we describe a newly discovered terrace fill, which extends the faunal record of Stegodon in the So'a Basin to the Late Pleistocene. Our evidence also suggests that the paleoenvir-onment of the So'a Basin became drier around the time of the observed faunal transition and arrival of hominins on the island, which could be related to an astronomically-forced climate response at the onset of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT;-1.25 Ma) leading to increased aridity and monsoonal intensity.

AB  - Smart hog breeding technologies have been viewed as practical solutions for environmental pollution, pork production inefficiency and food insecurity in rural areas. With difficulty in promoting these technologies, little is known about the role environmental regulation plays. Using 703 household survey data from rural Hubei, China, this paper identifies the impacts of different environmental regulation perceptions (i.e., supervisory, incentive and guiding regulation perceptions) on hog breeding farmers' intentions to adopt smart hog breeding technologies and on the intensity of their adoption intentions. Both multivariate probit model and ordered probit model are employed. Results show that smart hog breeding technologies are strong complementary. Farmers' environmental regulation perceptions greatly promote their intentions to adopt smart hog breeding technologies and their adoption intention intensity. Only the intensity of healthy farmers' adoption intentions is promoted by supervisory regulation perception. Compared to those without village cadres in family, the intensity of villagecadre group's adoption intentions is strengthened more by supervisory and guiding regulation perceptions. The greater incentive regulation perception is, the stronger the intensity of large-scale farmers' adoption intentions would be. The impacts of different environmental regulation perceptions on the intensity of adoption intentions are all partially mediated by value perception of smart agriculture. These findings suggest promoting smart hog breeding technologies jointly and underscore the importance of local environmental regulations in accelerating the diffusion of smart hog breeding technologies.

AB  - We used RNAseq analysis to identify key genes affecting reproductive traits for the Guizhou black goat. We utilized mRNA collected from uterine, ovarian and fallopian tube tissues of goats with the same pedigree and analyzed the results using bioinformatics and qRT-PCR. We found 8120 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ovarian tissues (3205 up-and 4915 down-regulated), 5255 DEGs in the fallopian tubes (1317 up-and 3888 down-regulated) and 5180 DEGs in uterine tissue (2597 up-and 2583 down-regulated). The biological processes associated with these DEGs were primarily cell differentiation, reproduction and biological regulation. The associated gene functions were related to organelle, cell membrane and cell structure in cell component processes and for molecular function, the genes were related to protein binding, catalytic activity and cell proliferation. Moreover, these DEGs were enriched in the categories of signal transduction, reproductive system, endocrine system and cancer-related pathways and linked the cGMP-PKG, cAMP, TGF beta and mTOR signaling pathways to reproductive performance. We verified these results using qRT-PCR for 9 up-regulated (AMH, CYP19A1, FOXL2, FSHR, GATA4, INHBA, LHB, LHX9 and ZP3) and 9 down-regulated (CNOT1. DMRTA1, GHRHR, Hox-All, Oviductin, PCYT1B, SLC34A2, WDR19 andWnt-7A) genes. The results were consistent with the RNAseq results and we more specifically linked AMH, GATA4, Oviductin and DMRTA1 to lambing traits of the Guizhou black goat.

AB  - Simple Summary Lameness and claw disorders are important animal welfare issues in dairy goats, and knowledge is limited. Estimates of genetic parameters for occurrence and susceptibility to clinical lameness and claw disorders and the genetic associations with milk production traits in dairy goats were obtained in this study. These results indicate that a selection index can be developed to select animals resistant or tolerant to lameness and claw disorders. The New Zealand goat industry accesses niche markets for high-value products, mainly formula for infants and young children. This study aimed to estimate the genetic parameters of occurrence and susceptibility of clinical lameness and selected claw disorders and establish their genetic associations with milk production traits. Information on pedigree, lameness, claw disorders, and milk production was collected on three farms between June 2019 and July 2020. The dataset contained 1637 does from 174 sires and 1231 dams. Estimates of genetic and residual (co)variances, heritabilities, and genetic and phenotypic correlations were obtained with uni- and bi-variate animal models. The models included the fixed effects of farm and parity, deviation from the median kidding date as a covariate, and the random effects of animal and residual error. The heritability (h(2)) estimates for lameness occurrence and susceptibility were 0.07 and 0.13, respectively. The h(2) estimates for claw disorder susceptibilities ranged from 0.02 to 0.23. The genotypic correlations ranged from weak to very strong between lameness and milk production traits (-0.94 to 0.84) and weak to moderate (0.23 to 0.84) between claw disorder and milk production traits.

AB  - Lay Summary The identification of human-pathogenic genotypes of fungi-related Enterocytozoon bieneusi in wild carnivores and ungulates in Portugal suggests cross-species infection events and overlapping of the sylvatic and domestic transmission cycles, demonstrating a potential transmission risk to humans.
   The phylum Microsporidia encompasses a diverse group of obligate, intracellular, and spore-forming organisms able to infect a wide range of animal hosts. Among them, Enterocytozoon bieneusi is the most frequently reported species in humans and animals. Little is known about the presence and epidemiology of E. bieneusi in wildlife. We investigated E. bieneusi occurrence and genetic diversity in wild and domestic mammals, through molecular-detection methods, from different regions across Portugal. A total of 756 samples were collected from 288, 242, and 226 wild carnivores, wild ungulates, and domestic animals, respectively. Overall, eight specimens were E. bieneusi-positive (1.1%, 8/756) obtained from five wild (Iberian lynx, Iberian wolf, red fox, stone marten, and wild boar) and one domestic (sheep) host. Nucleotide sequence analysis identified four genotypes of E. bieneusi, Type IV, Wildboar3, BEB6, and PtEbIX. Three of those genotypes belong to Groups 1 (Type IV and Wildboar3) and 2 (BEB6), which are known to contain genotypes capable of infecting a variety of hosts, including humans, highlighting their public health importance. PtEbIX belongs to the dog-specific Group 11. This study represents the first, largest, and most comprehensive molecular-based epidemiology survey carried out in Portugal in wild and domestic animals to date and the first worldwide identification of E. bieneusi in wolf species. Our study showed that wild carnivores and ungulates may act as reservoirs of zoonotic genotypes of E. bieneusi, establishing their role in maintaining the sylvatic cycle of this parasite while representing a potential source of infection for humans and domestic animals.

AB  - Small pig holders in Vietnam face obstacles when feed costs increase daily. Therefore, identifying a cost-effective feeding mode can help farmers cope with this problem. This study compared the effects of two popular feeding modes, commercial feed and combination feed (mixing instant feed with agricultural byproducts), on the technical efficiency (TE) of small pig holders in Vietnam. The data envelopment analysis approach and meta-frontier were used to measure and compare the TE of commercial and combination feeds. Additionally, this study used a Tobit regression to analyze the factors affecting TE. TE was 75.06, 86.56, and 78.76% with the meta-frontier, commercial, and combination feeding group frontiers, respectively. The corresponding meta-technology ratios of these groups were 83.89 and 97.24%, respectively, indicating that the TE of the combined feeding mode is higher than that of the commercial feeding mode. This finding confirms the economics of combination feed in the context of increasing the import price of raw materials for feed production. The results of the Tobit models show that the education of household heads, access to credit, pig density, family income, herd size, and percentage of own-produced piglets are determinants of TE.

AB  - Africa has played a pivotal role in the evolution of early proboscideans (elephants and their extinct relatives), yet vast temporal and geographical zones remain uncharted on the continent. A long hiatus encompassing most of the Eocene (Ypresian to the Early Priabonian, around 13 Myr timespan) considerably hampers our understanding of the early evolutionary history of the group. It is notably the case with the origin of its most successful members, the Elephantiformes, i.e. all elephant-like proboscideans most closely related to modern elephants. Here, we describe a proboscidean lower molar discovered in Lutetian phosphate deposits from Togo, and name a new genus and species, Dagbatitherium tassyi. We show that Dagbatitherium displays several elephantiform dental characteristics such as a three-layered Schmelzmuster, the presence of a mesoconid, transversely enlarged buccal cusps and the individualization of a third lophid closely appressed to a minute distal cingulid. Dagbatitherium represents a stem Elephantiformes, pushing back the origin of the group by about 10 Myr, i.e. a third of its currently known evolutionary history. More importantly, Dagbatitherium potentially unlocks the puzzle of the origin of the unique elephantiform tooth crown organization by bridging a critical temporal and morphological gap between early bunodont incipiently bilophodont proboscidean taxa and more derived elephantiforms.

AB  - Potoroid marsupials (bettongs and potoroos of the family Potoroidae) are considered ecosystem engineers because of the roles they play in maintaining biodiversity. However, severe declines since European arrival have necessitated intense conservation efforts. Vital to these efforts is an understanding of the physical challenges that define their niches. The mechanical properties of their foods, such as toughness and stiffness, represent a physical interface with the environment that can contribute to quantitatively defining their niches. Here, we provide mechanical property data from wild bettong and potoroo foods, such as roots and tubers, fruit, fungi, invertebrates, seeds, and leaves. Toughness ranged from approximately 56.58 J/m2 (fungal sporocarp of Descolea sp.) to 2568.15 J/m2 (tubers of the blue yam, Brunoniella australis). Similarly, stiffness of the wild foods ranged from 1.15 MPa for Descolea sp. to 30.4 MPa for B. australis. However, the mechanical demands of accessing the kernels from within the shells (testae) of sandalwood and quandong (Santalum spp.) seeds far exceed measurements of any foods tested. We also tested some farmed foods, alongside inclusion of data from previous studies. Taken together, these data can also improve selection of comparable foods in designing diets for potoroids, and other species, in captivity.
   Bettongs and potoroos are important for maintaining biodiversity, but we do not know much about how difficult their foods are to eat in the wild. We measured the toughness and stiffness of their foods, including roots and tubers, fruit, fungi, invertebrates, seeds, and leaves, and compared these with farmed items from similar food groups. This information is important for understanding how these animals survive in the wild and for designing diets for them in captivity.

AB  - Marine turtle species in the Asia-Pacific region face loss of habitat, population decline and serious risk of extinction. Understanding the associated loss in human welfare can motivate conservation finance, policy reforms and other actions to protect and restore marine turtle populations. This paper estimates non-use values for marine turtles in the Asia-Pacific region using a large-sample (n = 7765) global household survey. The survey focused on six countries in the region (China, Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam) but received responses from over 80 countries in total. A discrete choice experiment was used to elicit willingness-to-pay (WTP) for marine turtles, defined in terms of population trends (increasing, stable or declining) and species diversity (avoided extinctions). We find that a high proportion of households (82%) expressed a positive WTP for turtle conservation, and that the donation amounts are substantial. The median WTP for ensuring stable marine turtle populations, adjusted for demographic differences between the survey sample and the general population, is estimated at US $79 per household per year. A scenario analysis is used to estimate the economic welfare changes that would result from policy inaction (in which turtle populations continue to decline and two species become extinct) versus strong policy action (resulting in increasing turtle populations and no extinctions). The welfare loss that results from not acting is estimated to be US $40 billion per year, whereas the potential welfare gain from taking policy action to conserve, manage and protect marine turtles is estimated at US $55 billion per year. These results present a strong economic justification for governments across the region to align their environmental policies and budgets with Asia-Pacific peoples' stated WTP for turtle conservation.

AB  - In this study, the release of dissolved black carbon (DBC) from bulk-BC, its surface properties, colloidal stability, and oxidative stress to rice seedlings in the presence and absence of rice root exudates were compared. The bulkBCs were prepared at 550 C and derived from wood chips and pig manure, respectively. The release of DBC from bulk-BC was significantly enhanced (20.19-23.63%) by the introduction of root exudates, where low molecular weight organic acids played a dominating role in the dissociation of DBC from carbon skeleton. The surface properties of DBC were greatly modified by root exudates including decreases in the surface area (18.13%) and mineral contents (43.90-69.57%). The O-containing groups and graphitization were also enhanced by 11.46% and 18.65%, respectively. Meanwhile, the presence of root exudates not only reduced the colloidal stability of DBC but also lowered the intensity of free radicals (19.44-22.22%) in DBC. Consequently, the oxidative stress of DBC to rice seedlings was significantly (p < 0.05) alleviated, evidenced by reduced antioxidative enzyme activities (5.67-29.25%) and soluble protein content (15.75-46.79%) in rice plants. These results indicate that the interaction between DBC and root exudates could remarkably modify the surface properties and reactivity of DBC, which has profound implications for understanding the behavior and functions of DBC in the environment.

AB  - Simple Summary Ruminants contribute to global greenhouse gas production, mainly through enteric methane emission (EME). Different dietary strategies have been explored to mitigate EME, including the use of forages rich in tannins that inhibit methanogenic activity in the rumen. Feeding the condensed tannin-containing forage Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) has reduced EME by small ruminants in previous studies. In the present experiment, the digestion of fiber, and in particular of nitrogen, decreased as the concentration of lespedeza increased. Similar metabolizable energy intake and retained energy among diets suggests that decreasing digested nitrogen intake and protein status were responsible for marked declines in growth performance as the dietary amount of lespedeza increased. In contrast to many other reports, the dietary concentration of lespedeza did not affect EME by goats or sheep under these feeding conditions. Twenty-four Alpine doelings, initial 25.3 +/- 0.55 kg body weight (BW) and 10.4 +/- 0.11 mo of age, and 24 Katahdin ewe lambs, 28.3 +/- 1.02 kg BW and 9.6 +/- 0.04 mo of age, were used to determine effects of dietary inclusion of Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) hay on feed intake, digestion, growth performance, energy metabolism, and ruminal fermentation and methane emission. There were four periods, the first three 42 days in length and the fourth 47 days. Diets consumed ad libitum contained 75% coarsely ground hay with alfalfa (ALF), a 1:1 mixture of ALF and LES (ALF+LES), and LES (10.0% condensed tannins; CT). The intake of dry matter (DM) tended to be greater (p = 0.063) for Katahdin than for Alpine (4.14 vs. 3.84% BW; SEM = 0.110). The dry matter intake was similar among the diets (3.97, 4.10, and 3.89% BW for ALF, ALF+LES, and LES, respectively; SEM = 0.134). The digestion of organic matter (75.3, 69.3, and 65.5%; SEM = 0.86), neutral detergent fiber (61.7, 50.5, and 41.4%; SEM = 1.49), and nitrogen (78.8, 66.9, and 50.8% for ALF, ALF+LES, and LES, respectively; SEM = 0.92) decreased as the dietary concentration of lespedeza increased (p < 0.05). However, there was an interaction (p < 0.05) between the breed and diet in nitrogen digestion, with a greater value for goats vs. sheep with LES (54.4 vs. 47.3%; SEM = 1.30). The digested nitrogen intake decreased markedly with the increasing quantity of lespedeza (38.0, 27.5, and 15.7 g/day for ALF, ALF+LES, and LES, respectively; SEM = 1.26). The average daily gain was greater for Katahdin than for Alpine (p < 0.001; 180 vs. 88 g, SEM = 5.0) and ranked (p < 0.05) ALF > ALF+LES > LES (159, 132, and 111 g, respectively; SEM = 6.1). The ruminal methane emission differed (p < 0.05) between animal types in MJ/day (1.17 and 1.44), kJ/g DM intake (1.39 and 1.23), and kJ/g ADG (18.1 and 9.8 for Alpine and Katahdin, respectively). Regardless of the period and animal type, diet did not impact methane emission in MJ/day or relative to DM intake, BW, or ADG (p > 0.05). The digestible and metabolizable energy intakes, heat production, and retained energy were not affected by diet (p > 0.05). In conclusion, future research should consider the marked potential effect of CT of forages such as lespedeza on nitrogen digestion and associated effects on protein status and other conditions that may be impacted.

AB  - The overuse of antimicrobials in livestock farming has led to the development of resistant bacteria and the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) among animals. When manure containing these antibiotics is applied to agricultural fields, it creates a selective pressure that promotes the acquisition of ARGs by bacteria, primarily through horizontal gene transfer. Most research on ARGs focuses on their role in clinical antibiotic resistance and their transfer from environmental sources to bacteria associated with humans, such as Escherichia coli. . The study investigates the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) through class 1 integrons in 27 Escherichia coli strains from pig manure. It focuses on six common ARGs (ermB, erm B, cml A, flo R, qnr S, tet A, and TEM) and the class 1 integron gene, assessing their prevalence in manure samples from three pig farms. The study found correlations and anticorrelations among these genes, indicating a predisposition of the integron in spreading certain ARGs. Specifically, cmlA A and tetA A genes were positively correlated with each other and negatively with int1, suggesting they are not transferred via Int 1. Farm B had the highest int1 counts and a higher abundance of the TEM gene, but lower levels of cmlA A and tetA A genes. The results underscore the complexity of predicting ARG spread in agricultural environments and the associated health risks to humans through the food chain. The study's results offer valuable insights into the antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) profile in swine livestock, potentially aiding in the development of methods to trace ARGs in the environment.

Most studies of habitat selection by greater sage-grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus "sage-grouse") have focused on breeding and summer rather than winter habitat. We focused on winter microhabitat when available habitat was influenced by snow conditions. Our objectives were to 1) identify what microhabitat characteristics sage-grouse select during winter and 2) evaluate whether sage-grouse selected microhabitat at the home range (third order) or the population range (second order) scale. In summer 2020, we measured shrub characteristics and herbivore dung counts at 90 sage-grouse locations from the previous 2019/2020 winter in northwest Colorado and southcentral Wyoming and compared them with 90 paired, available locations within sage-grouse home ranges and 90 unpaired, available locations within the population range. We found strong support for sage-grouse selecting for winter microhabitat at the home-range scale because we observed similar differences in shrub characteristics between sage-grouse use locations and available locations at both scales and no differences between randomly available habitat. Compared with available locations within home ranges, wintering sage-grouse selected areas of 57.1% greater big sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata spp. Nutt.) canopy cover, 23.7% taller big sagebrush, and 110.6% more visual obstruction at use locations. Sage-grouse dung piles were 7.1 x higher at used locations than available locations within home ranges, further indicating that habitat use was less random within home ranges. In winter, microhabitat selection focused on higher cover and height of big sagebrush like previous observations from nearby studies of microhabitat selected by sage-grouse during nesting and brood-rearing.

AB  - This paper introduces Xanthomelon amurndamilumila sp. nov., a newly-discovered land snail species inhabiting the North East Isles, offshore from Groote Eylandt (= Ayangkidarrba), north-western Gulf of Carpentaria, in the Northern Territory, Australia. Specimens of this species were first collected during the 2021 Bush Blitz expedition to Groote Eylandt, a large offshore archipelago previously unexplored for land snails. The taxonomic status of the new species was established through a comprehensive analysis of comparative morphology and mitochondrial genetics: X. amurndamilumila forms a maximally supported clade closely related to X. arnhemense and is characterised by a unique combination of morphological characteristics, including smaller shell size, distinctive sculpture of collabral ridges and specific features of its reproductive anatomy. The genetic divergence and phylogenetic relationships suggest historical isolation. While the discovery of X. amurndamilumila sp. nov. enriches our understanding of land snail diversity in the Northern Territory, its conservation status is of concern on North East Island because of habitat degradation caused by feral deer.

AB  - Simple Summary Selection of pigs in Russia is carried out within the framework of separate large holdings. Such a system does not allow for the use of sufficiently large amounts of data (on all individuals of the breed) to obtain the most reliable breeding value estimates. This problem is especially relevant for low-inherited reproduction traits (for example, prolificacy), which are the main ones for maternal pig breeds. In this regard, our study considered the possibility of improving the accuracy of the breeding value assessment of Large White pigs (replacement pigs, sows and boars) through the use of genomic data obtained on a high-density hybridization chip. Replacement pigs' genomic prediction for reproduction (total number and born alive piglets in the first parity), meat, fatness and growth traits (muscle depth, days to 100 kg and backfat thickness over 6-7 rib) was tested using single-step genomic best linear unbiased prediction ssGBLUP methodology. These traits were selected as the most economically significant and different in terms of heritability. The heritability for meat, fatness and growth traits varied from 0.17 to 0.39 and for reproduction traits from 0.12 to 0.14. We confirm from our data that ssGBLUP is the most appropriate method of genomic evaluation. The validation of genomic predictions was performed by calculating the correlation between preliminary GEBV (based on pedigree and genomic data only) with high reliable conventional estimates (EBV) (based on pedigree, own phenotype and offspring records) of validating animals. Validation datasets include 151 and 110 individuals for reproduction, meat and fattening traits, respectively. The level of correlation (r) between EBV and GEBV scores varied from +0.44 to +0.55 for meat and fatness traits, and from +0.75 to +0.77 for reproduction traits. Average breeding value (EBV) of group selected on genomic evaluation basis exceeded the group selected on parental average estimates by 22, 24 and 66% for muscle depth, days to 100 kg and backfat thickness over 6-7 rib, respectively. Prediction based on SNP markers data and parental estimates showed a significant increase in the reliability of low heritable reproduction traits (about 40%), which is equivalent to including information about 10 additional descendants for sows and 20 additional descendants for boars in the evaluation dataset.

AB  - Kromdraai is a Plio-Pleistocene site located in the Cradle of Humankind (Gauteng Province, South Africa). It has produced diverse and abundant faunal assemblages and key hominin specimens like the holotype of Paranthropus robustus and early Homo. We provide the first taxonomic study of the Bovidae Family from the hominin-bearing Unit P at Kromdraai and discuss its potential to unravel its paleoecological context. We describe the presence of an unknown medium-sized buffalo (Syncerus sp.) that could be closely related to S. acoelotus. The bovid assemblage from Kromdraai Unit P combines older Plio-Pleistocene (Gazella gracilior, Makapania broomi, Numidocapra cf. porrocornutus) and younger Pleistocene taxa (Tragelaphus strepsiceros, Oreotragus oreotragus, Raphicerus campestris, Damaliscus lunatus). Overall, these bovid species indicate a grassland-dominated environment for Unit P. Comparisons with other Plio-Pleistocene South African sites indicate that Australopithecus was associated with woodland and closed-wet environment-adapted taxa, whereas Homo was found in association with bovid species adapted to open and dry environments. In contrast, the assemblages associated with Paranthropus show an extensive range of environmental adaptation among the bovids. The biochronology indicates that Kromdraai Unit P accumulated between 2.9 and 1.8 Ma. If Kromdraai Unit P were to be confirmed to date to the older end of this scale, it would provide the earliest appearance of Paranthropus robustus, Numidocapra, and Damaliscus in southern Africa.

AB  - Consumers play an important role in biogeochemical cycles through the consumption and release of essential elements such as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P). Indeed, a large proportion of consumed elements are released into the environment in inorganic (i.e. excretion) or organic form (i.e. egestion). On coral reefs, fishes represent the bulk of consumer biomass and thus play a key role in the recycling of nutrients. In recent years, excretion rates have been studied intensively, but less is known about the rate and quality of coral reef fish egestion. In this study, we quantify the elemental contents of fish feces, estimate absorption efficiencies and compare egestion and excretion rates for 51 coral reef fish species. We show that elemental concentrations decrease remarkably little from food to feces. This is due to extremely low absorption efficiencies, resulting in the egestion of large amounts of energy and nutrients. Moreover, we show that while the quality of fish feces varies across trophic guilds, it remains highly variable within trophic guilds. Finally, we demonstrate that the release of N and P through egestion outweighs the amount of nutrients recycled through excretion. Our study highlights the need to incorporate animal egestion into assessments of ecosystem functioning and food web structure.

AB  - Simple Summary Tunchang pigs are known for their good performance on roughage tolerance, which may alleviate the conflict between humans and livestock for grain resources. This study observed that Tunchang pigs can adapt to a high-fiber diet containing 5% crude fiber. The adaptive alterations in intestinal microbiota and the regulation of genes collectively facilitated the digestion of high-fiber diets in the host. These findings provide insight into the roughage tolerance of Tunchang pigs, and contribute to further exploration of host-microbiota interactions.Abstract Although studies have revealed the significant impact of dietary fiber on growth performance and nutrient digestibility, the specific characteristics of the intestinal microbiota and gene regulation in pigs capable of digesting high-fiber diets remained unclear. To investigate the traits associated with roughage tolerance in the Chinese indigenous pig breed, we conducted comparative analysis of growth performance, apparent fiber digestibility, intestinal microbiota, SCFA concentrations and intestinal transcriptome in Tunchang pigs, feeding them diets with different wheat bran levels. The results indicated that the growth performance of Tunchang pigs was not significantly impacted, and the apparent total tract digestibility of crude fiber was significantly improved with increasing dietary fiber content. High-fiber diets altered the diversity of intestinal microbiota, and increased the relative abundance of Prevotella, CF231, as well as the concentrations of isobutyrate, valerate and isovalerate. The LDA analysis identified potential microbial biomarkers that could be associated with roughage tolerance, such as Prevotella stercorea, and Eubacterium biforme. In addition, appropriate high-fiber diets containing 4.34% crude fiber upregulated the mRNA expressions of PYY, AQP8, and SLC5A8, while downregulating the mRNA expressions of CKM and CNN1.This indicated that appropriate high-fiber diets may inhibit intestine motility and increase the absorption of water and SCFAs.

AB  - Based on micro-panel data from Sichuan Province and Jiangsu Province collected in 2022 and 2023, multiple linear regression models are used to explore the impact of different industrial organization models on the green transformation of pig farming. The study found that the participation of pig farmers in pig industrialization organizations significantly promotes the green transformation, particularly in the input factors at the front and middle stages of pig farming, but has no significant impact on the final stage. The "company+farmer" model significantly promotes the green transformation of pig farming, but the promotion effect of the "cooperative+farmer" model is minimal. Further, industrialized organizations mainly promote green transformation by improving farmers' breeding technology, reducing financing constraints, and decreasing medical and epidemic prevention costs. In addition, livestock socialization services lessen the role of industrialized organizations in contributing to the green transformation. Finally, different types of industrialized organizations can significantly promote green transformation for farmers without implementing the planting and breeding cycle.

AB  - Exogenous nitrogen (N) addition serves as a pivotal nutrient management strategy, significantly enhancing agricultural production by regulating soil N availability and retention. However, the dynamics of soil organic nitrogen (SON) fractions in response to various forms of exogenous N addition across differing soil fertility levels remain inadequately understood. This study utilized data from a 25-year fertilization experiment and a 15 N cross- labeling experiment in Northeast China to assess and quantify the effects of mineral N fertilizers and organic materials (manure and straw) on SON fractions in NPK (mineral fertilizer addition) and NPKM (NPK combined with composted pig manure) treatments. Our findings indicate that long-term incorporation of manure substantially elevates soil fertility compared to the exclusive use of mineral fertilizers. Notably, exogenous N primarily boosts soil N availability by enhancing acid-soluble organic N fractions, particularly ammonium nitrogen (AN) and amino acid nitrogen (AAN). Organic materials, particularly straw, significantly enhanced the retention of mineral fertilizer N in both NPK and NPKM treatments (9.54 % vs 10.70 %). Moreover, over 70 % of the N from straw or manure remained in the soil as stable SON fractions. While straw rapidly improves low-fertility soils, manure contributes to enhanced soil N reserves and increased crop yields. Therefore, incorporating organic matter may bolster soil N sequestration in Northeast China, which is contingent upon soil fertility and tailored fertilizer management strategies. This research elucidates the distribution and conversion of exogenous N within SON pools, facilitating optimized N management, sustaining yields, reducing farmland N pollution, and promoting agricultural sustainability.

AB  - Simple Summary Crude glycerin can be used as a substitute for some feed ingredients in white pig diets. However, there are few reports on its use in Iberian crossbred pigs. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of three levels of crude glycerin (0, 50, and 100 g/kg) on performance parameters, nutrient digestibility, and blood parameters of Iberian x Duroc pigs during the last phase of fattening. The results show that the addition of glycerin did not affect average daily gain, average feed intake, or feed conversion ratio. Digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein and serum parameter concentrations were statistically similar among the evaluated treatments. It is concluded that crude glycerin up to 100 g/kg could be included in the diets of Iberian pigs for the last fattening phase with no negative effects. A total of 192 Iberian x Duroc pigs kept under intensive conditions were used to investigate the effects of feeding crude glycerin on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and blood parameters. Animals were blocked by initial body weight (96.0 +/- 11.3 kg) and allotted to pens (16 pigs per pen). Pens were assigned randomly to one of three dietary treatments (four pens per treatment). Dietary treatments contained 0, 5, or 10% of crude glycerin proportionally substituting for wheat (G0, G5, and G10, respectively). Diets were formulated to be isoenergetic and isoaminoacidic. No significant effect of crude glycerin was observed on average daily gain, average feed intake, or feed conversion ratio. The apparent total tract digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein was no different between treatments. Total serum protein, albumin, glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 were not affected by glycerin inclusion. In conclusion, crude glycerin up to 100 g/kg can be included in the diets of finishing Iberian crossbred pigs without any negative effect on growth performance, digestibility, or serum metabolic parameters.

AB  - An uncommonly continuous Lower Jurassic (uppermost Sinemurian and Pliensbachian) section (Llanbedr (Mochras Farm) Borehole, Cardigan Bay Basin, UK) comprises hemipelagic calcareous mudstone, wackestone/ siltstone and subordinate packstone/sandstone. Some beds show bigradational grading, and their sedimentary structures are typical of contourite drift facies. On the basis of the long-term persistence and stability of the currents that formed these deposits, sedimentation was likely controlled by thermohaline-driven geostrophic contour currents circulating between the Boreal ocean and Peri-Tethys through the narrow and relatively deep Cardigan Bay Basin (Cardigan Bay Strait). Trace fossils are strongly dominated by Phycosiphon incertum, which was produced by opportunistic colonizers. Thalassinoides, Schaubcylindrichnus and Teichichnus are common, accompanied by less common Zoophycos, Planolites, Palaeophycus, Trichichnus and dwelling structures such as cf. Polykladichnus, Siphonichnus and Skolithos. The ichnofabrics are usually simple, which results from generally high rates of deposition, unstable, water-saturated soft-ground substrate, and the domination of well-adapted Phycosiphon, but there are also cyclic appearances of more complex ichnofabrics with dwelling structures, reflecting more stable bottom conditions. A new detailed analysis of the core has allowed cycles to be distinguished based on combination of ichnological and sedimentological features, pointing to distinct cyclicity of oceanographic mechanisms influenced by orbital forcing and driving the inferred fluctuations in benthic life conditions, controlled mainly by variation in contour current intensity and oxygenation of bottom water reflected by trace fossils. The ichnological cycles show four-order hierarchy, which can be attributed to the orbital cycles: precession and obliquity (4th order), short eccentricity (3rd order), and long eccentricity (2nd order). The longest (similar to 2.5 Myr) 1st order cyclicity is attributable to the longer "grand orbital cycles" (period related to the Earth-Mars secular resonance), with long-term impacts on palaeoclimatic and oceanic circulation dynamics, and is recorded in large-scale changes in ichnodiversity, correlating with long-term changes of clay minerals and carbonate content. Possibly, there is also similar to 9 Myr cyclicity, expressed in observed modulation of frequency of precession cycles by eccentricity. Harmonic analysis of the cyclicity gives high confidence of orbital signals and allows refined estimation of duration of the Pliensbachian (similar to 8.4 Myr) and the jamesoni (similar to 2.8 Myr), ibex (similar to 2.0 Myr), davoei (similar to 0.47 Myr), margaritatus (similar to 2.33 Myr) and spinatum zones (similar to 0.8 Myr) with an overall stable sedimentation rate of 4.5-5.1 cm/kyr. Obtained durations show improved fit between 2nd-4th and 1st order cycle and removes the problem of an anomalously long duration and resulting much lower sedimentation rate for the spinatum Zone, previously obtained by other methods. A higher diversity of trace fossils is noticed in intervals enriched in smectite; most likely, this clay mineral occluded pore spaces and limited the competition from the opportunist Phycosiphon makers, allowing development of other, more specialized forms.
   The continuous, expanded ichnological record of deep-water hemipelagic/contour drift sediments is sensitive to climatic and oceanographic changes controlled by orbital cycles. The Cardigan Bay Strait played an important role in the Early Jurassic (at least Pliensbachian) oceanic circulation, providing a major link between the northern and southern part of the Laurasian Seaway (and in general between the Boreal and Peri-Tethys domains), funneling currents flowing from the north to the south.

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize and quantify microplastics (MPs) at the chlorophyll maximum layer (CML), around 30 to 60 m depth, during a cruise dedicated to the study of contaminants in plankton, the MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE project, along a north-south transect in the western Mediterranean Sea (Tedetti et al., 2023). Plankton were collected by horizontal net tows in this layer using a multinet Hydrobios Midi equipped with 60 mu m mesh-size nets. The collected plankton were fractionated through a sieve column for various later contaminant measurements and for zooplankton analysis (Fierro-Gonz ' alez et al., 2023). For all stations, samples were also fully examined for microplastics (MPs) for fractions >300 mu m. MPs were found at all stations in the CML layer (mean: 42.9 +/- 45.4 MPs m-3), of which 96 +/- 4 % were fibers. The ratios of mesozooplankton/MPs and detritus/MPs in this CML were respectively 223 +/- 315 and 2544 +/- 2268. These data are analyzed together with MPs concentrations from sea- surface sampled with a 300 mu m net-size Manta net at the same stations. Overall, our observations highlight the very high density of fibers at the CML, mainly associated with aggregates, raising the hypothesis of their interactions with marine snow. Therefore, the importance of marine snow and vertical layering will have to be considered in future MP distribution modelling efforts.

AB  - Reducing methane (CH4) is a key objective to address climate change quickly. Manure management and storage play a significant role. In this context, a real-scale trial was performed to measure the ability of the commercial additive SOP LAGOON to reduce carbon-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from liquid manure over approximately 4 months. Gas emissions were measured at a commercial dairy farm from two slurry tanks, one treated with the abovementioned product (SL) and the other used as the untreated control (UNT). After 3 and 4 months from the first additive applications, the SL storage tank showed lower and statistically significantly different emissions concerning the UNT (up to -80% for CH4 and -75% for CO2, p < 0.001), confirming and showing improved results from those reported in the previous small-scale works. The pH of the UNT tank was lower than that of the SL on two dates, while the other chemical characteristics of the slurry were not affected. In this work, SOP LAGOON proved to be an effective additive to help the farmers mitigate the contribution of stored liquid manure to global CH4 emissions, potentially improving the overall sustainability of the dairy industry.

AB  - Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), which has been reported in China, Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and Taiwan, is a causative agent of severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome. This virus has a high mortality and induces thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia in humans, cats, and aged ferrets, whereas immunocompetent adult mice infected with SFTSV never show symptoms. Anti-SFTSV antibodies have been detected in several animals-including goats, sheep, cattle, and pigs. However, there are no reports of severe fever thrombocytopenia syndrome in these animals. Previous studies have reported that the nonstructural protein NSs of SFTSV inhibits the type I interferon (IFN-I) response through the sequestration of human signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. In this study, comparative analysis of the function of NSs as IFN antagonists in human, cat, dog, ferret, mouse, and pig cells revealed a correlation between pathogenicity of SFTSV and the function of NSs in each animal. Furthermore, we found that the inhibition of IFN-I signaling and phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 by NSs depended on the binding ability of NSs to STAT1 and STAT2. Our results imply that the function of NSs in antagonizing STAT2 determines the species-specific pathogenicity of SFTSV.

AB  - Simple Summary Studies on the management factors that affect milk components at the farm level are important for understanding how to transfer the results from experimental study. Plant phenological stages and partially fresh herbage intakes affect the lactose and milk fatty acid profile. The botanical composition of the grassland partially affects the milk's phenol content. A few small relationships between plant phenols and milk colour could be of interest to explain the changes in milk colour parameters. The fatty acid profile, vitamins A and E, cholesterol, antioxidant power colour and the phenols profile of Sarda sheep milk from 11 commercial sheep flocks managed under permanent grassland were investigated. In each farm, the structural and managerial data and milk samples were collected during four periods (sampling dates, SD): January, March, May, and July. Data from the milk composition (fat, protein, casein, lactose, and somatic cell count), 68 fatty acids, 7 phenols, 1 total gallocatechin equivalent, ferric reducing antioxidant power, vitamins A and E, cholesterol, degree of antioxidant protection, and the colour (b *, a * and L *) were analyzed by multivariate factorial analysis using a principal component analysis approach. A proc mixed model for repeated measurement to point out the studied factors affecting significant macro and micro milk composition was also used. Only the first five components were detailed in this paper, with approximately 70% of the explained variance detected. PC1 presented the highest positive loadings for milk lactose, de novo FA synthesis and the BH intermediate, whereas OBCFA had negative loadings values. The PC2, LCFA, UFA, MUFA, vitamins E, and DAP showed positive loadings values, while SFA had a negative value. The PC3 showed a high positive loading for total phenols and non-flavonoids. PC4 presented a high positive loading for the milk macro-composition and negative values for n-3 FAs. The PC5 is characterized by high positive loadings for the a * and L * colour parameters whereas negative loadings were detected for the milk flavonoids content. These preliminary results could help to establish future threshold values for the biomarkers in milk sourced from grazing dairy sheep in natural, permanent pasture-based diets.

AB  - Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are more likely to alter the survival and fecundity of insect pests. Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) is an important insect pest that severely affects Indian agriculture, yet the influence of elevated CO2 on population dynamics of this species is still unknown. The elevated CO2 shortened the overall development time and total lifespan of S. frugiperda in a linear fashion with increase in CO2 from 410 ppm to 550 ppm. Further, the fecundity of S. frugiperda was reduced with increasing CO2 above 490 ppm, and the mean number of eggs laid per female moth increased as the atmospheric CO2 increased from 410 ppm to 490 ppm. Therefore, elevated CO2 had a positive correlation with fecundity at 430, 460, and 490 ppm, but not at 520 and 550 ppm, indicating a threshold level between 490 and 520 ppm. These results signify that future scenario of global climate change will influence the population fitness of S. frugiperda with increasing CO2 concentrations.

AB  - Larvae of Hydrotaea species are facultative predators of larvae of other fly species on poultry farms, chicken feces, pig, and decaying carcasses. The Neotropical species H. albuquerquei occurs together with M. domestica in these environments and might be useful in the biological control of the latter. To verify the predatory capacity of H. albuquerquei larvae on the larvae of M. domestica, we varied the size of the larvae and the densities of the predators and prey under controlled laboratory conditions. Adults were collected from a poultry farm for the experiment, and the larvae they produced were reared in the laboratory. The second and third instar larvae of H. albuquerquei, when at higher densities, suppressed populations of house fly larvae when the latter were smaller than the former. This means that the functional response increases gradually with an increase in prey population density and predator size. In these conditions, one H. albuquerquei larva consumes up to 29 M. domestica larvae at high prey densities and could reduce 100% of the house fly population under a 50% prey density. This study confirmed a pattern previously observed in other predatory larvae and our results have implications for the biological control and integrated pest management programs of M. domestica in poultry and swine farms.

AB  - Mitochondria are intracellular organelles responsible for cellular respiration with one of their major roles in the production of energy in the form of ATP. Activities with increased energetic demand are especially dependent on efficient ATP production, hence sufficient mitochondrial function is fundamental. In bees, flight muscle and the brain have particularly high densities of mitochondria to facilitate the substantial ATP production required for flight activity and neuronal signalling. Neonicotinoids are systemic synthetic insecticides that are widely utilised against crop herbivores but have been reported to cause, by unknown mechanisms, mitochondrial dysfunction, decreasing cognitive function and flight activity among pollinating bees. Here we explore, using high-resolution respirometry, how the neonicotinoid imidacloprid may affect oxidative phosphorylation in the brain and flight muscle of the buff-tailed bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We find that acute exposure increases routine oxygen consumption in the flight muscle of worker bees. This provides a candidate explanation for prior reports of early declines in flight activity following acute exposure. We further find that imidacloprid increases the maximum electron transport capacity in the brain, with a trend towards increased overall oxygen consumption. However, intra-individual variability is high, limiting the extent to which apparent effects of imidacloprid on brain mitochondria are shown conclusively. Overall, our results highlight the necessity to examine tissue-specific effects of imidacloprid on respiration and energy production.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal, is used in a wide range of applications, such as plastics, electroplating process, electronics, and so forth. Due to its bioaccumulation ability, Cd can contaminate soil, water, air and food. To determine the effect of Cd exposure on the necroptosis in pig spleen and its mechanistic investigation, we constructed a model in pigs by feeding them food containing 20 mg/kg Cd. In this study, we analyzed the effects of Cd exposure on pig spleen through HE staining, Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot (WB), and principal component analysis (PCA). Results show that Cd exposure can destroy the structure and function of pig spleen, which is closely related to necroptosis. Further results show that Cd exposure can induce necroptosis through ROS-mediated activation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/Receptor-Interacting Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase 3 (STAT1/RIPK3) signaling pathway in pig spleen. Additionally, Cd exposure also can affect the stability of mitochondrial-associated endoplasmic reticulum membrane (MAMs) structure, which also contributes to the process of necroptosis. Our study provides insights into the physiological toxicity caused by Cd exposure.

AB  - Animal manure handling is an essential but challenging part of Europe's intensive agriculture. To safeguard the environment and facilitate sustainable livestock production, lower-impact manure management technologies need to be identified, evaluated and implemented. Slurry acidification has been developed to address some of the environmental challenges faced by pig farmers, such as methane and ammonia emissions, that contribute to environmental impacts such as climate change, terrestrial acidification and air fine particulate matter formation. However, the efficiency of this technology has been found to depend on local environmental and regulatory conditions. The current study compared two slurry treatment options (no treatment versus slurry acidification in storage tanks) under the climatic, agronomic and legislative conditions found in Denmark, the Netherlands and Spain using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Data for the LCA model was collected from various sources and emissions following field application and crop yields were simulated over a 100-year period using the Daisy agricultural model. To address the uncertainty in LCA modelling, parameter analyses and Monte Carlo simula-tions with 1000 iterations were conducted followed by pairwise statistical tests. The results indicated that slurry acidification reduces the impact in all countries in impact categories mostly related to direct emissions from agriculture, such as methane and ammonia. For impact categories related to the provision of materials and energy to the farm, acidification increased the impacts in some cases. Additional requirements for lime appli-cation to counteract potential soil acidification did not result in significant changes in the performance of slurry acidification. The sulphur in the applied acid as an alternative to mineral S fertiliser can in some cases reduce the environmental impact of slurry acidification, but should not be advertised as doing so per se. Introducing stricter P application limits would seem to be the preferred option compared with slurry acidification in the Netherlands, while the opposite appeared true for Denmark.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) is the first essential nutrient for tea growth. However, the effect of soil acidification on soil N cycle and N forms in tea plantation are unclear. In this study, the nitrogen contents, soil enzyme activity and N mineralization rate in acidified soil of tea plantation were measured. Moreover, the effects of soil acidification on N cycling functional genes and functional microorganisms were explored by soil metagenomics. The results showed that the NH4+-N, available N and net N mineralization rate in the acidified tea soil decreased significantly, while the NO3--N content increased significantly. The activities of sucrase, protease, catalase and polyphenol oxidase in the acidified tea soil decreased significantly. The abundance of genes related to ammonification, dissimilatory N reduction, nitrification and denitrification pathway in the acidified tea soil increased significantly, but the abundance of functional genes related to glutamate synthesis and assimilatory N reduction pathway were opposite. In addition, the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Nitrospirae, Actinomadura, Nitrospira etc. microorganisms related to nitrification, denitrification and pathogenic effect increased significantly in the acidified tea soil. The correlation results showed that soil pH and N forms were correlated with soil enzyme activity, N cycling function genes and microbial changes. In conclusion, soil acidification results in significant changes in enzyme activity, gene abundance and microorganism involved in various N cycle processes in acidified tea soil, which leads to imbalance of soil N form ratio and is not conducive to N transformation and absorption of tea trees.

AB  - Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) are among one of the most prevalent and important infectious agents, which cause a severe economic impact on pig farming worldwide. Circulation of these viruses together in the same pig population may lead to the syndemic infection with altered pathogenicity and thereby pathology and clinical manifestation of the diseases. The present study evaluated syndemic infection between PRRSV and PCV2 in the pig population reared in the backyard farms in Mizoram state of India. The syndemicity between PRRSV and PCV2 was confirmed by clinicopathological studies followed by simultaneous detection of both the viruses in tissue samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry and SYBR green-based real-time PCR / RT- PCR. The syndemicity resulted to a more severe respiratory disease in affected pigs. Pathological studies on affected pigs revealed a combined picture of hemorrhagic lesions with lymphadenopathy. The SYBR green-based absolute quantification assay estimated the PCV2 load in more quantities than that of PRRSV in all the tissues. The highest PRRSV load was detected in the lungs, while the highest PCV2 load was detected in mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes. The co-circulation of different pathogenic viruses and their persistent infections in a population is always a matter of great concern to pig producers across the world. The present findings highlighted the similar situation with syndemic infection of PRRSV with PCV2 for the first time in Mizoram, India, that caused severe respiratory disease in affected pigs.

AB  - Pigs have become an important model for agricultural and biomedical purposes. The advent of genomic engineering tools, such as the CRISPR/Cas9 system, has facilitated the production of livestock models with desired modifications. However, precise site-specific modifications in pigs through the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway remains a challenge. In mammalian embryos, the use of small molecules to inhibit non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or to improve HDR have been tested, but little is known about their toxicity. The compound RS-1 stimulates the activity of the RAD51 protein, which plays a key role in the HDR mechanism, demonstrating enhancement of HDR events in rabbit and bovine zygotes. Thus, in this study, we evaluated the dosage and temporal effects of RS-1 on porcine embryo development and viability. Additionally, we assessed the effects of its vehicle, DMSO, during embryo in vitro culture. Transient exposure to 7.5 mu M of RS-1 did not adversely affect early embryo development and was compatible with subsequent development to term. Additionally, low concentrations of its vehicle, DMSO, did not show any toxicity to in vitro produced embryos. The transient use of RS 1 at 7.5 mu M during in vitro culture seems to be the best protocol of choice to reduce the potentially toxic effects of RS-1 while attempting to improve HDR in the pig. Direct injection of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, combined with strategies to increase the frequency of targeted modifications via HDR, have become an important tool to simplify and accelerate the production of genetically modified livestock models.

AB  - Agricultural soil is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions, among which carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important greenhouse gas, impacting the global climate. In China, as a large rice-producing country, carbon sequestration and CO2 mitigation in paddy soil are crucial for the mitigation of global climate change. While biochar has been widely used in the mitigation of soil greenhouse gas emissions, the application site of biochar, i.e., whether or not it is the same as its feedstocks, may generate different effects on soil CO2 emissions due to the differences in the element and nutrient concentrations in its feedstocks, especially when applied in fertilized soil. In order to explore the effects of biochar application with different feedstocks on the mitigation of CO2 emissions from paddy soil, this experiment took paddy soil in a red soil area as the research object, using rice straw and Camellia oleifera fruit shell as raw materials to produce biochar (adding an amount of 40 g kg(-1) soil) and urea as an external nitrogen source (adding an amount of 200 mg kg(-1) soil). The effects of two different types of biochar derived from feedstocks with different producing origins on the CO2 emissions from paddy soil were studied via laboratory control incubation studies. The results showed that (1) the effects of rice straw biochar addition on the soil pH, NO3--N and total available nitrogen (AN) content were significantly higher than those of Camellia oleifera fruit shell biochar (the scale of the increase was higher by 6.40%, 579.7% and 180.1%, respectively). (2) The CO2 emission rate and cumulative emissions of soil supplemented with rice straw biochar were significantly lower than in that supplemented with Camellia oleifera fruit shell biochar (decreases of 28.0% and 27.5%, respectively). Our findings suggest that the efficiency of emission mitigation of rice straw biochar is better than that of Camellia oleifera fruit shell applied to paddy soil. While future studies considering more types of greenhouse gases will be necessary to expand these findings, this study indicates that biochar prepared from in situ feedstock can be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in rice fields, so as to ensure sustainable development and achieve energy conservation and emission reduction goals. This study will benefit future agricultural practices when choosing biochar as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy in the context of global warming, as well as other global changes following global warming, caused by elevated atmospheric greenhouse gases.

AB  - Deer antlers are the only mammalian organs that can fully regenerate, which relies on pedicle periosteum (PP). Interestingly during the growing phase, antlers themselves can regenerate partially lost antler tissue. However, what tissue type in the growing antlers fulfills this role is not known. Following antler removal during the growing phase, a "second" antler regenerates from the stump. In this study, the "second" antler growing from the cut antler base (AB) was examined in both red and sika deer. The results showed that all regenerating antlers were formed from the peripheral edge of the AB, where the antler periosteum (AnP) is located. The growth center showed a clear demarcation from the AB bone in red deer. Therefore, it is highly likely that AnP is the tissue that possesses the potential. Factors that might affect this potential were explored and the main factor was found to be AB calcification, which was controlled by rising androgens. Thus, the ultimate antler regeneration potential of the AnP was assessed through castration and repeated antler removal. The results demonstrated that the regeneration potential of AnP was somewhat limited and inferior to that of the PP. The ability of AnP to achieve partial regeneration may be evolutionarily conserved, as the regeneration of partially lost antlers within the season is secured; whereas, with PP, a new set of antlers in the next season is guaranteed. This two-level mechanism may signify how evolutionarily important it is for deer to possess reasonably intact antlers.

AB  - Livestock farming and its slurry management represent a significant contributor to global anthropogenic ammonia (NH3) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, resulting in negative impacts on the environment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of two microbial slurry additives (A1, A2) on the emissions of NH3, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as on the changes in chemical properties of slurry in a mesocosm experiment. Two different controls (C1 and C2) were established, due to differences in the methodology of the additives studied. Although the A1 treatment showed significantly (3.3 times) higher NH3 emissions than the A2 treatment, it is not evident that the additive alone is responsible for the observed differences, as (3.5 times) higher NH3 emissions were also detected in the control C1 treatment than in the C2. An opposite trend was observed for CH4 emissions, with higher average values in the A2 and C2 treatments. The differences can also be attributed to the different conditions in the use of the additive. Incubation of the A2 additive required additional water and maize grits, which diluted the slurry and changed its pH. The two additives had no impact on the emissions when compared to their respective control treatments. The results for CO2 were more nuanced with no clear trends. The treatments had a significant effect on NH3 emissions, whereas the weekly addition of pig slurry was the main contributing factor in the variation of CO2 and CH4 emissions.

AB  - Simple Summary The general objective of this study was to investigate the effect of hybrid barley and wheat in the diet of fattening pigs on the oxidative stability of pork related to the chemical composition, especially the fatty acid profile. The feeds used included 80% hybrid barley in group I, a mixture of 40% wheat and hybrid barley in group II, and 80% wheat in group III. The feeding trial lasted 78 days. Meat samples were taken from twelve carcasses, randomly selected, chosen from each experimental group. The meat analyses covered the physicochemical and sensory traits. The results showed a decrease in the palmitic acid concentration and an increase in the oleic acid concentration in the meat of fattening pigs fed a diet of 80% hybrid barley. The meat of these pigs was characterised by the best marbling, which was closely related to its juiciness after thermal processing and its final culinary quality. Moreover, meat samples from the hybrid barley fed pigs exhibited a reddish colour, before and after thermal processing. In summary, the addition of hybrid barley into the diets of pigs improved the quality of the culinary meat. Feed determines the quality of pork meat, in which the composition of the fatty acid (FA) profile is one of the easiest to modify by the application of selected feed components. Barley grains are considered to have an impact on meat quality, including pork; however, there are still limited data on the use of hybrid barley in fattening pigs' nutrition in relation to meat quality. The aim of this study was to determine the relation between meat quality, i.e., its oxidative stability, especially the FA profile, and fattening pigs' diets with hybrid barley and/or wheat. In group I, hybrid barley (HB) composed 80% of the feed; in group II, a mixture of (40% each) wheat and barley was used; and in group III, wheat (W) composed 80% of the feed. Meat samples were taken from twelve randomly selected carcasses chosen from each group. The meat analyses covered the physicochemical and sensory traits. The results showed that the pork meat of fattening pigs fed fodder with 80% HB had decreased palmitic acid concentrations and increased oleic acid concentrations. The meat of these pigs was characterised by the best marbling, which was closely related to its juiciness after thermal processing and determined its final culinary quality. Moreover, the meat from these pigs exhibited a reddish colour, before and after thermal processing. In summary, the application of hybrid barley into pig nutrition improved the quality of the culinary meat.

AB  - The study was performed to survey the Sarcoptic mange in sheep and the effect of infection on the local strains during a specific period in different regions of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 1745 sheep were examined clinically and were selected from the suspected cases for laboratory investigation of skin scrapings for disease diagnosis. The examined animals included (509) Naimi, (396) Najdi, (518) Hurri, and (322) Rufidi native sheep. The results showed that the infestation rate was (12.77%) in all sheep. The highest strain was recorded (17.2%, 14.3%, 9.6%, and 8.6%), respectively. The infestation was highest in sheep over two years of age (15.2%) while it was lowest in sheep under two years of age (11.2 %). In addition, the infection rate in females was higher than in males. The prevalence of mange mites in females was (14%) compared to (11.2%) in males. The highest percentage of infestation was recorded in the head region at 67.2%, followed by that in the neck (4.4%), back (16.5%), tail (11.6%), and legs (0%). The presence of mange mites was discovered by microscopic examination of deep skin scrapings of infected animals that were identified morphologically. The infection was assured by histological investigations. This study revealed that mange mite is one of the most significant sheep health constraints in Riyadh. Therefore, proper prevention measures must be implemented to take into consideration other non-host-related risk factors. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Recent advances in epitranscriptomics have unveiled functional associations between RNA modifications (RMs) and multiple human diseases, but distinguishing the functional or disease-related single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the majority of 'silent' variants remains a major challenge. We previously developed the RMDisease database for unveiling the association between genetic variants and RMs concerning human disease pathogenesis. In this work, we present RMDisease v2.0, an updated database with expanded coverage. Using deep learning models and from 873 819 experimentally validated RM sites, we identified a total of 1 366 252 RM-associated variants that may affect (add or remove an RM site) 16 different types of RNA modifications (m(6)A, m(5)C, m(1)A, m(5)U, Psi, m(6)Am, m(7)G, A-to-I, ac(4)C, Am, Cm, Um, Gm, hm(5)C, D and f(5)C) in 20 organisms (human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, maize, fruit fly, yeast, fission yeast, Arabidopsis, rice, chicken, goat, sheep, pig, cow, rhesus monkey, tomato, chimpanzee, green monkey and SARS-CoV-2). Among them, 14 749 disease- and 2441 trait-associated genetic variants may function via the perturbation of epitranscriptomic markers. RMDisease v2.0 should serve as a useful resource for studying the genetic drivers of phenotypes that lie within the epitranscriptome layer circuitry, and is freely accessible at: www.rnamd.org/rmdisease2.

AB  - Invasive plants often express above-ground traits, such as higher growth than native plants, which promote their success. This may reflect low levels of invertebrate herbivory and/or high rates of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) association. However, the root traits that contribute to invasive success are less well known. Moreover, the combined roles of above-ground herbivory, AMF, and root traits in the invasion process are poorly understood. We conducted field surveys at 17 sites along a latitudinal gradient in China (22.77 degrees N to 42.48 degrees N) to investigate the relationships among above-ground herbivory, AMF colonization, and root traits for five pairs of closely related invasive and native Asteraceae plant species. We experimentally manipulated above-ground insect feeding for two of these pairs of plant species in a middle latitude (34.79 degrees N) common garden. We measured above-ground invertebrate abundance, leaf damage, AMF colonization, root morphological traits associated with nutrient uptake, and root soluble sugar concentrations. In the field survey, invasive plants had lower leaf damage and Hemiptera abundances plus higher AMF colonization, thinner roots with more surface area and higher concentrations of root soluble sugars than native plants. Leaf damage decreased with increasing latitude for native plants. In the common garden, invasive plants had lower leaf damage and Hemiptera abundances plus higher AMF and greater surface area of fine roots than native plants. Leaf damage and Hemiptera reduced AMF colonization via a phenotypic effect of reduced fine root soluble sugars. Synthesis: Our results indicate that low above-ground invertebrate herbivory on invasive plants contributes to their success directly by increasing their growth and indirectly via root soluble sugars that increase their AMF colonization. Invasive plants appear to benefit from greater root volume and surface area, but this did not vary with latitude or above-ground invertebrate herbivory. These results highlight the importance of considering above- and below-ground processes simultaneously to understand how they interact to determine plant invasion success.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep are affected by a viral infection that causes an incurable and difficult to treat lung, joint and brain disease that decreases production efficiency. This small ruminant lentivirus is closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS in humans. Differences in breed susceptibility to disease are known in sheep that indicate genetic, or hereditary, resilience factors exist. Our objective was to study the source of this hereditary advantage so that it can eventually be translated into a tool for sheep breeders to improve herd health. Previously, one such hereditary region was detected, but little was known about possible mechanisms or nearby mutations. Here, we report several mutations that may underlie this hereditary mechanism and are in regions of DNA that are known to affect genes by increasing or decreasing gene expression, akin to gene "on/off switches." These mutations were strongly associated with a predictor of disease severity in live animals and had a greater predicted effect on the degree of disease than previously studied mutations. Statistical association (p < 0.05) of disease was demonstrated in two different groups of sheep that were reared in different environments, which indicates increased likelihood that a genetic factor is producing this effect. Small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) causes Maedi-Visna or Ovine Progressive Pneumonia in sheep and creates insidious livestock production losses. This retrovirus is closely related to human immunodeficiency virus and currently has no vaccines or cure. Genetic marker assisted selection for sheep disease resiliency presents an attractive management solution. Previously, we identified a region containing a cluster of zinc finger genes that had association with ovine SRLV proviral concentration. Trait-association analysis validated a small insertion/deletion variant near ZNF389 (rs397514112) in multiple sheep breeds. In the current study, 543 sheep from two distinct populations were genotyped at 34 additional variants for fine mapping of the regulatory elements within this locus. Variants were selected based on ChIP-seq annotation data from sheep alveolar macrophages that defined active cis-regulatory elements predicted to influence zinc finger gene expression. We present a haplotype block of variants within regulatory elements that have improved associations and larger effect sizes (up to 4.7-fold genotypic difference in proviral concentration) than the previously validated ZNF389 deletion marker. Hypotheses for the underlying causal mutation or mutations are presented based on changes to in silico transcription factor binding sites. These variants offer alternative markers for selective breeding and are targets for future functional mutation assays.

AB  - Many mammals grow up with siblings, and interactions between them can influence offspring phenotype and fitness. Among these interactions, sibling competition between different-age offspring should lead to reproductive and survival costs on the younger sibling, while sibling cooperation should improve younger sibling's reproductive potential and survival. However, little is known about the consequences of sibling effects on younger offspring life-history trajectory, especially in long-lived mammals. We take advantage of a large, multigenerational demographic dataset from semi-captive Asian elephants to investigate how the presence and sex of elder siblings influence the sex, survival until 5 years old, body condition, reproductive success (i.e. age at first reproduction and lifetime reproductive success) and long-term survival of subsequent offspring. We find that elder siblings have heterogeneous effects on subsequent offspring life-history traits depending on their presence, their sex and the sex of the subsequent offspring (named focal calf). Overall, the presence of an elder sibling (either sex) strongly increased focal calf long-term survival (either sex) compared to sibling absence. However, elder sisters had higher impact on the focal sibling than elder brothers. Focal females born after a female display higher long-term survival, and decreased age at first reproduction when raised together with an elder sister rather than a brother. Focal males born after a female rather than a male showed lower survival but higher body weight when both were raised together. We did not detect any sibling effects on the sex of the focal calf sex, survival until 5 years old and lifetime reproductive success. Our results highlight the general complexity of sibling effects, but broadly that elder siblings can influence the life-history trajectory of subsequent offspring. We also stress the importance of considering all life stages when evaluating sibling effects on life trajectories.

AB  - The microalga Scenedesmus almeriensis was produced using diluted pig slurry as the sole nutrient source during one year using a 30 m(2) thin-layer cascade photobioreactor located outdoors. Evaporation contributes significantly to the water requirements of microalgae production; approximately 1000 L of water are required to produce 1 kg of microalgal biomass. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of plastic covers to avoid or minimise water evaporation in open photobioreactors. The N-NH4+ concentrations at the inlets ranged from 40 to 100 mg L-1, depending on the experimental run. These values could not be increased because of the dark colour and turbidity of the pig slurry. The biomass productivity of the system was 17.6, 18.8, 23.4, and 17.3 g m(-2).day(-1) in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. Covering the reactors led to a decrease in biomass productivity that ranged from 8.5 to 16.9% depending on the season. However, water evaporation was reduced by 24.9-42.0% depending on the season. In summer, covering the reactors reduced the amount of water evaporated from 6.3 to 3.6 L m(-2).day(-1). In a theoretical 1 ha production facility, this would represent 2700 L of water saved per day. Overall, the processing of pig slurry using microalgae is challenging because of their variable nutrient concentration, colour and turbidity. Covering the reactors with inexpensive commercial plastics could significantly reduce the water requirements of the system.

AB  - Cotton mealy bug, Phenacoccus solenopsis (Tinsley) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is a polyphagous and invasive pest of various agricultural and horticultural crops. Aenasius bambawalei (Hayat) (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) is a biological control agent that provides most efficient control of this pest. Nutritional quality of P. solenopsis hosts affects the life history traits and parasitism rate of its parasitoids. No prior research reports are available on effects of different host plants reared P. solenopsis on biology of A. bambawalei at tri-trophic levels. In this study, the influence of cotton Gossypium hirsutum L., China rose Hibiscus rosasinensis L., and okra Abelmoschus esculentus L. reared P. solenopsis on various life traits of A. bombawalei as well as its host was assessed. Results showed that cotton was the most suitable host of P. solenopsis as developmental time, pre-oviposition, and oviposition periods were shortest with the highest nymphal body weight. Cotton reared nymphs were the best for rearing of parasitoid as females significantly took shorter time to reach maturity and also less duration for mummy formation with maximum parasitism. Higher rate of parasitism was positively associated with body weight of the nymphs, which was significantly greater when reared on cotton. It is concluded that cotton is the best suitable host for mass rearing of A. bambawalei in the biological control programs.

AB  - This contribution aimed to uncover the unique host plant-finding and spatial ecology of reproductive and diapausing Argentine stem weevil, Listronotus bonariensis, and its adaptive implications in Aotearoa-New Zealand pasture. Still-air two-armed olfactometers revealed the reproductive and diapausing L. bonariensis preferences for plant and weevil-derived volatiles. Winter-collected diapausing weevils were strongly attracted to host plant feeding damage by conspecifics and their frass. Such attraction disappeared when 20 stem weevils were added to the damaged ryegrass. This suggests that L. bonariensis on a damaged host plant above a certain density causes repellency probably avoiding over-exploitation of the host plant. Neither the weevils' sex nor related physiological condition were found to impart any significant effects. Volatile organic compound (VOC) analysis showed that phenylacetaldehyde was the only de novo synthesised herbivore-induced volatile compound found resulting from diapausing L. bonariensis feeding damage. This study therefore found that the seasonal behaviour of L. bonariensis was very closely related to that of the rice water weevil Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus and its very similar responses to phenylacetaldehyde. In both cases the compound attracts spring populations (emerging from diapause) to their host plants and conspecifics. Thereafter, as with L. oryzophilus, L. bonariensis similarly on becoming reproductive, its sensitivity to phenylacetaldehyde ceases. Such close connection between L. bonariensis and L. oryzophilus seasonal responses to phenylacetaldehyde therefore greatly reenforces the concept of evolved L. bonariensis behaviour in its native range as being relict behaviour in New Zealand's grassland ecosystem.

AB  - For a considerable period, fibroblast growth factor 12 (FGF12) was regarded as an intracellularly secreted protein, and with a paucity of research conducted on the effects of FGF12 on cell proliferation. Nevertheless, recent studies have demonstrated that FGF12 can be secreted extracellularly and exhibited bioactive properties. Given the highly conserved motifs characteristic of the FGF family that are present in FGF12, we postulated that it has the potential to stimulate cell proliferation. In this study, we validated the recombinant FGF12 protein's ability to enhance fibroblast proliferation and confer anti-apoptotic properties. The subsequent analyses were conducted using differential gene expression, KEGG pathway, RT-qPCR and Western blotting, which revealed that FGF12 stimulates fibroblast proliferation via the BMP7/Smad signaling pathway. Furthermore, in vivo experimentation with recombinant FGF12 protein revealed its potential to improve growth efficiency, augment blood glucose control and facilitate the development of longissimus lumborum in mice. Collectively, these findings afford novel insights into FGF12's unconventional secretion, its role in regulating cell proliferation, and its promise in promoting muscular development.

AB  - With a historical perspective, I reviewed the peer-reviewed scientific literature (and some gray literature, as needed) on European hare (Lepus europaeus) in the six countries already invaded by it: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. I covered the following topics: (a) Introduction, spread, and current distribution; (b) Life history, reproduction, and population dynamics; (c) Interactions with predators other than humans; (d) Interactions with scavengers; (e) Interactions with plants and herbivorous competitors; (f) Interactions with parasites and diseases; (g) Interactions with humans, including hunting, exports, and interference. Notoriously missing is the coverage of hare genetics and population dynamics and modeling. Another eyesore is the lack of an ecosystem approach to this invader, including not only biological aspects but the social-economic and cultural contexts that harbors it.

AB  - An increasing world population along with increasing human needs have raised demand for animal origin products. Moreover, high prices of conventional animal feeds have led to a demand for alternative feedstuff. Food waste can be an alternative feed ingredient. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dietary inclusion of dried hotel residues (DHR) on the growth performance, blood biochemical parameters and meat quality traits in finishing pigs. In each of the 2 trials conducted, 20 castrated male pigs were allotted into 2 treatments. In both trials, control treatment pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet without hotel residues. In the first trial, a DHR1 treatment contained 100 g DHR1/kg with meat residues (approximately 5%). In the second trial, a DHR2 treatment, contained 80 g DHR2/kg with no meat residues. Average daily feed intake tended to be lower and average daily weight gain was lower in DHR1 compared to control pigs in the first trial, while in the second no differences were detected. However, final body weight, FCR and dressing percentage were not affected in any of the two trials. Minor differences in several meat physical traits, hematological parameters were observed among treatments and trials. In conclusion, the results indicate that the dietary addition of DHR did not affect the feed utilization and the quality of the produced meat; hence, the use of DHR in pig feeding can be supported.

AB  - Foraging behaviors often involve trade-offs between predation risk and access to forage. Risk-forage trade-offs may be particularly acute for maternal female ungulates, whose nutritional needs are high and whose calves are highly vulnerable to predation. In moose, the selection of calving habitat is one way in which females can respond to these trade-offs. Our objective was to compare among-individual variation in selected habitat for maternal and nonmaternal female moose during the calving season. We hypothesized that, compared to nonmaternal females, maternal females would exhibit a greater range of variation among individuals, which may signal differential responses to risk-forage trade-offs. Meanwhile, we expected nonmaternal females to show comparatively less variation among individuals, consistent with a group primarily maximizing forage intake. To test our hypotheses, we used a path selection framework and a set of continuous remotely sensed map covariates to build predictive models and corresponding spatial predictions for maternal and nonmaternal groups. We then calculated the range of variation among individuals within each group along a relative unitless axis, which we call the "maternal difference index" and define as the divergence of predicted maternal habitat selection from nonmaternal habitat selection. We included 10,080 GPS collar locations for 24 female moose over three consecutive years. Our predictive models had high levels of accuracy (>75%) based both on independent test partitions of a nested cross-validation and on independent very high frequency (VHF) location data, each including spatial and temporal replication. Both groups of females preferred areas where primary forage species were abundant, diverse, and within foraging height. Habitat selected by the maternal group both overlapped and was broader than habitat selected by the nonmaternal group. Based on the maternal difference index, maternal individuals were less consistent in their habitat selection than nonmaternal individuals. Given that habitat selection behaviors are one way in which animals respond to potential risk-forage trade-offs and that maternal individuals in our study differed along a continuum in their selection for primary forage species, we suggest that the concept of maternal trade-offs, as it relates to habitat selection, is most useful when seen as individually determined and variable, rather than group-determined and discrete.

AB  - The nutritional value of goat milk is determined by the composition of its fatty acids, with particular importance placed on the role of unsaturated fatty acids in promoting human health. CircRNAs have been known to affect fatty acid metabolism through different pathways. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was employed to construct expression profiles of mammary tissue harvested during the dry period and peak lactation stages of dairy goats. Differentially expressed circRNAs and mRNAs were screened, revealing significantly higher expression levels of circRNA-08436 and ELOVL6 during the peak lactation period compared with the dry period. Thus, circRNA-08436 and ELOVL6 were chosen for subsequent studies. The findings demonstrated that circRNA-08436 not only promotes the synthesis of triglyceride (TAG) and cholesterol in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs), but also increases the concentrations of saturated fatty acids in the cells. Through the utilization of software prediction, the dual luciferase reporter system, and qRT-PCR, it was observed that circRNA-08436 binds to miR-195, with its overexpression reducing the expression levels of miR-195 and inhibiting TAG synthesis. In addition, circRNA-08436 upregulated the expression levels of the miR-195 target gene ELOVL6. The data also revealed that YTHDC1 facilitated the transport of circRNA-08436 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, while YTHDC2 in the cytoplasm functioned as a "reader" to identify and degrade circRNA-08436. Taken together, these findings contribute to a better understanding of the molecular regulation of fatty acid metabolism in the mammary glands of dairy goats, thus offering a sound theoretical basis for the production of high-quality goat milk.

AB  - Potassium-oxygen batteries (KOBs) are a promising energy storage technology with high theoretical energy density, low overpotential and a long cycle life. The cathode microstructure plays a significant role in the electrochemical performance of KOB. In this article, hierarchical porosity was introduced to commercially available carbon paper cathodes by thermal pretreatment in air at different pretreatment times. This pretreatment modifies the properties, such as surface area, defects, oxygen functional groups, etc. The discharge performance was determined at three different current densities, i.e., 0.1 mA/cm2, 0.5 mA/cm2, and 1.0 mA/cm2. It has been found that an increase in specific surface area with the introduction of micropores and mesopores is beneficial for the improvement in the discharge capacity by enabling homogeneous discharge product, KO2 distribution and high degrees of pore filling over the volume of the cathode. A reduction in the discharge overpotentials was observed, which is attributed to the introduction of oxygenic functional groups and defects. Samples treated for the longest pretreatment time of 24 h showed the highest discharge capacity of 5 mAh/cm2 and lowest discharge overpotential of 0.03 V.

AB  - Embryos can be produced from prepubertal donor animals using laparoscopic ovum pickup and in vitro embryo production technologies (LOPU-IVEP). Together, these tools can shorten the interval between generations, rapidly accelerating the rate of genetic gain. Here, we assessed the impact of different gonadotropin stimulation protocols in Mediterranean water buffalo heifer calves aged between 2 and 6 months old. Following gonadotropin stimulation, LOPU was performed at two-week intervals, with animals receiving different protocols on subsequent LOPUs. After collection, the cumulus-oocyte com-plexes (COCs) were matured and fertilized in vitro, and embryos were cultured to the blastocyst stage followed by transfer into synchronized adult recipients. The number and size of follicles aspirated during LOPU, the number and quality of COCs recovered, as well as cleavage, embryo development and preg-nancy rates were assessed. First, we evaluated the impact of using FSH with and without eCG (admin-istered 24-h prior to LOPU) and found that a combination of FSH and eCG was able to significantly improve embryo development rates (20.6 +/- 2.0% vs. 9.0 +/- 3.6%; P < 0.05). Second, we compared this protocol to a slow-release formulation of FSH reconstituted in hyaluronan. In addition to requiring less work to prepare the animals for LOPU, this slow-release formulation yielded numerically higher, but not statistically different, average number of recovered COCs (14.4 +/- 2.1 vs. 10.3 +/- 2.0; P > 0.05) and embryo development rates (22.9 +/- 4.7% vs. 14.1 +/- 5.2%; P > 0.05) compared to FSH given every 12 h. Next, we compared the length of gonadotropin treatment over 3-, 4-and 5-days prior to LOPU and found that as the length of gonadotropin treatment increased, although the number of COCs recovered steadily decreased (14.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 8.7 +/- 1.0 vs. 6.9 +/- 0.7; P < 0.05), the embryo development rates steadily increased (14.4 +/- 3.9 vs. 27.3 +/- 4.4 vs. 35.9 +/- 7.0; P < 0.05), presumably due to an increase in the pro-portion of large follicles at the time of LOPU. Numerically, the 4-day treatment yielded more transferrable embryos per donor per LOPU (2.70 +/- 0.5) than 3-day (1.94 +/- 0.6) and 5-day (2.25 +/- 0.5) treatments. Finally, following embryo transfer, 26 of 90 recipient females became pregnant (28.9%). Pregnancies were established from all treatments, which suggests that post-implantation development was not affected among the gonadotropin treatments assessed.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Nitrogen plays an important role in plant growth and development, with different nitrogen forms also having an impact on carbon/nitrogen metabolism. Unlike most plants, tea plants prefer ammonium over nitrate. In this paper, we focused on how different nitrogen sources regulate the carbon/nitrogen metabolism in tea plants. Tea seedlings of 'Longjing 43' were cultivated hydroponically in four different solutions (zero-nitrogen, only NH4+, only NO3- and mixed nitrogen (NH4+: NO3- = 1:1). We analyzed characteristic components of tea plants and related genes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism. Tea polyphenols and catechins representing carbon pool, increased when NO3- was supplied as the nitrogen source, and similar findings were recorded in the zero-nitrogen treatment. The expression of most catechins biosynthesis-related genes was up regulated under NO3- and zero-N treatment, that was associated with tea polyphenols and catechins changes. Compared with NO3- as the nitrogen source, NH4+ and mixed nitrogen treatments had a positive effect on the accumulation of amino acids, especially theanine, glutamate and arginine, and these components contribute to the freshness flavor of tea. The expression of ammonium-assimilation genes was also up-regulated with NH4+ supply. Under mixed nitrogen treatment, the ratio of total polyphenols to free amino acids (PP/AA) was between sole NH4+ and NO3- supply. Therefore, compared with single nitrogen source, carbon and nitrogen metabolism of tea plant was more balanced under mixed nitrogen treatment. The results suggested that NO3- as the nitrogen source promoted the biosynthesis of catechins enriching the carbon pool, whereas NH4+ supply was more conducive to nitrogen metabolism, indicating that different nitrogen sources could affect the carbon and nitrogen balance.

AB  - Many social networks exhibit community structure, where individuals form discrete subgroups. The composition of such groupings is important for numerous research directions, but their characterization is challenged by data sampling issues. In wild populations, where individuals range over large distances and observation can be limited, social data required to resolve community structure are difficult to collect. Recent studies used simulated data sets to determine the robustness of individual level network metrics under suboptimal sampling conditions, but the sensitivity of community detection algorithms to imperfect sampling has not been assessed. Here, we used simulated data sets to determine how sampling effort and skew influence the ability of three community detection algorithms (fastgreedy, walktrap and louvain) to recover the ?true? community structure of networks under two sampling regimes (field-based observational sampling and sampling through biologgers, e.g. proximity detectors). We also examined the robustness of a measure of uncertainty in estimated community structure (rcom). We based our simulated societies on contact patterns in wild male African elephants, a model system reflecting common sampling challenges of large wild populations. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the algorithms improved with increasing sampling effort and decreasing sampling skew. Under the field sampling regime, when sampling effort is constrained, mid-levels of sampling skew may provide a reasonable compromise between maximizing the mean numbers of observation per individual and minimizing sampling skew. Even with skewed data, rcom can provide a reliable measure of uncertainty in the estimated community assignments, but it should be interpreted cautiously with highly skewed data. The network structures explored represent common sampling challenges for wild populations, but unexplored sampling regimes may drive somewhat different dynamics. Our simulations indicate that adequate sampling even when skewed can be informative and maximization of the number of observations among all individuals should be a general objective. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with organic oregano (Origanum vulgare) essential oil (OEO) on the rumen microbial population, with a focus on methanogenic archaea, in lactating dairy goats. A total of nine age-matched goats (mean body weight 49 +/- 1.8 kg) were assigned to three experimental groups (n = 3 per group) in a completely randomized design. All animals were fed a basal diet consisting of a corn-based concentrate and a forage mix composed of alfalfa hay, wheat straw and corn silage. Group 1 was the control group while Groups 2 and 3 received an OEO supplement at dosages of 1 mL/day and 2 mL/day per animal, respectively, incorporated into the concentrate feed. Rumen fluid samples were collected on days 15, 30 and 45 of the feeding trial and their microbial profile was assessed using NGS analysis. The results demonstrated a reduction in the relative abundance of methanobacteria in both OEO-supplemented groups compared to the control group. Statistical analysis revealed significant differences between feeding groups and days of sampling. These findings suggest that OEO has the potential to modulate the rumen microbiome by reducing methane-producing archaeal populations. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with OEO may serve as a natural strategy to mitigate enteric methane emissions in Alpine dairy goats.

AB  - The Antarctic krill Euphausia superba is often considered an herbivore but is notable for its trophic flexibility, which includes feeding on protistan and metazoan zooplankton. Characterizing krill trophic position (TP) is important for understanding carbon and energy flow from phytoplankton to vertebrate predators and to the deep ocean, especially as plankton composition is sensitive to changing climate. We used repeated field sampling and experiments to study feeding by juvenile krill during three austral summers in waters near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Our approach was to combine seasonal carbon budgets, gut fluorescence measurements, imaging flow cytometry, and compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids. Field measurements coupled to experimentally derived grazing functional response curves suggest that phytoplankton grazing alone was insufficient to support the growth and basal metabolism of juvenile krill. Phytoplankton consumption by juvenile krill was limited due to inefficient feeding on nanoplankton (2-20 mu m), which constituted the majority of autotrophic prey. Mean krill TP and the metazoan dietary fraction increased in years with higher mesozooplankton biomass, which was not coupled to phytoplankton biomass. Comparing TP estimates using delta 15N of different amino acids indicated a substantial and consistent food-web contribution from heterotrophic protists. Phytoplankton, metazoans, and heterotrophic protists all were important contributors to a diverse krill diet that changed substantially among years. Juvenile krill fed mostly on heterotrophic prey during summer near Palmer Station, and this food web complexity should be considered more broadly throughout the changing Southern Ocean.

AB  - The Tibetan goat (Capra hircus) exhibits remarkable adaptations to high-altitude hypoxia, yet the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study integrates RNA-seq, WGCNA, and machine learning to explore gene-environment interactions (G x E) in hypoxia adaptation. Fibroblasts from the Tibetan goat and Yunling goat were cultured under hypoxic (1% O2) and normoxic (21% O2) conditions, respectively. This identified 68 breed-specific (G), 100 oxygen-responsive (E), and 620 interaction-driven (I) Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs). The notably higher number of interaction-driven DEGs compared to other effects highlights transcriptional plasticity. We defined two gene sets: Environmental Stress Genes (n = 632, E boolean OR I) and Genetic Adaptation Genes (n = 659, G boolean OR I). The former were significantly enriched in pathways related to oxidative stress defense and metabolic adaptation, while the latter showed prominent enrichment in pathways associated with vascular remodeling and transcriptional regulation. CTNNB1 emerged as a key regulatory factor in both gene sets, interacting with CASP3 and MMP2 to form the core of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Machine learning identified MAP3K5, TGFBR2, RSPO1 and ITGB5 as critical genes. WGCNA identified key modules in hypoxia adaptation, where FOXO3, HEXIM1, and PPARD promote the stabilization of HIF-1 alpha and metabolic adaptation through the HIF-1 signaling pathway and glycolysis. These findings underscore the pivotal role of gene-environment interactions in hypoxic adaptation, offering novel perspectives for both livestock breeding programs and biomedical research initiatives.

AB  - Simple Summary Lysine cell mass (LCM) is a potential protein and lysine source for pigs. However, the potential value of LCM as a lysine source for the swine diet has not been investigated. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the effects of LCM as an alternative lysine source in diets for weaning pigs. In the first experiment, an increase in dietary LCM from 0 to 1% did not affect the growth performance and diarrhea incidence of weaning pigs. However, in the second experiment, increasing the level of LCM supplementation for replacing L-lysine center dot HCl from 0% to 100% quadratically decreased the growth performance of weaning pigs such that replacing 0 to 80% of L-lysine center dot HCl with LCM had no difference in the growth performance, whereas LCM supplementation with 100% replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl decreased the average daily gain and gain to feed ratio of weaning pigs. We concluded that LCM could be included in the diet for weaning pigs as a substitute of L-lysine center dot HCl up to 2.8% and 1.76% for phase 1 and phase 2, respectively, without negative impacts on the performance of weaning pigs. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of lysine cell mass (LCM) as an alternative lysine source in diets for weaning pigs on growth performance, diarrhea incidence, and blood profiles. In experiment 1, a total of 200 weaning pigs, with an average body weight (BW) of 6.89 +/- 1.04 kg, were allotted into one of five treatments with four replicates of 10 pigs per pen in a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The dietary treatments were composed of LCM supplementation (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.0%) with partial replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl (0 to 0.8% for phase 1 diets and 0 to 0.07% for phase 2 diets). The BW and feed intake were recorded at the end of each phase (d 0 to 14 for phase 1, d 14 to 35 for phase 2), and diarrhea incidence was checked daily throughout the experimental period. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein of pigs at 2 weeks and 5 weeks to determine the blood profiles of weaning pigs. In experiment 2, a total of 144 weaning pigs with an average BW of 6.44 +/- 1.19 kg were allotted into one of six treatments with six replicates of four pigs per pen in RCBD. The dietary treatments were composed of LCM supplementation (0 to 3.5% for phase 1 diets and 0 to 2.2% for phase 2 diets) with replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl from 0 to 100%. In experiment 1, partial replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl with 0 to 1% LCM did not affect growth performance and diarrhea incidence of pigs. An increase in the LCM supplementation from 0 to 1% with partial replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl had no influence on the blood urea nitrogen concentrations, whereas it resulted in a linear decrease (p < 0.05) in the serum IgG concentrations for 5 weeks. In experiment 2, increasing the dietary level of LCM with replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl quadratically decreased (p < 0.05) ADG and G-F ratio for phase 2 and G-F ratio for the overall period such that 100% replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl with LCM decreased ADG and G-F ratio of weaning pigs. An increase in the LCM supplementation with replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl tended to decrease linearly (p < 0.10) the diarrhea incidence of weaning pigs for the overall period and linearly decrease (p < 0.05) the serum IgG concentrations for 2 weeks. In conclusion, partial replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl with LCM from 0 to 1% had no negative impacts on the growth performance, but 100% replacement of L-lysine center dot HCl with LCM decreased the growth performance of weaning pigs.
   Therefore, LCM could be included in the diets for weaning pigs up to 2.8% and 1.76% for phase 1 and phase 2, respectively, as a substitute for L-lysine center dot HCl without detrimental effects on the performance of weaning pigs.

AB  - Body size is an important functional trait to animals. Caste division of eusocial insects can exert a profound influence on their interactions with environment. We investigate the intra-specific variation of body size between caste within Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) (Blattodea: Termitidae), the most common and widely distributed termite species in Taiwan Island. By utilizing specimens from the NCHU Termite Collection and WorldClim data, we describe the body size distribution pattern of O. formosanus on two castes, worker and alate, and relationship with climatic factors is examined. The body size of workers is positively correlated with latitude and elevation. The body size of alates does not correlate with latitude but is positively correlated with elevation. Temperature factors negatively affect the body size of both castes. Precipitation has a positive effect on the body size of alates and no effect on workers. Additionally, humidity and temperature fluctuations over time have divergent effects on the body size of alates and workers. The results provide evidence of trait evolution decoupling at the intraspecific level, which may be shaped by climatic factors.

AB  - The herbivore Cameraria ohridella (kingdom Animalia) and the pathogen Erysiphe flexuosa (kingdom Fungi) are considered pests and biotic stressors of Aesculus hippocastanum (chestnut trees). The impact of both pests on the accumulation of secondary metabolites in chestnut leaves was investigated. Specifically, the interactive effect of both pests on metabolite accumulation and their potential role in enhancing the resistance of chestnut trees to biological stress was the focus of this study. Aesculus hippocastanum leaves with varying degrees of Cameraria ohridella infestation and Erysiphe flexuosa infection were used in this research. Leaf samples were collected during the plant vegetative growth phase and evaluated for pest infection and secondary metabolite content. Eight main polyphenols were identified in the leaves: (1) neochlorogenic acid, (2) (-)-epicatechin, (3) procyanidin trimer A-type, (4) procyanidin tetramer A-type, (5) quercetin-3-O-arabinoside, (6) quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, (7) kaempferol-3-O-arabinoside, and (8) kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside. It was found that the accumulation of metabolites, primarily those derived from epicatechin and quercetin, during the initial vegetation phase (up to 11.05 or 09.05), strongly depended on the later degree of pest infection. The differences observed in the metabolite dynamics in the chestnut leaves, depending on the extent of infection, indicate the development of a metabolic response mechanism in chestnut trees to biological stress.

AB  - The gas-phase environment of in vitro culture system plays an important role in the development of oocytes, and oxygen concentration is one of the important factors. In the present study, we aimed to explore the effect of different oxygen concentrations (20%, 10%, 5% or 1% O-2) in yak oocyte maturation and to detect the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cell apoptosis in yak COCs. First, the maturation rate of oocytes, cleavage rate and blastocysts rate following parthenogenetic activation in the group with 5% oxygen concentration were significantly higher (p < .05) than the other groups. Then, TUNEL analysis showed that the 5% oxygen concentration group significantly inhibited apoptosis of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) compared to the other group, and the transcription and protein levels of pro-apoptotic factor Bax, HIF-1 alpha and VEGF in yak COCs significantly reduced, while anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 significantly increased. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining results indicated that HIF-1 alpha protein was mainly located in theca follicle interna, mural follicular stratum granulosum, corona radiata and ovarian stroma in the follicular ovarian tissue, while VEGF protein was mainly located in the granulosa and theca cell layers. In summary, our findings demonstrate that 5% oxygen concentration may promote maturation and inhibit apoptosis of oocytes through HIF-1 alpha-mediated VEGF expression.

AB  - Within-host parasite interactions can be mediated by the host and changes in host phenotypes often serve as indicators of the presence or intensity of parasite interactions. Parasites like helminths induce a range of physiological, morphological and immunological changes in hosts that can drive bottom-up (resource-mediated) or top-down (immune-mediated) interactions with co-infecting parasites. Although top-down and bottom-up interactions are typically studied in isolation, the diverse phenotypic changes induced by parasite infection may serve as a useful tool for understanding if, and when, these processes act in concert. Using an anthelmintic treatment study of African buffalo, Syncerus caffer, we tracked changes in host immunological and morphological phenotypes during helminth-coccidia co-infection to investigate their role in driving independent and combinatorial bottom-up and top-down parasite interactions. We also examined repercussions for host fitness. Clearance of a blood-sucking helminth, Haemonchus, from the host gastrointestinal tract induced a systemic Th2 immune phenotype, while clearance of a tissue-feeding helminth, Cooperia, induced a systemic Th1 phenotype. Furthermore, the Haemonchus-associated systemic Th2 immune phenotype drove simultaneous top-down and bottom-up effects that increased coccidia shedding by changing the immunological and morphological landscapes of the intestine. Higher coccidia shedding was associated with lower host body condition, a lower chance of pregnancy and older age at first pregnancy, suggesting that coccidia infection imposed significant condition and reproductive costs on the host. Our findings suggest that top-down and bottom-up interactions may commonly co-occur and that tracking key host phenotypes that change in response to infection can help uncover complex pathways by which parasites interact.

AB  - The global increase in population will result in increased global food production which can, in turn, lead to excessive food waste. Although composting is widely adopted for the conversion of organic waste into value-added products, there are several limitations, such as its lower efficiency in composting food waste without co-composting, the loss of nutrients, and the emission of greenhouse gases. Due to its renowned characteristics, biochar amendments are used during composting to overcome these issues; each waste should be at an appropriate level to yield good quality compost with high nutrient levels. In this study, we co-composted food waste with chicken and swine manure with varying proportions in the presence and absence of biochar to identify the ideal proportion of each raw material and the biochar. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, EC, temperature, bulk density, porosity, C:N ratio, and gaseous emissions were analyzed. The results showed that the desired quality of compost was obtained in the treatment with 5% biochar with 40%, 20%, and 20% of food waste, chicken manure, and swine manure, respectively, and 15% sawdust.

AB  - Psylloids cause severe damages to their host plants and transmit serious plant diseases for several crops in different parts of the world. The species composition and geographical distribution of psylloids in Egypt were assessed. The abundance of Heterotrioza chenopodii (Reuter, 1876) on various host plants in different ecological zones and their monthly abundance in Wadi El-Natroun were monitored throughout three successive seasons. We used a sweep net and a mechanical aspirator to survey populations of Psylloidea species from 2014 to 2017. Twenty-six psylloid species belong to four families were recorded from six geographical zones. H. chenopodii was the most widely distributed psylloid species in Egypt. The total number of species collected per zone ranged from a minimum of two at Fayoum Basin (FB) to a maximum of 15 at Lower Nile Valley and Delta (LNVD). The highest number of psylloid species were sampled from the host plant Tamarix sp. (6 species) followed by Zygophyllum sp. (5 species). The negative binomial regression analysis showed that the abundance of H. chenopodii is more dependent on host plants (chi(2)= 61.5, P<0.001) than ecological zones (chi(2) = 11.9, P = 0.018). Density of H. chenopodii inWadi El-Natroun showed a bimodal seasonal pattern with two peaks of adult abundance: spring (April) and late autumn (December). Moreover, we recorded a drop in the psylloid densities during hot (summer) and cold (winter) seasons. Additional ecological and taxonomic studies on Psylloidea are needed to conduct integrated pest management against species with economic and pharmaceutical interests.

AB  - A novel Eimeria sp. from a captive-bred bilby (Macrotis lagotis Reid, 1837) has been identified in Western Australia. The bilby was bred at the Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre, Perth, as part of the National Bilby Recovery Plan. Oocysts (n = 31) irregular blunt ellipsoidal, 17-18 x 11-12 (17.2 x 11.3); length/width (L/W) ratio 1.4-1.5 (1.5). Wall bi-layered, 0.8-1.0 (0.9) thick, outer layer smooth, c.2/3 of total thickness. Micropyle barely discernible. Oocyst residuum is absent, but 2-3 small polar granules are present. Sporocysts (n = 31) ovoidal, 7-8 x 5-6 (7.8 x 5.7); L/W ratio 1.3-1.4 (1.4). Stieda, sub-Stieda and para-Stieda bodies absent or indiscernible; sporocyst residuum present, usually as an irregular body consisting of numerous granules that appear to be membrane-bound or sometimes diffuse among sporozoites. Sporozoites vermiform with a robust refractile body. Further molecular characterization was conducted on the sporulated oocysts. At the 18S locus, it sat in a large clade of the phylogenetic tree with two isolates of Eimeria angustus from quendas (Isoodon obesulus Shaw, 1797) and the Choleoeimeria spp. It shared the highest identity with E. angustus (KU248093) at 98.84%; at the COI gene locus, it was unique and most closely related to Choleoeimeria taggarti, which is hosted by another species of marsupial, the yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes flavipes), with 90.58% genetic similarity. Based on morphological and molecular data, this isolate is a new species and named as Choleoeimeria yangi n. sp.

AB  - Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive glycogen-storage disorder resulting from an accumulation of toxic polyglucosan bodies (PGBs) in the central nervous system, which causes behavioral and neurologic symptoms in humans and other animals. In this case study, brains collected from two young adult free-ranging moose (Alces alces) cows that were seemingly blind and found walking in circles were examined by light and electron microscopy. Microscopic analysis of the hippocampus of the brain revealed inclusion bodies resembling PGBs in the neuronal perikaryon, neuronal processes, and neuropil. These round inclusions measuring up to 30 microns in diameter were predominantly confined to the hippocampus region of the brain in both animals. The inclusions tested alpha-synuclein-negative by immunohistochemistry, alpha-synuclein-positive with PAS, GMS, and Bielschowsky's staining; and diastase-resistant with central basophilic cores and faintly radiating peripheral lines. Ultrastructural examination of the affected areas of the hippocampus showed non-membrane-bound aggregates of asymmetrically branching filaments that bifurcated regularly, consistent with PGBs in both animals. Additionally, oc-synuclein immunopositivity was noted in the different regions of the hippocampus with accumulations of small granules ultrastructurally distinct from PGBs and morphologically compatible with alpha-synucleinopathy (Lewy body). The apparent blindness found in these moose could be related to an injury associated with secondary bacterial invasion; however, an accumulation of neurotoxicants (PGBs and alpha-synuclein) in retinal ganglions cells could also be the cause. This is the first report demonstrating Lafora disease with concurrent alpha-synucleinopathy (Lewy body neuropathy) in a non-domesticated animal.

AB  - In this paper, the in vivo behavior of orthopedic implants covered with thin films obtained by matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation and containing bioactive glass, a polymer, and natural plant extract was evaluated. In vivo testing was performed by carrying out a study on guinea pigs who had coated metallic screws inserted in them and also controls, following the regulations of European laws regarding the use of animals in scientific studies. After 26 weeks from implantation, the guinea pigs were subjected to X-ray analyses to observe the evolution of osteointegration over time; the guinea pigs' blood was collected for the detection of enzymatic activity and to measure values for urea, creatinine, blood glucose, alkaline phosphatase, pancreatic amylase, total protein, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase to see the extent to which the body was affected by the introduction of the implant. Moreover, a histopathological assessment of the following vital organs was carried out: heart, brain, liver, and spleen. We also assessed implanted bone with adjacent tissue. Our studies did not find significant variations in biochemical and histological results compared to the control group or significant adverse effects caused by the implant coating in terms of tissue compatibility, inflammatory reactions, and systemic effects.

AB  - Sperm membrane glycan-binding proteins (lectins) interact with the counterpart glycans in the oviduct, oocytes, and vice-versa. It has already been well known that specific glycans are present on oviductal epithelium and zona pellucida (ZP) in different mammalian species. Some of these glycans are necessary for oviductal sperm reservoir formation and gamete recognition. The specific binding phenomenon of lectin-glycans is one of the vital factors for successful fertilization in mammals. We hypothesized that buffalo sperm membrane glycan-binding proteins have specific glycan targets in the oviduct and ZP supporting the fertilization event. In the present investigation, sperm membrane proteins were extracted and assessed for their binding capacity with glycans using a high-throughput glycan microarray. The most promising glycan binding signals were evaluated to confirm the sperm putative receptors for glycan targets in the oviductal epithelial cells (OEC) and on ZP using an in-vitro competitive binding inhibition assay. Based on an array of 100 glycans, we found that N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), Lewis-a trisac-charide, 30-sialyllactosamine and LacdiNAc were the most promising glycans and selected for further in -vitro validation. We established an inhibitory concentration of 12 mM Lewis-a trisaccharide and 10 mg/ml Lotus tetragonolobus (LTL) lectin for the sperm-OEC binding interaction, indicating its specificity and sensitivity. We observed that 3 mM 30-sialyllactosamine, and LacdiNAc were the most competitive inhibitory concentration in sperm-ZP binding, suggesting a specific and abundance-dependent binding affinity. The competitive binding affinity of Maackia amurensis (MAA) lectin with Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-4) GlcNAc further supports the abundance of 30-sialyllactosamine on ZP responsible for sperm binding. Our findings develop the strong evidence on buffalo sperm putative receptors underlying their locking specificities with Lewis-a trisaccharide in oviduct and 30-sialyllactosamine on ZP. The functional inter-action of buffalo sperm lectins with the target glycans in OEC and ZP appears to be accomplished in an abundance-dependent manner, facilitating the fertilization event in buffaloes.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - It is well known that objectionable fibres emerge from the surface of the yarn due to the centrifugal force of the spinning device. Furthermore, the hair removal process is based on the same physical principles. However, the fibres that are >30 mu m (PcF) are the fibres that appear in the hairiness of the yarn and are eliminated by dehairing. It has always been presumed that the PcF was linearly correlated with the diameter of the fibre (MFD) in llamas, but not so in alpaca fibres. Nevertheless, there is evidence that this relationship is curvilinear and behaves the same way in both species. The objectives of this study are to explore the relationship between MFD and PcF in both llamas and alpacas, to explore the existence of a breaking point (BP) in this curvilinear relationship, and to determine the frequency of fleeces that do not require dehairing because the PcF <= 3.2%. In addition, the existence of a positive bias of coarse fibre content on the hairy surface (CFs) of the yarn to coarse fibre content within the yarn fibres (CFy) was determined, which may explain the effect of the dehairing on the prickle factor of SAC fibres. The relationship of PcF on MFD behaves the same way in alpacas and llamas. It conforms to a power distribution and presents a BP of 23 mu m, with PcF being constant before the BP and increasing significantly after it. Most animals (<= 91% of alpacas and <= 87% of llamas) are above the threshold (<= 3.2%), requiring dehairing to correct it. By means of a shaving technique on the surface of the fabric sample, it was established that the objectionable CFs content is 8.15% higher than the objectionable CFy content. In the evoked-coarse fibre in the dehaired samples, a CFs-CFy difference below 5.9% (p > 0.05) is not significantly detected by panellists. The surface MFD is more than 2.7 mu m coarser than the yarn MFD.

AB  - Livestock operations in California face livestock losses due to a range of carnivore species. Simultaneously, there is an increased call to reduce the use of lethal predator control methods and replace them with nonlethal methods. Livestock guardian dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are one such nonlethal livestock protection tool (LPT), yet research is still lacking on the factors and situations that impact their effectiveness. Using three case studies, we demonstrate the value of objective analyses that explicitly address the inherent differences in ranch management, environment, and surrounding land uses in examining livestock guardian dogs as an LPT. We used semi-structured questionnaire surveys of livestock operators to collect information on effectiveness, behavior, and producer satisfaction of LGDs protecting poultry (Gallus gallus domesticus), calves (Bovus taurus), and sheep (Ovis aries) on private and public land and in conjunction with a variety of other livestock protection tools. We aimed to address all aspects related to the use of LGDs as a means of informing livestock operators' decisions on whether LGDs are an appropriate tool for a particular operation. The case studies demonstrated the complexities involved in applying LGDs as a LPT within the context of a livestock operation. In two of the three case studies, LGDs did not entirely eliminate livestock losses yet operator satisfaction remained high.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to identify genetic variants of the TLR5 gene and the promoter methylation level with a susceptibility to brucellosis in Chinese Saanen dairy goats ( SN). We randomly collected 205 genetically unrelated animals from five Chinese goat breeds, including the Saanen dairy goat (SN, n = 67), Tibetan goat ( TG, n = 35), Chuannan black goat (CN, n = 30), Meigu goat ( MG, n = 37) and the Jianzhou big-ear goat (JZ, n = 36). A blood sample was collected from each individual and used for the detection of brucellosis, TLR5 polymorphism identification and the detection of promoter methylation. In total, twenty-four SNPs were identified in the five investigated breeds. The allele and genotype frequency of the four loci (g.435C>T, g.690G>T, g. 978A>G and g.1832A>G) were correlated with a seroprevalence of brucellosis in the SN goats. An r2 linkage disequilibrium ( LD) was detected in SN, CN, TG and MG, but not in the JZ goats. Ten methylation sites were detected on the first CpG island with DNA methylation levels ranging from 0.2% to 5.2%, and twenty- two methylation sites were found on the second methylation island with a 2.3% to 12.1% methylation. The methylation levels of the two CpG islands in the healthy SN were significantly higher than those recorded in the brucella-infected SN (p <0.05). Our findings demonstrated that genetic variations and the promoter methylation of TLR5 were associated with a brucellosis risk in SN goats. These results will be helpful for further studies of disease resistance in ruminants.

AB  - Coevolution between plants and insects is thought to be responsible for generating biodiversity. Extensive research has focused largely on antagonistic herbivorous relationships, but mutualistic pollination systems also likely contribute to diversification. Here we describe an example of chemically-mediated mutualistic species interactions affecting trait evolution and lineage diversification. We show that volatile compounds produced by closely related species of Zamia cycads are more strikingly different from each other than are other phenotypic characters, and that two distantly related pollinating weevil species have specialized responses only to volatiles from their specific host Zamia species. Plant transcriptomes show that approximately a fifth of genes related to volatile production are evolving under positive selection, but we find no differences in the relative proportion of genes under positive selection in different categories. The importance of phenotypic divergence coupled with chemical communication for the maintenance of this obligate mutualism highlights chemical signaling as a key mechanism of coevolution between cycads and their weevil pollinators.

AB  - Food availability and temporal variation in predation risk are both important determinants of the magnitude of antipredator responses, but their effects have rarely been examined simultaneously, particularly in wild prey. Here, we determine how food availability and long-term predation risk affect antipredator responses to acute predation risk by monitoring the foraging response of free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) to an encounter with a Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) in Yukon, Canada, over four winters (2015-2016 to 2018-2019). We examined how this response was influenced by natural variation in long-term predation risk (2-month mortality rate of hares) while providing some individuals with supplemental food. On average, snowshoe hares reduced foraging time up to 10 h after coming into close proximity (<= 75 m) with lynx, and reduced foraging time an average of 15.28 +/- 7.08 min per lynx encounter. Hares tended to respond more strongly when the distance to lynx was shorter. More importantly, the magnitude of hares' antipredator response to a lynx encounter was affected by the interaction between food-supplementation and long-term predation risk. Food-supplemented hares reduced foraging time more than control hares after a lynx encounter under low long-term risk, but decreased the magnitude of the response as long-term risk increased. In contrast, control hares increased the magnitude of their response as long-term risk increased. Our findings show that food availability and long-term predation risk interactively drive the magnitude of reactive antipredator response to acute predation risk. Determining the factors driving the magnitude of antipredator responses would contribute to a better understanding of the indirect effects of predators on prey populations.

AB  - Livestock feed production is one of the primary users of freshwater and arable land, and it is also in competition with human food production. Therefore, we require reconsideration of the way we use freshwater in livestock feed production. The objective of this study is to assess the impact on freshwater use of pork production by using alternative pig diets based on local feed ingredients, or by-products. We used a lifecycle approach to analyse the freshwater use associated with feed production to produce one kg of pork. We explored three feeding scenarios (STANDARD: diets commercially used in Ireland; LOCAL: diets based on ingredients grown in Ireland; and BY-PRODUCT: diets based on by-products only). We calculated the freshwater use, using the water footprint (WFP) method, and the competition for water use between food and feed production using the water use ratio (WUR) for each scenario. The WUR quantifies the maximum amount of human digestible protein (HDP) derived from food crops that could be produced on the same land, and using the same water resources, that were used to grow the feed ingredients needed to produce 1 kg of pork.The WFP of the scenarios was 2,470 L/kg pork for STANDARD, 2,492 L/kg pork for LOCAL, and 2,205 L/kg pork for BY-PRODUCT. When we considered the WUR, none of the scenarios had a value < 1 (i.e. in all scenarios, more HDP can be produced from direct cultivation of food crops rather than pork). However, the BY-PRODUCT scenario (1.4) performed better than STANDARD (1.9) and LOCAL (2.9). Beet pulp and bakery by-products had zero WFP and no edibility and were thus considered promising ingredients. Moreover, rapeseed meal had a low WFP and rapeseed meal and sunflower seed meal are not considered human edible and were considered fit for future inclusion in diets. We also concluded that both the WFP and WUR methods have separate strengths and limitations, and should thus be used in conjunction; the ideal diet is one with the minimum WFP and WUR. Consideration of human edibility of feed ingredients is an important approach which should be included in future studies. Moreover, the entire food system including dairy, beef, poultry and other competitive uses should be taken into account when considering which feed ingredients to use in pig diets.

AB  - Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) playsa centralrole in the maturation and activation of the peptide hormone ghrelin,which performs a wide range of endocrinological signaling roles. Usinga tight-binding fluorescent ghrelin-derived peptide designed for highselectivity for GOAT over the ghrelin receptor GHSR, we demonstratethat GOAT interacts with extracellular ghrelin and facilitates ligandcell internalization in both transfected cells and prostate cancercells endogenously expressing GOAT. Coupled with enzyme mutagenesis,ligand uptake studies support the interaction of the putative histidinegeneral base within GOAT with the ghrelin peptide acylation site.Our work provides a new understanding of GOAT's catalytic mechanism,establishes that GOAT can interact with ghrelin and other peptideslocated outside the cell, and raises the possibility that other peptidehormones may exhibit similar complexity in their intercellular andorganismal-level signaling pathways.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the disconnect between goat farming and its perception as a food source and determine if this is related to the way farmers value goats. We conducted a questionnaire of 1 open and 15 closed questions among (n = 23) goat producers in Bairro Boroma, Province of Tete, Mozambique, and six in-depth interviews with stakeholders of the local goat meat trading chain. The results show that goats have an economic value more than a nutritional value, meaning they preferred trading them instead of allocating them for their own consumption. Conformation and size characteristics were more relevant when buying/selling an animal. All goat producers sold live animals in their household's backyard, at an average price of USD 19.3 & PLUSMN; 4.6/per animal with an average weight of 20.23 & PLUSMN; 3.41 kg. Finally, goat producers preferred to increase their number of goats rather than cattle due to the ease of husbandry, amount of meat obtained from the carcass and reduced risk of meat spoilage post-slaughter because of their smaller size. The latter is essential within an environment lacking access to drinkable water and electric energy to support cold chain management in meat storage.

AB  - Simple Summary Silvopastoral systems support multiple uses, such as cattle grazing, timber harvesting and the provision of many ecosystem services. The management of livestock movement patterns plays a pivotal role in the sustainable use of silvopastoral systems. Uneven livestock distribution can lead to over- and under-grazed areas, negatively affecting plant and animal diversity, as well as ecosystem services. This study was conducted in a Mediterranean silvopastoral area grazed by autochthonous Sarda cattle to determine the spatial distribution and habitat selection of the cows, who were fitted with GPS tracking collars for this purpose. The total time spent by the animals in different areas was mapped to show the spatial distribution of the cattle in the landscape. Moreover, a preference index was computed for different areas and across different seasons. Overall, the areas where the animals drank and received supplementation were strongly preferred, whereas areas with predominantly rocks were strongly avoided. Grasslands were normally used in proportion to their presence in the area. Forest area was frequented by the cows more in the spring and the summer. These results, representing the first findings concerning Sarda cow grazing in silvopastoral areas, could help farmers to implement actions that help exploit the area more evenly by cows, limiting over- and under-grazing. The beef livestock system in Sardinia is based on suckler cows, often belonging to autochthonous breeds, such as the Sarda breed, and they often graze silvopastoral areas. Besides beef meat, silvopastoral systems (SPSs) provide several Ecosystem Services (ESs), such as timber provision, harvested as wood, and watershed protection. Livestock distribution is a critical factor for the sustainable use of SPSs (e.g., to avoid uneven grazing patterns) and information on patterns of spatial use are required. A study was conducted to determine: (i) the spatial distribution and (ii) the habitat selection of Sarda cattle grazing in a Mediterranean silvopastoral area. Over different seasons, 12 free-roaming adult Sarda cows were fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) Knight tracking collars to calculate an index mapping of the incidence of livestock in the landscape (LRI) and a preference index (PI) for different areas. Since the PI data were not normally distributed, the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) procedure was used for the analysis. LRI was able to represent the spatial variability in resource utilization by livestock as a LRI map. Overall, the areas where the animals drank and received supplementation were strongly preferred by the cows, reaching PI values in the summer of 19.3 +/- 4.9 (median +/- interquartile range), whereas areas with predominantly rocks were strongly avoided (the worst PI value in the spring was 0.2 +/- 0.6). Grasslands were, in general, used in proportion to their presence in the area, with slightly increased use in the spring (PI 1.1 +/- 0.5). Forest area was avoided by cows, except in the spring when it was used in proportion to their presence in the area.

AB  - There are many enclaves in the Mediterranean basin with soils contaminated with heavy metal(loid)s, most of these in natural areas of great beauty that have suffered the consequences of industrial and mining activity for years. These soils pose a risk to human and animal health due to the transfer of metal(loid)s condemning these areas to isolation. The rehabilitation by means of phytoremediation is one of the most used techniques, but phytoremediation must be part of a comprehensive strategy of steps that guide owners and administrations in the recovery of ecosystem services. An easily replicable decision-making methodology is defined, considering the initial conditions, the preferences of the decision makers or typologies from among six possibilities and the different models of use, typified in 13 categories. As a result, a landscape is obtained that integrates phytostabilization and areas with recreational and/or educational uses. Two case studies from the southeast of Spain are presented as validation, a deposit of mining sludge residues and the channel of a river contaminated by industrial discharges.

AB  - As a novel method of earth observation, video satellites can observe dynamic changes in ground targets in real time. To make use of satellite videos, target tracking in satellite videos has received extensive interest. However, this also faces a variety of new challenges such as global occlusion, low resolution, and insufficient information compared with traditional target tracking. To handle the abovementioned problems, a multi-feature correlation filter with motion estimation is proposed. First, we propose a motion estimation algorithm that combines a Kalman filter and an inertial mechanism to alleviate the boundary effects. This can also be used to track the occluded target. Then, we fuse a histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features and optical flow (OF) features to improve the representation information of the target. Finally, we introduce a disruptor-aware mechanism to weaken the influence of background noise. Experimental results verify that our algorithm can achieve high tracking performance.

AB  - We aimed to explore the effects of two different doses of Zn on the fecal microbiota in pigeons and the correlation between these effects and intestinal immune status. Zn doses affected pigeon growth performance, and pigeons in the T60 (60 mg/kg Zn) and T90 (90 mg/kg Zn) groups exhibited higher villus height and crypt depth in duodenum and ileum compared to the control group, respectively. Supplementation with Zn increased the expression of the IL8, CD798, TJP and NKTR genes (p < 0.05), while enhancing serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA concentrations compared to the control pigeons (p < 0.05). T60 treatment reduced relative Actinobacteriota abundance, while Lactobacillus spp. abundance was highest in the T90 group compared to the two other groups. The core functional genera significantly associated with immune indices in these pigeons were Rhodococcus erythropolis and Lactobacillus ponti. Our findings will help facilitate the application of dietary Zn intake in pig production.

AB  - Live capture-recapture is often considered the gold standard for estimating wildlife population size or density, but the approach can be limited by permitting requirements, required labor, welfare concerns, and biased estimates resulting from heterogeneity in individual behavior. Noninvasive genetic sampling (e.g., from fecal pellets) offers a powerful alternative approach, but this method's success varies among taxa, with little research available on its use in rodents. Here, we addressed a series of questions to develop a noninvasive genetic sampling approach for the endangered giant kangaroo rat ( Dipodomys ingens ): (1) how quickly does DNA degrade in natural conditions, (2) how many pellets are required to recover a genotype, (3) how often do multiple individuals contaminate a pooled sample from a single sampling location, and (4) how do variable and parameter estimates from noninvasive genetic sampling compare to live-trapping mark-recapture estimates? We found that fecal pellets were successfully genotyped up to 9 days (estimated probability of recovery = 0.78) after exposure to hot, arid conditions, but that rate fell precipitously soon after. Although giant kangaroo rats are territorial, multiple individuals deposited fecal pellets at the same sampling locations; however, single pellets contained sufficient DNA to recover genotypes and to identify individuals, so contamination was not a problem for this approach. Capture probabilities were lower using noninvasive genetic sampling ( = 0.26, SE = 0.01) than live trapping ( = 0.40, SE = 0.06). Population estimates were generally similar using noninvasive genetic sampling, although they were quite a bit higher ( = 64 , = 38) on one grid. Noninvasive genetic sampling can overcome many of the limitations of live-trapping for small mammals, but the approach should be tested in additional taxa and systems to provide more generalizable recommendations for sampling schemes.

AB  - Tea estates in Bangladesh are currently experiencing frequent waterlogging stress due to heavy rainfall or flooding under changing climate scenarios. The development of waterlogging-tolerant tea cultivars is, therefore, crucial for sustainable tea production with increased yield in waterlogging-affected areas. In this study, a total of two hundred tea genotypes were screened for waterlogging tolerance based on yield and quality potentials. Tea genotypes were raised at the nursery and evaluated with 13 traits at the seedling and mature stages. Descriptive and multivariate analysis of the recorded data of measured traits were performed for clustering the studied genotypes in relation to their yield and quality potential. The 200 tea genotypes were categorized into six clusters and the measured traits were classified into two groups. Cluster-5 comprised 46 closely related tea genotypes whereas other clusters-Cluster-1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 contained 39, 20, 24, 29, and 42 genotypes, respectively. PCA-biplot showed that the first two principal components (PC 1 and PC 2) cumulatively described 56.9% of total variations. From the genetic diversity analysis, the characteristics like green leaf yield (GLY), plucking points (PP), spreading of bush and number of pubescence (NP) exhibited high to moderate heritability, indicating to consider these traits as selection criteria for tea breeding program. The trait GLY showed a strong positive correlation with PP, and SBF and a negative association with PI and DR. The key quality trait, QSB had a positive correlation with SF and NP. Based on these studied descriptors, a total of 11 tea genotypes were selected, found potential for waterlogging tolerance, and can be considered for varietal improvement programs.

AB  - In response to novel anthropogenic stresses, defense strategies, including resistance, tolerance, and escape, can evolve. However, if the evolution of one or more of these strategies is limited by weak natural selection or a lack of genetic variation, then a mixed strategy (e.g., resistance and tolerance) is unlikely to evolve. To determine the mechanisms that limit the evolution of defense strategies, we studied escape from and tolerance to glyphosate herbicide in Amaranthus palmeri, an agricultural weed that has evolved glyphosate resistance. We grew A. palmeri in fields planted with corn, soybean, or no crop; manipulated their exposure to glyphosate; and measured escape and tolerance. We did not detect selection or genetic variation for glyphosate escape in any agricultural environment, suggesting that a mixed strategy of resistance and escape is unlikely to evolve in A. palmeri. We also did not detect selection for glyphosate tolerance, but there was genetic variation for tolerance in a corn crop environment, suggesting the potential for a mixed strategy of resistance and tolerance to evolve in A. palmeri in only a subset of environments. These results suggest that exposure to herbicides is unlikely to cause the widespread evolution of a mixed defense strategy in agricultural weeds.

AB  - Simple Summary Changes in feeding, rumination, and resting behaviors are directly linked with physiological disturbance and metabolic disorders in animals. Therefore, this study was designed to validate the NEDAP technology for the monitoring of behaviors in buffaloes. The current results showed that feeding, rumination, lying, and standing behaviors were precisely and noninvasively monitored by NEDAP technology than visual observation or video recording in buffaloes. In conclusion, the current finding showed that the NEDAP system can be used for monitoring behavioral variables in buffaloes. The current study aimed to investigate the monitoring behaviors of the NEDAP system in buffaloes, to evaluate the validation, accuracy, and precision over visual observation and video recording. The NEDAP neck and leg tags were attached on the left side of the neck and left front leg of multiparous dairy buffaloes (n = 30). The feeding, rumination, lying, and standing behaviors were monitored by the NEDAP system, visual observation, and video recording. The feeding time monitored by NEDAP was 25.2 +/- 2.7 higher (p < 0.05) than visual observation and video recording. However, the rumination, lying, and standing time was lower (p < 0.05) in buffaloes when monitored by the NEDAP technology than by visual observation and video recording. The Pearson correlation between NEDAP technology with visual observation and video recording for feeding, rumination, lying, and standing was 0.91, 0.85, 0.93, and 0.87, respectively. The concordance correlation coefficient between the NEDAP with visual observation and video recording was high for rumination and standing (0.91 for both), while moderate for feeding and lying (0.85 and 0.88, respectively). The Bland-Altman plots were created to determine the association between NEDAP and visual observation and video recording, showing no bias. Therefore, a high level of agreement was found. In conclusion, the current finding showed that the NEDAP system can be used for monitoring feeding, rumination, lying, and standing behaviors in buffaloes. Moreover, these results revealed that the buffalo behavior was monitored precisely using NEDAP technology than visual observation and video recording. This technology will be useful for the diagnosis of diseases.

AB  - Combined effect of the working pressure, the feed flow rate and the volume reduction ratio on the flux during ultrafiltration of goat's milk with a polyacrylonitrile membrane UF10-PAN through full factorial experimental design was studied. The multi-factorial mathematical model and response surfaces showed that the highest value of the flux was obtained at a high level of the working pressure and the feed flow rate, and low level of the volume reduction ratio. The concentration factors according to the fat content, proteins and mineral substances increased, as the lowest increase was observed with the mineral substances. The selectivity of the membrane according to the proteins achieved 97.93% at volume reduction ratio of 3.

AB  - Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) whose emission from soil can be enhanced by ruminant excretal returns in grasslands. The default (Tier 1) emission factors (EF3PRP; i.e. proportion of deposited nitrogen emitted as N2O) for ruminant excreta deposition are associated with a wide range of uncertainties and the development of country-specific (Tier 2) EF(3PRP )is encouraged. In Ireland, a Tier 2 EF3PRP has been developed for cattle excreta but no data are available for sheep. The aim of this study was to generate data to contribute to the derivation of a Tier 2 EF3PRP for sheep excreta, while assessing the effect of excreta type, grassland type and season of deposition on N2O emissions. An experiment was carried out on two sites in the west of Ireland: a managed lowland grassland (LOW) and an extensively grazed hill pasture (HILL), characterised by mineral and acid peat soils, respectively. For each season, four treatments were applied to the soil in a fully randomized block design: control (C), sheep urine (U), sheep dung (D), and artificial urine (AU). Nitrous oxide fluxes were assessed over a full year following each application of treatments, using a static chambers methodology. Results showed a brief initial peak following each application of U/AU in LOW but not in HILL. Cumulative N2O emissions were significantly higher from the lowland site. Average EF3PRP for combined excreta was negligible on both sites, thus lower than the IPCC Tier 1 EF3PRP. Causes of low emissions are likely to depend on site characteristics (e.g. soil acidity in HILL) and season of application (i.e. ammonia volatilisation in summer). This study showed very low N2O emissions from sheep excretal returns in Irish grasslands and highlighted the importance of developing Tier 2, animal-specific EF3PRP. More experimental grasslands should be assessed to confirm these results.

AB  - The sika deer population on Yakushima Island exhibits high genetic diversity despite the small size of the island. We hypothesized that the high genetic diversity of the population had been maintained by the population structure, which included several subpopulations among which gene flow was limited. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the spatial genetic structure of the population using 12 microsatellite loci. Two and four subpopulations were detected by STRUCTURE (stN and stS) and GENELAND (glN, glE, glS, and glW) software, respectively. The basic genetic structure assigned by STRUCTURE was supported by GENELAND, while stN and stS were further separated into two subpopulations (glN and glE; glS and glW, respectively) by GENELAND. All pairwise genetic differentiations between the two and four subpopulations were significant. These results demonstrated that the Yakushima population was structured into genetically distinct subpopulations. Although the location of the western boundary between stN and stS corresponded with a large river, no landscape or biological feature could be identified for the eastern boundary. We discussed the relationships between the genetic structure and management units designed by the local government and concluded that the Yakushima population should be managed based on their spatial population structures considering multiple time scales.

AB  - Simple Summary Early embryonic loss is the major cause of repeat breeding in buffalo. For successful pregnancy outcomes, proper communication between the embryo and maternal system is very important. When the embryo reaches the uterus, being semi-allogenic in origin, it has to cope from maternal immune reactions to further survive. To survive better in the maternal system, proper embryo functioning is important to give proper signals to the maternal system, and at the same time, an adequate conducive maternal environment is also required for embryonic survival. It was found that blastocyst-stage embryos release some specific molecules (such as interferon-tau), which act as signals to the maternal endometrium. To this response, several genes are modulated in the maternal system and affect expression of several genes in the embryo as well. This way, the embryo survives in the maternal system, and pregnancy continues. Understanding the molecular cross-talk between the embryo and uterine endometrium is crucial for the improvement of IVF outcomes. The present work was undertaken to investigate the effect of pre-implantation embryo on the expression profile of immune-related genes in uterine epithelial cells (UECs) and PBMCs in buffalo. UECs were isolated from slaughterhouse-derived non-gravid uteri, cultured ex vivo and characterized, and buffalo embryos were produced in vitro from slaughterhouse-derived ovaries. Embryos co-cultured with steroid-treated UECs significantly stimulated (p < 0.05) the relative mRNA abundance of PTGS2, ISG15, OAS1, MX2, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 in UECs while they significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of NFk beta IA, NFk beta 2, TNF alpha and IL1B, with no significant change in TGF beta 1 and IL10 in the co-culture of embryos with UECs. In vitro treatment of PBMCs with conditioned media (CM) derived from embryos as well as UEC-embryo co-culture upregulated the mRNA abundance of ISG15, TGF beta 1, PTGS2OAS1, MX2 and STAT1 while it downregulated IL17 and TNF alpha expression. The expression of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 was elevated in PBMCs cultured in embryo-derived CM, but there was no significant change in PBMCs cultured in UEC-embryo co-culture CM. Thus, it can be concluded that the developing embryo and its secretions modulate the expression of immune responses by inducing an anti-inflammatory action in uterine epithelial cells for acceptance of the semi-allogenic embryo in the uterus to sustain pregnancy in buffalo.

AB  - We present the most recent data on the seasonal and spatial occupation of South American sea lions (Otaria flavescens) and fur seals (Arctocephalus australis) in the Wildlife Refuge of Ilha dos Lobos (WRIL) in southern Brazil throughout the year, based on aerial photographic counts. Thirty-one aerial photographic counts were conducted between July 2019 and November 2020 to assess monthly differences in the abundance of pinnipeds in the WRIL. The results were analysed using a generalized linear model. Spatial analysis was performed using kernel density. Subadult males of South American sea lion were the most abundant pinniped in the WRIL, followed by juveniles of South American fur seal. A juvenile of Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) was also recorded. South American fur seals showed a marked seasonality, occurring only between July and October, while South American sea lions occurred year-round. Among the months analysed, September exhibited the highest mean abundance (mean 113.75; SD: & PLUSMN; 8.58), followed by August (mean 103.00; SD: & PLUSMN; 15.69). The pinnipeds were more often concentrated in the northern and central parts of the island. This study reinforces the importance of the WRIL as a haulout site for pinnipeds. Considering the seasonal occupation of the island by South American pinnipeds, monitoring is recommended prior to the development of activities in the area.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae fortified with organic selenium on the milk constituents of the local goats. Twelve does were 2.5-3 years of age and had body weight averaging 40 +/- 2.5 kg. The goats were divided randomly into two groups; each group includes six does. All goats were fed the standard ration. The treated group (G1) was administered (Saccharomyces-cerevisiae-selenium) (0.03 g/kg/bw), and was given orally for four weeks. The second control group (G2) was late without treatment, the milk samples were collected weekly. The results showed that the group G1 that there administrated Saccharomyces cerevisiae-selenium was significantly increased (P <= 0.05) in fat and lactose %, compared to the control group, while the results of physical properties of milk showed non-significant differences between the treated group and control group. From these results, it was concluded that Saccharomyces cerevisiae has synergistic activity with selenium as an organic form to improve the fat and lactose percentage of goat's milk.

AB  - Veterinary medicines are frequently used within intensive livestock husbandry and there has been a growing interest regarding their fate in the environment. However, research has seldom assessed the influence of pig slurry properties on the fate of veterinary medicines even though such an understanding is essential for a more robust environmental risk assessment. Changes within manure degradation rates have the potential to alter the concentration of antibiotics applied to land, and the outcome of the risk assessment. The aim of this work was to investigate whether commonly reported redox potentials affect the degradation rates of acetyl-salicylic acid, ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, and tylosin. The employed redox potentials were-100 mV (reduced),-250 mV (anaerobic) and-400 mV (very anaerobic). A compound specific relationship was observed where the degradation of ceftiofur, florfenicol, oxytetracycline and sulfamethoxazole was inhibited under reduced conditions over that of very anaerobic; the respective DT50 values were 0.7-1.84 h, 1.35-3.61 h, 22.2-49.8 h, 131-211 h and 35.4-94 h. In contrast, tylosin was found to degrade faster at reduced conditions over very anaerobic (DT50 6.88-19.4 h). The presented research demonstrates the importance of redox potential on degradation rates and suggests we need stringent and harmonized redox control to improve the environmental risk assessment of veterinary medicines.
   Environmental relevance and significance: Given the significant effect of anaerobic redox potentials on veterinary medicine fate tighter regulation is required in manure degradation trials.

AB  - The ocean's meso- and submeso-scales (1-100 km, days to weeks) host features like filaments and eddies that have a key structuring effect on phytoplankton distribution, but that due to their ephemeral nature, are challenging to observe. This problem is exacerbated in regions with heavy cloud coverage and/or difficult access like the Southern Ocean, where observations of phytoplankton distribution by satellite are sparse, manned campaigns costly, and automated devices limited by power consumption. Here, we address this issue by considering high-resolution in-situ data from 18 bio-logging devices deployed on southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) in the Kerguelen Islands between 2018 and 2020. These devices have submesoscale-resolving capabilities of light profiles due to the high spatio-temporal frequency of the animals' dives (on average 1.1 +-0.6 km between consecutive dives, up to 60 dives per day), but observations of fluorescence are much coarser due to power constraints. Furthermore, the chlorophyll a concentrations derived from the (uncalibrated) bio-logging devices' fluorescence sensors lack a common benchmark to properly qualify the data and allow comparisons of observations. By proposing a method based on functional data analysis, we show that a reliable predictor of chlorophyll a concentration can be constructed from light profiles (14 686 in our study). The combined use of light profiles and matchups with satellite ocean-color data enable effective (1) homogenization then calibration of the bio-logging devices' fluorescence data and (2) filling of the spatial gaps in coarse-grained fluorescence sampling. The developed method improves the spatial resolution of the chlorophyll a field description from similar to 30 km to similar to 12 km. These results open the way to empirical study of the coupling between physical forcing and biological response at submesoscale in the Southern Ocean, especially useful in the context of upcoming high-resolution ocean-circulation satellite missions.

AB  - Hyperprolific pig breeds produce particularly large litters. Birth order within these litters, reflecting the duration of the expulsion phase of farrowing, may be associated with an increased risk of birth complications that may affect the later functioning of the pig. In this study, piglets from 12 litters were weighed at birth. The first-born (FB) and the last-born piglet, that went through the longest expulsion period, were identified and selected per litter. These pigs were tested in a cognitive holeboard (HB) task, which allows simultaneous assessment of spatial working memory (WM) and reference memory (RM) performance. In the HB, the pigs learned to find hidden rewards (M & M's (R)) in 4 of 16 holes distributed in a 4 x 4 matrix. After task acquisition, a new pattern of baited holes was presented (reversal). Salivary cortisol samples were collected before and after the first reversal trial. We hypothesized that the FB piglets would be less likely to have their health and fitness compromised by the birthing process than the LB piglets. Also, the LB pigs would have lower birth weights, poorer memory performance in the holeboard, and be more stressed by the change to a new pattern of baited holes, as indicated by a more pronounced increase in salivary cortisol concentrations. Birth weights of FB and LB piglets did not differ, but mean birth weights decreased with increasing litter size. Acquisition of the WM and RM components of the HB task was similar in FB and LB pigs. When confronted with a reversed configuration of baited holes, FB and LB pigs showed an initial decrease in both WM and RM performance that was unaffected by birth order. Both groups reached high levels of performance on both memory components in the reversal phase. Switching to the reversed configuration of baited holes had no effect on salivary cortisol, i.e. it may not have stressed the pigs. The inter- visit interval, i.e., the average duration per hole visit, which is thought to reflect a pig's motivation to search for food rewards, was not differentially affected by birth order but was highly variable, presumably reflecting the influence of external conditions during training, most likely ambient temperature.

AB  - Bone and teeth, specialised bio-mineralized connective tissues, are left after the typical decomposition process of any vertebrate organism. Their analysis can reveal insights into an organism's life and retrace the history of the remains after death (also known as taphonomy), which ultimately evolves to destruction or fossilization. Studies on the taphonomy of terrestrial mammalian bio-mineralized tissues have mostly focussed on terrestrial depo-sitional environments. Here, samples submerged in the marine environment are investigated.Five archaeological bones of terrestrial mammalian species (pig and oxen) with historically known post-mortem submersion interval (PMSI) (69-316 years) and recovery sites, were analysed macroscopically, micro-scopically and by microCT. The aim was to characterize for the first time the alterations produced by marine bioeroding sponges, and to discuss their potential interdisciplinary application, with special focus on forensic investigations.The pig samples showed microanatomical preservation (Oxford Histological Index = 3-5), increased total porosity, the presence of old tissue flakes with sponge spicules and traces of bioerosion, such as papillary holes, canals and chambers with microsculptured walls. The presence of such tissue flakes suggested that, at the time of recovery, they may have been free of sediment and inhabited by live sponges. The shape of one internal chamber was identified as the ichnospecies Entobia convoluta as typically produced by shallow, warm-water Cliothosa spp. Surface analyses for further biological evidence remained inconclusive.The taphonomy of skeletal remains has always been relevant in anthropological, natural and forensic studies. In forensics, the role of taphonomy is to contribute to personal identification, cause of death and post-mortem interval (PMI). This study detected the past colonization of terrestrial mammalian bone by marine bioeroding sponges, and aimed to link the taphonomic findings to natural processes and environments. Bioeroding sponges are for the first time confirmed to colonize terrestrial mammalian bone submerged in marine environments, and to promote diagenesis through bioerosion.

AB  - Marine oxygen minimum zones play a crucial role in the global oceanic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycles as they harbor microbial communities that are adapted to the water column chemistry and redox zonation, and in turn control the water column chemistry and greenhouse gas release. These micro-organisms have metabolisms that rely on terminal electron acceptors other than O-2 and often benefit from syntrophic relationships (metabolic coupling). Here, we study chemo(auto)trophy along the redoxcline in two stratified fjords on Vancouver Island (Canada) using bacterial bacteriohopanepolyols and archaeal ether lipids. We analyze the distribution of these lipid classes in suspended particulate matter (SPM) to trace ammonia oxidation, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), sulfate reduction/sulfur oxidation, methanogenesis, and methane oxidation, and investigate ecological niches to evaluate potential links between their respective bacterial and archaeal sources. Our results show an unparalleled BHP and ether lipid structural diversity that allows tracing the major redox-driven metabolic processes at the time of sampling: Both fjords are dominated by archaeal ammonia oxidation and anammox; sulfate-reducing bacteria may be present in Deer Bay, but absent from Effingham Inlet; methanogenic Euryarchaeota and archaeal and bacterial methanotrophs are detectable at low abundance. Correlation analysis reveals distinct biomarker clusters that provide constraints on the biogeochemical niches of some orphan BHP and ether lipids such as in situ-produced adenosyl-BHPs or unsaturated archaeols.

AB  - Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) is commonly used as a plasticizer and its usage continues to increase in conjunction with plastic consumption. DBP is readily released into air, drinking water, and soil, and unfortunately, is a potent endocrine disrupter that impairs central nervous system functions. Previously DBP was found to (1) arrest the cell cycle of C17.2 neural progenitor cells (NPCs) at the G1 phase, (2) reduce numbers of newly generated neural stem cells in the mouse hippocampus, and (3) adversely affect learning and memory. Other investigators also noted DBP-mediated neurotoxic effects, but as yet, no study has addressed the adverse effects of DBP on neuronal differentiation. Data demonstrated that at 200 mu M DBP induced apoptosis in rat embryo primary neurons by increasing reactive oxygen species levels and inducing mitochondrial dysfunction. However, no significant effect was detected on neurons at concentrations of <= 100 mu M. In contrast, doublecortin/microtubule associated protein-2 (DCX/MAP2) immunocytochemistry showed that DBP at 100 mu M delayed neuronal maturation by increasing protein levels of DCX (an immature neuronal marker), without markedly affecting cell viability. Further in vivo studies confirmed that DCX+ cell numbers were significantly elevated in the hippocampus of DBP-treated mice, indicating that DBP delayed neuronal maturation, which is known to be associated with impaired memory retention. Data demonstrated that DBP might disrupt neuronal maturation, which is correlated with reduced neurocognitive functions.

AB  - Contacts between individuals are key for the spread of infectious disease. Although essential to understanding disease spread, contact rates are difficult to predict, based simply on population demographics in wildlife populations, because contact rates depend upon environmental features as well as the nature of social interactions within and between groups of individuals. We developed a detailed, behaviorally structured, individual-based model (IBM) in Netlogo to simulate contacts between- and within-groups of individual mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), a species particularly susceptible to chronic wasting disease. The model tracks contacts (defined as two individuals coming within five meters of one another), recorded as between- or withingroup depending on the social group membership of the two individuals (dyad). We parameterized the model with data from mule deer with global positioning systems (GPS) collars in east-central Alberta, Canada. Individuals move according to habitat preferences, home range attraction, and grouping behaviours. Animals were tracked at two-hour time steps and were modelled as selecting locations relative to preferred resources based on sex-specific integrated step-selection functions (iSSFs) with steps biased toward a home range centroid. Total within-group contacts increased with group size and were sensitive to changes in movement cohesion of the group and movement persistence, particularly movement cohesion. Total between-group contacts were sensitive only to the number of groups. We compared model predictions for where the locations of deer contacts occurred against an existing statistical model for the relative contact probabilities (RCP) on the same landscape (Dobbin et al. 2023). Predicted locations of deer contacts generally were consistent with higher predicted RCP values. When disease transmission is a function of contact rate, the model can be used to assess the interaction between model components (e.g., movement rates, grouping rules, home ranges, animal densities) and the spatial distribution of key natural and artificial resources that may attract deer and potentially increase disease spread.

AB  - Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are a flagship species in the regional ecosystem and their existence is increasingly threatened by habitat modification. Such circumstance caused Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC) notably in the Alipurduar district of India. This study aims to identify suitable elephant habitats essential for planning effective elephant conservation. The study employed the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique and used the resistance surface habitat suitability model in ArcGIS 10.8v software to identify suitable habitats of elephants in the Alipurduar district of India. The findings show 24.01 km(2) as very high, 110.92 km(2) as high, and 776.04 km(2) as moderately suitable habitats for elephants out of a total district area of 3383 km(2). In related with it, the study reveals that moderate and low suitability zones have the highest human and elephant deaths due to HEC. The suitable habitats of elephants are predominantly identified in the northern and central part of the district, overlapping with the elephant's corridors, protected areas (PAs) of Buxa Tiger Reserve and Jaldapara National Park. However, the surrounding area of these PAs, with increasing settlements and high anthropogenic pressure, was identified as very low suitable for elephants. The correlation matrix uses for the grid-wise values of each selected parameters with habitat suitability magnitude to show the relation between them. The study further identified that forest cover, forest core, grassland, and water bodies were positively associated with suitable habitats for elephants, whereas variables such as settlements and agricultural lands were negatively associated. We recommend the management focus on the connectivity between these PAs that may be helpful for elephant conservation.

AB  - Bioacidification of animal slurry has proven to be a good alternative to traditional acidification with sulfuric acid for reducing ammonia emissions. However, the fertiliser value of the bioacidified slurry is yet to be determined before a whole-system assessment can be made. The N fertiliser value of pig slurry either untreated or bioacidified with glucose and/or fermented brown juice (BJ) was investigated in a pot experiment with maize (Zea mays L.) grown in a greenhouse. The slurry treatments were either pre-acidified with sulfuric acid to pH 6.5 or 5.5 before bioacidification, or bioacidified without pre-acidification. Plant growth was good in all treatments, but the bioacidified treatments showed a lower mineral fertiliser equivalence (MFE) value than the non-bioacidified treatments. Average MFE values were 71 %, 62 %, 59 % and 41 % for the non-bioacidified (noC), glucose (glu), glucose and brown juice (glu + BJ20) and brown juice (BJ50) treatments respectively. This reduction was most likely caused by immobilisation of N due to the addition of easily available C from the substrates. The fertiliser value was not affected by the pH, C/N ratio and C content of the treatments, while a positive correlation was found with NH4 +-N content. Pre-acidification positively affected MFE, probably due to higher nutrient availability. Further studies on the effect of different inclusion rates of substrates for bioacidification and the effect of application method on the fertiliser value, as well as studies under field conditions, are needed before recommendations can be made about bioacidification as an alternative to traditional acidification.

AB  - Colletes bradleyi Mitchell is a rare Nearctic bee known from only three females collected within a 30-km range. Details on life history and the male form have never been reported. Our study provides the first description of the male and its diagnosis. We also present novel observations on floral associations, as well as the floral and pollinator communities in the vicinity of each encounter, to help characterize habitat targetable for future research and conservation. Findings come from five sites where we collected a total often females and eleven males. We obtained additional specimen records by examining museum materials, with one extending the range by at least 750-km. We found both sexes of C. bradleyi in direct association with the semitoxic plant Sheep Laurel, Kalmia angustifolia L. Males rapidly patrolled patches of K. angustifolia while females visited inflorescences to drink nectar and gather pollen. Previous work has shown K. angustifolia possesses key morphological features that should enhance specialist-pollinator interactions, and our findings suggest C. bradleyi is a specialist on the plant. We hope that our observations can aid in the discovery and preservation of new populations, and that future focus will be placed on evaluating the conservation status of this species.

AB  - Small Kashmir Flying Squirrel (SKFS) Eoglaucomys fimbriatus (Gray, 1837) is a resident of thick for-ests in northern parts of Pakistan. The species faces many threats in Pakistan and is listed as vulnerable in Pakistan. A camera trapping study was carried out in the Musk Deer National Park (MDNP) from 11 May to 26 June 2014, with the main purpose to study the distribution of SKFS. A total of 40 trail cameras were deployed for 1,025 trap nights in different watersheds of the park territory. The species was photo -captured at seven stations during 11 capture events. The camera-trapping results showed that SKFS was present in the central and western parts of the park. The photo-captured history of the species shows nocturnal activity between 20:00 to 3:00 hrs. Based on photo-captured data, we assume that moon phases do not affect the activity of SKFS in MDNP. Rainfall had a negative impact, while the temperature was directly correlated with the species' activity. Current research has helped to redefine this species' range, as its presence was confirmed about 38 km from the IUCN nearest declared range.

AB  - Studies on the transport of deer (Cervidae), in the UK, were published > 15 years ago. A more recent study of deer transport is required to allow for assessments and improvements to the transport of farmed deer. Sixteen deer farmers participated in a survey describing their management practices related to transport. Their responses showed that most vehicles used to transport deer were designed for other livestock. Participating farmers estimated journey times to slaughter as 1-8 h, with an arithmetic mean of 4.8 (& PLUSMN; 2.38) h. Specific concerns raised by the respondents, relating to the transport of deer, included a need for deer-specific vehicles, stop-off areas for long journeys, market locations and haulier experience. Furthermore, data were collected from two abattoirs between July 2019 and June 2020 comprising journey times, slaughter times, bruising, location of origin, vehicle type and the number of animals. In total, 4,922 deer were transported across 133 journeys (from farm to abattoir) from 61 farms. Median and range for journey length were 3.2 (0.4-9.8) h and 154.2 (7.1-462.2) km, whereas group size and time spent in the lairage were 24 (1-121) and 17.8 (10.2-68.9) h, respectively. Group size was found to be significantly associated with both the presence of bruising in a group and the amount of bruising per deer. This study provides a much-needed update on the transport of farmed deer in the UK and highlights key areas for future research including the welfare impact of transport in larger groups and for longer durations.

AB  - Fertilisers are used in agriculture to promote crop productivity. There are many nutrient sources in fertilisers, and different sources cause variation in plant defence and pest tolerance. Assessing how pests respond to different types of fertilisers is key to develop integrated pest management programs. Here, we assessed how two fertilisers applied to quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.) affected cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora Koch.) and Lygus spp. survival and reproduction. Quinoa is a newly introduced crop in the USA, and fertiliser regimes using organic or synthetic nitrogen sources are being evaluated. We quantified growth and survival of each pest on organic- and synthetic-fertilised quinoa for two varieties in cages and the open field. We also quantified gene expression associated with three phytohormones involved in chemical defence to identify potential mechanisms of treatment effects. In cages, organic-fertilised quinoa had the fewest aphids and lowest Lygus survival. However, the effects were weaker in the open field, where aphids were marginally less abundant on organic-fertilised plants and no effects of fertiliser on Lygus were observed. There was also evidence for fertiliser altering defence gene expression, suggesting a possible mechanism impacting pest behaviour and fitness. Overall, our study shows that fertilisers from different sources may provide varying levels of pest control in quinoa crops.

AB  - Soil fertility is tightly linked with herbivore pressure because it affects the nutritional status of host plants as well as the production of anti-herbivore defenses. This in turn can influence whether herbivores in different feeding guilds render plants more or less susceptible to one another. Thus, growers' fertility management choices may impact herbivores through a variety of indirect channels. We examined relationships between soil fertility and interactions between phloem-feeding and leaf-chewing herbivores on broccoli (Brassica oleracea) plants in the greenhouse, taking advantage of natural variation in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in soils from 20 working organic vegetable farms. Next, we experimentally fertilized soil in a field trial with N and/or P to examine the consequences of these nutrients for growth of and interactions between specialist and generalist herbivores. Soils on our cooperating farms varied widely in P and N concentrations, with 40% exceeding recommended pre-plant N concentrations and 90% exceeding P recommendations. In single-herbivore infestations, augmenting N in the soil increased caterpillar (Pieris rapae) growth, augmented N and P additively enhanced generalist green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) colonization, and augmented P (but not N) increased specialist cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae) growth. In dual-guild herbivore infestations, caterpillars facilitated specialist cabbage aphid growth in the absence of fertilizer, but this pattern disappeared under augmented N, and reversed under augmented P. We found that a complex web of indirect effects linked soil fertility to herbivore performance, depending on the identity of the nutrients being altered, the ecological roles of responding herbivore species (i.e., specialist versus generalist), and indirect interactions between chewing and sucking herbivores. More generally, we highlight that successful use of fertility management to improve pest resistance requires careful consideration of herbivore feeding niches and herbivore-herbivore interactions.

AB  - The increase in wild boar numbers in recent decades is partly due to the involvement of most young females in reproduction as early as their first year of life. After the rut of adult females is over, young females are still entering oestrous as they attain maturity, prolonging the rutting period by several months. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of seasonality on the growth rate of male wild boar bodies, the growth of piglet and yearling male wild boar gonads, and sperm concentration in the epididymides. We found that yearlings' weight and body length were almost constant in summer and autumn, with a sharp increase in winter. Seasonality was also reflected in the body condition index, which rose by more than 41% between summer and winter. In terms of seasonality, the testimetric dimensions again differed significantly only in winter. Sperm were recorded in piglets weighing more than 15 kg. Regardless of the time of capture, 41% of piglets were examined as juveniles, only 6%, resp. 8% of piglets reached low or medium concentration values. While 10% of all yearling males were azoospermatic (juvenile), regardless of weight, there was evidence of seasonality in the proportion of males with measurable concentrations. These concentrations gradually increased from 62.5% in summer to 78.6% in winter. No sterile male over two years of age was noted. The results show that even in wild boars, there is a culmination not only of physical characteristics in winter but also a culmination of testimetric dimensions. Sperm already occur in 15 kg of piglets, which means they can theoretically participate in the fertilisation of female piglets.

AB  - The negative impact of zearalenone (ZEN; potent estrogenic mycotoxin) exposure on buffalo embryo production has not yet been determined. In the current study, buffalo sperm and oocytes were exposed to ZEN at different concentrations during maturation. Sperms (with and without ZEN exposure) were incubated for 2 h and evaluated for motility, viability, acrosome integrity, normality, and ultrastructure. Matured oocytes exposed to ZEN were stained to determine their nuclear maturation. Further, their developmental ability was evaluated after in vitro fertilization. Our results showed the toxic effects of ZEN at high concentrations (2000 ng/mL) on different buffalo sperm parameters. The number of acrosome-intact sperm was reduced at 0 h after exposure to a concentration of >= 100 ng/mL. Furthermore, the maturation rate of buffalo oocytes (telophase I + metaphase II) was significantly decreased in ZEN-treated oocytes with a higher degeneration rate. Oocytes matured in 1000 ng/mL ZEN and subsequently exhibited considerable reduction in cleavage rate and blastocyst formation compared with control oocytes (2.6% vs. 13.1%). Moreover, the morula rate was decreased (p < 0.001) in ZEN-treated oocytes at concentrations of >= 10 ng/mL. Overall, the adverse effects of in vitro ZEN exposure on buffalo sperm parameters and oocyte meiotic progression with a notable reduction in cleavage, morula, and blastocyst rates were defined by these results. Altogether, buffaloes should be considered sensitive to ZEN exposure with respect to their reproductive function.

AB  - Habitat destruction, land conversion, and forest fragmentation over the past several decades have resulted in major declines and local extirpation of wild animal and plant species. The gray snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus brelichi) is currently listed among the 25 most endangered primate species in the world, with an estimated remaining wild population of less than 400 individuals. Given the potential negative effects of small population size on genetic diversity, we investigated how factors, such as climate, inbreeding, kinship, population structure, and effective population size, have contributed to their genetic status. We extracted DNA from 307 fecal samples and analyzed microsatellite diversity, sex-identifying genes, and the mtDNA control region in 179 wild individuals. Our analyses suggest that gray snub-nosed monkeys experienced an initial population decline during the Last Glacial Maximum, some 20,000 years ago. During the past 70 years, this species experienced a second, steeper population decline, coinciding with human activities. Their current effective population size (+/- SD) of 675 +/- 292 exceeds the remaining number of individuals in the population and has declined by 93.9%-96.7% over the past 20,000 years. Our findings highlight the need for immediate conservation and management strategies to protect this endemic and Critically Endangered primate species.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the major causes of death in the world. Medicinal plants with thrombolytic properties may be used as an alternative to modern medicines for CVDs. The present study was aimed to evaluate the thrombolytic potential of six medicinal plants available in Bangladesh using an in vitro clot lysis method where streptokinase and ethanol were used as a positive and negative control, respectively. Ethanolic extract at a dose of 10 mg/ml of Arjun tree (Terminalia arjuna), Garlic (Allium sativum), Elephant apple (Dillenia indica), Amla (Phyllanthus emblica), Yellow mombin (Spondias pinnata) and Burmese grape (Baccaurea ramiflora) showed 14.18 +/- 1.23%, 10.72 +/- 0.78%, 8.25 +/- 0.42%, 7.08 +/- 0.64%, 5.42 +/- 0.47% and 2.47 +/- 0.19% clot lysis, respectively, whereas the standard drug streptokinase lysed 41.11 +/- 0.31% clot at a dose of 30,000 IU. From the data, it is evident that ethanolic extracts of six selected medicinal plants possess a moderate to insignificant thrombolytic activities. Among these plants, Arjun tree and Garlic exhibited the highest thrombolytic activity and the Burmese grape showed the lowest thrombolytic activity. Through our study, it could be concluded that Arjun tree, Garlic, and Elephant apple might be used as traditional healing purposes of CVDs. However, further animal studies will prove the scientific justification of their uses. Conservation efforts should be given for Arjun tree, Elephant apple, Yellow mombin, Burmese grape, and Amla to save these plants from extinction in nature.

AB  - Cancer productus and Pugettia producta () have been observed in the field feeding on live teleost fishes, an unexpected behavior for the molluscivorous C. productus and the largely herbivorous P. producta. Crabs were seen employing a speculative hunting technique of pouncing on tufts of algae or open areas of sediment followed by probing with the pereopods. Such behaviors suggest that food web relationships involving crabs may be much more complex than usually assumed.

AB  - Central nervous system (CNS) development is a very complex process that can be altered by environmental stimuli such as noise, which can generate long-term auditory and/or extra-auditory impairments. We have previously reported that early noise exposure can induce hippocampus-related behavioral alterations in postnatal day (PND) 28 adolescent rats. Furthermore, we recently found biochemical modifications in the hippocampus (HC) of these animals that seemed to endure even in more mature animals (i.e. PND35) and that have not been studied along with behavioral correlates. Thus, the aim of this work was to reveal novel data about the effects of early noise exposure on hippocampal-dependent behaviors in more mature animals. Additionally, extended enriched environment (EE) housing was evaluated to determine its capacity to induce behavioral modifications, either by its neuroprotective ability or the greater stimulation that it generates. Male Wistar rats were exposed to different noise schemes at PND7 or PND15. Upon weaning, some animals were transferred to EE whereas others were kept in standard cages. At PND35, different hippocampal-dependent behavioral assessments were performed. Results showed noise-induced behavioral changes that differed according to the scheme and age of exposure used. In addition, housing in an EE was effective either in preventing some of these changes or in inducing the appearance of new behavioral modifications. These findings suggest that CNS development would be sensitive to the effects of different type of environmental stimuli such as noise or enriched housing, leading to maladaptive behavioral changes that last even until adolescence.

AB  - Background Fleas belonging to the Pulicidae are prevalent ectoparasites infesting mammals and birds in Iran. This study focused on genetically identifying and characterizing Ctenocephalides canis collected both off-host and infesting humans and various domestic animals in the country. Methods A total of 918 adult flea samples were collected from 10 sites in western and northwestern Iran between April 2018 and May 2019. Out of these, 71 specimens were found off-host, while the remaining fleas were collected from humans (121), sheep (126), goats (184), and dogs (416). Morphological identification at the genus level was performed on all fleas, and ten selected specimens selected based on the sampling sites and hosts were subjected to molecular detection at the species level by using partial amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2, as well as the cytochrome oxidase I (COXI) markers. Results The morphological identification confirmed all fleas as Ctenocephalides spp. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial partial sequences confirmed the presence of C. canis. However, molecular divergence was observed among the ten isolates based on the ITS1 and ITS2 with diversity rates estimated at 0.15% and 3.36%, respectively. Notably, the analysis of the COXI marker revealed no molecular divergence among the partial sequences representing the ten studied isolates from C. canis. Conclusions This study explores the diversity of C. canis in the western and northwestern regions of Iran, providing insights into their molecular taxonomy and potential role as disease vectors in these areas.

AB  - Understanding the carbon and nitrogen balance in a swine body can contribute greatly in quantifying and assessing greenhouse gas emissions in swine production. In this study, the carbon balance and nitrogen balance in swine were assessed using literature data and different case scenarios in the Philippines. GHG emissions from 10 backyard farms and 12 commercial farms in the country were quantified and emission per pig class from their manure management system were estimated. The routes of carbon and nitrogen in the pigs' body were presented through material balance. For nitrogen flow in the swine system, the majority of the consumed nitrogen is retained in the pigs' body and the rest is excreted in the manure. Similarly, most carbon in the swine system is retained in its body, while the rest goes out of the system by exhalation and enteric fermentation, or is excreted in the manure. The study provides a new framework for assessing the global warming potential through carbon and nitrogen balances. The output of this study could serve as a basis developing strategies for reducing GHG emissions, improving resource efficiency, and promoting sustainable livestock management.

AB  - Positron emission tomography studies using the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [11C]-UCBJ provide in vivo evidence for synaptic dysfunction and/or loss in the cingulate and frontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia. In exploring potential confounding effects of antipsychotic medication, we previously demonstrated that chronic (28-day) exposure to clinically relevant doses of haloperidol does not affect [3H]-UCB-J radioligand binding in the cingulate and frontal cortex of male rats. Furthermore, neither chronic haloperidol nor olanzapine exposure had any effect on SV2A protein levels in these brain regions. These data do not exclude the possibility, however, that more subtle changes in SV2A may occur at pre-synaptic terminals, or the post-synaptic density, following chronic antipsychotic drug exposure. Moreover, relatively little is known about the potential effects of psychotropic drugs other than antipsychotics on SV2A. To address these questions directly, we herein used immunostaining and confocal microscopy to explore the effect of chronic (28-day) exposure to clinically relevant doses of haloperidol, olanzapine or the mood stabilizer lithium on presynaptic SV2A, postsynaptic Neuroligin (NLGN) puncta and their overlap as a measure of total synaptic density in the rat prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. We found that, under the conditions tested here, exposure to antipsychotics had no effect on SV2A, NLGN, or overall synaptic puncta count. In contrast, chronic lithium exposure significantly increased NLGN puncta density relative to vehicle, with no effect on either SV2A or total synaptic puncta. Future studies are required to understand the functional consequences of these changes.

AB  - Hyphantria cunea is a significant invasive pest characterized by its polyphagous nature and robust reproductive capabilities. In the present study, the interaction between Morus alba seedlings and H. cunea larvae was revealed by combining the induced chemical defense of M. alba with the adaptive strategies of H. cunea larvae. Larval feeding damage swiftly triggers both local and systemic chemical defenses in M. alba, involving nutrients (amino acids, proteins, soluble sugars), secondary metabolites (total phenol, total flavone, tannin, lignin), and flavonoid synthesis pathways. Mild damage induced defense responses in M. alba that persisted until day 21, inhibiting the growth of a subsequent batch of H. cunea larvae after 7 days of continuous feeding. Conversely, at moderate damage levels, these induced defenses diminished by day 21, temporarily failing to affect the larval growth. In response to these defenses, H. cunea larvae significantly up-regulated the expression of most detoxification enzyme genes, which remained active throughout. Initially, some trypsin and lipase genes in the larvae were significantly up-regulated, but with prolonged feeding, gene expression shifted towards the alpha-amylase family. Feeding by H. cunea larvae can stimulate the induced chemical defense of M. alba. The H. cunea larvae can adapt to the M. alba chemical defense by modulating their digestive and metabolic detoxification mechanisms.

AB  - Context The occurrence of apoptosis due to transient oxidative damage to spermatozoa presents a significant challenge in semen preservation. At present, the addition of protective agents is the primary method for mitigating this damage and involves the addition of protective agents.Aims This study aims to elucidate the mechanism of action of cryopreservation and to identify high-quality combinatorial cryopreservation dilutions.Methods In this study, two protective agents, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and sodium alginate (SA), were combined to evaluate the effectiveness of these novel additives in protecting porcine sperm from damage during cryopreservation. The mechanism of action of the SA and BSA combination was further elucidated at the molecular level, with key proteins being identified through proteomic analysis.Key results The findings indicated that sperm treated with 2 mg/mL SA and 5 mg/mL BSA exhibited optimal motility parameters, superior functional integrity and the most effective ability to alleviate oxidative stress. Combined with proteomic data, the results suggested that these additives regulate improvements in sperm quality by mediating the activity of the PI3K-AKT pathway.Conclusions This study found that the combination of SA and BSA provides an effective protective effect for frozen sperm preservation.Implications The findings offer theoretical and technical support for the use of composite additive to protect sperm from damage, which is crucial for enhancing the quality of pig semen and improving reproductive outcomes.

AB  - Mineral development and metal smelting seriously polluted the surrounding groundwater and soil, threatening human health through the food chain. To investigate the effects of different sources of molybdenum (Mo) fertilizers on immune function of Nanjiang brown goats grazing on natural pastures under compound pollutions, fertilizing experiment was carried out in Liangshan Yi Nationality Prefecture of the Western Sichuan Plateau, China. Eighteen square hectometers of polluted meadows were fenced and were randomly divided into three groups (3 replications/group and 2 hm(2)/replication). A total of 54 healthy Nanjiang brown goats with an average BW of 31.6 +/- 1.5 kg (1 year old) were used to this 30-day test (18 goats per group). The goats from CON group, AM group, and PM group were orally supplemented with deionized water, 15 mg Mo/BW.d (ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate), and 15 mg Mo/BWd (potassium molybdate), respectively. Compared to CON group, the serum Fe content of grazing animals from AM group and PM group was 10.05% and 3.45% higher (P < 0.05), and the serum Cu content of grazing animals from AM group and PM group was 69.05% and 67.86% lower, respectively (P < 0.05). Mo fertilization significantly increased the levels of blood Hb, RBC, and PCV, and the activities of serum SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and Cp of grazing goats (P < 0.05), and also extremely decreased the MDA content of experimental goats fed Mo compared to the control goats (P < 0.05). Compared to CON group, the activities of serum IgG, IgA, IgM, IL-2, and TNE-alpha of grazing animals from AM group and PM group were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and the levels of serum IL-6 and IL-1 beta of grazing goats from AM group and PM group were extremely decreased (P < 0.05). In summary, oral Mo fertilizers can alter the contents of serum mineral elements, reduce oxidative stress, improve immune function, and relieve the toxic damage of goats grazing on contaminated natural grasslands.

AB  - The geographic mosaic of coevolution predicts reciprocal selection, the first step in coevolution, to vary with changing biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. Studying how temperature affects reciprocal selection is essential to connect effects of global warming on the microevolutionary patterns of coevolution to the ecological processes underlying them. In this study, we investigated whether temperature influenced reciprocal selection between a plant (Brassica rapa) and its pollinating butterfly herbivore (Pieris rapae). In two temperature environments (ambient and hot), we measured the phenotypes of plants and butterflies, their interactions and fitness, which we used to calculate reciprocal selection. We found a variety of traits involved in reciprocal selection in the ambient environment, but none in the hot environment. We provide experimental evidence that elevated temperature weakens reciprocal selection, which will help better predict the consequences of global warming for coevolution.

AB  - Ecologists have shown considerable interest in the spatial patterns of organism distribution and the processes responsible for their formation and maintenance. The phytophagous insects typically use chemicals in plants as host-finding cues. Because nonvolatile chemicals remain near the source, the spatial structure of plant community determines the local distribution of insects. In addition, the plant chemical accumulation due to plant-plant interaction also influences the distribution of insects. In Rumex obtusifolius, for example, the production of phenolics is mediated by conspecific interaction. Rumex plants with high phenolic concentrations are preferred by the leaf beetle Gastrophysa atrocyanea, resulting in its spatial aggregation. Although this preference of beetles for nonvolatile chemicals should be beneficial in finding host plants, there is also a cost in terms of intraspecific competition among the beetles due to aggregation on certain chemical-rich hosts. To investigate the evolutionary significance of preference for nonvolatile chemicals and the ecological consequence of spatial distribution in leaf beetles, we constructed a mathematical model for the joint evolution of two preferences for plant size and chemical condition. In the model, beetles choose a resource based on the size and chemical concentrations of plants and are exposed to resource competition. Host plants accumulate the chemicals when they interact with neighboring conspecifics, and hence the level of chemical accumulation varies depending on the species composition and spatial distribution of the plant community. As a result, beetles became more sensitive to chemicals when the host species was rare and sparsely distributed in the community. The evolution of high chemical preference caused the aggregation of beetles and hence population size declined. We proposed a potential mechanism that underlies aggregated distribution in phytophagous insects, driven by the evolution of chemical preferences in response to plant community structure.

AB  - White-nose syndrome (WNS), caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd), has led to significant mortality and species endangerment in North America. Bats in eastern China, however, carry low loads of Pd and do not exhibit disease, suggesting natural resistance. To explore potential defenses, we isolated and screened antagonistic bacteria from the wing membranes of Rhinolophus ferrumequinum for their ability to inhibit Pd growth. We employed the plate delineation isolation method to obtain 74 single strains, which were then screened for antagonistic effects through contact and non-contact inhibition experiments. A total of 18 antagonistic strains were isolated. After sequencing and comparison with the NCBI database, we identified eight known species and three unidentified species of antagonistic bacteria: Pseudomonas carnis, Buttiauxella ferragutiae, Paraburkholderia fungorum, Arthrobacter rhombi, Serratia liquefaciens, Paeniglutamicibacter gangotriensis, Brevibacterium aurantiacum, Acinetobacter lactucae, Pseudomonas sp., Brevibacterium sp., and Acinetobacter sp. Seventeen isolated strains showed varying degrees of inhibition by contact, while five species, including P. carnis, B. ferragutiae, S. liquefaciens, P. gangotriensis, and Brevibacterium sp., also inhibited Pd via non-contact mode. We utilized solid-phase microextraction coupled with GC-MS to obtain approximately 20 volatile compounds, all of which exhibited inhibitory effects on the growth of Pd, including ketones, aldehydes, and sulfur ethers. Notably, 5 ppm of 1-undecene, dimethyl trisulphide, and 2-nonanone each independently inhibited Pd growth. These findings suggest that the antagonistic strains and their VOCs might help protect bats from WNS. Understanding the interactions between Pd and skin flora, along with their VOCs, may be crucial in mitigating bats' vulnerability to WNS and developing effective mitigation strategies in the future.

AB  - The application of animal manure containing antibiotic residues as an organic fertilizer to farmlands, poses a major threat to the health of river basin ecosystems. Waste treatment processes can help reduce antibiotic pollution levels in river basins following manure application, but the overall influence of these processes remains unclear. This study evaluates the impact of manure treatment methods on the emission and subsequent river pollution caused by 14 frequently detected antibiotics in a typical pig breeding area in China, by using hypothetical scenarios method. Three scenarios were constructed based on possible fate pathways of antibiotics, representing in 47.0, 55.3, and 81.6 ton.yr(-1) antibiotic emissions into the river basin. The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) model successfully simulated the transport of antibiotics from farmland to surface water, with calibration and verification performed using hydrological station monthly data over 8 consecutive years. Field measured concentrations also verified the reliability of the model and were used to determine the most realistic scenario. In basins applied with manure, environmental antibiotic pollution is most affected by the wastewater treatment process and manure applied patterns, followed by changes in streamflow. The antibiotic pollution in manure applied areas showed significant spatial and temporal differences, resulting from the different manure application patterns. The simulated total outflow of antibiotics in the river basin accounted for 18.1% of the inflow, with the loss of target antibiotics by degradation, volatilization and sedimentation deposition in the river basin being 0.23, 0.01 and 33.2 ton.yr(-1), respectively. This study can help to clarify the environmental fate of antibiotics in the basin following manure application, provide guidance for policy makers and help to design the effective corrective interventions for reducing the environmental pollution.

AB  - Animal coloring serves several functions, including camouflage and thermoregulation. However, some individuals have anomalous coloring patterns due to excess (melanism) or deficiency (albinism, leucism, or piebaldism) in melanin production. Although these anomalies occur in several species, there are few cited cases. Here, we report the occurrence of color anomalies in three Neotropical deer species. Data were obtained from wildlife inventories, through direct observation, camera-traps, and/or deer carcasses, between 2011 and 2020, in three biomes-the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado), and the Atlantic and Amazon Rain Forests. We registered 10 individuals with anomalous coloring from Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo, Amazonas and Rondonia states; seven Mazama gouazoubira (six piebalds and one leucistic), two piebald M. americana, and one piebald M. nemorivaga. Of the registered individuals, five were males, two females, and three of undetermined sex. To our knowledge, this is the largest set of anomalous coloring data for Neotropical deer. Even with the increasing reports of anomalous coloring, little is known about the factors that may cause this and how it influences the survival of individuals and consequently wild populations.

AB  - Lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security and public health. Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting productivity and public health. Several pathogens are associated with livestock abortions but across Africa surveillance data rarely include information from abortions, little is known about aetiology and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. This paper describes outcomes from a surveillance platform established in Tanzania spanning pastoral, agropastoral and smallholder systems to investigate causes and impacts of livestock abortion. Abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers (LFO) and on to investigation teams. Events were included if the research team or LFO could attend within 72 hr. If so, samples and questionnaire data were collected to investigate (a) determinants of attribution; (b) patterns of events, including species and breed, previous abortion history, and seasonality; (c) determinants of reporting, investigation and attribution; (d) cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44), and goats (n=100) were investigated. Attribution, achieved for 19.5% of cases, was significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system, achieved through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection and application of molecular diagnostic platforms.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) supplementation on performance, nutrient apparent digestibilities, plasma metabolites, and milk quality in dairy goats. The active ingredients of MCE are sanguinarine and chelerythrine, which are from the medicinal plant (Willd.) R. Br. Dietary supplementation with MCE can increase performance and the apparent nutrient digestibility of fiber in dairy goats. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of Macleaya cordata extract (MCE) supplementation on performance, nutrient apparent digestibilities, plasma metabolites, and milk quality in dairy goats. Twenty-four lactating Guanzhong dairy goats (n = 24) were randomly divided into two groups (each containing 12 goats) in a 52-day trial: the CON group was fed a basal diet; the MCE group was fed a basal diet supplemented with 400 mg/kg MCE. The results indicated that the 4% fat corrected milk yield (4% FCM); uncorrected milk yield; milk-fat concentration; content of C4:0, C18:0, and C18:1n9c fatty acids in milk; and apparent digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) in the MCE group were significantly higher (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the lactoferrin (LTF), alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-La), and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg) of the milk and feed conversion rate (FCR) of the goats were significantly greater (p < 0.01) in the MCE group than in the CON group. In contrast, the somatic cell count (SCC) (p < 0.01), content of C14:0 fatty acids (p < 0.01) of milk, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations (p < 0.05) were significantly lower in the in the MCE goats. These results show that the feeding of MCE can increase the performance and apparent nutrient digestibility of fiber in dairy goats, improving the quality of goat milk.

AB  - Estimating population abundance is central to many ecological studies and important in conservation planning. Yet the elusive nature of many species makes estimating their abundance challenging. Abundance estimates of sea turtles, marine birds, and seals are usually made when breeding adults are ashore, while life stages spent at sea, including as juveniles, are often poorly sampled. We used a combination of high-resolution satellite tracking (Fastloc-GPS), uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys, and capture-mark-recapture approaches to assess the abundance of immature hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in a tidal lagoon of the Chagos Archipelago (Indian Ocean). We captured, marked, and released 50 turtles (48 hawksbill and 2 green turtles) prior to UAV surveys and used satellite tracking data from 27 immature turtles (25 hawksbill and 2 green turtles) to refine the estimated numbers of marked turtles available for resighting and those likely to have emigrated from the study area. We estimated a total of 339 turtles in the lagoon with a density variation at different tidal heights between 265 turtles km(-2) at high water and 499 turtles km(-2) at low water. Of these, 91% were hawksbills and 9% were green turtles. These hawksbill densities are the highest reported among 17 foraging sites recorded around the world and likely reflect successful long-term protection of turtles in the Chagos Archipelago.

AB  - Humans have altered marine ecosystems over very long-time scales and historical data is often needed to understand the true magnitude of human impacts. The Southwest Atlantic Ocean has a long history of large-scale removal of marine vertebrates due to whaling, sealing, and fishing in the past three centuries. Historical catch records are crucial in assessing the conservation status of these historically over-exploited populations and setting suitable recovery goals. However, several gaps in the history of exploitation of many populations limit our ability to judge recoveries success. This study examines the history of the Spanish fishing company, the Real Compania Maritima (Royal Maritime Company), and reconstructs its catches of marine mammals in Patagonia and on the north coast of the Rio de la Plata. The analysis of a wide range of historical sources reveals that, between the years 1790 and 1804, the Company extracted less than 100 southern right whales Eubalaena australis, some 200,000 South American fur seals Arctocephalus australis and South American sea lions Otaria flavescens, and a few southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina. Although the Company's whale catch is negligible compared to that of other nations in the same whaling grounds, the amount of fur seals and sea lions removed from the ecosystem deserves attention. This historical survey provides us with the first estimate of the catches made by the Real Compania Maritima. However, these figures only represent a small part of the extractive activities that took place in the region and further research is encouraged to assess the true dimension of human impacts on Southwest Atlantic ecosystems. The incorporation of retrospective data into ecological studies can be laborious and may have inherent biases, but it also provides valuable information for comprehending modern ecosystems and formulating appropriate conservation plans.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) are increasing worldwide, posing a threat to both humans and wildlife in terms of human injury and loss of wildlife. Understanding the temporal and spatial non-randomness of WVCs is an essential process for effective WVC management. Roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) is the most prevalent wildlife species in WVCs on Jeju Island, South Korea. This study analyzed individual temporal patterns and spatial hotspots (clusters) based on roe deer-vehicle collisions (RDVC) on Jeju Island from 2014 to 2017. RDVCs occur frequently from July to October, and RDVCs are higher in male deer than with females in all seasons, except in winter. The clusters in the high-risk periods were more regionally distributed compared to the clusters in the low-risk periods. Regardless of the period, some road sections have been identified as crucial clusters that should be given priority for road fencing to mitigate humandeer conflicts. Our findings could also provide road administrators with practical options for management such as temporarily imposing vehicle speed limits and installing signboards.

AB  - The demand for strategic and environment-friendly swine waste (SW) management is critical in the northeastern states of India, which account for 46.7% of the country's total swine population. This paper examines nutrient-rich compost production from SW with minimal negative environmental fallout, using cow dung microbiological inoculum and sawdust bulking agent for expeditious rotary drum composting. Aerobic biodegradation conducted in a rotary drum composter (RDC), raised the feedstock temperature to > 40 degrees C in just 24 h, which stimulated thermophilic decomposition. The thermophilic phase remained for 16 days in the cow dung-amended 10:1:1 (swine waste:cow dung:sawdust) trial (RDC1) versus 7 days for the sawdust-amended 10:1 (swine waste:sawdust) trial (RDC2). After 20 days, the RDC1 product exhibited superior nutritional characteristics, with a total nitrogen content of 2.52%, a significantly reduced coliform population, and an overall weight loss of 25%. These findings highlight that incorporating cow dung (10% w/w) into SW and bulking agents through RDC produces high-quality compost in just 20 days. Thus, the livestock industry benefits significantly from this laboratory-scale method of improved waste management by producing valuable bioproducts via RDC.

AB  - Cryptic colouration is a primary anti-predation strategy in herbivorous insects. Achieving crypsis often requires acquiring dietary carotenoids-tetraterpene pigments vital for plant colouration and photoprotection. Silicon (Si) accumulation in plants makes tissues tougher and less digestible for insects, but its effect on plant pigment levels remains unclear. It is also unknown whether feeding on silicified plants impairs insects' ability to sequester carotenoids and achieve crypsis. Using the model grass Brachypodium distachyon, we demonstrate that the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) larvae exhibited stunted growth and reduced carotenoid sequestration, particularly lutein, into their haemolymph when feeding on Si-supplemented (+Si) plants. This reduction led to distinct body-colour morphs: larvae feeding on +Si plants developed brown colouration, contrasting sharply with the green leaves, whereas larvae feeding on Si-free (-Si) plants exhibited green cryptic colouration that blended seamlessly with the foliage. Plant leaves contained various carotenoids (neoxanthin, violaxanthin, beta-carotene and lutein) and chlorophylls (a and b), but larvae only sequestered beta-carotene and lutein into their haemolymph while excreting substantial amounts of pigments, regardless of plant Si status. Under insect-free conditions, +Si plants had lower carotenoid and chlorophyll contents than -Si plants. However, following insect herbivory, pigment levels in -Si and +Si plants equalised. Insect herbivory also increased Si accumulation in +Si plants. Our findings provide novel evidence that plant Si defences can disrupt cryptic colouration in insect herbivores by restricting carotenoid sequestration from host plant tissues. This disruption could increase insect visibility to predators, potentially elevating their risk of predation.

AB  - Geographical variation in animals' acoustic signals has received much attention. However, few studies have compared the patterns and underlying selective forces driving geographical divergence of vocalizations with similar and different functions within the same species. Also, the social consequences of geographical divergence in acoustic signals are still rather poorly understood. Here we recorded three types of social calls of male great Himalayan leaf-nosed bats (Hipposideros armiger) across eight colonies in China. Two calls share similar functions and the third has a function distinct from the other two. We examined the patterns and causes of geographical variation of each of these calls. We found that all three calls had significant geographic variation with similar patterns of spatial variation. Only one of the two social calls with similar functions was found to be affected by genetic drift, while the other two calls were not affected by selection, drift, or morphological constraints. Furthermore, we found that bats could discriminate between vocalizations of their own colony and those of an allopatric colony. Overall, these results suggest that acoustic signals with similar functions may be shaped by different driving forces and acoustic signals with different functions may exhibit similar geographical patterns. This study expands our limited knowledge of the patterns of geographical variation of vocalizations emitted at different emotional states and highlights the importance of comparing simultaneously patterns and causes of geographical divergence of vocalizations with similar and different functions.
   This study provides the empirical evidence suggesting that calls with a similar function may fail to co-vary and alternatively calls with a different function may co-vary. Moreover, we show that bats can discriminate between calls of their own colony from those of a foreign colony. These results expand our limited knowledge of the patterns of geographical variation of vocalizations uttered under different emotional states and the nature of functional drivers that influence the evolution of communicative systems.

AB  - The endangered Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) population is declining, and its conservation is threatened by the species' low fecundity and high pup mortality. This study details reasons for pup deaths and quantifies the impacts of disease and comorbidity. Of 284 dead pups reported from five breeding seasons (2016-2022) at the Seal Bay colony, Kangaroo Island, gross necropsy was conducted on 122, with fecal analysis for hookworm (Uncinaria sanguinis) detection, tissue histology, and bacterial culture performed on subsets. Determinable primary causes of mortality were conspecific trauma (+/- comorbidity, 41.0%), starvation (24.6%), and infectious disease (hookworm-associated hemorrhagic enteritis [HAHE] +/- bacterial infection, 19.7%). Allowing for comorbidity, 37.7% of pups died with an infectious disease, including 44.0% of deaths with trauma and 41.5% with starvation. In higher mortality summer-autumn breeding seasons, pups were at greater risk of trauma (p = .001) and subsequent bacterial infection (p < .001). Parasiticide treatment significantly reduced HAHE-associated (p = .005) and overall mortality (p < .001) risk, suggesting hookworm infection increases pup susceptibility to other causes of mortality. Although the exact causal pathways for this treatment-related overall mortality benefit remain to be confirmed, intervention appears highly impactful and could benefit species conservation efforts.

AB  - Pregnancy and lactation are energetically expensive for female mammals and greatly influence the evolution of species-specific reproductive strategies. Phocid ("true" seals) lactation is generally short in duration and relies heavily on stored energy, whereas otariid (sea lions and fur seals) lactation is generally much longer, and energy is supplemented by foraging. While a phocid, the smaller body size of the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) is assumed to preclude the maintenance of lactation solely from stored energy. For this reason, their lactation strategy is believed intermediate to that of otariids and phocids. The purpose of this study was to characterize blubber fatty acids (FAs) of pregnant and lactating harbor seals and determine if lactating blubber FA profiles more closely resemble phocids or otariids. Blubber FA differences between female reproductive states (lactating, n = 18; pregnant, n = 7; non-lactating-non-pregnant, n = 17), mother-pup pairs (n = 6), and families (otariid, n = 3; phocid, n = 3) were evaluated using permutation analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). Compared to lactating females, pregnant harbor seals had elevated polyunsaturated FAs (PUFAs) and decreased monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs) in their blubber, suggesting pregnant harbor seals may prioritize PUFA storage in the blubber. Additionally, when compared to their pregnant counterparts, lactating harbor seals had lower PUFA, as well as saturated FAs (SFAs) and MUFA <= 16C, suggesting lactating harbor seals may utilize blubber FAs similar to other phocids. Lastly, while blubber SFA and MUFA concentrations may be conserved among pinniped families, PUFA concentrations among lactating phocids and otariids appear to be similar, suggesting lactating species may selectively mobilize PUFA from the blubber in a similar way despite family or lactation strategy. Understanding how family and body size influence the lactation strategy of a species provides greater insight into the physiological and behavioral limitations a species may have to both internal and external forces during such a critical time in its life history.

AB  - Although the arsenic contamination and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during composting have been studied separately, there is limited information on their interactions, particularly, the relationship between arsenic biotransformation genes (ABGs) and ARGs. Therefore, the present study used different forms of arsenic stress (organic and inorganic arsenic at 10 and 50 mg/kg) in pig manure and straw co-composting, to evaluate the effects of arsenic stress on microbial community structures, metabolic function, ABGs, and ARGs. The results showed that arsenic stress had different effects on different parameters and promoted the microbial formation of humic acid and the biodegradation of fulvic acid. Inorganic arsenic showed more rapid effects on microbial community structure, visible within about 20 days, while the effects of organic arsenic were later (about 45 days) due to the necessity of transformation. Moreover, the addition of organic roxarsone and inorganic arsenic resulted in higher expression of ABGs and ARGs, respectively. Arsenic addition also caused increased expression of genes associated with replication and repair. A significant relationship was observed between ABG and ARG expression, for instance, genes involved in arsenic reduction and oxidation were influenced by genes involved in aminoglycoside and chloramphenicol resistance genes (p < 0.05). These complex interactions among microorganisms, functional genes, and external parameters contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying cross -contamination.

AB  - Guizhou is one of the centers of origin for the tea plant (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze). The location contains highly diverse ancient tea plant germplasms in its Sandu Aquarium Autonomous County. After a prolonged course of continuous evolution, these ancient plants have gained a wealth of genetic diversity. Their resources could be harnessed for the selection and breeding of fine varieties of tea plant, as well as for the effective utilization and protection of germplasm resources. In this study, the specific locus-amplified fragment (SLAF) sequencing method was used to analyze the population structure and conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the three traits of 125 ancient tea plants in the Sandu County of Guizhou province, China. A total of 807,743 SLAF tags and 9,428,309 population single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tags were obtained. The results of the phylogenetic tree analysis, cluster analysis, and principal component analysis showed that 125 germplasms were clustered into four groups, and the heterozygosity rates for groups I, II, III, and IV, were 0.211, 0.504, 0.144, and 0.192, respectively. Additionally, GWAS analysis suggested that seven candidate genes were related to altitude at the origin of the plants, eight were related to tree shape, and three were associated with leaf color. In this study, we clarified genetic relationships between four ancient tea plant-producing areas in Sandu County and obtained candidate genes related to their development associated with altitude, tree shape, and leaf color. The study provides useful information for tea plant-breeding development and molecular identification.

AB  - Musk is a biologically valuable secretion from the musk gland of male musk deer, with significant economic and medicinal importance. Due to severe decline and depletion of wild musk deer population, captive breeding of musk deer has become the primary approach for sustainable musk production. So far, the histological structure and secretion mechanism of the musk gland remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques, along with three-dimensional (3D) tissue reconstruction, to systematically analyze the cellular composition and secretory functions of the musk gland in forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii). Our results revealed that the musk gland was primarily composed of acinar structures containing two distinct glandular cell (GC) types based on the histological observation. IHC results showed type I glandular cells (GCIs) predominantly expressed GALNT7 while type II glandular cells (GCIIs) mainly expressed BMP6. The 3D reconstruction demonstrated structural heterogeneity along the gland's longitudinal axis, with the proportion of the acinar area varying between 40% and 65%. This is the first time that a detailed 3D view of musk gland in forest musk deer has been shown, which provides essential histological insights into musk gland function in this species. These preliminary observations may provide useful groundwork for future investigations into the regulatory mechanisms of musk secretion.

AB  - BackgroundInvestigating the population structure and demographic history is crucial for elucidating the evolutionary imprints of a species and laying a foundation for effective utilization of its germplasm. Camellia oleifera Abel., a traditional woody oil-producing species, is widely distributed in south of the Yangtze River in China. However, the phylogeography and genetic diversity of wild population remain poorly understood.ResultsData for 20 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and two chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) fragments was generated to assess the genetic variation and differentiation across 33 natural populations. The integrated Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and ecological niche modeling (ENM) were utilized to analyze the demographic and evolutionary history. The analysis revealed high genetic diversity at the species level and significant genetic variation within populations for both SSR and cpDNA datasets. The genetic evidence based on cpDNA indicated no noteworthy genetic divergence and phylogeographical structure. Haplotype phylogenetic analyses suggest that the temporal pattern of species diversification is likely associated with the abrupt uplift of Hengduan Mountains and adjacent regions (HMR) during the late Miocene to late Pliocene. In contrast, the genetic structure in SSR data revealed a discernible geographic pattern: 33 populations were divided into two lineage regions, namely HMR and Central-East China. The identification of two potential refugia for C. oleifera during the LGM, namely the HMR and southeastern China, was achieved through a comprehensive analysis combining ENM and population structure analysis.ConclusionsThe presence of distinct genetic patterns observed in cpDNA and SSR makers may account for the divergent hereditary characteristics between the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, resulting in disparate phylogeographic patterns. The Nanling mountain range was regarded as a dispersal conduit that facilitated effective gene flow between the two refugia, leading to the extensive distribution and stable evolutionary trajectory of C. oleifera. These methods and findings can provide a reference for uncovering the demographic history of perennial woody oil crops and facilitate the utilization of wild C. oleifera genetic resources for the genetic breeding.

AB  - We used European geometrid moths (>630 species) as a model group to investigate how life history traits linked to larval host plant use (i.e., diet breadth and host-plant growth form) and seasonal life cycle (i.e., voltinism, overwintering stage and caterpillar phenology) are related to adult body size in holometabolous insect herbivores. To do so, we applied phylogenetic comparative methods to account for shared evolutionary history among herbivore species. We further categorized larval diet breadth based on the phylogenetic structure of utilized host plant genera. Our results indicate that species associated with woody plants are, on average, larger than herb feeders and increase in size with increasing diet breadth. Obligatorily univoltine species are larger than multivoltine species, and attain larger sizes when their larvae occur exclusively in the early season. Furthermore, the adult body size is significantly smaller in species that overwinter in the pupal stage compared to those that overwinter as eggs or caterpillars. In summary, our results indicate that the ecological niche of holometabolous insect herbivores is strongly interrelated with body size at maturity.

AB  - Mutualistic symbioses between ants and plants are widespread in nature. Antscan deter unwanted pests and provide protection for plants in return for foodor housing rewards. Using a long-term demographic dataset in a tropical seasonal rain forest in Southwest China, we found that associations with ants positively influenced seedling survival and adult growth, and also, species withextrafloral nectaries experienced weaker conspecific negative density dependence compared with species without extrafloral nectaries. Furthermore, wefound strong evidence suggesting that species in our forest experienced con-specific density dependence, which we interpreted as heavy pest pressure thatmay drive the development of anti-pest symbioses such as the plant-ant rela-tionship. Our findings suggest that ants and conspecific neighbors play impor-tant but inverse roles on plant survival and growth and that ants can buffertree neighborhood interactions in this tropical forest.

AB  - To address the safety problems posed by the transportation of boar semen using LN, this study was conducted on the short-term storage of frozen boar semen in dry ice (-79 degrees C). Boar semen frozen in LN was transferred to dry ice, kept for 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, or 8 days, and then moved back to LN. The quality of frozen semen stored in LN or dry ice was determined to evaluate the feasibility of short-distance transportation with dry ice. The results showed that 60 degrees C for 8 s was the best condition for thawing frozen semen stored in dry ice. No significant differences in spermatozoa motility, plasma membrane integrity, or acrosome integrity were observed in semen after short-term storage in dry ice compared to LN (p > 0.05). There were no significant changes in antioxidant properties between storage groups either (p > 0.05). In conclusion, dry ice could be used as a cold source for the short-term transportation of frozen boar semen for at least 7 days, without affecting sperm motility, morphological integrity, or antioxidant indices.

AB  - Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is a multifunctional nucleolar protein that plays a role in cell cycle control, tumorigenesis, induction of the inflammatory cytokine, virus replication, as well as the cellular responses to a variety of stress stimuli. However, its physiological functions in pigs have not been well understood. Here, we cloned the porcine NPM1 (porNPM1) gene and analyzed the functions of the porNPM1 protein in pigs. The full-length porNPM1 gene encoded a 294-amino acid protein with 94.5%-99.3% sequence identity to its orthologues in mammals and was extensively expressed in various pig tissues at the mRNA level. The porNPM1 primarily localizes in the nucleus of ST cells, while it translocates from the nucleus to nucleoplasm upon UV irradiation or H2O2 treatment. Notably, JEV infection blocked the translocation of porNPM1 from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm. Furthermore, porNPM1 interacted with the JEV C protein and facilitated JEV replication in ST cells. The overexpression and knockdown of porNPM1 respectively enhanced or impaired JEV replication, suggesting the important role of porNPM1 in JEV replication. Additionally, the purified ectodomain of porNPM1 induced the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-& alpha;, IL-6, and IL-8). Together, these data demonstrated that porNPM1 is involved in cellular stress stimuli, JEV replication, and induction of inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Adaptive management, whereby monitoring is used to evaluate management interventions with uncertain outcomes, is theoretically well-developed but poorly implemented. Previous work has identified several reasons for this, but there has been little direct investigation into the perceptions of on-the-ground managers (those ultimately responsible for adopting adaptive management).We conducted interviews with nine protected area managers in the Mana-Sapi-Chewore World Heritage Site in Zimbabwe to understand their perspectives on, and extent of adoption of, adaptive management. We focused on how managers use ranger-collected data on elephant poaching to inform their anti-poaching strategies. To better understand drivers of adoption, we also interviewed 18 key informants either working with these managers or familiar with their work.We found that while managers used ranger-collected to guide patrol deployments, data use was basic, short term and reactive. We found little evidence of managers systematically analysing and learning from trends in data to inform anti-poaching. Lack of buy-in and ownership was a significant barrier to adoption of data-based adaptive management. Managers did not see how the approach would help their work, felt that the costs of adoption outweighed the benefits, and were resistant to change from management based on intuition and experience (which they saw as more familiar and dependable).We find strong parallels between drivers of adoption in our study and prominent theories of what affects technology and innovation adoption within organisations more generally. Looking beyond our case study, we contend that the 'human' dimension of adaptive management (manager buy-in and organisational culture) has been under-emphasised compared to technical fixes (like providing more resources and training). Our results highlight the difficulties of implementing adaptive management, rather than critiquing the concept itself.Finally, we generalise our findings to develop a theory of change to promote greater manager buy-in to adaptive management, drawing on principles from human-centred design to ensure that solutions are sensitive to the priorities and decision-making context of protected area managers.

AB  - Humans are ubiquitously exposed to complex mixtures of environmental chemicals (ECs). This study charac-terised changes in post-natal and peripubertal growth, and the activation of the reproductive axis, in male and female offspring of sheep exposed to a translationally relevant EC mixture (in biosolids), during pregnancy. Birthweight in both sexes was unaffected by gestational biosolids exposure. In contrast to females (unaffected), bodyweight in biosolids males was significantly lower than controls across the peripubertal period, however, they exhibited catch-up growth eventually surpassing controls. Despite weighing less, testosterone concentra-tions were elevated earlier, indicative of early puberty in the biosolids males. This contrasted with females in which the mean date of puberty (first progesterone cycle) was delayed. These results demonstrate that devel-opmental EC-mixture exposure has sexually dimorphic effects on growth, puberty and the relationship between body size and puberty. Such programmed metabolic/reproductive effects could have significant impacts on human health and wellbeing.

AB  - We have found that the Reclamation merino sheep in Southern Xinjiang, China, showed emaciation, stiff limbs, instability, and sudden death, which is related to the impairment of immune function and antioxidant capacity caused by selenium (Se) deficiency. The experiments were to study the effects of Se-enriched malt on the immune and antioxidant function in Se-deprived Reclamation merino sheep in Southern Xinjiang, China. The samples of soil and forage had been collected from tested pastures, and animal tissues were also collected in tested animals. The mineral content of soil, forage, and animal tissues was measured in the collected samples. Hematological indexes and biochemical values were also examined. The findings showed that the Se contents were extremely lower in affected soil and forage than those from healthy soil and forage (P < 0.01). The Se contents in affected blood and wool were also extremely lower than those from healthy blood and wool (P < 0.01). The values in glutathione peroxidase and total antioxidant capacity in affected serum samples were also extremely lower than those from healthy serum samples, and levels of malondialdehyde, total nitric oxide synthase, and lipid peroxide were extremely higher in affected serum samples than those from healthy serum samples (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, the values of hemoglobin, packed cell volume, and platelet count from affected blood were extremely lower than those from healthy blood (P < 0.01). The levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, immunoglobulin A, and immunoglobulin G in serum were extremely decreased in the affected Reclamation merino sheep (P < 0.01). The levels of IL-6 and immunoglobulin M in serum were extremely reduced in the affected Reclamation merino sheep compared to healthy animals (P < 0.01). The animals in affected pastures were orally treated with Se-enriched malt, and the Se contents in blood were extremely increased (P < 0.01). The immune function and antioxidant indicator returned to within the healthy range. Consequently, our findings were indicated that the disorder of the Reclamation merino sheep was mainly caused by the Se deficiency in soil and forage. The Se-enriched malt could not only markedly increase the Se content in blood but also much improve the immune function and the antioxidant capacity in the Se-deprived Reclamation merino sheep.

AB  - An adult female Brazilian cownose ray (Rhinoptera brasiliensis), housed in Ubatuba Aquarium died after loss of appetite period. During necropsy, an enterolith was discovered partially obstructing the intestinal lumen. Examination of the enterolith revealed a bonefish spine nidus. Enterolithiasis has been linked to multiple factors including diet, genetics, alkaline intestinal environments and, as in this particular case, the ingestion and retention of foreign bodies. The composition of this enterolith from a cownose ray was primarily monohydrocalcite. This short communication, apparently the first to report enterolithiasis in stingrays, emphasizes the need for post-mortem examinations of carcasses on macroscopic and microscopic levels.

AB  - IntroductionThe Yangtze vole (Microtus fortis) is a small herbivorous rodent that usually causes damage to crops and forests in China. Various measures were used to control their population including chemical rodenticides. However, rodenticides may cause secondary damage to the environment and the ecosystem. Therefore, the development of new rodent sterilants is urgent. Considering that some compounds of paper mulberry leaves have been verified that can inhibit the biosynthesis of sexual hormone, we aimed to explore the antifertility effect of paper mulberry leaves on M. fortis. MethodsIn this study, voles were divided into three groups including a male group, a female group, and a breeding group, and paper mulberry leaves were added into basal fodder of voles maintained in laboratory, of which the proportion of leaf weight was 50%. In each group, voles were fed with mixed fodder as treatment (BP) and voles were fed with basal fodder as contrast (CK). Results and discussionAfter feeding for more than 1 month, the results indicated that paper mulberry leaves attracted voles to feed, but inhibited their growth and reproduction. Since the second week, food intakes of BP have been significantly higher than CK (p< 0.05). However, weights of voles in male and female groups were 72.283 & PLUSMN; 7.394 g and 49.717 & PLUSMN; 2.278 g in the fifth week, and both were significantly reduced compared with their original weight (p< 0.05). Meanwhile, testicular volumes of male voles fed with BP were significantly smaller than CK (former: 318.000 & PLUSMN; 44.654 mm(3), latter: 459.339 & PLUSMN; 108.755 mm(3)); the testosterone level, sperm number, and vitality of BP were obviously weaker than CK. Female uteruses and oophoron of BP grew slower, and the organ coefficients of uterus and oophoron fed BP were both significantly lower than CK (p< 0.05). The first reproduction of BP couple voles spent 45 days, while CK spent only 21 days. These results suggest that paper mulberry leaves could be the potential resource to produce sterilants to control rodent populations by delaying their sexual growth and reproduction. If it was practical, the apparent advantages of paper mulberry are that it is an abundant resource and the inhibitory effect could be effective in both male and female individuals. Our conclusion also supports the transformation of rodent management from lethal management to fertility control, which would be more ecologically friendly to agriculture and the ecosystem.

AB  - Non-invasive endocrinology is an important tool for animal conservation, but its success depends on many factors (e.g. adequate hormonal extraction, diet, antibody used in the assay). Dietary fiber is one of the main sources that can lead to erroneous interpretation of the endocrine status provided by EIA analysis. This study aimed to evaluate the dietary fiber effect on the fecal androgen metabolites (FAM) detection, on the daily defecation rate and fecal production, as well as to analyze the gastrointestinal passage and retention time of the experimental diets. Eight brown brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira) males were randomly assigned to two groups and submitted to both isocaloric and isoproteic experimental diets for 10 days, in a crossover system: low fiber percentage feed (LF, 7% fiber) and high fiber percentage feed (HF, 19% fiber). Such groups were alternated in the middle of this period, with an interval of 10 days between them. In addition, there was a five-day adaptation phase at the beginning of each diet. Fecal collection for FAM measurement was performed during 10 days of treatment, whereas, the defecation rate and fecal production were performed every two hours, for 6 days. The mean FAM level in the HF group was 5038.0 +/- 1529.1 ng/g, while for LF, 2178.7 +/- 824.9 ng/g (p < 0.05). The mean HF fecal production was 182.6 +/- 36.2 g DM/day and 117.5 +/- 12.6 g DM/day for LF (p < 0.05). There were no differences in terms of mean defecation rate, passage, and retention times between groups. The results suggest that dietary fiber affects the FAM detection, and this should be taken into consideration before conducting experiments using fecal samples as a source of reproductive hormones profiling.

AB  - Slugs are polyphagous herbivores that damage various crops. The genus Deroceras is primarily herbivorous; however, certain species are known to feed on various types of organic matter. In this study, we documented field observations of predation by Deroceras on eggs of the water scavenger beetle Coelostoma stultum at the waterside of paddy fields in central Japan and identified the predator species by DNA barcoding. Molecular phylogenetic analyses revealed that the slugs found sympatrically with C. stultum are Deroceras laeve, whose two haplotypes are widely distributed throughout the Palearctic and eastern margin of Asia. In two of three observed predation events, D. laeve thrust its head into the egg cocoon and preyed on eggs while C. stultum females were spinning. In the other event, no females spinning egg cocoons were observed. Due to the relatively large body size of the slug, it may push the female beetle away and prey on eggs. Considering the native distribution range of these two species, invasion of D. laeve has resulted in a new combination of predator-prey relationships in Japan between D. laeve and native C. stultum. It is a matter of concern that slugs may establish predatory pressures that threaten C. stultum.

AB  - Formulating new integrated plant nutrient management (IPNM) strategies in order to sustain crop production and protect the environment has become an important issue in the present agricultural system. Therefore, a field study was carried out in the two seasons 2016 and 2017 to formulate the best IPNM strategies for improving the growth, yield, and quality of maize grown in an arid agro-ecosystem. The IPNM comprised full-dose NPK (T1); composted agricultural wastes based on cow manure (T2), poultry manure (T3), and a mixture of sheep and camel manure (T4) as activators at the rate of 5 t ha(-1) for each; half-dose NPK was combined with the mixture of the three types of composted agricultural wastes at the rate of 5 t ha(-1) (T5) or 10 t ha(-1) (T6), and a mixture of the three types of composted agricultural wastes at the rate of 10 t ha(-1) (T7), 15 t ha(-1) (T8), or 20 t ha(-1) (T9), either with or without biofertilizers. The results showed that, as compared to T1, T6 or T9 significantly increased different growth, yield, and quality parameters of maize by 11.4-27.3%, 0.8-31.8%, and 4.6-17.2%, while T2 significantly decreased these parameters by 2.2-17.8%, 3.5-16.7%, and 4.5-9.4%, respectively. Seed inoculation with biofertilizers significantly increased different parameters of maize by 1.8-12.9%, compared to that of the non-inoculation seed treatment. Principal component analysis showed a strong relationship between different parameters of maize and treatments T5, T6, T8, and T9 with seed inoculation. Further, a significant and linear relationship was observed between different parameters of maize and the amount of N (R-2 = 0.65-0.77), P (R-2 = 0.58-0.71), and K (R-2 = 0.63-0.73). These results indicated that any IPNM strategies that manage the NPK status and dynamics in the soil are a promising avenue for improving the growth and productivity of maize grown in the arid agro-ecosystem.

AB  - The dugong (Dugong dugon) is a fully marine mammal that grazes in nearshore seagrass meadows and whose health is vulnerable to human coastal activities. This study establishes urine baseline ranges for apparently healthy dugongs that can be used as health biomarkers. Voluntary urine samples (uncontaminated by seawater) were collected from 71 wild-caught dugongs in Moreton Bay, Australia, that were held out of water during an annual health assessment from 2008 to 2022. Urine was analysed for qualitative characteristics (colour, turbidity, odour), biochemistry through reactive urinalysis test strips, urine specific gravity (USG) by refractometer, electrolytes by flame photometry, sediment by microscopy, and bacterial culture. Urine of dugongs was typically pale yellow, clear to slightly cloudy, and mildly odorous. Urine was usually slightly alkaline (mean pH 8), and USG was low (mean 1.018). Urinalysis from dipstick indicated consistently negative readings for the presence of glucose, urobilinogen, bilirubin, ketones, and nitrites. Urinary protein was detected in 85% of sampled dugongs. Haemolysed red blood cells were recorded in > 85% of urine samples; microscopy indicated light haematuria (intact red blood cells) in 16% of samples. Seven percent of dugongs had detectable levels of leukocytes suggesting the possibility of mild urinary tract infection. Urinary sediment containing epithelial cells, keratinaceous debris, calcium carbonate crystalluria, and rare struvite crystals were typical. Light to moderate levels of bacteria were present in urine samples, with variable mixed growths, including Halomonas aqua marina, Pseudomonas stutzeri, Photobacterium damselae, Psychrobacter spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. Spermatozoa were present in the urine of 32% of the sexually mature males. Physical characteristics and chemistry of dugong urine showed some similarities to those of manatees and other herbivores. These baseline urinalysis data for healthy wild dugongs in a single population are valuable benchmarks against which dugongs of variable health status (including compromised dugongs) and from other localities may be compared.

AB  - The application of wool as mulch in strawberry cultivation was analysed to find a solution for the rational use of wool from mountain sheep. In the plantation, the experimental plots mulched with wool, straw, and bark were appointed. The plots were monitored during the experiment, while the soil temperature and moisture content were measured. The data collected in two-hour intervals were analysed, taking into account air temperature and falls registered in the local meteorological station. Additionally, the progress of mulch biodegradation was tracked. The changes in the wool morphology that occurred by biodegradation were observed during microscopic examinations using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). It was stated that wool mulch plays an essential role in thermoregulation of the soil surface, prevents the overheating of the soil during the summer heat, and protects soil against excessive cooling during cold nights. The wool mulch minimizes the fluctuations between the soil's day and night temperature. The fluctuations do not exceed 2-3 degrees on hot summer days, which are five times smaller than for the control plot. The wool retains large amounts of rainwater several times its weight. The water is then slowly released, providing the growing plants with a moist environment during a longer rainless period. Moreover, wool is difficult to biodegrade and maintains its properties for a long time, lasting longer than one vegetation season. Compared to straw and bark, the temperature fluctuations recorded for wool are two times smaller, and its effectiveness in water management is considerably better. The beneficial impact of the wool mulch ensuring favourable conditions for strawberry growth was explained by the specific wool structure and its unique properties.

AB  - Context. In pigs, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) is associated with high polyspermy rates, and for this reason, in vitro embryo production (IVP) is still an inefficient biotechnology. Coculture with somatic cells is an alternative to improve suboptimal in vitro maturation (IVM) conditions. Aim. This study was conducted to test a coculture system of porcine luteal cells (PLC) and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) to improve oocyte metabolism. Methods. COC were matured in vitro with PLC. Oocyte lipid content, mitochondrial activity, zona pellucida (ZP) digestibility and pore size, cortical reaction and in vitro embryo development were assessed. Key results. Coculture reduced cytoplasmic lipid content in the oocyte cytoplasm without increasing mitochondrial activity. Although ZP digestibility and ZP pore number were not different between culture systems, ZP pores were smaller in the coculture. Coculture impacted the distribution of cortical granules as they were found immediately under the oolemma, and more of them had released their content in the ZP. Coculture with porcine luteal cells during IVM increased monospermic penetration and embryo development after IVF. Conclusions. The coculture of COC with PLC affects the metabolism of the oocyte and benefits monospermic penetration and embryo development. Implications. The coculture system with PLC could be an alternative for the conventional maturation medium in pigs.

AB  - The synthetic progestin, 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17-OHPC), is administered to pregnant individuals at risk for recurrent preterm birth during a critical period of fetal mesocorticolimbic serotonergic and dopaminergic pathway development. These pathways play an important role in regulating cognitive behaviors later in life. Despite this, there has been very little research regarding the potential long-term effects of 17-OHPC on the behavioral and neural development of exposed children. In rodents, developmental exposure to 17-OHPC disrupts serotonergic and dopaminergic innervation of the medial prefrontal cortex and impairs decision-making in complex cognitive tasks in adulthood. The present study tested the hypothesis that developmental exposure to 17-OHPC similarly disrupts the development of serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways within limbic targets and subsequent mood-related behaviors. Developmental 17-OHPC exposure significantly increased the density of serotonin transporter-IR fibers in CA1, CA2/3, and the suprapyramidal blade of dentate gyrus in hippocampus and significantly reduced the density of TH-IR fibers within the nucleus accumbens shell in males but had no effect in females during adolescence. Irregular microglia activational phenotype and number were also observed in the hippocampus of 17-OHPC-exposed males. Developmental 17-OHPC reduced the latency to immobility in males in the forced swim test but did not affect sucrose consumption in a sucrose preference test. These findings suggest that 17-OHPC exerts sex-specific effects on the development of mesocorticolimbic pathways and mood-related behavior in adolescence and highlight the need to investigate effects in adolescent children.

AB  - Given the fact that carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have been commercially produced in quantities, it is inevitable to make their ways into environment and interact closely with the public. Even though CQDs in the environment have been reported to damage the central nervous system, the underlying mechanisms of neurotoxic effects of CQDs following respiratory exposure is still not clear. Intranasal instilled CQDs, mimicking respiratory exposure, induces neurobehavioral impairments associated with neuronal cell death of ferroptosis and disulfidptosis that is regulated by metabolic reprogramming of glutathione and cysteine pathways in the cortex and hippocampus where CQDs were hardly accumulated. Therefore, further exploration found that dysbiosis in the lung microbiome was found specifically manipulated by CQDs, which correlated with systemic and neuroinflammatory responses, implicating a lung-brain axis other than gut-brain axis as a critical pathway through which microbiota dysbiosis may impact neurological health after respiratory exposure to CQDs. This study pioneers the exploration of the neurological consequences of inhaled CQDs in the environment through the regulation of microbiomelung-brain axis, which is key in understanding the mechanistic link between CQDs exposure and neurotoxicity. The findings could develop potential strategies for mitigating the neurological effects of CQDs even other types of nanoparticles.

AB  - This work aimed to determine the effect of cysteamine (25, 50, 100 and 200 mu M) incorporated during dilution on frozen thawed buffalo semen quality. Semen was collected twice weekly for 7 consecutive weeks from three Egyptian buffalo bulls using an artificial vagina. Semen samples were pooled and extended with a Tris-based extender, cooled, equilibrated and finally frozen in liquid nitrogen. The diluted semen was evaluated for motility, viability, morphology, plasma membrane and DNA integrity, in addition to oxidative stress and in vitro fertilizing capability. The post thaw motility and velocity parameters noticeably increased with different concentrations of cysteamine (mainly 100 mu M) during different incubation periods. The post thaw sperm viability and normality significantly (p < 0.05) improved with concentrations of 50 and 100 mu M. Plasma membrane integrity substantially increased at all concentrations of cysteamine. Cysteamine reduced alanine aminotransferase (at all concentrations), aspartate aminotransferase (at 25-100 mu M), and creatine kinase (at 100 and 200 mu M). Cysteamine at a concentration of 100 mu M noticeably enhanced the total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase and decreased nitric oxide production. Cysteamine, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mu M, increased the DNA intensity in the comet head (%) and decreased the DNA % in the comet tail. The comet tail length and moment substantially decreased at concentrations of 50-200 mu M. Cysteamine did not affect the in vitro fertilizing capability of sperm. In conclusion, cysteamine incorporation (mainly at a concentration of 100 mu M) in buffalo semen extender showed varying protective effects on different sperm parameters against cryo-damage; however, it did not affect the in vitro fertilizing capacity of sperm.

AB  - Upwelling systems deliver nutrient-rich water into coastal ecosystems, influencing primary productivity and poten-tially altering seaweed-herbivore interactions. Upwelling bottom-up effects on distinct trophic levels are well-known. However, their influence on seaweed biomolecules and on algae-herbivore interactions and growth are less known. The aim of this study was threefold: i) to compare physical-chemical characteristics and nutrient levels in the water of upwelling (U) and downwelling (DU) zones, ii) to quantify their influence on the content of protein and carbohydrates in seaweed tissues of representative U and DU locations, and iii) to experimentally assess their effect on the feeding behavior and growth of a prominent intertidal herbivore, the sea urchin Loxechinus albus. Waters from U zones showed lower temperatures and pH, and higher phosphate concentrations than those from downwelling zones. Similarly, the tissue of seaweeds from a U location had significantly more proteins and carbohydrates than those from a DU location. The origin location of the sea urchins had a significant influence on consumption and growth rates: in gen-eral, those coming from a site with U conditions consumed and grew more than those coming from DU conditions. The quality of the algae was a significant factor on consumption rates, although in the case of preference trials, this factor interacted with sea urchin origin location. Our results show that the availability and quality of the food in upwelling zones has an influence on herbivore-seaweed direct interactions. However, these interactions and the growth of the sea urchins were also related to the coastal site and conditions from which the sea urchins came from. These results are relevant considering the expected impact of climate change on the world's oceans, and the importance of U zones as thermal (cold water) refuges for marine ectotherms.

AB  - Lambs harboring the Hb-AA (3-globin haplotype present improved cell-mediated responses and increased resistance against Haemonchus contortus infection. The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of sex and (3-globin haplotypes on specific humoral responses and phenotypes of resistance during H. contortus infection in Morada Nova sheep. As expected, females displayed stronger resistance during the first and second experimental challenges. Differential systemic humoral immune responses were observed comparing sex groups, in which higher levels of specific antibodies targeting 24 kDa excretory-secretory (ES24) protein of H. contortus of IgG and IgM antibodies were respectively observed as predominant isotypes in males and females. The IgM levels were significantly correlated with phenotypes of resistance, evaluated by packed cell volume and fecal egg counts. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting divergent humoral responses profiles to H. contortus infection between male and female sheep. The impact of (3-globin haplotypes was less pronounced in females compared to males. Notably, only males showed significant weight differences across haplotypes, with Hb-AA lambs being the heaviest. Additionally, Hb-AA males had significantly higher PCV (indicating better red blood cell health) and lower FEC (indicating lower parasite burden). These findings suggest a more pronounced effect of (3-globin polymorphisms on H. contortus infection in males, potentially due to their generally weaker resistance compared to females. This study highlights the importance of sex and (3-globin haplotypes in shaping immune responses to H. contortus infection. Specifically, IgM antibodies targeting the ES24 protein appear to play a crucial role in hostparasite interactions and may hold promise for therapeutic development.

AB  - Substituting soybean meal (SM) with other protein sources can be advantageous in reducing production costs without increasing nitrogen losses in the environment. Peanut cake (PC) might be a strategy in ruminant herds to result in a performance similar to that observed in animals fed SM. This study assessed the PC inclusion at rates of 0, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 g/kg on intake and digestibility, performance, nitrogen balance, microbial protein synthesis, and carcass traits of lambs. Forty-five entire, crossbreed Dorper x Santa In & ecirc;s lambs (average age = five months and 24.49 +/- 5.27 kg of BW) were distributed in a completely randomized design. Only the ether extract intake was not affected by the PC inclusion, and only the crude protein digestibility was affected by the diets. The total weight and average daily gains decreased, and the feed conversion increased. Hot carcass yield was influenced quadratically, the leg depth increased and the loin-eye area decreased. The total replacement of soybean meal with peanut cake in diets for lambs did not compromise nutrient digestibility, microbial protein synthesis, and carcass characteristics. Nevertheless, peanut cake as a protein source in the diet had adverse effects on nutrient intake and growth performance of feedlot lambs.

AB  - Many animals vary their acoustic signals with weather conditions to ensure sufficient range of signal transmission as atmospheric attenuation increases (the atmospheric attenuation change hypothesis). However, few studies have considered the effects of weather conditions on the vocalizations of endotherms via the effects on their physiological condition (the physiological change hypothesis). In the present study, we directly linked weather conditions to changes in bats' body temperatures and to their echolocation call frequencies. We found a significantly positive correlation between body temperatures and call frequencies among individuals of the great leaf-nosed bat, Hipposideros armiger, in the wild. We then monitored changes in body temperature and call frequency of H. armiger over an hour at an ambient temperature of about 11 degrees C. The bats emitted echolocation calls of lower frequencies with decreasing body temperature caused by decreased ambient temperature, supporting the physiological change hypothesis. We also investigated changes in body temperature and echolocation call frequencies for H. armiger from summer to winter. The bats' body temperatures decreased with decreasing ambient temperature. However, echolocation call frequencies increased significantly. A linear mixed-effects model suggested that the change in atmospheric attenuation rather than body temperature had a significant effect on the call frequency, supporting the atmospheric attenuation change hypothesis. Overall, our results suggested that weather conditions can affect the echolocation signals of bats via the effects on their body temperature and on atmospheric attenuation. When both effects coexist, weather-induced adjustments in the echolocation signals could be more likely to be driven by the atmospheric attenuation effect.

AB  - The current study attempts to investigate the differences in gene expression in longissimus thoracis muscles between sheep breeds acclimated to diverse environments. Changthangi sheep inhabits the cold arid plateau of Ladakh, at an altitude above 3000 m with prevalence of rarefied atmosphere. Muzzafarnagri sheep, on the other hand is found in the sub-tropical hot and humid plains at an altitude of about 250 m. Comparative transcriptomics was used to provide a molecular perspective of the differential adaptation of the two breeds. RNA sequencing data was generated from four biological replicates of the longissimus thoracis muscles from both breeds. The common genes expressed in both breeds were involved in muscle contraction and muscle fibre organization. The most significant pathways enriched in Changthangi muscles were glycogen metabolism, reduction of cytosolic Ca++ levels and NFE2L2 regulating anti-oxidant, while those in Muzzafarnagri were extracellular matrix organization and collagen formation. The hub genes identified in Changthangi were involved in hematopoiesis and HIF signaling pathway, suggesting the molecular acclimatization of Changthangi to the high altitude cold desert of Ladakh. The nodal genes discovered in Muzzafarnagri sheep were associated with the extracellular matrix which accentuates its significance in the development, growth and repair of muscles. The observed transcriptomic differences underscore the morphological and adaptive disparity between the two breeds. The candidate genes and pathways identified in this study will form the basis for future research on adaptation to high altitude and body size in small ruminants.

AB  - Hippoboscid flies, also known as louse flies, are obligate blood-feeders ectoparasites of birds and mammals. By studying louse fly parasites of four Passeriformes species, Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula), Eurasian blackcap (Sylvia atricapilla), common chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs) and European robin (Erithacus rubecula), with dissimilar time of colonization of Azores islands, we tested whether: (i) island host populations have lower parasite richness than the mainland one; (ii) island host populations undergo higher parasite prevalence, mean intensities and mean abundance than the mainland one; (iii) island parasite diversity are composed exclusively by specific parasites and (iv) parasite richness is positively correlated with the island area and proximity to the continent. For these purposes, 775 birds were sampled for presence of louse flies, by modified fumigation chamber method, from Azores Islands (Sa?o Miguel, Terceira and Flores) and Portugal mainland. Insular and mainland parasite assemblages were statistically compared. We record for the first time to Azores, Ornithomya fringillina and Icosta minor from Portugal mainland. Louse flies had highest prevalence and abundance from Azores Islands compared to those observed in mainland birds, especially blackbirds. The insular parasite diversity of Azores blackbirds, blackcaps and chaffinches was richer than the one observed in mainland population. None of the hippoboscid flies observed on the islands and mainland were host-specific. Thus, our findings provide an upgrade of parasite island syndromes knowledge, in the context of the ectoparasites, namely to the hippoboscid flies case.

AB  - Beneficial soil microbes can enhance plant growth and defense, but the extent to which this occurs depends on the availability of resources, such as water and nutrients. However, relatively little is known about the role of light quality, which is altered during shading, resulting a low red: far-red ratio (R:FR) of light. We examined how low R:FR light influences arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF)-mediated changes in plant growth and defense using Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and the insect herbivore Chrysodeixis chalcites. We also examined effects on third trophic level interactions with the parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris. Under low R:FR light, non-mycorrhizal plants activated the shade avoidance syndrome (SAS), resulting in enhanced biomass production. However, mycorrhizal inoculation decreased stem elongation in shaded plants, thus counteracting the plant's SAS response to shading. Unexpectedly, activation of SAS under low R:FR light did not increase plant susceptibility to the herbivore in either non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal plants. AMF did not significantly affect survival or growth of caterpillars and parasitoids but suppressed herbivore-induced expression of jasmonic acid-signaled defenses genes under low R:FR light. These results highlight the context-dependency of AMF effects on plant growth and defense and the potentially adverse effects of AMF under shading.

AB  - Difficulty discriminating between threat and safety cues is a hallmark symptom of many fear-related disorders including anxiety, which are highly prevalent during adolescence. Moreover, females are disproportionately affected by fear and anxiety disorders. Correspondingly, growing evidence suggests that sex differences in fear responding and regulation are readily apparent in adults. Yet, it remains unclear when these differences emerge throughout development and what behavioral factors may drive them. Using adult (postnatal day/PND 69-128) and adolescent (PND 29-34) mice, we set out to study age and sex differences in learning about cues explicitly indicating safety (i.e., safety learning). Our results revealed that female mice of both ages froze more and discriminated less than males of both ages during initial discriminative conditioning. All mice showed evidence of conditioned inhibition during a summation test, though the magnitude of suppression was smaller in females. During an expanded summation test that included novel cues and different combinations of stimulus parameters, females of both ages exhibited higher fear generalization to novel cues. In addition, adolescents of both sexes failed to inhibit fear using a safety cue, suggesting that adolescent learning may be disrupted by complex experimental design. Finally, neural activity (cFos expression) was greater in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus of adolescents relative to adults, and the retrosplenial cortex and ventral hippocampus of males relative to females. Together, these findings illustrate the potential to take age and sex into account in the identification and treatment of fear and anxiety disorders.

AB  - As ecosystem engineers, subterranean rodents excavate and inhabit burrow systems. However, the changes in their use of underground space are poorly recorded. There is conflicting evidence about whether the burrow systems of subterranean rodents, once established, are relatively stable as a result of the high energy costs of digging. We monitored the size of the home ranges of the plateau zokor (Myospalax baileyi) during different stages of its life cycle to show whether mating behavior and the characteristics of its habitat influence the size and location of its home range. We used radio-tracking to quantify the changes in, and overlap of, the home range of M. baileyi during a one-year period. The average size of the home ranges of male zokors was 6.5 times larger than that of female zokors during the mating season. The males expanded their burrows to overlap with multiple females to increase their chances of mating. However, there was no overlap between estrus females or males, perhaps to reduce the number of encounters and unnecessary fights. The home ranges of male and female zokors were similar in size after courtship and the home ranges of single zokors overlapped with those of several neighbors. Most individuals remained territorial and excluded intraspecific interactions from their home ranges. The location of female zokors was stable throughout the year, but half of the males changed the location of their nests and established completely new home ranges in the non-breeding season, mainly in October. The use of space by M. baileyi is flexible in response to a need for physical contact during the mating season and food resources. The home ranges of subterranean plateau zokors are dynamic and the home ranges of male zokors can change within one breeding cycle.

AB  - We investigated the viability of Opuntia ficus indica (or cactus), as nutritional substitute for alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) hays, assessing its effects on greenhouse gas emissions, water intake, and water footprint. Fermentation kinetics were assessed using in vitro gas production technique with two ruminally cannulated Angus steers as inoculum donors. Forage types were incubated in serum bottles over three runs for 48 h to analyze fermentation characteristics. In vitro digestion kinetics evaluated cactus forage inclusion at 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% on a dry matter basis. Computer simulations estimated the of cactus diets on water usage. Data were analyzed as completely randomized design, with diet as fixed and runs as random effects. Results showed cactus reduced CH4 and increased CO2 production higher with cactus compared to hay (P < 0.05). Rumen pH, propionate, and digestibility increased with cactus inclusion, while acetate, isobutyrate, isovalerate, and valerate decreased in orchardgrass diets (P < 0.05). Cactus also reduced water intake and footprint (P < 0.001), offering a viable option to lower methane emissions without affecting cattle performance. Cactus fermentation enhances digestibility and propionate production and produces less methane compared to alfalfa and orchardgrass while still maintaining high dry matter digestibility.

AB  - Leadership is a risky behaviour that can impact individuals and groups. Leaders, i.e. individuals who perform or initiate a task while other individuals in the group follow, have been studied in different contexts, but there is still a lack of understanding on the role of individual characteristics that may predispose them to become leaders, such as dominance and personality. In particular, the characteristics of leaders in domestic animal populations has been poorly examined. We studied leadership within 32 groups of young pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus, n = 366 individuals). Leadership was assessed during a group-based fear test (Human Approach Test) which was repeated three times. The first individual per group to touch the person was identified as leader. We assessed repeatability of leadership and characteristics of leaders as compared to followers. Leadership was marginally repeatable, with 6 out of 26 groups having a consistent single leader across all tests. Females had odds 4.13 times greater than males of being a leader, while there was no effect of body weight (a proxy of dominance) or coping style on leadership. The results indicate a similarity with wild populations, in which females lead the herd even though the males, which are superior in body weight, are often dominant.

AB  - Root-feeding herbivores present challenges for insect scouting due to the reliance on aboveground visual cues. These challenges intensify in multi-stress environments, where one stressor can mask another. Pre-visual identification of plant stress offers promise in addressing this issue. Hyperspectral data have emerged as a measurement able to identify plant stress before visible symptoms appear. The effectiveness of spectral data to identify belowground stressors using aboveground vegetative measurements, however, remains poorly understood, particularly in multi-stress environments. We investigated the potential of hyperspectral data to detect Western corn rootworm (WCR; Diabrotica virgifera virgirefa) infestations in resistant and susceptible maize genotypes in the presence and absence of drought. Under well-watered conditions, the spectral profiles separated between WCR treatments, but the presence of drought eliminated spectral separation. The foliar spectral profiles separated under drought conditions, irrespective of WCR presence. Spectral data did not classify WCR well; drought was well classified, and the presence of drought further reduced WCR classification accuracy. We found that multiple plant traits were not affected by WCR but were negatively affected by drought. Our study highlights the possibility of detecting WCR and drought stress in maize using hyperspectral data but highlights limitations of the approach for assessing plant health in multi-stress conditions.

AB  - Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is facing various threats because of the human conflict in the northern mountainous areas of Pakistan. The present study was initiated to provide baseline information regarding human-black bear conflicts and their possible mitigation at Siran and Kaghan valleys of District Mansehra, from April-2018 to April 2019. A total of 100 inhabitants of various occupations were interviewed and questionnaires were filled from 32 villages of both valleys. Agriculture crops destruction was documented as a common conflict issue (92%), followed by livestock predation (90%), and human casualties (85%). Maiz was frequently raided crop (50%) followed by fruits and vegetables (27.1%, 22.6%). Goats were the most (47.61%) predated animals, followed by sheep and cattle (37.14%, 12.38%). Human casualties were rare and mostly accidental, while victims often experienced deep injuries. Local communities faced annually Rs.167,922 (US$ 1085.47) agriculture loss and Rs. 1,620,000 (US$ 10,731.19) livestock loss during 2015-19. Generally, local inhabitants expressed negative attitudes (48%), and they were in favor of eliminating bears due to frequent conflict incidents. Although good husbandry is the most effective measure of preventing black bear damage, compensation of loss and community involvement in conservation programs were documented as the most effective mitigation strategies. Human dependence on forest resources, habitat destruction, anthropogenic food waste, and retaliatory killing were the main conservation threats to black bear survival in the study area.

AB  - To assess whether amphipods' habitat choice and feeding preference for a specific seaweed species are based on nutritional value or structural complexity, and to evaluate the role of chemical cues in the amphipod choice, we carried out laboratory experiments using amphipods (Ampithoe marcuzzii) and seaweeds from different divisions (Chlorophyta, Ochrophyta, and Rhodophyta). To evaluate feeding preference, we carried out a multiple-choice experiment offering six species of seaweeds to amphipods. To assess whether habitat choice by amphipods is guided exclusively by seaweed complexity, we conducted an assay offering seaweeds and complexity-like mimics (artificial plants) to amphipods, quantifying their choices. To evaluate whether seaweeds' secondary metabolites acted as chemical cues affecting seaweed choice by the amphipods, we used the same plastic mimics, one of which was brushed with crude extracts from the most-consumed seaweeds and a control. The consumption of Gracilaria cervicornis by amphipods was around three times higher than that of the other offered species, likely due to its paucity of chemical and physical defenses. The highest contents of nitrogen and crude proteins in this species may have contributed to its high consumption. Amphipods also used G. cervicornis as a shelter more than its mimic, but exhibited no preference between other seaweeds and their mimics, indicating that a more palatable refuge is preferred. This idea was corroborated when amphipods were able to detect chemical cues of G. cervicornis painted over a plastic mimic of similar structure and preferred it over the control mimic, which had the same complexity but no chemicals. Our results suggest that amphipods use chemical cues to identify high-quality habitat regarding refuge (complexity) and food source (nutritional value).

AB  - Invasive plants are highly successful because they can quickly adapt to selection pressures imposed by both biotic and abiotic stressors. Since selection pressures may vary across temporal and biogeographical gradients, the growth and fitness of invasive plants varies across time. However, only a few studies have focused on the evolutionary potential of invasive plants following their establishment. In this study, the impacts of cadmium (Cd) on the germination and seedling growth of an invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, were examined. The seeds were collected from different historical populations at the invasion stage (during the early, middle, and new stages of invasion). Plant performance was tested under both heavy metal and simulated herbivory treatments to examine the evolution of A. adenophora under different selection pressures. It was found that early stage A. adenophora populations have higher germinability and weaker seedling growth than the new stage populations. Compared with new stage populations, early-stage populations are more tolerant to simulated herbivory and their germination potential tends to be higher under high Cd stress. It seems that the adaptive strategy of A. adenophora is to invest more energy in growth during the initial stage of invasion. As selection pressures increases over time, more energy seems to be shifted to the improvement of seed quality as well as to the vegetative growth system which improves its ability to tolerate stressful environments. It is important to consider the invasion history of a species when studying the invasive and evolutionary potential of plant species.

AB  - Pig farm biogas slurry is being increasingly used as a potent organic fertilizer for sustainable agriculture under circular economy. However, the effect of biogas slurry on soil pH is currently controversial, and the underlying mechanisms especially in saline-alkali soils are not well understood. A saline-alkali soil (pH = 9.2, EC = 2.0 ms/cm) was selected for soil column (0-50 cm) experiments with (BS) and without (CK) addition of pig farm biogas slurry to investigate the soil pH change and its driving factors. Our results show that the soil pH under CK ranged between 9.1 and 9.5 across different soil depths. Compared to CK, the BS-treated soil had lower pH at 0-20 cm depth and higher pH at 20-30 cm depth (P < 0.01). The soil NH4+ - N concentrations were negatively correlated with pH values under BS (P < 0.01), indicating that the oxidation of ammonium mainly contributed to the decrease of soil pH. Interestingly, the anions, such as Cl-, SO42- and NO3-, were accumulated in the topsoil (0-20 cm) under BS, resulting in the changed correlations of these anions with Na+ when compared to the control. FT-IR and C-13-NMR spectra uncovered that carboxyl, amide C, and total alkyl C groups may be responsible for reducing pH of the saline-alkali soil tested. The soil surface morphology confirmed a much tighter granular aggregate microstructure when mixing the biogas slurry with the soil. Overall, we concluded that from the perspective of soil pH, the utilization of biogas slurry for improving saline-alkali soil is feasible and sustainable.

AB  - An updated checklist of the vascular plants from the continen-tal region of Equatorial Guinea (Rio Muni) is presented. The catalogue (Appendix 1) is the result of the compilation of herbarium specimens (6850), species records (7985) from the botanical literature and online da-tabases (10109 GBIF records and 8897 RAINBIO records). A database of 23517 georeferenced records was prepared by updating the nomenclatural and standardizing the locality names from all these sources. The cata-logue comprises 2707 taxa (2598 species, 81 subspecies, and 28 varieties) included in 1020 genera and 178 families. About 90.6% of the taxa are considered native, 1.17% introduced and 5.96% naturalized. The 10 most diverse families are Rubiaceae (294 species), Fabaceae (290), Orchidace-ae (168), Poaceae (105), Euphorbiaceae (87), Apocynaceae (85), Cypera-ceae (79), Annonaceae (68), Acanthaceae (65) and Melastomataceae (61), which comprise 49.22% of the species in Rio Muni. Only 11 species can be considered endemic to Rio Muni; this low number reflects the absence of natural barriers in the territory. The number of threatened taxa (VU, EN and CR) is 134 (5.02% of the total evaluated), of which 43 are at risk of extinction, being within the categories of Endangered or Critically Endangered. Five species restricted to the Gulf of Guinea are considered threatened: three Endangered (Grossera angustifolia, Polyscias aequa-toguineensis and Rhipidoglossum montealenense), and two Critically En-dangered (Asplenium carvalhoanum and Macropodiella uoroensis), thus they should be considered as priority in management plans development and conservation strategies.

AB  - Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a global public health concern affecting 1.6 billion people worldwide. The administration of iron supplements during the treatment of IDA adversely affects the intestinal barrier function and the composition and functionality of the intestinal microbiome, both of which are already altered during IDA. For this reason, it is of great interest to develop nutritional strategies aimed at alleviating these gut alterations associated with IDA and its treatment. In this sense, fermented goat's milk (FGM) was studied due to its nutritional quality. Our findings showed that in anemic animals the consumption of a FGM-based diet, compared to a standard diet, had positive modulatory effects on the intestinal microbiome. FGM-based diet restored intestinal dysbiosis, the intestinal barrier functionality, and bacterial translocation, contributing to a more efficient recovery of IDA. Therefore, FGM is a useful nutritional tool to ease intestinal alterations occurring during IDA and during its treatment.

AB  - The semiarid grasslands of Argentina ' s central region have been modi fi ed by domestic livestock grazing, both in their composition and structure. The increase in the proportion of woody and non-forage species and the decrease in forage species are some of the most evident results of this process. There is limited available information about the effect of differential grazing pressures on morphometric attributes of native species, and it also depends on the life histories of the species in this grassland. The objective of this work was to evaluate some morphometric aspects in the grasses Poa ligularis Nees ex Steud and Piptochaetium napostaense (Speg.). Hack according to distance from the water source in communities in the central semiarid region of Argentina. The study area included areas of low grassland, golden forests, and secondary forests in grasslands (6 fi elds with 9 paddocks). Grazing pressure was established based on the distance to the water source, so sampling areas were designated near the water source (grazing pressure is greater) and far from the water source (grazing pressure light) in each of the pastures. In both species, specimens were selected at random, and the following attributes were measured: crown diameter at ground level (cm), burial depth (cm), average tiller weight per plant (g. Marcello - 1 ), and the density of tillers per unit of crown surface (tillers.cm - 2 crown). The morphometric attributes evaluated showed differences according to the distance to the watering hole and in the different pastures. Both species presented similar behaviors for the attributes. There were signi fi cant differences in the depth of burial and the average weight of tillers per plant, being greater in the areas close to the water source. Regarding the distance to the watering hole, there were no signi fi cant differences in crown diameter and tiller density, but the highest values were recorded for the former near the watering hole and for the second far from the watering hole. In pastures with low grassland or secondary forest on the plain, the greatest depth of burial and weight of tillers was recorded closer to the water. In forest areas, the highest density of tillers was found far from the water. For crown diameter, although there was no interaction, the largest diameters were found in plain grassland areas near the waterhole. In general, both species had a differential behavior depending on the grazing pressure that was evident along the physiognomic gradient from plain grassland to forest and that could be interpreted as a strategy to perpetuate themselves against herbivory.

AB  - The cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) gene, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is crucial for maintaining immune homeostasis and preventing autoimmune diseases. Studies have shown that polymorphisms in the CTLA4 gene are linked to an increased risk of brucellosis in humans, but its association with brucellosis in goats remains unexplored. In this study, the tissue expression profile of CTLA4 in goats was investigated, and the correlation between InDel polymorphisms in the CTLA4 gene and susceptibility to brucellosis in goats was examined. The findings reveal the widespread expression of CTLA4 in goat tissues, particularly in the spleen and testes. The tested goat populations presented genotypes insertion/insertion (II), insertion/deletion (ID), and deletion/deletion (DD) at both the P1 and P2 loci, and an association analysis revealed significant differences in the distribution of genotypes and allele frequencies at the P1 and P2 loci of the CTLA4 gene between the Brucella goat case and the control groups (p < 0.05). Specifically, compared with the II genotype, the P1 and P2 loci were significantly associated with an elevated risk of brucellosis development in goats under both the codominant (ID/II) and dominant (ID + DD/II) models (P1, p = 0.042, p = 0.016; P2, p = 0.011, p = 0.014). Additionally, haplotype analysis indicated that haplotypes IP1DP2, DP1IP2, and DP1DP2 were significantly associated with an increased risk of brucellosis in goats compared to the reference haplotype IP1IP2 (p = 0.029, p = 0.012, p = 0.034). Importantly, the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of peripheral blood monocytes and/or macrophages from goats with the II, ID, and DD genotypes resulted in increased CTLA4 expression levels in the II genotype, leading to a robust LPS-induced inflammatory response. Through bioinformatic analysis, the observed effect of the InDel locus on Brucella pathogenesis risk in goats could be attributed to the differential binding of the transcription factors nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappa B) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha). These findings offer potential insights for breeding strategies against brucellosis.

AB  - Myiasis is an infestation of maggots on living tissue in humans and animals all over the world. It is known to occur in wild animals, while no information is reported in forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii). During our research on the conservation of forest musk deer, we found a new record of traumatic myiasis of an injured forest musk deer. The flies are likely Lucilia caesar (Linnaeus, 1758) according to the results of DNA barcoding technology. We report traumatic myiasis of forest musk deer for the first time, which expands the information on parasite and myiasis of forest musk deer and confirms the potential risk of traumatic myiasis of forest musk deer.

AB  - Alterations to ratios of protein and fiber in an organism's diet have been shown to structurally and functionally alter its individual digestive physiology. However, it is unclear how these dietary changes may affect phenotypic changes across generations. We utilized feeding trials, morphological analyses, enzyme activities, and 16S rRNA sequencing of the gut microbiome of zebrafish (Danio rerio) to determine how variations to fiber and protein concentrations, kept consistent across sequential generations, affect phenotypic changes. Our results show that Parental (P) and first generation (F-1) fish did not differ from each other in terms of their intestine length, intestine mass, enzyme activity levels, and microbial community composition for any of the three experimental diets (high-protein/low-fiber, moderate-protein/fiber, and low-protein/high-fiber). However, each of the three experimental diets for the P and F-1 fish, as well as the ancestral diet fish, did have distinct microbial community structure from one another. This indicates that there is a strong dietary effect on digestive physiology and gut microbial community and that these effects are consistent when the diet is kept homogenous across generations.

AB  - Princess parrotfish Scarus taeniopterus is one of the top three parrotfish species landed in the Caribbean, and the top Scarus species targeted in commercial fishing efforts; however, a paucity of information exists concerning basic life history information for Caribbean parrotfish species. Prior to this work, no comprehensive life history information existed in the literature for princess parrotfish. This study provides the first comprehensive documentation of age, growth, size/age at sexual maturity, and size/age at transition for a Caribbean Scarus species. Sampling of 759 fish occurred in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands from October 2015 to February 2020. Females ranged from 50 to 250 mm total length (TL) and 0 to 7 years of age, males ranged from 159 to 314 mm TL and 2 to 11 years, and transitional fish ranged from 140 to 292 mm TL and 2 to 6 years. Previously unknown von Bertalanffy parameters (L-infinity = 301 and k = 0.316) and length at median sexual maturity (LM50 = 119 mm TL), age at median sexual maturity (AM(50) = 1.5 years), length at median sexual transition (LS50 = 223 mm TL), and age at median sexual transition (AS(50) = 4.2 years) will enable stock assessments and informed management for this Caribbean parrotfish.

AB  - Biochar is a widely used soil amendment that can improve soil physical properties like aggregation. However, little information is available regarding how pig manure biochar improves soil structure formation and organic carbon content in clay soil. This short-term field experiment (120 days) investigated the impacts of biochar on soil organic carbon (SOC) and aggregate stability (MWD) coupling with microbial biomass carbon (MBC) in clay soil under Pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.). The experiment consisted of five treatments as follows: (i) Control as no biochar (T-0), (ii) inorganic fertilization (triple super phosphate) at 2 t ha(-1) (T-1), (iii) biochar at 4 t ha(-1) (T-2), (iv) biochar at 8 t ha(-1) (T-3) and (v) biochar at 16 t ha(-1) (T-4). Results showed that large macroaggregates were increased by 1.9, 2.2 and 2.7 times higher, while MWD was increased by 53, 75 and 103 % in the T-2, T-3 and T-4 treatments, respectively, upon biochar incorporation as compared to T0 (P < 0.01). The SOC was increased significantly with all treatments compared to T0 (P < 0.001). Moreover, MBC and GRSP were enhanced by 4.5 and 1.25-fold, respectively, with only T4 biochar treatment (P < 0.001), while T2 treatment had no impact on MBC and GRSP (P > 0.05). SOC, MBC and GRSP were significantly correlated with MWD (P < 0.05), while iron oxides had no impacts on MWD (P > 0.05). The study indicates that biochar, particularly at 16 t ha(-1), can potentially enhance MWD, boosting microbial activity and SOC in clay texture soils of southeast Bangladesh.

AB  - Lotus eremiticus is an endemic species from La Palma World Biosphere Reserve. It has a small distribution range, low population size, and is threatened by introduced herbivores. Since these threats have not been removed from the protected area, they were excluded by building a fence. The land where the species grows is private property, so an agreement with the landowner was reached to permit measures to favor its recovery. During 2008-2019, as a result of this agreement and the conservation efforts, a large population increase occurred, from the initial 5 individuals to the 30 plants that are currently distributed at the original site. Furthermore, these measures allow the species to maintain stable population dynamics, meaning that this endangered species is itself capable of recovery if the threat is removed. This is a good example of how land stewardship is an effective tool to conserve endangered species.

AB  - Large-scale blooms of Phaeocystis globosa have caused serious damage to marine ecosystems in coastal waters of China. Phaeocystis blooms depend on the competitive advantage of their heteromorphic life history: colony formation has the benefit of resisting herbivory by zooplankton, and solitary cells can absorb nutrients rapidly. In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the metabolic differences between the two types of cells, morphological observations, rapid light curve analysis, fatty acid profiling, and transcriptome assessment were conducted in the laboratory. The rapid light curve of colonial cells was higher than that of solitary cells, which indicated that colonial cells had higher CO2 fixation capacity. The fatty acid level of colonial cells was evidently lower than that of solitary cells, which is consistent with down-regulated synthesis of fatty acids and up-regulated degradation of fatty acids in the transcriptome. ATP-binding cassette transporters, the TCA cycle, and biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides (EPS) also displayed obvious differences. In summary, colonial cells have stronger carbon fixation capacity. They do not synthesize fatty acids as energy storage materials but secrete EPS, which might be one of the mechanisms of colony formation. Here we present a physiological and molecular overview of the differences between solitary cells and colonial cells and thereby provide further insight to help unravel the mechanisms that help Phaeocystis globosa adapt to different environments.

AB  - Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease due to its global distribution, infectious- contagious potential (half a million new patients yearly), and a wide variety of niches (livestock, humans, wildlife, water, and air). A large part of these effects on the productive yields of cattle and goats in the Emilio Portes Gil community in the municipality of Puebla, Mexico, is attributed to Brucella. Therefore, this study aims to isolate Brucella sp. in agricultural soil samples in an area with a high incidence in animals and humans. Agricultural soil samples were used (n = 90). By standard microbiological methods, Brucella melitensis was isolated, and its presence was detected and confirmed in the analyzed samples, 100% for the primary isolation (total samples), 69.8% during reseeding, and 57% in the endpoint PCR confirmatory tests (using BM16 and E. coli as controls). The bp 26 gene was amplified by 1024 bp, and the microbiological profiles were identical for B. melitensis. This is the first record of detection, isolation, and confirmation of B. melitensis in agricultural soil in Mexico. The soil system is recognized as an extension of the niche for B. melitensis. These data constitute a useful tool to improve understanding of the pathogenesis and virulence of the Brucella genus in a natural environment and its potential effect on public and animal health.

AB  - PurposeTheileria species are tick-borne, intracellular apicomplexan protozoan parasites that pose a significant threat to livestock health and productivity. Theileria orientalis, the etiological agent of oriental theileriosis, is a benign Theileria species with worldwide distribution, including Algeria, where investigations on its prevalence and genetic diversity in domestic ruminants are limited. This study aimed to investigate the molecular and phylogenetic profiles of Theileria spp. in Algeria.MethodsA total of 149 blood samples were collected from cattle, sheep, and goats in Bouira and Tizi-Ouzou regions. Molecular identification was performed using a PCR assay targeting the Cox3 and Tams1 genes. Positive samples were sequenced to assess their phylogenetic relationships.ResultsAnalysis of the Cox3 gene revealed an overall infection rate of 12.75% +/- 2.73% (19/149), with all positive cases detected in cattle. Further analysis of the Tams1 gene identified Theileria annulata in 11.40% +/- 5.10% (17/149) of the samples. Sequencing of two samples negative for T. annulata showed a 99.84% identity with Theileria orientalis.ConclusionsThis study reports the identification of a novel T. orientalis Cox3 haplotype in Algeria, emphasizing the need for further epidemiologic and phylogenetic analyses to understand better the distribution, diversity, and impact of this pathogen on livestock populations in the region.

AB  - An environmental risk factor for schizophrenia (SZ) is maternal infection, which exerts longstanding effects on the neurodevelopment of offspring. Accumulating evidence suggests that synaptic disturbances may contribute to the pathology of the disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular B (EphB) receptor signaling plays an important role in synaptic plasticity by regulating the formation and maturation of dendritic spines and regulating excitatory neurotransmission. We examined whether EphB receptors and downstream associated proteins are susceptible to environmental risk factors implicated in the etiology of synaptic disturbances in SZ. Using an established rodent model, which closely imitates the characteristics of SZ, we observed the behavioral performance and synaptic structure of male offspring in adolescence and early adulthood. We then analyzed the expression of EphB receptors and associated proteins in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. Maternal immune activation offspring showed significantly progressive cognitive impairment and pre-pulse inhibition deficits together with an increase in the expression of EphB2 receptors and NMDA receptor subunits. We also found changes in EphB receptor downstream signaling, in particular, a decrease in phospho-cofilin levels which may explain the reduced dendritic spine density. Besides, we found that the AMPA glutamate, another glutamate ionic receptor associated with cofilin, decreased significantly in maternal immune activation offspring. Thus, alterations in EphB signaling induced by immune activation during pregnancy may underlie disruptions in synaptic plasticity and function in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus associated with behavioral and cognitive impairment. These findings may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying SZ.

AB  - Simple Summary The involvement of women in livestock production is a tradition around the world, where women have been associated with small animal farming, mainly based on family production systems. They used to be responsible for animal care (feeding and milking) and family care (children and the elderly), with the working hours exceeding the daily working time defined in developed countries. Men are responsible for the farm's management and finances. In Europe, small ruminants are mainly raised in adverse environments. Nevertheless, they contribute to maintaining an open environment and the prevention of fire damage in times of drought. On the farms studied, a lower incidence of mastitis in goats was found when a woman worked on the farm (they milk with more care and patience). In this study, there is a predominance of farms with women and men (a family unit), where the genders both equally participate when making decisions that involve household expenses; however, this shared control usually ends up being transferred to the man. In addition, very few women are the owners of farms or make binding decisions. Finally, the inclusion of women should be recommended throughout the small ruminant productive process: this would help improve farming results and provide an incentive to keep women in rural areas. One of the factors involved in goat milk production is the role of women as farmers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of women on dairy goat farms, considering: (1) the profile of women occupationally involved, (2) the organization of the women's work, (3) the degree of involvement by women in the decision-making on these farms, and (4) the influence of women's work on productive results. This study was conducted on 52 dairy goat farms in southern Spain. A descriptive analysis and means comparisons were performed to describe the farms where any women were involved or not. In 61.5% of the farms, at least one woman was involved, with an age of 42.2 +/- 8.8 years. Very few women were farm owners, although women took binding decisions in 81.25% of these farms. Their work is dedicated to milking and caring for the kids. Women had a positive influence on the productive variables analysed, and for mastitis in herds, the incidence was lower in herds where women participated (p < 0.01). In conclusion, it is recommended to include women's work as a factor when characterizing dairy goats farms' systems to evaluate their positive effect on a farm's performance.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on milk fat globule (MFG) size and the ruminal microbiome of goats. Twenty-four mid-lactation Saanen dairy goats weighing 49 +/- 4.5 kg (168 +/- 27 d in milk, 1.2 +/- 0.1 kg milk/d, 2-3 years old) were randomly divided into four groups-a control (CON) group, which was fed a basal diet, and three CLA supplementation groups, in which 30 g CLA (low-dose group, L-CLA), 60 g CLA (medium-dose group, M-CLA), or 90 g CLA (high-dose group, H-CLA) was added to the basal diet daily. The experiment lasted for 21 days, during which time goat milk was collected for composition and MFG size analysis. On day 21 of feeding, ruminal fluid was collected from the CON and H-CLA groups for analysis of the changes in microorganismal abundance. The results showed that CLA supplementation did not affect milk production, milk protein, or lactose content in the dairy goats (p > 0.05), but significantly reduced the milk fat content (p < 0.01) compared with the CON group. The CLA supplementation significantly decreased the D-[3,D-2] and D-[4,D-3] of the MFGs in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Moreover, dietary CLA inclusion increased the proportion of small-sized MFGs and decreased that of large-sized ones. The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that CLA-induced milk fat depression in dairy goats was accompanied by significant changes in the relative abundance of ruminal bacterial populations, most of which belonged to the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. The relative abundance of Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group and Prevolellaceae_UCG-003 in Bacteroidetes and UCG-002, Succiniclasticum, and norank_f__norank_o__Clostridia_vadinBB60_group in Firmicutes was significantly higher in the CON group than in the H-CLA group. In contrast, the relative abundance of norank_f__UCG-011, norank_f_Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_ group, unclassified_f__Lachnospiraceae, and UCG-001 in Firmicutes and norank_f__Muribaculaceae in Bacteroidetes was significantly higher in the H-CLA group than in the CON group. Correlation analysis showed that the milk fat content was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of some bacteria, including members of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Similarly, MFG size (D-[3,D-2] and D-[4,D-3]) was negatively correlated with several members of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, including Lachnospiraceae, norank_f__ UCG-011, UCG-001, norank_f__Eubacterium_ coprostanoligenes_group (Firmicutes), and norank_f__Muribaculaceae (Bacteroidetes), while positively correlated with the relative abundance of some members of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, including Mycoplasma, Succiniclasticum, norank_f__norank_o__Clostridia_vadinBB60_group, UCG-002 (Firmicutes), and Rikenellaceae_ RC9_gut_group (Bacteroidetes). Overall, our data indicated that CLA treatment affected milk fat content and MFG size in dairy goats, and these effects were correlated with the relative abundance of ruminal bacterial populations. These results provide the first evidence to explain the mechanism underlying diet-induced MFG from the perspective of the ruminal microbiome in dairy goats.

AB  - Determining sex in Cervidae species is crucial for wildlife management, conservation, breeding programs, disease surveillance, and forensic investigations. While existing genetic sexing methods have proven effective, they often involve time-consuming and resource-intensive processes. In response to the growing need for a more efficient and cost-effective technique, this study aimed to develop a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method for sex detection in various deer species. We designed LAMP primers specific to Cervidae based on sex chromosome-located genes, AmelogeninX, and SRY. Analytical specificity was confirmed using 108 samples from red deer, roe deer, and fallow deer, and species specificity was also tested in other deer and mammal species. Sex determination results were fast (40 min) and accurate (100% reliability). This technique has the advantage of allowing researchers to identify the sex of different deer species using the same method. Using the isothermal amplification properties of LAMP, this new method provides a simple, quick, and accurate tool to help researchers, wildlife managers, and forensic investigators with important sex-related questions in cervid populations.

AB  - BackgroundInteractions between alien plants and insect herbivores in introduced ranges may determine their invasion success. However, few studies have investigated whether alien plants respond differently to native and introduced herbivores in their introduced ranges and whether genotypes of alien plants matter. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine the effects of herbivory by a native insect (Spodoptera litura), by an introduced insect (S. frugiperda), and simultaneously by both insect species on growth, morphology, and biomass allocation of 17 genotypes of an invasive alien clonal plant Hydrocotyle verticillata, and used selection gradient analysis to test which herbivory conditions favor selection of a specific leaf or root trait value.ResultsDifferent genotypes of H. verticillata showed significant variation in growth, morphology, and biomass allocation, but their responses to herbivory were relatively consistent. All three herbivory treatments significantly decreased total mass and stolon mass, but herbivory of S. frugiperda increased specific leaf area. Herbivory of S. litura and simultaneous herbivory of both insect species also decreased leaf mass, petiole mass, root mass, and ramet mass. Selection gradient analysis showed that leaf and root traits varied under different herbivory treatments. To achieve greater fitness, as measured by total mass and/or number of ramets, H. verticillata favored larger leaf area under herbivory by S. frugiperda, larger leaf area and lower specific leaf area under herbivory by S. litura, and larger leaf area, lower specific leaf area, and lower root-to-shoot ratio under simultaneous herbivory.ConclusionsH. verticillata demonstrated contrasting responses to herbivory by native and introduced insects, showing a remarkable ability to coordinate leaf trait plasticity and optimize biomass allocation. This strategy allows H. verticillata to achieve greater fitness under various herbivory conditions, potentially contributing to its invasion success. These findings highlight the importance of plant-herbivore interactions in shaping invasion dynamics and underscore the complex adaptive mechanism that enables invasive plants to establish and spread in introduced ranges.

AB  - In this note we report the first direct evidence for Europe of coypus (Myocastor coypus) feeding on freshwater algae. Coypus fed on green algae of the genus Spirogyra (Zygne-matophyceae) in a Mediterranean coastal wetland of central Italy (Torre Flavia) where Spirogy-ra represents the most spread filamentous macroalgal stands. By analyzing Spirogyra stands, we also detected the presence of microalgae which, in turn, have been indirectly ingested by coypus: Ulnaria capitata, Navicula sp., Nitzschia sp. (Bacillariophyceae), Netrium digitus (Zygnematophyceae), and Phacus sp. (Euglenophyceae). Other taxa of green macroalgae, such as Cladophora glomerata and Ulva intestinalis (Ulvophyceae), were commonly recorded in the same area, however there is no evidence that they were consumed by coypus.

AB  - Earth resource and environmental monitoring are essential areas that can be used to investigate the environmental conditions and natural resources supporting sustainable policy development, regulatory measures, and their implementation elevating the environment. Large-scale forest fire is considered a major harmful hazard that affects climate change and life over the globe. Therefore, the early identification of forest fires using automated tools is essential to avoid the spread of fire to a large extent. Therefore, this paper focuses on the design of automated forest fire detection using a fusion-based deep learning (AFFD-FDL) model for environmental monitoring. The AFFD-FDL technique involves the design of an entropy-based fusion model for feature extraction. The combination of the handcrafted features using histogram of gradients (HOG) with deep features using SqueezeNet and Inception v3 models. Besides, an optimal extreme learning machine (ELM) based classifier is used to identify the existence of fire or not. In order to properly tune the parameters of the ELM model, the oppositional glowworm swarm optimization (OGSO) algorithm is employed and thereby improves the forest fire detection performance. A wide range of simulation analyses takes place on a benchmark dataset and the results are inspected under several aspects. The experimental results highlighted the betterment of the AFFD-FDL technique over the recent state of art techniques.

AB  - Many organisms rely on environmental cues to predict and anticipate the annual optimal timing of reproduction. In insectivorous birds, preparation for breeding often coincides with the time vegetation starts to develop in spring. Whether there is a direct relationship between the two, and through which mechanisms this link could come about, has rarely been investigated. Plants release herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) when they are attacked by insects, and recent studies have shown that birds can detect and orient to those odours when searching for food. Whether those volatiles also stimulate sexual reproductive development and timing of reproduction remains to be discovered. We tested this hypothesis by monitoring gonadal growth in pairs of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus) exposed to air from caterpillar-infested oak trees or from a control, in spring. We found that while males and females grew their gonads over time, gonads grew at the same rate in both odour treatments. More exploratory (i.e. a proxy of personality) females did, however, have larger ovarian follicle sizes when exposed to the HIPVs than to the control air, which is consistent with earlier results showing that fast explorers have larger gonads in spring and are more sensitive to HIPVs. If HIPVs constitute powerful attractants in foraging birds, their influence on gonadal development prior to breeding appears to be relatively subtle and to only enhance reproductive readiness in some individuals. These results are nevertheless important as they set olfaction as a new player in the seasonal timing of reproduction in birds.

AB  - Food web research needs to be predictive in order to support decisions system-based conservation. In order to increase predictability and applicability, complexity needs to be managed in such a way that we are able to provide simple and clear results. One question emerging frequently is whether certain perturbations (environmental effects or human impact) have positive or negative effects on natural ecosystems or their particular components. Yet, most of food web studies do not consider the sign of effects. Here, we study 6 versions of the Kelian River (Borneo) food web, representing six study sites along the river. For each network, we study the signs of the effects of a perturbed trophic group i on each other j groups. We compare the outcome of the relatively complicated dynamical simulation model and the relatively simple loop analysis model. We compare these results for the 6 sites and also the 14 trophic groups. Finally, we see if sign-agreement and sign-determinacy depend on certain structural features (node centrality, interaction strength). We found major differences between different modelling scenarios, with herbivore-detritivore fish behaving in the most consistent, while algae and particulate organic matter behaving in the least consistent way. We also found higher agreement between the signs of predictions for trophic groups at higher trophic levels in sites 1-3 and at lower trophic levels in site 4-6. This means that the behaviour of predators in the more natural sections of the river and that of producers at the more human-impacted sections are more consistently predicted. This suggests to be more careful with the less consistently predictable trophic groups in conservation management.

AB  - Simple Summary Cytoplasmic droplets (CD) represent a common sperm abnormality in boar. Their negative effect on fertility might be compensated by high numbers of morphological and functional intact spermatozoa in the insemination dose. To prove this hypothesis, a retrospective analysis of fertility data from 1497 inseminations obtained with 260 extended ejaculates of 130 boar was performed. CD rates > 11% provided a greater risk for reduced litter sizes. However, average litter sizes in the semen group with high CD rate (>15%) did not differ from groups with medium (10-15%) or low (<10%) CD rates. The farrowing rate was even slightly higher in the high CD group. This was accompanied by a higher tolerance of sperm to heat and cold stress compared to semen groups with lower CD rates. Other functional sperm parameters did not differ between the three CD groups. In conclusion, an increased rate of CD in extended boar semen portions can be compensated by a high percentage of stress-tolerant sperm so that fertility is not affected. Retained cytoplasmic droplets (CD) provide the most abundant sperm abnormality in boar and reduce fertility. It is still unclear as to whether high CD rates in semen portions are compensable. The aim was to explore the impact of CD in relation to quantitative and qualitative sperm traits on fertility performance of sows. Retrospective data analysis of 1497 inseminations was performed. Ejaculates (n = 260) were assigned to three groups with low (<10%), medium (>= 10% to <15%), and high (>= 15%) CD rates. Average sperm numbers were lowest in the high CD group (2.08 x 10(9)/mL). Membrane integrity and mitochondrial activity did not differ between the groups. Breakpoint analysis indicated a shift towards lower litter sizes when the CD rate exceeded 11%. Group comparisons revealed no difference in litter size (p = 0.205), together with a slightly higher farrowing rate in the high CD group (p < 0.001), which coincided with higher resistance against temperature stress in the stored semen samples (p < 0.001) and a higher sperm motility (p < 0.001). In conclusion, an increased prevalence of CD in boar semen is compensable by high tolerance against temperature stress, whereas sperm numbers per dose are less relevant.

AB  - One of the major challenges in the aquaculture of marine organisms is the susceptibility to pathogens. Immune cells defend bacterial invasion by recognizing pathogen -associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria. The white body are key organs for immune response and hematopoiesis, and play an important role in understanding the antimicrobial biological response in gold -ringed octopus ( Amphioctopus fangsiao ). In the present research, transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were conducted on A. fangsiao white body tissue after 6 h and 24 h of LPS stimulation. The results showed 2,029 and 73 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the 6- and 24 -hour time points, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were beneficial in determining immune -related terms and signaling pathways. Subsequently, a protein -protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and 20 hub genes, such as AKT3, MAPK14 , and PIK3CA , were identified. These genes are involved in a variety of signaling pathways, including the Hippo signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathway, and leukocyte trans endothelial migration. Using qRT-PCR, the accuracy of the 20 hub genes was verified. The present study provides a substantial theoretical foundation for the research on A. fangsiao white body immunity, enhancing the current understanding of cephalopods ' innate immunity.

AB  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an extract enriched with growth factors that facilitate skin regeneration and rejuvenation. Here, the functionalities of PRP derived from various animal sources have been investigated and compared, focusing on its potential therapeutic applications in skin regeneration. Total antioxidant capacity, wound closure, and melanin content in cultured keratinocytes were used to evaluate the efficacy of different animal PRP sources. The PRP derived from deer exhibited the highest performance and was selected for subsequent proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Our findings indicate that deer blood is an optimal source of animal-derived PRP, demonstrating significant properties in promoting wound healing, anti-inflammatory responses, and skin regeneration. This identified PRP from deer sources can be developed as a safe and effective product for skin rejuvenation and regeneration.

AB  - Herbivorous insects experience diverse plant stimuli, the relative influence of which depends upon the scale of the interface between both organisms and the insect's life history. Using microCT and SEM, we conducted a whole insect study of the sensory structures of Glycaspis brimblecombei (Hemiptera: Psylloidea; commonly called psyllids or jumping plant lice) to understand this tiny insect's utilisation of the leaves of their tree hosts- especially to reconcile rapid host assessment versus protracted, sinuous searching behaviours. Each compound eye comprises 360 ommatidia of relatively uniform density and facet diameter indicating limited spatial resolution and sensitivity. The areas of highest relative sampling resolution are not directed ventrally towards the surface of leaves but laterally and dorsally. There is a high abundance of chemo- and mechanosensory sensilla on the genal cones (216-240) and fewer on the terminalia (120-150), i.e. body parts regularly in contact with leaf surfaces. There are even fewer such sensilla on the basitarsi (10-16) and only putative olfactory sensilla on the antennae. Leaf surface conformation probably guides females to veins while contact chemoreception likely stimulates probing; the number of eggs deposited is likely determined by the flow and quality of nutrients experienced during feeding. For this psyllid, vision aids movements among leaves and relocation of hosts if dislodged by wind or escaping predators. Walking, as opposed to flying, maintains continuity of exposure to plant stimuli essential to maximising reproductive success. Such a life history is possible on large, evergreen hosts and is facilitated by rapid accept/reject discrimination of ingesta. (c) 2024 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are accompanied by neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity, in which microglia and astrocytes play an important role. However, there is still no clear understanding of how glial cells interact in the processes associated with inflammatory reactions in the brain. The study was aimed to elucidate the in vitro effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as an inducer of inflammatory reactions, on transcription levels of the Slc superfamily transporter genes in microglia, depending on the astrocytic environment, as well as to reveal regional differences in these levels. The study was carried out on microglial cells in both monoculture and co-culture with astrocytes. Microglia and astrocytes were isolated from the cortex and hippocampus of 21-day-old Wistar rats. Microglial activation was induced by LPS. Transcription levels of the genes encoding Slc family transporters were analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LPS was shown to induce an increase in transcription levels of genes encoding the neuronal excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (Slc1a1, EAAT3), excitatory amino acid transporter 4 (Slc1a6, EAAT4), vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (Slc17a7, VGLUT1), and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (Slc16a1, MCT1a1) in microglial cells in vitro both in monoculture and in the presence of astrocytes. Transcription levels of the Slc family transporter genes significantly increased in all studied cultures compared to non-activated microglial cultures (control): in non-activated microglia-astrocyte co-cultures by 30.8-172.3%, in LPS-activated microglial monocultures by 33.5-63.3%, in LPS-activated microglia-astrocyte co-cultures by 17.8-76.0%. Moreover, regional differences were revealed in transcription levels of the above transporter genes in response to LPS administration. Thus, the data obtained confirm a change in the transcription profile of glutamate and monocarboxylate transporters upon LPS-induced activation of microglia, as well as the involvement of the astrocytic environment in these changes. Overall, it was shown that the exposure to a proinflammatory factor (LPS) activates the transcription of Slc family transporter genes in microglial cells.

AB  - Simple Summary: Given the escalating production of livestock and poultry coupled with the surging cost of soybean meal, the quest for alternative raw materials capable of replacing soybean meal is gaining increasing significance. Rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower seed meal, which are common by-products of agricultural production, offer viable plant-based protein substitutes for soybean meal in pig production. This study reveals that the incorporation of miscellaneous meal (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower seed meal) as a substitute for soybean meal in the diet did not significantly influence the growth performance, apparent nutrient digestibility, serum amino acid content, or fecal microbiota diversity of growing pigs weighing between 50 and 75 kg. These results suggest that miscellaneous meal (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower seed meal) could potentially serve as a partial or complete replacement for soybean meal in the diet of growing pigs.This study was carried out to investigate the effects of miscellaneous meal (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower seed meal) as a replacement for soybean meal on growth performance, apparent nutrient digestibility, serum biochemical parameters, serum free amino acid contents, and gut microbiota of 50-75 kg growing pigs. A total of 54 healthy growing pigs (Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire) with initial body weights (BWs) of 50.64 +/- 2.09 kg were randomly divided into three treatment groups, which included the corn-soybean meal group (CON), corn-soybean-miscellaneous meal group (CSM), and corn-miscellaneous meal group (CM). Each treatment included six replicates with three pigs in each replicate. Dietary protein levels were maintained at 15% in all three treatment groups. Additional rapeseed meals, cottonseed meals, and sunflower seed meals were added to the CSM group's meals to partially replace the 10.99% soybean meal in the CON group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Pigs in the CM group were fed a diet with a mixture of miscellaneous meals (7.69% rapeseed meal, 7.69% cottonseed meal, and 7.68% sunflower seed meal) to totally replace soybean meal. Our findings revealed that there was no significant impact of replacing soybean meal with miscellaneous meal on the ADG (average daily gain), ADFI (average daily feed intake), or F/G (feed-to-gain ratio) (p > 0.05) of growing pigs weighing 50-75 kg, nor on the crude protein, crude fat, or gross energy (p > 0.05) of the diet. On the other hand, compared to the CON group, the CM group exhibited significantly elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and triglyceride (TG) levels (p < 0.05), while urea levels were significantly reduced (p < 0.05). No significant effect was observed on the serum free amino acid contents (p > 0.05) following the substitution of soybean meal with miscellaneous meal. A t-test analysis indicated that compared with the CON group, the CM group exhibited a significantly diminished abundance of Euryachaeota at the phylum level and augmented abundance of Desulfobacterota at the genus level. This study demonstrated that the miscellaneous meals (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower seed meal) as a substitute for soybean meal in the diet had no significant negative effects on the growth performance, apparent nutrient digestibility, serum amino acid content, or diversity of fecal microbiota in 50-75 kg growing pigs.
   These results can be helpful in developing further miscellaneous meals (rapeseed meal, cottonseed meal, and sunflower seed meal) as functional alternative feed ingredients to soybean meal in pig diets.

AB  - Tibetan sheep are known for their high-quality meat and strong ability to adapt,but limited information is available on the effect of dietary concentrate-to-forage ratio on carcasstraits, meat quality, rumen fermentation and gut microbiota of Tibetan sheep during the cold season.Therefore, this study investigated the impact of the different concentrate-to-forage ratios on slaughterperformance, meat quality, rumen fermentation, and rumen and fecal microbial community composi-tion. The results revealed that an increase in the dietary concentrate level from 30% to 70% positivelyimpacted slaughter performance, tenderness, and juiciness of Tibetan sheep meat. Meat color wasoptimized with high acceptability by consumers and was observed at a dietary concentrate-to-forageratio of 50:50. Correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation between specific gastrointestinalbacteria and slaughter performance as well as with meat quality. These findings offer insights intothe effect of the diet on slaughter performance, meat quality, rumen microbiota, and fecal microbiotaof Tibetan sheep, which may inform decisions regarding feeding strategies. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different dietary concentrate-to-forage ratios on slaughter performance, meat quality, rumen fermentation, rumen microbiota and fecal microbiota in Tibetan sheep. A total of sixty male Tibetan sheep were equally allocated into three dietary groups based on concentrate-to-forage ratios, i.e., 30:70 (C30), 50:50 (C50), and 70:30 (C70). Compared with the C30 group, sheep fed the C70 diet resulted in a higher (p < 0.05) slaughter live weight (SLW), hot carcass weight (HCW), dressing percentage (DP), eye muscle area, average daily gain (ADG), and ruminal total volatile fatty acids concentration and propionate molar proportion and lower (p < 0.05) shear force and cooking loss of meat, and ruminal acetate molar proportion and acetate:propionate ratio. Sheep in the C50 group exhibited a higher (p < 0.05) SLW, HCW, ADG, and ruminal propionate molar proportion and lower (p < 0.05) shear force and cooking loss of meat, and ruminal acetate molar proportion and acetate: propionate ratio compared with the C30 group. In rumen fluid, the relative abundance of Butyrivibrio was lower (p = 0.031) in the C30 group, and that of Ruminococcus was higher (p = 0.003) in the C70 group compared with the C50 group. In feces, genus Monoglobus and UCG_002 were the most abundant in the C30 group (p < 0.05), and the relative abundance of Prevotella was significantly higher in the C70 group than in other groups (p = 0.013). Correlation analysis revealed possible links between slaughter performance and meat quality and altered microbiota composition in the rumen and feces of Tibetan sheep. Overall, feeding a C70 diet resulted in superior carcass characteristics and meat quality in Tibetan sheep, thus laying a theoretical basis for the application of short-term remote feeding during the cold season.

AB  - Photo-identification has been proven to be a successful individual recognition tool in seahorse species (e.g., long-snout seahorse Hippocampus reidi (Ginsburg, 1933) and long-snouted seahorse Hippocampus guttulatus (Cuvier, 1829)). Its use was deemed valuable for the assessment of wild populations and to understand variations in abundance over time when capture-recapture methods are needed. In this study, a computer software with a pattern recognition algorithm (I3S (R) Contour 3.0) was used for individual identification of short-snouted seahorses Hippocampus hippocampus (Linnaeus 1758) in the laboratory. Using this methodology, differences in the shape of each individual's coronet were tested as a unique and distinguishable characteristic. Two different contours were used as reference and tested to assess the effectiveness of this method in individual identification. A total of 94 captive-bred H. hippocampus, 45 adults (> 1 year old) and 49 young adults (4 months old), were tested. Positive matches were obtained in 55.1 % of the young adults and 84.4 % of the adults using contour 1; and in 77.6 % and 97.8 % for young adults and adults, respectively, using contour 2. All un-matched photos were later successfully matched by visual comparison, using additional traits (e.g., spot patterns) and gender. This methodology yielded very promising results and could be further used in wild individuals to allow population size estimates.

AB  - Neuromedin S (NMS) plays various roles in reproductive regulation, while the mechanism by which NMS regulates ovarian steroidogenesis remains unclear. In the current study, we confirmed the enhancement role of NMS in steroidogenesis in goat ovarian granulosa cells (GCs). To further explore the specific mechanism, we conducted a knockdown of NMUR2 in GCs followed by treatment with NMS and determined the effects of NMS treatment on mitochondrial morphology and function. The results found that NMS treatment increased the production of estrogen and up-regulated the expression of STAR, CYP11A1, 3BHSD, and CYP19A1, while the effects of NMS treatment were blocked by the knockdown of NMUR2 in goat GCs. Moreover, NMS treatment enhanced the fusion of mitochondria and up-regulated the expression of OPA1, MFN1, and MFN2, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential, the activity of respiratory chain enzymes and ATP production by maintaining a low expression level of mitochondrial unfolded protein response markers. The effects of NMS treatment on mitochondria were reversed by NMUR2 knockdown and NMS cotreatment. The possible mechanism of the results above was revealed by NMS treatment activating the Hippo pathway effector YAP1 and then managing the expression of phosphorylation PPARGC1A (Ser571). Together, these data showed that NMS promoted the fusion of mitochondria and protected mitochondrial function from mitochondrial unfolded protein response possibly via the NMUR2/YAP1/PPARGC1A pathway, thereby affecting the steroidogenesis of goat GCs. By elaborating the potential mechanism of NMS in regulating estrogen production in goat GCs, our results can serve as the mechanism reference for follicular growth and development.

AB  - Simple Summary Boar taint is a major cause of consumer complaints about pork but it can be eliminated by immunizing entire males against gonadotrohpin releasing factor (immunocastrated males). However, immunocastrated males have increased feed intake and backfat compared to entire males, which is an issue in countries such as Australia, where producers are penalized for high backfat. The inclusion of an in-feed ingredient, albus lupins, is one way to suppress the voluntary intake of IC male pigs and subsequently their fat deposition, but the appropriate quantity to include in the diet had not been determined. Albus lupins are thought to reduce feed intake due to slower transit of feed through the digestive system, which then influences satiety. The albus lupin concentration to maximize growth rate, minimize feed intake, maximize carcass weight and minimize backfat depth was 120, 142, 62.7 and 138 g/kg, respectively. An experiment was conducted to determine the appropriate dietary concentration of albus lupins that would lower feed intake and decrease backfat while optimizing the effect on the growth rate of immunocastrated male pigs. The pigs were fed albus lupins (varying from 0 to 200 g/kg) from 2 weeks after the last immunization against GnRF for 14 d prior to slaughter (where d 0 is the day of the last immunization against GnRF). Increasing the dietary albus lupin concentration decreased daily gain for d 15 to 28 (p = 0.004). Daily feed intake also decreased as the concentration of the albus lupins increased for d 15 to 28 (p < 0.001). Carcass weight and backfat decreased as the concentration of dietary albus lupins increased (p = 0.011 and p = 0.024, respectively). The albus lupin concentration to maximize growth rate, minimize feed intake, maximize carcass weight and minimize backfat depth was 120, 142, 62.7 and 138 g/kg, respectively.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous parasite increasingly detected in marine mammals and suspected to contribute to limited recovery of endangered populations. This study reports on the exposure of the Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) to this protozoon using archived adult and pup sera from three island colonies in South Australia. Modified agglutination testing (MAT) detected a seroprevalence of 30.4% (95% CI 13.2-52.9: n = 23) and high antibody titers (512 to > 2048 IU/ml) in adult females (median age 9.5 y, range 5.5-14.5 y) at Dangerous Reef, a felid-free island. Antibodies weren't detected in any surveyed pup (97.5% CI 0.0-2.0%, n = 184) at two felid-free islands (Dangerous Reef: n = 21; Olive Island: n = 65), nor at Kangaroo Island (n = 98), which has a high-density feral cat population. Kangaroo Island pups of known age were 7-104 d old, while standard length and bodyweight comparison suggested younger and older pup cohorts at Dangerous Reef and Olive Island, respectively. This study provides the first quantification of disease risk in this endangered species from T. gondii exposure. The absence of detectable pup seroconversion supports the lack of detectable congenital transmission, maternal antibody persistence or early post-natal infection in the sampled cohort yet to commence foraging. An extended serosurvey of N. cinerea colonies is recommended to confirm the hypothesis of predominantly forage-associated exposure to T. gondii in this species. Findings have implications for parasitic disease risk in wildlife inhabiting Australia's islands and for the feral cat control program on Kangaroo Island.

AB  - Soil salinity is an increasingly severe problem affecting plant growth and development thus posing a threat to agricultural production worldwide. Many crops currently grown are susceptible to even moderate salt stress, and crop diversification is sought to cope with increasingly challenging environmental conditions. Camelina sativa is a versatile, underutilized, low-input Brassicaceae oilseed crop valued for its high-quality seeds and its resilience to a wide range of climate conditions. In this study, the effects of salt stress on the growth and productivity of two camelina cultivars and six landraces from different geographic regions were examined. The performance of these lines was related to adjustments in their carbohydrate metabolic enzyme activity profiles in leaves as a central physiological hub. Profiling enzyme activities and their regulation in response to salt stress revealed significant genotype x treatment (G x T) interactions and allowed the identification of specific activity signatures associated with differences in yield stability in the tested lines. Yield-stable landraces showed distinct regulation patterns contrasting those of less yield-stable lines. In particular, upregulation of specific enzyme activities was associated with yield stability under salt stress. Camelina landraces may be promising resources to improve tolerance to salinity, with plasticity in carbohydrate metabolism as a contributing mechanism. Overall, these results provide a valuable basis for enzyme activity signatures as new physiological markers for supporting breeding programmes.

AB  - The hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes a common infectious disease that infects pigs, wild boars, deer, and humans. In most cases, humans are infected by eating raw meat. Some essential oils have been reported to exhibit antiviral activities. In this study, in order to investigate the anti-HEV properties of essential oils, the immunoreactivities of HEV antigen proteins against the relevant antibodies were analyzed after the HEV antigens underwent treatment with various essential oils. The essential oils extracted from the tea tree, which was previously reported to exhibit antiviral activity, lavender, and lemon had strongly reduced activity. We found that treatment with the essential oil prepared from Sakhalin spruce was associated with the strongest reduction in immunoreactivity of HEV antigen protein(s) among the tested substances. The main volatile constituents of Sakhalin spruce essential oil were found to be bornyl acetate (32.30 %), alpha-pinene (16.66 %), camphene (11.14 %), camphor (5.52 %), beta-phellandrene (9.09 %), borneol (4.77 %), and limonene (4.57 %). The anti-HEV properties of the various components of the essential oils were examined: treatment with bornyl acetate, the main component of Sakhalin spruce oil, alpha-pinene, the main component of tea tree oil, and limonene, the main component of lemon oil, resulted in a strong reduction in HEV antigen immunoreactivity. These results indicate that each main component of the essential oils plays an important role in the reduction of the immunoreactivity of HEV antigen protein(s); they also suggest that Sakhalin spruce essential oil exhibits anti-HEV activity. In a formulation with the potential to eliminate the infectivity of HEV in foodborne infections, this essential oil can be applied as an inactivating agent for meat processing and cooking utensils, such as knives and chopping boards.

AB  - The West Kalimantan province in Borneo island, Indonesia belongs to endemic area of Japanese encephalitis (JE) that accounts for approximately 30% of total cases yearly. As the presence of pig holdings is uncommon in West Kalimantan, another reservoir host might have played a role in the local transmission of JE virus in this area. Current study aimed to identify the potential role of bats in the local transmission of JE by performing molecular detection of JE virus in bats and mosquitoes using RT-PCR. Sample collection was performed in 3 districts in West Kalimantan, covering 3 different ecosystems: forest, coastal, and residential areas. Bat collection was performed using mist net and harp net, while mosquito collection was carried out using animal-baited trap and human landing collection. A total of 373 blood samples from bats were tested for JE virus, among which 21 samples (5.6%) showed positive results, mainly from Cynopterus brachyotis (lesser short-nosed fruit bat) found in residential areas. Out of 53 mosquito pools, 3 JE-positive pools of Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. vishnui were collected at the same location as JE-positive bats. Current study showed the first evidence of JE virus detection in several species of Megachiropteran bats in Indonesia, demonstrated the potential role of frugivorous bats in local transmission of JE in West Kalimantan. More aggressive measures are required in JE risk mitigation, particularly in initiating JE vaccination campaign and in avoiding disruption of bats' natural habitats through changes in land-use.

AB  - To better understand tick ecology in Virginia and the increasing Lyme disease incidence in western Virginia, a comparative phenological study was conducted in which monthly collections were performed at twelve sampling locations in southwestern Virginia (high Lyme disease incidence) and 18 equivalent sampling locations in southeastern Virginia (low Lyme disease incidence) for one year. In western Virginia, we also explored the effect of elevation on collection rates of Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) and Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae). In total, 35,438 ticks were collected (33,106 A. americanum; 2,052 I. scapularis; 134 Ixodes affinis Neumann [Acari: Ixodidae]; 84 Dermacentor variabilis [Say] [Acari: Ixodidae]; 49 Dermacentor albipictus [Packard] [Acari: Ixodidae]; 10 Haemaphysalis leporispalustris [Packard] [Acari: Ixodidae]; 2 Ixodes brunneus Koch [Acari: Ixodidae]; 1 Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann [Acari: Ixodidae]). Within southwestern Virginia, Ixodes scapularis collection rates were not influenced by elevation, unlike A. americanum which were collected more frequently at lower elevations (e.g., below 500 m). Notably, I. scapularis larvae and nymphs were commonly collected in southwestern Virginia (indicating that they were questing on or above the leaf litter) but not in southeastern Virginia. Questing on or above the leaf litter is primarily associated with northern populations of I. scapularis. These findings may support the hypothesis that I. scapularis from the northeastern United States are migrating into western Virginia and contributing to the higher incidence of Lyme disease in this region. This comparative phenological study underscores the value of these types of studies and the need for additional research to further understand the rapidly changing tick-borne disease dynamics in Virginia.

   The welfare of animals in human care should be taken into consideration by both the scientific community and members of the public who are able to view animals in a zoo setting. One component of individual welfare is how groups of animals and the individuals within groups may be affected by the presence of zoo guests. At the Buffalo Zoo in New York, we studied the behavioral differences of six gorillas in two conditions: heavy guest presence and the complete absence of guests. We found few significant behavioral differences between the conditions, with the greatest behavioral change observed in the adult silverback male. We stress the importance of not over-generalizing our findings, and suggest an inter-institutional study of the nuanced ways that zoo guests interact with gorillas in managed care.
   Research conducted on the effects that zoo visitors have on primate behavior has yielded inconsistent patterns. This study aims to contribute to the growing body of literature regarding visitor effects on zoo-housed primate's activity budgets, with the purpose of quantifying the behavioral variability under two conditions: guest presence and guest absence. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many zoos were closed to the public for varying lengths of time. The Buffalo Zoo was closed to guests for an 18-week period including the summer of 2020, which allowed us to effectively control for zoo guest presence. This case report compares data on the zoo's gorilla troop from the same time period in 2019. We found inconsistent results, similar to prior studies conducted with zoo-housed gorilla troops. Most gorillas were observed foraging less and exhibiting more inactivity in 2020, whereas the adult male silverback showed the opposite pattern. Abnormal or undesirable behaviors were performed less frequently when guests were absent however, these differences were not significant. We encourage others to compare behavior patterns during the pandemic shutdown to add to our knowledge base of visitor effects. We suggest that researchers do not try and generalize their individual and troop results to the entire population of gorillas in managed care, as both intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to individual differences in behavioral response.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the interaction between pesticides and climate change is critical to the safety of pesticide applications. Many insecticides are actually more toxic at higher temperatures. However, little is currently known about the effect of temperature on the toxicity of chemicals. In order to fill this knowledge gap and improve our understanding of the mechanisms of temperature effects, the present study investigated the toxic, physiological, and behavioral effects of four insecticides, chlorfenapyr, fipronil, imidacloprid, and indoxacarb, on subterranean termites, Reticulitermes flaviceps at different temperatures (24 to 32 degrees C). The results show that the sensitivity of R. flaviceps to chrofenapyr (LC 50 = 8.67 -152.49 mg/L), fipronil (LC 50 = 10.14 -36.84 mg/L), imidacloprid (LC 50 = 184.27 -326.47 mg/L) and indoxacarb (LC 50 = 12.23 -46.23 mg/L) substantially increased when the temperature alters from 24 to 32 degrees C. Additionally, the activities of three detoxification enzymes [glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), carboxylesterase (CarE), and cytochrome P450 (P450)] of R. flaviceps were also measured of four insecticide at various temperatures. Correlation analysis reveals that changes in GSTs CarE and P450 activities of R. flaviceps are closely related to their sensitivity to chlorfenapyr, fipronil, imidacloprid, and indoxacarb. Meanwhile, the speed of action (LT 50 value) of four insecticides is positively affected by temperature. In addition, intoxication, ataxia, and moribundity behaviors were observed in most concentrations and temperature combinations for chlorfenapyr, fipronil, and imidacloprid -exposed termite. The findings of our research emphasize that in the context of global climate change, the development and application of pesticides should consider the temperature dimension.

AB  - The USDA Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network aims to enhance sustainable agricultural management practices through a coordinated, cross-site common experiment involving 18 locations across the United States. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the LTAR grazing lands common experiment at the Northern Plains (NP) site, where an experiment was initiated in 2019 to answer producers' and researchers' questions about whether the tactical application of fire or grazing can reduce the dominance of invasive Kentucky bluegrass in northern Great Plains ecosystems. As part of the LTAR common experiment, we contrast a prevailing practice (season-long grazing at moderate stocking rate) with four alternative practices at a half-hectare plot scale: (1) mob grazing by cattle, (2) multi-species grazing (mob grazing by cattle, with goats foraging at key times of the year), (3) prescribed fire, and (4) prescribed fire followed by cattle grazing. A stakeholder group is engaged in the co-production process to determine alternative practices and how to apply them. Every 5 years, the treatment with the best overall outcomes is applied at a field scale (15 ha), resulting in a core treatment contrast of prevailing versus alternative grazing management systems. This experiment aims to develop alternative agroecological practices that optimize current and future economic and ecosystem benefits.
   Grazing lands in the Northern Plains (NP) are mixed-grass prairies that sustain an abundance of plants, wildlife, and livestock. The NP Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Grazing Lands Common Experiment examines tradeoffs between season-long grazing and alternatives. Alternative treatments include the use of prescribed fire, different types of grazing, and range seeding. The treatment with best outcomes is applied at a field scale, contrasting prevailing versus alternative systems. A project-specific stakeholder focus group actively engages in treatment selection and implementation decisions.
   Grazing lands in the northern Great Plains of the United States sustain abundant plants, wildlife, and livestock. Potential shifts toward more dry and variable weather conditions may be challenging for managing these lands. Effective and feasible management methods need to be developed in collaboration with, and for land managers. The northern Great Plains Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network Grazing Lands Common Experiment was designed to meet this need. The LTAR experiment at the Northern Plains examines management options such as mob grazing, multi-species grazing, prescribed fire, and rangeland seeding. Alternative practices will be updated based on the interests of scientists and focus group members.

AB  - After dissection of a large blast furnace, the erosion mechanism of carbon bricks after service in a blast furnace (BF) hearth was studied. Obvious "elephant foot" erosion characteristics emerged in the height direction of the BF. The existing forms of carbon bricks after service were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and chemical analysis. The results showed that Zn and iron erosion above and below the taphole was observed in the BF, while iron and Zn erosion acted only as a key factor of carbon brick erosion. The convective heat transfer coefficient in the lower part of the hearth of the BF was large, which increased the temperature of the hearth sidewall, resulting in the increase in the carbon-unsaturation of the molten iron at the sidewall, and intensified erosion to the hearth sidewall. The average pore size (1.083 mu m) of the carbon bricks on the hot-face of the hearth sidewall was smaller than the critical size (2.12 mu m) of the molten iron that penetrated the pores of the carbon bricks, which was not conducive to the penetration of molten iron.

AB  - The Peninsular Indian population of the endangered Asian elephant occurs in the Western and Eastern Ghats, and further north-east in the Eastern Central Indian (ECI) range. Using DNA obtained from fresh elephant dung, this study assessed the genetic variation, population structure, and gene flow in the two southern populations, SI1 and SI2, separated by the Palghat Gap in the Western Ghats, and the third population in the ECI range. As these populations have been shown to be genetically associated in previous studies, the hypotheses that their combined genetic diversity would be high and gene flow via migration would be evident, were tested. A total of 379 elephants were genotyped at 10 microsatellite markers, and a 630 bp mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) fragment from the D-loop region was sequenced from 33 individuals. Four previously documented mtDNA haplotypes were identified: SI1 and ECI each had a single haplotype (BN and BL, respectively), while SI2 had two haplotypes (BA and BF). The mtDNA markers indicated substantial genetic differentiation among the populations, while differentiation using microsatellite data was moderate. The populations were assigned to three genetic groups: SI1, SI2, and the ECI. However, 39% of these individuals showed mixed ancestry, indicating ongoing gene flow despite natural and human-made barriers. Several first-generation male migrants were identified providing further evidence of contemporary gene flow. The sex ratio was female-biased, which is consistent with the existing census data. These three populations should be managed as a single conservation unit to ensure their long term viability.

AB  - Pointhead flounder (Cleisthenes pinetorum) and blackfin flounder (Glyptocephalus stelleri) are key commercial species distributed in the East Sea off the Korean coast. Evaluating the stock status of commercial fish is essential for sustainable fisheries management, as it informs conservation efforts and resource allocation. This study evaluated the stock status of these two flounder species using three length-based assessment methods: TropFishR, length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR), and length-based Bayesian Biomass (LBB). Length and weight data from 1947 pointhead flounders and 4715 blackfin flounders were collected in the eastern waters of Korea. Both species exhibited positive allometric growth patterns, with b values of 3.40 and 3.39, respectively. Among the growth parameters estimated via the ELEFAN-GA method, the asymptotic length was 43.44 and 42.27 cm, and the growth coefficient was 0.20 and 0.16 year-1 for pointhead and blackfin flounder, respectively, while the total mortality derived from the length-converted catch curve for the two species was 1.19 year-1 and 0.92 year-1 , respectively. Both species showed exploitation rates above the optimal value of 0.5 (0.69 for pointhead flounder and 0.66 for blackfin flounder), which indicated overexploitation. The LBSPR results revealed low spawning potential ratios of 0.19 for the former and 0.23 for the latter, which indicated recruitment overfishing. Furthermore, growth overfishing was also evident, as most samples were below the length at first maturity, i.e., 24.67 cm for pointhead flounder and 24.09 cm for blackfin flounder. The ratio of fishing mortality to natural mortality was 2.87 and 2.25, respectively, exceeding the reference point of 1 for both species, while that of current biomass to virgin biomass was 0.12 and 0.15, respectively, both below the reference point of 0.50. The current fishing mortality rates were 61.44 % and 36.06 % higher than the reference point F0.4 for pointhead flounder and blackfin flounder, respectively.

AB  - Copepods represent an interesting alternative or a complement live food to brine shrimps and rotifers commonly used in aquaculture. They constitute the natural prey of many fish species and therefore do not require a potential nutritional enrichment. But an optimization of the microalgal diets used to feed copepods is essential to improve their mass culture. This study examined the effects of seven microalgal diets, namely single-species diets of Rhodomonas salina (R), Tisochrysis lutea (T), and Pavlova lutheri (=Diacronema lutheri) (P), two-species diets (R + T, T + P, and R + P), and a three-species diet (R + T + P), on the fatty acid and monosaccharide composition of the cyclopoid copepod Paracyclopina nana as well as its reproductive investment. Experiments were run during 15 days in 10-L beakers; starting with nauplii collected from a large 300-L batch culture. Copepods fatty acid contents were studied, particularly the relative amounts of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosa-pentaenoic acid (EPA). The R + T, R, and T diets induced the highest total fatty acid amount in copepods. R + T and R also generated the lowest DHA/EPA ratios in copepods due to high EPA contents. The highest value of total monosaccharides was found in copepods fed with R + T + P. Diets R + T and R induced the greatest prosome volumes and clutch volumes in ovigerous females. Both prosome volume and clutch volume in P. nana ovigerous females were correlated to the individual EPA amount. The results demonstrated that all diets including R. salina enhanced the productivity of P. nana in mass culture, particularly when combined with T. lutea. R. salina, and T. lutea induced complementary fatty acid and monosaccharide profiles, confirming that R + T represents the best microalgae combination for productive culture of P. nana. Conversely, P. lutheri did not enhance the nutritional profile nor the fecundity of P. nana in the culture. This study is the first to demonstrate that R. salina is a suitable microalga for productive mass culture of P. nana for use as live food in aquaculture.

AB  - Simple Summary Feed costs are high in feedlot systems. To reduce these costs, cheaper alternatives are studied. The use of licury cake (LC) is an economical alternative because it can compete (economically and nutritionally) with common ingredients used in animal feed. However, the ruminant has different feed degradability and digestibility mechanisms, promoted by symbiosis with microorganisms in the rumen that can affect the physicochemical characteristics of the final product. We studied dietary LC inclusion, at levels of 0, 67, 133 and 200 g/kg of dry matter (DM), to evaluate its impact on qualitative aspects of milk and cheese. The inclusion of LC up to 133 g/kg DM is recommended for the diet of lactating goats whose milk will be used in the production of Minas Frescal cheese. The study was carried out to evaluate the effects of licury cake (LC) inclusion in diets for lactating goats on milk chemical composition and fatty acid profile, and physicochemical composition and sensory attributes of Minas Frescal cheese. Twelve lactating goats were used (eight Saanen and four Anglo Nubian goats, with 35 +/- 5 days in lactation and average body weight of 37.93 +/- 9.22 kg), distributed in a triplicate 4 x 4 Latin Square design. The increasing levels of LC studied were: 0, 67, 133 and 200 g/kg of dry matter (DM). The analyses were adjusted using orthogonal polynomial contrasts, in which the probability level of 5% was considered. For sensory attributes, principal component analysis was performed. The LC inclusion promoted the reduction in moisture (p = 0.013) and mineral matter (p < 0.001) content in cheese. The ether extract content in cheese showed a quadratic effect (p = 0.021). Lauric acid showed a linear (p = 0.002) increasing effect, and myristic (p < 0.001) and rumenic (p = 0.018) acids showed quadratic effects. The sensory attributes analysis in cheese indicated that the inclusion of 133 and 200 g/kg of LC improve its texture. Flavor was improved with the inclusion of 67 and 133 g/kg. The inclusion of up to 133 g/kg of LC in the diet of lactating goats is recommended because it promotes improvements in flavor and texture of Minas Frescal cheese.

AB  - The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is characterized by its low temperature and thin oxygen climate, which results in hypoxic conditions during the composting of livestock and poultry manure in this region. Reducing moisture content can enhance oxygen flow through the composting pile, thereby improving humification efficiency. However, the impact of moisture content on antibiotic removal and changes in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during animal manure composting on the Tibetan Plateau remains unclear. Building upon prior research, this study further investigated the dynamic changes of antibiotic concentration and ARGs during sheep manure composting on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau at two moisture contents: 45% (M45) and 60% (M60). Additionally, the study analyzes the influencing factors and host microorganisms associated with ARGs. The results showed that, compared with M60, M45 could significantly decrease the concentrations of oxytetracycline, cephalosporin C, and penicillin in compost products by 4.37%, 3.94%, and 4.37%, respectively (P < 0.05). M45 can influence the dynamic changes of ARGs by altering the temperature, pH, total nitrogen, organic matter, humus content, and microbial communities of compost. Compared with M60, M45 reduced the abundance of ARGs conferring resistance to beta-lactam, multidrug, bacitracin, tetracycline, and vancomycin. Corynebacterium, Jeotgalicoccus, Nocardiopsis, Brachybacterium, and Arthrobacter were the main potential hosts of ARGs during the early stages of composting, whereas Streptomyces, Pseudoxanthomonas, Luteimonas, and Thermobifida became the main potential hosts during the late stages. These findings suggest that reducing moisture content can significantly enhance the removal efficiency of antibiotics and ARGs in sheep manure compost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - Retinal guanylate cyclases (RetGCs) are regulated by a family of guanylate cyclase-activating proteins (called GCAP1-7). GCAPs form dimers that bind to Ca2+ and confer Ca(2+ )sensitive activation of RetGC during visual phototransduction. The GCAPS homologue from zebrafish contains two nonconserved cysteine residues (Cys15 and Cys17) that bind to ferrous ion, which stabilizes GCAPS dimerization and diminishes its ability to activate RetGC. Here, we present NMR and EPRDEER structural analysis of a GCAPS dimer in the Mg2+-bound, Ca2+-free, Fe2+-free activator state. The NMR-derived structure of GCAPS is similar to the crystal structure of Ca2+-bound GCAP1 (root-mean-square deviation of 2.4 angstrom), except that the N-terminal helix of GCAPS is extended by two residues, which allows the sulthydryl groups of Cys15 and Cys17 to become more solvent exposed in GCAPS to facilitate Fe2+ binding. Nitroxide spin- label probes were covalently attached to particular cysteine residues engineered in GCAPS: C15, C17, T26C, C28, N56C, C69, C105, N139C, E152C, and S159C. The intermolecular distance of each spin-label probe in dimeric GCAPS (measured by EPR- DEER) defined restraints for calculating the dimer structure by molecular docking. The GCAPS dimer possesses intermolecular hydrophobic contacts involving the side chain atoms of H18, Y21, M25, F72, V76, and W93, as well as an intermolecular salt bridge between R22 and D71. The structural model of the GCAPS dimer was validated by mutations (H18E/Y21E, H18A/Y21A, R22D, R22A, M2SE, D71R, F72E, and V76E) at the dimer interface that disrupt dimerization of GCAPS and affect the activation of RetGC. We propose that GCAPS dimerization may play a role in the Fe2+-dependent regulation of cyclase activity in zebrafish photoreceptors.

AB  - We report the reproductive strategy of the speckled guitarfish, Pseudobatos glaucostigmus, a poorly studied elasmobranch caught in the south-eastern Gulf of California. Of 2068 specimens collected from the artisanal and industrial shrimp trawl fisheries, 1073 were females and 995 males. The sex ratio of adults and embryos did not deviate significantly from 1:1 overall or during summer, but significant differences in the other months suggest a temporal sexual segregation. Monthly records of maturity stages, gonado-somatic index, and development of oocytes suggested an annual cycle (May to July) with a gestation period of 6 months (May to October). Parturition began mainly in June, with vitellogenesis and embryonic development being concurrent. Median size-at-maturity for males (50.72 cm TL) was smaller than females (52.58 cm TL), which reached a size-at-maternity of 59.41 cm TL. Fecundity was 1-9 embryos (mean 4 embryos) and increased with maternal body size and weight. From ovulation to parturition, gestation was around 6 months with a possible presence of embryonic diapause. The information presented in this study will establish the baseline for population dynamic and demographic models to determine the stock productivity and establish strategies for the conservation and management of this species in the Gulf of California.

AB  - Camellia nitidissima Chi, is a rare and endangered plant that is narrowly distributed in South China and North Vietnam. In this study, seven polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to investigate the genetic diversity, recent population bottlenecks as well as population structure of twelve remnant populations of the plant. Our results indicated that, despite their severely fragmented natural range, C. nitidissima remnants maintained a moderate level of genetic variability, and only a bottlenecked population was detected by the clear evidences. No significant correlation was found between genetic diversity and population size. Significantly high genetic differences among populations were found, and the twelve populations could be classified into two distinct genetic groups. AMOVA indicated that 16.14% (16.73%, after one suspected artificial population was excluded) of the molecular variation was attributable to regional divergences (between Nanning and Fangcheng), and the majority of genetic variation existed within populations which were 69.24% (70.63%, after one suspected artificial population was excluded). For conservation management plans, the genetic resources of the two distinct groups are of equal importance for conservation, separate management unit for each of them should be considered. Given that all remnant populations are small and isolated, and many plants are illegally dug out for commercial purposes, management efforts in terms of habitat protection and legal protection, as well as transplantations and reintroductions, would be necessary for this species.

AB  - Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) is commonly used to assess the dietary ecology of modern and fossil taxa. In carnivorans, teeth with different functions record dietary behavior differently. Here, we assess DMTA variability along the tooth row of an extant carnivorous marsupial-the Tasmanian devil, Sarcophilus harrisii-which has multiple carnassial-like molars that may function and record diet similarly. We compared the complexity (Asfc), anisotropy (epLsar), and textural fill volume (Tfv) of the lower second, third, and fourth molars of Tasmanian devils to test the hypothesis that teeth with similar forms yield similar functions. Although third molars do have significantly higher epLsar values than fourth molars, all other DMTA attributes are indistinguishable from one another. These data suggest that teeth with comparable morphologies in the same taxon have similar functions and largely record diet similarly. In addition, we compared fossil and modern specimens of S. harrisii from Tasmania to assess dietary behavior over time. These analyses indicate that foods with similar textures have been consumed since the late Quaternary.

AB  - The remediation performance of biochar varies based on the biomass used for its production. Further innovation involves developing tailor-made biochar by combining different raw materials to compensate for the limitations of pure biochar. Therefore, tailor-made combined biochar produced from the co-pyrolysis of pig manure and invasive Japanese knotweed (P1J1), as well as biochars produced from these feedstocks separately, i.e., pure pig manure (PM) and pure Japanese knotweed (JK), were applied to Pb and As contaminated soil to evaluate the biochar-induced changes on soil properties, microbial activity, DOM, and metal and metalloids solubility at the soil pore water scale. Biochar application reduced soluble Pb, whereas enhanced the As mobility; the increased soil pH after biochar addition played a fundamental role in reducing the Pb solubility, as revealed by their significant negative correlation (r = -0.990, p < 0.01). In contrast, the release of dissolved P strongly influenced As mobilization (r = 0.949, p < 0.01), especially in P-rich PM and P1J1 treatments, while JK showed a marginal effect in mobilizing As. Soils treated with PM, P1J1, and JK mainly increased Gram-negative bacteria by 56 %, 52 %, and 50 %, respectively, compared to the control. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis identified three components in pore water DOM, C1 (long wavelength humic-like), C2 (short wavelength humic-like), and C3 (protein-like), which were dominant respectively in the P1J1, JK, and PM-added soil. A principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed that the PM and P1J1 had similar performance and were more associated with releasing P and Mg and specific DOM components (C1 and C3). Meanwhile, P1J1 supplemented soil OM/OC and K, similar to JK. The results of this study suggest that combined biochar P1J1 can comprehensively enhance soil quality, embodying the advantages of pure PM and JK biochar while overcoming their shortcomings.

AB  - Microplastics, as an environmental pollutant, are receiving increasing attention due to their ubiquitous presence in ecosystems and their ability to transfer and accumulate through food chains. Although it is well known that microplastics can enter plants through nutrient and water uptake by plant roots, the effects of microplastics on the growth, development and predation efficiency of herbivorous insects and predatory natural enemies after transfer from plants are still lacking. In order to investigate the impacts of polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) on the growth, reproduction of herbivorous insects and the predation efficiency of their predatory natural enemies, the quarantine pest globally - Leptinotarsa decemlineata and its predatory natural enemy - the Arma chinensis were selected as the research objects. Constructed a transfer system of polyethylene microplastics (PE-MPs) soil - potato plants - L. decemlineata and PE-MPs feed - Tenebrio molitor - A. chinensis. The key attention is paid to the reproduction, growth, and development of the L. decemlineata, as well as changes in the predation behavior and ability of A. chinensis against the L. decemlineata. We found that PE-MPs treatment reduced the egg production of adult L. decemlineata, prolonged their developmental time, and decreased their survival rate. Additionally, it extended the resting time, searching time, paralyzing time, and the latent period of A. chinensis, while decreasing the predation amount of A. chinensis on L. decemlineata larvae. Although the effects of PE-MPs on the growth and reproduction of L. decemlineata and the predatory efficiency of armpit A. chinensis were limited, our study still revealed the adverse effects of PE-MPs on phytophagous pests and predatory natural enemies. Finally, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain uncertain, necessitating further research to assess whether microplastics have potential long-term impacts on interactions between herbivorous insects and their predatory enemies. Collectively, these studies provide new insights into the effects of microplastics on herbivorous insects and predatory natural enemies.

AB  - Brokerage typologies represent an aspect of sociality by describing the social structure, at a group and individual level, concerning the direction and flow of behaviours or information within, and between subgroups. While animal studies have identified keystone individuals, capable of imparting positive and negative effects on conspecifics, none have characterised social networks based upon brokerage roles. This study applied a brokerage model to a dynamic breeding sow herd (average size = 78) to investigate the direction aggression flows within and between subgroups (based upon connectedness). In total, 42 h of video observations were obtained over two production cycles. Each production cycle covered 21 days, and behavioural observations occurred on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 20, 21. The social network metrics of degree centrality (number of interactions) and brokerage position (the extent to which individuals lie on the directed path between two previously unconnected individuals) were analysed to describe the directional flow of agonistic behaviours within the networks and investigate the relationship between sociality and brokerage typology. Brokerage typologies are described as coordinators, gatekeepers, representatives, consultants, and liaisons. Aggressive behaviours included biting, thrusting, chasing, and displacement. The results revealed all pigs have brokering capability regardless of social connectivity, with a relationship between the level at which a sow is interacting and the brokerage typology they typically engage. Coordinating and consulting behaviour was typically engaged in by the highest connected sows. Significant differences in initiated behaviour (outdegree centrality) and received behaviour (indegree centrality) were found between the specific brokering roles in both production cycles, with coordinators found to be the most aggressive individuals in both networks. Results also reveal a consistency in group-level structure over two production cycles with further consistency in individual behaviour by coordinators and consultants. This preliminary study of brokerage types in a dynamic sow herd demonstrates the capacity to extend the traditional social network metrics currently applied in animal science research. It further provides an individual-level criterion to describe how behaviour is enabled to flow through a network.

AB  - Imperial expansion can have substantial impacts on the daily and long-term activities of colonized regions. However, statecraft can vary depending on local resilience and the decisions made by agropastoralists and other economic collectives. We explore how Wari expansion affected, and was affected by, pastoralists' activities by examining the isotopic variation of camelid bone, teeth, and hair (or fibres) at three mid-valley (yunga) (500-2300 masl) sites in the Majes and Sihuas valleys of southern Peru. We report stable delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopic compositions (n = 34) of keratin from previously published serial samples of camelid (Lama sp./Vicugna sp.) fibre from the site of Beringa in the Majes Valley, delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of bone collagen (n = 6) and delta C-13 values from tooth enamel bioapatite (n = 65) from Uraca in the Majes Valley, and delta C-13 and delta N-15 values of bone collagen (n = 30) from Quilcapampa in the Sihuas Valley. We compare diets between sites and between development phases of individual animals. Extensive networks of inter-valley trails connected neighboring yunga communities and camelid caravans enabled the exchange of goods and ideas. Stable isotope analysis of camelids from these three sites suggests that yunga communities in the Majes and Sihuas valleys were engaged in both highland and coastal camelid-caravan networks prior to Wari expansion that permitted local communities to maintain foddering flexibility. Herders maintained these networks into the Wari era, while also taking advantage of new trading opportunities as they became available.

AB  - Significantly higher population densities of a squash pest beetle, Acalymma vittatum, were observed in a squash monoculture than a triculture of squash, maize, and beans. One hypothesis for such differences is that non-host plants in the triculture cause the herbivore to move more frequently resulting in higher emigration rates from the tricultures. Plant to plant movement of the beetle was studied in vegetative winter squash to evaluate if differences in components of trivial movement would generate a higher emigration rate from the triculture. Tenure times were shorter on plants in the triculture than on plants in the squash monoculture, there was no movement directionality, movement distances were greater in squash monocultures than in tricultures and were greater during July than August. In the tricultures, plant-to-plant transitions were primarily to maize from non-host plants and to beans or squash from host plants during July, but during August, movement from any plant was primarily to maize. We integrated the values of the movement components from vegetative winter squash into a simple Markov model, and found that during July, emigration was estimated to be faster from the triculture than the monoculture, supporting the hypothesis. However, in August, emigration was estimated to be slower from the triculture. In August, maize plants were tall and, by acting like a fence, greatly reduced the movement distance of beetles. The effect of the differences in emigration rate on beetle population density was greatest for small patches, indicating that emigration may be important only in small-scale production systems.

AB  - Goats are natural hosts of Mycobacterium (M.) bovis, and affected herds can be the cause of significant economic losses. Similarites in disease course and lesions of M. bovis infections in goats and M. tuberculosis in humans make goats good models for human tuberculosis. The aim of this investigation was to characterize M. bovis challenge models in goats. For this, goats were endobronchially inoculated with three doses of M. bovis or culture medium. Clinical signs, shedding, and immune responses were monitored until 146 days post inoculation (dpi). At necropsy, lesions were examined by computed tomography, histology, and bacteriological culture. Infected goats did not develop clinical signs. M. bovis was cultured from feces, but never from nasal swabs. IGRAs were positive from 28 dpi onwards, antibodies at 140 dpi, and SICCT at 146 dpi. The increase in CD25(+), IFN-gamma(+), and IFN-gamma-releasing T-cell subpopulations was time-related, but not dose-dependent. All infected goats developed paucibacillary granulomas in the lungs and regional lymph nodes. M. bovis was regularly cultured. Dose-dependent effects included the size of pulmonary lesions, caverns, intestinal lesions, and early generalization in the high-dose group. In summary, reproducible challenge models with dose-dependent differences in lesions were established, which may serve for testing vaccines for veterinary or medical use.

AB  - Interdisciplinary efforts are fundamental for achieving successful conservation translocations. However, behavioral information is usually lacking to guide conservation translocations for social animals. This is particularly significant for the conservation of endangered Asian elephants. Therefore, by tracing the long-term behavioral logbook records in the southern central part of Myanmar, our study highlighted that younger semi-captive elephants (male <= 21 years old; female <= 42 years old) were identified as suitable candidates for translocations since they were more easily accepted by the wild population, with fewer fighting events and higher mingling probability. Furthermore, we recorded 136 present data combining field surveys and collection from literature, and we identified 4349.69 km2 of suitable habitat in this region located around 10 km away from the villages, closer to managed forests and water. This study integrated ecological and behavioral information to support reinforcement conservation for Asian elephants in Southeast Asia, where most of the semi-captive elephants are distributed. These insights could guide more effective reinforcement projects by considering age and sex for improved success in integration. Additionally, our study emphasizes the importance of habitats near human-dominated areas, which are preferred by elephants, offering practical implications for habitat management and human-elephant conflict mitigation efforts. Further research efforts from the behavioral perspectives, such as using camera trappings or video recordings, are encouraged to facilitate social animal conservation.

AB  - Greater engagement in a range of daily activities is associated with better cognitive functioning (Lee et al., Lee et al., 2020). The hippocampus, a subcortical brain structure implicated in learning, memory, spatial navigation and other aspects of cognitive functioning, may be structurally sensitive to exposure to and engagement with novel experiences and environments. The present study tested whether greater activity diversity, defined as the range of common daily activities engaged in and the proportion of time spent in each, is associated with larger hippocampal volume. Greater diversity of activities, as measured using daily diaries across an 8-day period, was related to greater hippocampal volume averaged across the left and right hemispheres, even when adjusting for estimated intracranial volume, total activity time, sociodemographic factors, and self-reported physical health. These findings are broadly consistent with nonhuman animal studies, demonstrating a link between enriched environments and structural changes to the hippocampus. Future longitudinal and experimental work can elucidate causal and directional relationships between diversity of daily activities and hippocampal volume.

AB  - Simple Summary How to effectively alleviate oxidative stress in pregnant sows and weaning piglets is one of the key issues in the pig industry. Maternal feeding is a key determinant of the composition and activity of the intestinal microbiota in both the mother and the offspring, while the effect of the maternal intake of microbial-derived antioxidants (MA) thereof remains to be elucidated. In the current study, we used Sprague Dawley rats as a model to investigate the impact of maternal MA additive on the microbiota of breastmilk, the maternal ileum, and the intestinal microbiota of the offspring on the day of birth and ten days afterwards, via analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. We found that the impact of MA was more obvious on the microbiota of mature milk than on that of colostrum. In addition, MA additive did not significantly affect maternal ileal microbiota, but affected offsprings' colonic microbiota significantly ten days after birth. Collectively, the current study underlines colonic microbiota as a key target affected by maternal MA additive in the offspring with the potential to relieve oxidative stress by enriching beneficial bacteria, as well as aiding in the development of maternal feed for improved health outcomes in both mothers and their offspring. This study can provide a theoretical basis for the development of antioxidant feed and the improvement of animal welfare in the pig industry and elsewhere.Abstract In this study, sixteen Sprague Dawley (SD) female rats and eight SD male rats were co-housed to mate. Pregnant SD female rats were fed with a control diet or an MA diet. Breast milk, maternal ileum, and intestinal samples of the offspring were collected at the day of birth and ten days afterwards. The results showed that the impact of MA was more obvious on the microbiota of mature milk (p = 0.066) than on that of colostrum. In addition, MA additive did not significantly affect maternal ileal microbiota, but affected offsprings' colonic microbiota significantly ten days after birth (p = 0.035). From the day of giving birth to ten days afterwards, in addition to the increase in microbial richness and diversity, at genus level, the dominant bacteria of breastmilk changed from Pseudomonas veronii to Bacillus and Lactococcus. Different from breastmilk microbiota, ten days after giving birth, the maternal ileal microbiota and the offsprings' intestinal microbiota were dominated by Lactobacillus. Instead of ileal microbiota, offsprings' colonic microbiota is a key action site of maternal MA additive. Therefore, the current findings have significant implications for the development of maternal feed aimed at modulating the intestinal microbiota of offspring, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes for both mothers and their offspring.

AB  - In the natural environment, plants grow and interact with both conspecific and heterospecific neighbours under different environmental conditions. In this study, we tested whether Chenopodium quinoa Willd genotypes differ in growth performance when grown with kin and non-kin under nutrient limitation in pot partitioning treatments. Biomass accumulation, allocation, organ efficiency, and specific leaf area were measured at the end of the experiment. Response variables were differentially impacted by kinship, fertility, and barrier. Total dry mass, shoot dry mass, and root and stem allocation were greater for plants grown with kin in connected pots than with non-kin in connected pots across the nutrient treatments. Kin connected and disconnected plants had a greater specific root length, specific stem length, and average leaf mass than non-kin connected and disconnected plants. Non-kin connected and disconnected plants had greater LAR and SLA than kin connected and disconnected plants under low- and high-nutrient treatments. Plants always grew better in the presence of their kin than non-kin. These results conclude that quinoa plant production benefits from planting closely related individuals under both high- and low-nutrient conditions.

AB  - Seahorses are characterized by unique characteristics such as a male pregnancy reproductive strategy and grasping preferences, which make these species vulnerable to various environmental risks. Zinc (Zn) is one of the most frequently occurring toxic elements in coastal waters; however, little is known about the effect of Zn exposure on seahorses. In the present study, line seahorses (Hippocampus erectus) were exposed to waterborne Zn (0.2 and 1.0 mg/L) and the impact on growth and gonadal development was investigated. Zn exposure induced growth improvement, but also led to gonadal dysfunction in the lined seahorse. Female seahorses exhibited high testosterone levels, immature follicles, and weight increase after Zn exposure, which is the typical characteristics of a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like phenotype. Transcriptomic data suggested that the Zn-induced growth promotion resulted from the dysregulated expression of fat accumulation genes. Further investigation of gene expression profiles in the brain, ovaries, and testes indicated that Zn affected the expression of genes involved in growth, immunity, tissue remodeling, and gonadal development by regulating serum steroid hormone levels and androgen receptor expression. This study not only clarifies the complex impact of Zn on seahorses using physiological, histological, and molecular evidence but can also provide new insights into the mechanism underlying PCOS in reproductive-aged women. Moreover, this work demonstrates the risk of the common practice of Zn supplementation in the aquaculture industry as the consequent growth yield may not represent a healthy condition.

AB  - The molluscan feeding structure is the radula, a chitinous membrane with teeth, which are highly adapted to the food and the substrate to which the food is attached. In Polyplacophora and Patellogastropoda, the handling of hard ingesta can be facilitated by high content of chemical compounds containing Fe or Si in the tooth cusps. Other taxa, however, possess teeth that are less mineralized, even though animals have to avoid structural failure or high wear during feeding as well. Here, we investigated the gastropod Gastropteron rubrum, feeding on hard Foraminifera, diatoms and Porifera. Tooth morphologies and wear were documented by scanning electron microscopy and their mechanical properties were tested by nanoindentation. We determined that gradients of hard- and stiffness run along each tooth, decreasing from cusp to basis. We also found that inner lateral teeth were harder and stiffer than the outer ones. These findings allowed us to propose hypotheses about the radula-ingesta interaction. In search for the origins of the gradients, teeth were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy, to determine the degree of tanning, and analyzed with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, to test the elemental composition. We found that the mechanical gradients did not have their origins in the elemental content, as the teeth did not contain high proportions of metals or other minerals. This indicates that their origin might be the degree of tanning. However, in the tooth surfaces that interact with the ingesta high Si and Ca contents were determined, which is likely an adaptation to reduce wear.

AB  - Simple Summary Dairy goats, as an important economic livestock for the milk supply in dairy products, have been raised worldwide. However, with the intensive management of dairy goat breeding, the disease problems are becoming increasingly serious, among which Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis has been spreading in dairy goat breeding in China. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptome and proteomics of dairy goats infected with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis at 72 h and 144 h. Through a comparative correlation analysis of the data, we hope to find the pathogenic mechanism and provide a theoretical basis for the disease problems in dairy goat breeding. Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis (C. pseudotuberculosis) is a zoonotic chronic infectious disease. It mainly occurs in dairy goats reared in herds, and once it invades the dairy goats, it is difficult to completely remove it, causing great harm to the development of the sheep industry. This study mainly was based on TMT-based quantitative proteomics and RNA-seq methods to measure the spleen samples of infected dairy goats at different time periods. Nine four-month-old dairy goats were divided into three groups, with three goats in each group. The dairy goats in the first group (NC group) were inoculated with 1.0 mL of sterilized normal saline subcutaneously, and the second (72 h group) and third groups (144 h group) were inoculated with 1.0 mL of 1 x 10(7) cfu/mL bacterial solution subcutaneously in the neck. Significant changes in the protein and mRNA expression were observed in different infection and control groups. In the 72 h group, 85 genes with differential genes and proteins were up-regulated and 91 genes were down-regulated in this study. In the 144 h group, 38 genes with differential genes and proteins were up-regulated and 51 genes were down-regulated. It was found that 21 differentially expressed genes and proteins were co-up-regulated in the two groups. There were 20 differentially expressed genes and proteins which were co-down-regulated in both groups. The 72 h group were mainly enriched in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosome, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism and the estrogen signaling pathway. In the 144 h group, they were protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway which was enriched by mRNA-proteins pairs co-upregulated by the five pairs. The combined transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were performed to provide insights into the effects of C. pseudotuberculosis through several regulatory features and pathways. We found that in the early stage of infection (72 h), the co-upregulated gene-protein pairs were enriched in multiple pathways, which jointly defended against a bacterial invasion. However, in the later stages of infection (144 h), when the disease stabilizes, a few co-upregulated gene-protein pairs played a role in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum pathway. In addition, the mRNA and protein expressions of dairy goats infected with the bacteria at different periods of time indicated the adaptability of dairy goats to the bacteria. At the same time, it guides us to carry out a corresponding treatment and feeding management for dairy goats according to different periods of time.

AB  - Fear associated with perceived predation risk can elicit behavioral and physiological changes in animals, including insects. Diamondback moth (DBM), Plutella xylostella, larvae are known to wriggle violently backwards and even fall off plants when attacked by predators and parasitoids. In the laboratory, the DBM larvae exposed to the specialist parasitoid Diadegma insulare were found to move to lower quality, older foliage, which negatively affected their development. In Hawaii, by far the dominant parasitoid species of DBM is the generalist Cotesia vestalis, with many sampling efforts often only yielding this species. Thus, in this study, we investigated the influence of C. vestalis on the behavior of DBM larvae. We focused on the distribution of DBM on cabbage plants, from the youngest to oldest leaves (leaf position 1-12, respectively), in the presence of C. vestalis in the lab and field. We found that in the lab, DBM larvae showed a clear preference for younger leaves (leaf positions 3-5). However, when C. vestalis was present, regardless of whether the parasitoids could touch the DBM, larvae were less likely to be on those preferred leaf positions. This change in larval distribution was also replicated when potted cabbage plants containing DBM larvae were placed in cabbage fields. Changes in herbivore feeding sites, whether mediated by natural enemies or other environmental factors, could have significant implications, not only for herbivore fitness, but also for economic damage to crops based on the value of plant parts affected.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Community-Based Sheep Breeding Program (CBSBP) on gross profit and lamb mortality by comparing participated farms and non-participated farms by focusing on the case of Akkaraman breed in Nigde province of Turkey. The primary data were collected from 108 sheep farms, 54 farms participated and 54 farms those did not participate in the sheep breeding program. According to average treatment effect results derived by utilizing propensity score matching method, if all farms would participate to CBSBP, each farm acquired 6209.13 Turkish Lira (1094.92 USD) more gross profit and would be 3.47% less lamb mortality rate in the farms. The study indicated that CBSBP provided significant economic benefit and welfare of animal. Hence, further supporting and scaling up of community-based small ruminant breeding programs appears to be one of the best solutions for improving livestock genetic resources of rural communities in developing countries. Accordingly, incentive mechanisms for participating in breeding programs should be more focused on small-scale family farms and especially the young people in the rural area.

AB  - The hippocampus has a central role in regulating contextual processes in memory. We have shown that pharmacological inactivation of ventral hippocampus (VH) attenuates the context-dependence of signaled active avoidance (SAA) in rats. Here, we explore whether the VH mediates intertrial responses (ITRs), which are putative unreinforced avoidance responses that occur between trials. First, we examined whether VH inactivation would affect ITRs. Male rats underwent SAA training and subsequently received intra-VH infusions of saline or muscimol before retrieval tests in the training context. Rats that received muscimol performed significantly fewer ITRs, but equivalent avoidance responses, compared to controls. Next, we asked whether chemogenetic VH activation would increase ITR vigor. In male and female rats expressing excitatory (hM3Dq) DREADDs, systemic CNO administration produced a robust ITR increase that was not due to nonspecific locomotor effects. Then, we examined whether chemogenetic VH activation potentiated ITRs in an alternate (non-training) test context and found it did. Finally, to determine if context-US associations mediate ITRs, we exposed rats to the training context for three days after SAA training to extinguish the context. Rats submitted to context extinction did not show a reliable decrease in ITRs during a retrieval test, suggesting that context-US associations are not responsible for ITRs. Collectively, these results reveal an important role for the VH in context-dependent ITRs during SAA. Further work is required to explore the neural circuits and associative basis for these responses, which may be underlie pathological avoidance that occurs in humans after threat has passed.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to evaluate the impact of peanut straw mulching on the N change and the functional genes in Camellia oleifera intercropping systems. Methods A field experiment with different types of straw mulch treatments (conventional tillage, whole, and crushed) and timing was (50 d and 150 d) established between 2018-2022; the soil N fractions, N transformation rates, the abundance and dominant species compositions of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), nirK, and nirS-harboring genes were investigated. Results The whole peanut straw mulching of 150 d significantly improved (P < 0.05) the content of soil microbial biomass N (MBN), ammonia N (NH4+), and nitrate N (NO3-). The soil nitrification and ammonification rates increased by 96.8% and 132% in the 150 d of peanut crushed and whole straw mulching, respectively. Notably, the peanut straw mulching of 50 d mainly affects the diversity and relative abundance of AOA while the soil nirK and nirS-harboring genes were affected by 150 d crushed and whole peanut straw mulching, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed that crushed and whole peanut straw mulching affects nitrate reductase as the primary factor in regulating the soil N cycle via functional genes and soil variables. Conclusions Long-term whole peanut straw or whole and crushed mixed straw mulching could hence be recommended to dryland farming communities to increase the soil N cycle and crop productivity in the C.oleifera-peanut intercropping system.

AB  - Theory predicts that selection against maladaptive hybridization leads to divergence of sexual characters in co-occurring closely related species. Consequently, signal disparity should be greater between sympatric vs. allopatric lineage pairs. However, this pattern may also result from species sorting or the greater evolutionary age of sympatric pairs. We used species pairs comparisons to examine the existence of acoustic divergence in a Neotropical montane radiation, the Rhinocryptidae, whose members tend to occupy different elevational ranges. Most rhinocryptids exhibit conservative morphology and are only differentiated by song attributes. Our results show that sympatric species pairs that overlap in elevation exhibited overall greater song divergence compared to allopatric species pairs after controlling for morphological differences, age and phylogenetic effects. Song divergence decreased when excluding sympatric pairs that do not overlap in elevation, suggesting that selection for improved species identification between co-occurring (syntopic) species accentuates signal differentiation. Comparative evolutionary models of signal differentiation over time revealed a similar pattern, which suggests that sexual selection in syntopy might have driven reproductive character displacement in this radiation. We conclude that selection against the production of unfit hybrids could favor acoustic traits that reliably signal species identity in tropical environments where many taxa are poorly differentiated by visual attributes.

AB  - Simple Summary More than 90% of the animals in current pig farms have been conceived by artificial insemination (AI). However, it is expected that the number of pigs derived from in vitro fertilization (IVF) will increase in the coming decades since the trade of cryopreserved pig embryos can be a reality soon, as it already is in cattle. Today, nothing is known about the repercussions that IVF could have on animal health, welfare, or food safety because no colonies of study exist yet. We created a small one 4 years ago and the present work shows some data collected from 16 pigs derived from IVF and 14 pigs derived from AI, conceived from the same boar, and housed and fed under the same conditions since they were born. The results point out that the IVF animals showed a lower incidence of lameness and higher weight and occupied more predominant positions in the hierarchy of the herd than the AI animals. Although genetic differences from the maternal line could explain some of these results, it is also possible that the way in which the animals were conceived (AI or IVF) induced better adaptative abilities in the IVF group, explaining the lower incidence of lameness. Nonetheless, more studies with a higher number of animals are necessary to reach consistent conclusions about the phenotype of IVF-derived adult pigs. The in vitro production (IVP) and subsequent transfer of embryos (ET) to recipient mothers is not yet an established reproductive technology in the pig industry, as it is in cattle. However, that the trade of IVP-cryopreserved pig embryos is expected to start in the next decades. Society and governments are increasingly aware of the repercussions that IVP could have for animal health, welfare, behavior, or food safety, but proven scientific information for this type of animal does not exist, since no colonies of pigs have been created to this end. We created a small one and studied the differences between 16 IVP-derived pigs and 14 pigs derived from artificial insemination (AI), at 3.5 years of age, conceived from the same boar, and housed and fed under the same conditions since they were born. Incidence of lameness, position in the herd hierarchy, weight, adenosine deaminase activity, and hematological and biochemical analytes were compared between the two groups of animals. The results showed that the IVP animals weighed more, occupied higher positions in the herd hierarchy, and had a lower incidence of lameness. Although genetic differences from the maternal line could explain some of these results, it is also possible that the IVP animals developed better adaptative abilities, but more studies with a higher number of animals are necessary to reach consistent conclusions.

AB  - Biting to obtain attached benthic prey characterizes a large number of fish species on coral reefs, and is a feeding mode that contributes to important ecosystem functions. We use high-speed video to reveal the mechanisms used by a surgeonfish, Acanthurus leucosternon, to detach algae. After gripping algae in its jaws, the species pulls it by ventrally rotating both the head and the closed jaws, in a novel use of the intra-mandibular joint. These motions remain in the plane of the fish, reducing the use of a lateral head flick to detach the algae. The novel ability to bite and pull algae off the substrate without bending the body laterally minimizes exposure to high water flows, and may be an adaptation to feeding in challenging reef habitats such as the crest and flat. Therefore, our results could potentially represent a key milestone in the evolutionary history of coral reef trophodynamics.

AB  - In this research, environmental impacts associated with the intensive production of pigs on a farm in Mexico were determined through the application of life cycle assessment methodology. The research was focused on the following stages of the product system: (i) pig rearing and growth phases; (ii) production operations in the pig-house; (iii) the supply of feed. The life cycle inventory database was mainly made up of data collected in field visits to local farms. The functional unit was defined as one finished swine weighing 124 kg. The results for the selected impact categories of carbon, water, and energy footprints were 538.62 kg CO(2)eq, 21.34 m(3), and 1773.79 MJ, respectively. The greatest impact was generated in the final stages of pig fattening, mainly due to the large quantity of feed supplied. The impacts caused by operation of the pig farm were less significant, their contribution in all cases was less than a third of the total quantified values. The energy conversion of pig slurry improves the environmental performance of the product system by reducing the carbon footprint.</p>

AB  - Knowledge regarding the occurrence of short-chain and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs and MCCPs) in foodstuffs and their dietary exposure risks for rural Tibetan residents remains largely unknown. Herein, we collected main foodstuffs (including highland barley, vegetables, Tibetan butter, mutton, and yak beef) across the rural Tibetan Plateau and characterized the CP profiles and concentrations. The highest SCCPs concentrations were detected in Tibetan butter (geometric mean (GM): 240.6 ng/g wet weight (ww)), followed by vegetables (59.4 ng/g ww), mutton (51.4 ng/g ww), highland barley (46.3 ng/g ww), and yak beef (31.7 ng/g ww). For MCCPs, the highest concentrations were also detected in Tibetan butter (319.5 ng/g ww), followed by mutton (181.9 ng/g ww), vegetables (127.0 ng/g ww), yak beef (71.2 ng/g ww), and highland barley (30.3 ng/g ww). The predominant congener profiles of SCCPs were C 13 Cl 7-8 in mutton and yak beef, C 10 Cl 7-8 in Tibetan butter, and C 10-11 Cl 6-7 in highland barley and vegetables. The predominant congener profiles of MCCPs were C 14 Cl 7-9 in all sample types. Combined with our previous results of free-range chicken eggs, the median estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of SCCPs and MCCPs via diet for Tibetan rural adults and children was estimated to be 728.8 and 1853.9 ng/kg bw/day and 2565.6 and 5952.8 ng/kg bw/day, respectively. In the worst scenario, MCCPs might induce potential health risks for rural Tibetan population. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic dietary exposure research of SCCPs and MCCPs in the remote rural areas.

AB  - Purpose Balantidium coli, is a protozoa that can infect humans. Balantidium coli infection is mostly asymptomatic, but can cause of diarrhea, abdominal pain and sometimes perforated colon. There are only few previous reports regarding the infant balantidiasis and there is a little information about its clinical signs and treatment. In Islamic countries pig farming and consumption is prohibited and reservoir host is unknown.Methods 1.5 years old boy showed sever anorexia and diarrhea. The affected infant was depressed. The evaluation of fecal examination revealed a large number of B. coli trophozoites and cysts leaded us to an uncommon presentation of B. coli in the infant.Results A few reports of human balantidiasis from Iran seems quite extraordinary. Wild boars have been proposed the responsible for transmission of human infection in Iran.Conclusion However, this report as the first report of infant balantidiasis in Iran supports the role of other sources and domestic or wild animals as reservoir hosts for B. coli in Iran.

AB  - This study documents the depositional pattern of modern pollen and fungal spores in relation to the different vegetation types and wildlife activities in Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary, located in north-east India. The pollen data accurately matches the extant vegetation types and provides additional evidence on the representation and relative abundance of the major pollen taxa in the pollen assemblages. The forest habitat is characterised by the abundance of Bombax, Lagerstroemia, Barringtonia, and Albizia pollen in the pollen assemblage. The swamp habitat is characterised by Cyperaceae, Onagraceae, Nymphaea, and Potamogeton, while the grassland habitat is characterised by the dominance of non-cereal (Poaceae), Asteroideae, Cyperaceae, and Bombax pollen. Also, coprophilous fungal spores were observed and identified. Their presence varies in relation to the different vegetation types and level of wildlife activity in each habitat in the wildlife sanctuary. Rhododendron pollen in the palynoassemblages is indicative of seasonal flooding during periods of high rainfall in and around the study areas. Principal component analysis applied to the quantitative data obtained from the pollen frequency analyses revealed a significant variation that distinguished the three different vegetation types in the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary. This modern pollen and fungal spore data serves as a reliable baseline for the reconstruction of the palaeoecology and palaeoherbivory in the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary and to correlate the types of vegetation present in other parts of the tropical region of Indo-Burma.

AB  - With increasing deforestation, questions are being raised about the risk of zoonotic disease to humans. To better assess the role of forest in the emergence of tick-borne diseases, we conducted a meta-analysis of the scientific literature to compare the abundance or diversity of ticks between forest and open habitats (natural or anthropogenic) and a meta-regression to test how tick abundance is influenced by the abundance of their vertebrate hosts in forest habitats.We found that Ixodes ticks were on average more abundant and diverse in forests than in any other nonforested habitats, the difference being more pronounced with mixed deciduous- coniferous than with deciduous forests. At the forest scale, exophilic Ixodes tick abundance was positively influenced by the abundance of their ungulate hosts.Our results suggest that mixed forests represent the habitats with the highest level of tick hazard. However, more studies are needed to assess the risk of transmission of tick-borne diseases in forests, which also depends on the prevalence of pathogens and the exposure of people.

AB  - The composting and thermodynamic processes of crude oil (CO) degradation using the compost of goat manure origin (CGMO) and compost of palm oil mill effluent origin (CPOMEO) were studied. Microbial activity was investigated using the carbon dioxide (COQ) evolution test. The physiochemical properties of the composts and that of the treated CO-contaminated soil (COCS) were also investigated. In particular, CGMO significantly improve CO degradation with the highest COQ evolution rate of 45 mg/g compared to the CPOMEO and the control. The CO degradation rates of 85.7 %, 71.4 %, and 14 % corresponded to the first-order CO degradation rate constants of 0.743 day-1, 0.689 day-1, and 0.136 day-1 for CGMO, CPOMEO, and control, respectively. The Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectral pattern for both composts revealed adsorption bands that were identifiable with polysaccharides, potassium, and nitrogen, whereas the scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive spectrophotometry (SEMEDX) of CPOMEO indicated carbon and oxygen as the sole compositions. The negative Delta G and Delta H values indicated the spontaneity and exothermic nature of the CO composting process, respectively.

AB  - Pig slurry contains valuable nutrients and organic matter, although its high water content makes its management and use as a fertilizer more expensive. It is also an interesting bioenergy resource for biogas production. We propose a treatment that consists of solid-liquid separation followed by the anaerobic digestion of liquid fraction of slurry (LFS) while a microfiltration membrane module concentrates the solids in the digester and removes a liquid fraction of the digestate (LFD). The aims of the work were to evaluate the fertilizer value of the LFS, digestate and concentrated digestate and the possibility of reusing the LFD in agriculture. The LFS contained 72% less dry matter than the slurry. The solid-liquid separation mainly removed N and P. Thanks to microfiltration, the remaining solids were partially recirculated to the digester, concentrating there. To do this, the membrane module continuously removed the LFD, which was made up of 99% water with dissolved elements, mainly C, N, K and Na. The concentrated digestate contained less K, similar amounts of N and P, and more dry matter and C than the initial LFS. The entire slurry treatment affected the mineralization dynamics by increasing recalcitrant C and decreasing labile C without modifying N release. The proposed process allowed taking advantage of the nutrients and stabilized organic matter contained in the LFS, producing a concentrated digestate. LFD did not meet the reclaimed water requirements. However, it could be useful as a fertirrigation solution and a post treatment could be enough to comply with the regulations.

AB  - Spearfishing is a popular activity practiced for recreation and subsistence along the tropical and subtropical coast of Brazil. Although being an economically important activity, the influence of species traits driving target preferences among recreational spearfishers have been poorly explored. Spearfishing is highly selective towards large trophy species, therefore its effects on top predators, which are generally threatened, have been widely reported as detrimental. Here we test if species traits are useful to predict spearfishers' target preferences and the relationship between spearfishers' experience with catch's size and composition in a subtropical Brazilian rocky reef. Large macrocarnivores species and species that form schools associated with the pelagic habitat are predicted to form the core of target preferences by spearfishers. More experienced spearfishers captured larger fish than less experienced ones. Herbivores and macro-carnivorous fishes were the most important trophic groups contributing to catch composition biomass, being parrotfishes (Scarinae) the most selected. Spearfishers with more years of practice acknowledged that stocks of many targeted species have been depleted. Spearfishers claim that spearfishing is sustainable because their catches are selectively captured, but such selectivity is highly dependent on fisher experience, frequency and body size of available targets. Most importantly, spearfishing is highly selective for large and vulnerable individuals, especially big old fat fecund females, which are the individuals that need to be protected most. There is an urgent need to control species identity and size of captures to avoid stocks colapse and local functional extinctions.

AB  - Plant monocultures growing for extended periods face severe losses of productivity. This phenomenon, known as 'yield decline', is often caused by the accumulation of above- and below-ground plant antagonists. The effectiveness of plant defences against antagonists might help explain differences in yield decline among species. Using a trait-based approach, we studied the role of 20 physical and chemical defence traits of leaves and fine roots on yield decline of 4- and 18-year-old monocultures of 27 grassland species. We hypothesized that yield decline is lower for species with high defences, that root defences are better predictors of yield decline than leaf defences, and that in roots, physical defences better predict yield decline than chemical defences, while the reverse is true for leaves. We additionally hypothesized that the relationship between defences and yield decline increases with time and that species increasing the expression of defence traits after long-term monoculture growth would suffer less yield decline. We summarized leaf and fine root defence traits using principal component analyses and analysed the relationship between the most informative components along with their temporal changes and monoculture yield decline. The significant predictors of yield decline were traits related to the so-called collaboration gradient of the root economics space (specific root length and root diameter) as well as their temporal changes and traits related to the leaf physical vs chemical defence tradeoff (leaf dry matter, silicon and cellulose content, toughness and phytochemical diversity). We were unable to unequivocally identify the mechanisms relating the effect of those traits to yield decline as they could mediate plant responses to several stressors such as antagonist accumulation, nutrient depletion or drought. Further studies are needed to differentiate between these alternative mechanisms and to gain a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of yield decline in relation to root and leaf defence traits.

AB  - Floral attractiveness is a strong determinant of pollination success, although the same attributes that attract pollinators can also attract florivores. Consumption of the corolla and/or reproductive structures can reduce pollinator visitation frequencies and depress fruit and/or seed set. We hypothesized that florivory would negatively affect the visitation frequencies of floral visitors and natural fruit set in Daustinia montana, a herba-ceous species endemic to Brazil. We collected inflorescences of D. montana and recorded the numbers of floral structures with signs of florivory, as well as the locations of that damage, to quantify natural florivory. Artificial damage experiments were carried out with the corollas and stamens to experimentally determine the influence of florivory on the frequency of floral visits. We also randomly marked intact flowers and those naturally damaged by florivory and measured fruit set. More intact floral buds were observed under natural conditions than buds damaged by florivory. We observed that all of the analyzed structures (stamens/pistil and corolla) are generally attacked simultaneously, as opposed to only one specific structure. Intact flowers (controls) demonstrated greater rates of pollinator visitation than experimentally damaged flowers. The visitation frequencies of nectar thieves were not different between intact flowers and artificially damaged flowers. Fruit set under natural conditions was greater for intact flowers than for those that had experienced natural florivory. Our data indicated that floral damage had negative effects on floral attractiveness to pollinators. The greater natural production of fruits from intact flowers is indicative of the degree to which florivory can impact plant reproduction.

AB  - Pig slurry can be used as an alternative source for nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N), for plants. However, after applying the pig slurry to the soil, gaseous loss of N this nutrient may occur, mainly in the form of ammonia. Hence this study aimed to evaluate the loss of N by volatilization after the application of pig slurry with an acidified pH. Ammonia volatilization was evaluated using pig slurry, with its pH modified to 5.0 using four acids (sulfuric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, and acetic acid). Additionally, pig slurry with natural pH and a control were also used. The work was conducted in a greenhouse, and collectors were used to capture the volatilized ammonia in a static free semi-open chamber. The application of pig slurry with natural pH (7.19) resulted in 61% loss of ammonia, whereas acidification with ascorbic acid (pH 5.0) caused a loss of only 26%. The application of pig slurry with pH above 7.0 caused N loss, indicating that using acids to maintain a pH of 5.0-6.0 could be an alternative to reduce N loss by ammonia volatilization.

AB  - The effects of intense heat during the reproductive phase of two Brassica species-B. napus and C. sativa-could be alleviated by a prior gradual increase exposure and/or PGPR inoculation. Abct. Among extreme weather events caused by climate change, heat waves are one of the most threatening issues for food security. Heat stress is known to be particularly penalizing at the reproductive stage for oleaginous crops, such as oilseed rape and camelina, and is responsible for crop failures as a consequence of yield losses and lower quality of harvest plants parts. In this context, our study aims to analyze two acclimation strategies that rely on the induction of signals prior to an intense heat stress event, i.e., thermopriming (herein, a gradual increase in temperature) and bacteria inoculations (herein, two Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) were tested). In the two experiments, we assessed the expected beneficial effects of these two acclimation strategies on yield components, seed quality criteria (nutritional and related to dormancy). While thermopriming improved heat stress tolerance in B. napus cv Aviso by maintaining yield, seed nutritional quality and seed dormancy, the effects of the gradual increase prior to the heat stress were even more negative than the later intense heat stress event in C. sativa cv Calena which resulted in cumulated negative effects. The experimentation based on PGPR inoculation highlighted similar trends to thermopriming in B. napus cv Aviso but to a lesser extent. However, in C. sativa cv Calena, very weak effects of PGPR inoculation upon heat stress were observed. Finally, these two acclimation strategies were shown to help alleviate the impacts of intense heat stress but in a species-dependent manner. This study should be deepened by exploring the behaviors of more cultivars of oilseed rape and camelina in the perspective to generalize these results at the species scale.

AB  - The first records of elephant seals, likely southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, are reported for the Colombian Pacific coast. A juvenile elephant seal was registered on the beaches of Pianguita and Maguipi (Valle del Cauca), from January 23-25, 2018. On 22 February 2018, a male juvenile, presumably the same animal, was also reported further north on the beaches of Guachalito (Choco). Then, a group of three individuals was sighted on the beach of El Medio, the mouth of the Yurumangui River (Valle del Cauca) from 29 December, 2019 to 20 January 2020; this sighting was confirmed on January 3, 2020, by recording a subadult male individual apparently in healthy body condition. Also, a dead subadult in advanced state of decomposition was found in the river Guapi in January 8, 2021. These sightings are among the most northern extralimital records for this species with a large displacement covering 5000-8000 Km from its normal distributional range that includes southern Chile and Antarctica. The presence of the southern elephant seal in the Colombian Pacific had not been documented, and the arrival of this species could be linked to the search for food and the influence of eco-physiological processes, as well as the impact of the ENSO and ongoing environmental changes in the Southern Ocean.

AB  - Yersinia pestis, causative agent of plague, occurs throughout the western United States in rodent populations and periodically causes epizootics in susceptible species, including black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). How Y. pestis persists long-term in the environment between these epizootics is poorly understood but multiple mechanisms have been proposed, including, among others, a separate enzootic transmission cycle that maintains Y. pestis without involvement of epizootic hosts and persistence of Y. pestis within epizootic host populations without causing high mortality within those populations. We live-trapped and collected fleas from black-tailed prairie dogs and other mammal species from sites with and without black-tailed prairie dogs in 2004 and 2005 and tested all fleas for presence of Y. pestis. Y. pestis was not detected in 2126 fleas collected in 2004 but was detected in 294 fleas collected from multiple sites in 2005, before and during a widespread epizootic that drastically reduced black-tailed prairie dog populations in the affected colonies. Temporal and spatial patterns of Y. pestis occurrence in fleas and genotyping of Y. pestis present in some infected fleas suggest Y. pestis was introduced multiple times from sources outside the study area and once introduced, was dispersed between several sites. We conclude Y. pestis likely was not present in these black-tailed prairie dog colonies prior to epizootic activity in these colonies. Although we did not identify likely enzootic hosts, we found evidence that deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) may serve as bridging hosts for Y. pestis between unknown enzootic hosts and black-tailed prairie dogs.

AB  - Interleukin (IL)-2 has been reported to regulate neutrophil functions in humans, mice, pigs and chicken although it is a key regulator of T cells. Consistently, we found that grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) interleukin-2 (gcIl-2) is capable of modulating the antimicrobial activities of neutrophils via regulating granzyme B- and perforin-like gene expression in our previous study. In the present study, stimulation of gcIl-2 on neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation in grass carp neutrophils was demonstrated by detecting free DNA release, histone H3 citrullination and morphological changes of the cells. Further investigation revealed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from NADPH oxidase but not mitochondria was involved in NETosis induced by gcIl-2. Aside from ROS, autophagy was disclosed to be indispensable for NETosis induced by gcIl-2. These converging lines of evidence suggested that fish Il-2 could induce NETs formation via NADPH oxidase-derived ROS- and autophagy-dependent pathways in fish species which is evolutionarily conserved with that in mammals. It is noteworthy that these two pathways did not interplay with each other in Il-2-stimulated NETosis. The mechanisms governing autophagy induced by Il-2 were also explored in the present study, showing that Il-2 modulated the action of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein to stimulate autophagy, leading to NETs formation in fish neutrophils. These results provided a new insight to the function of Il-2 in fish neutrophils, and a clue about the regulation of NETosis in the lower vertebrates.

AB  - Simple Summary Caciotta is a very popular cheese in Italy that can be made with cow, sheep, goat or buffalo milk. In this study, we investigated the effects of donkeys' milk addition in the production of this cheese, considering a short- and a medium-ripening period. Two batches were considered for cheesemaking: cows' milk only and cows' milk with the addition of 5% donkey's milk. With the longest ripening period, the cheese with donkey milk received the highest ratings for color, aroma, flavor, and overall liking. This study investigated the effects of adding donkey milk in cheesemaking on the acceptability of a Caciotta cow cheese after 10 and 45 days of ripening. The cheeses produced were: a control cheese with cow's milk only and experimental cheese with the addition of 5% donkey's milk. The acceptability of Caciotta was determined by the judgement of 80 habitual cheese consumers. The acceptability of the Caciotta cheese was significantly influenced by the addition of donkey milk, with the exception of the texture parameter. At a ripening time of 10 days, the control cheese scored significantly higher than the experimental cheese for aroma, flavor and overall liking; conversely, at the longest time, the experimental cheese had significantly higher scores for color, aroma, flavor, and overall liking. Our results confirm that the use of donkey milk in cheesemaking can improve cheese acceptability. In addition, the known benefits of using donkey milk in cheesemaking, such as the reduction of blowing defects and the probiotic properties, could increase interest in innovative products among both processors and consumers. Processors could reduce, if not eliminate, the use of additives in cheesemaking, while cheese could also appeal to consumers of probiotic and fermented products.

AB  - Simple Summary Mycobacteria can cause medically and socio-economically significant diseases, including several non-tuberculous infections and tuberculosis, and are considered a One Health challenge for their impact on public and animal health. These microorganisms are maintained and shared between the environment, domestic and wild animals, and humans. The aim of this research was to characterize the interactions that take place between several wild mammals and cattle through camera-trapping in order to provide insights into the dynamics of mycobacteria transmission opportunities in the environment of cattle farms located in Atlantic habitats from northern Iberian Peninsula. Camera traps were set during a one-year period in three cattle farms and visits of six wild species were modelled. We demonstrated that cross-species mycobacteria transmission, if occurring, would be mainly maintained through indirect interactions and most likely occur in pastures. In contrast to previous studies, wildlife visits were abundant but brief, and food and water resources did not attract wild animals. We suggest that badger latrines might act as aggregation points and sources of exposure to mycobacteria for badgers, wild boars, foxes, and cattle. This knowledge can contribute to designing and implementing effective measures aimed at controlling the spread of mycobacterioses in the environment-wild-domestic-human interface. Interactions taking place between sympatric wildlife and livestock may contribute to interspecies transmission of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex or non-tuberculous mycobacteria, leading to the spread of relevant mycobacterioses or to interferences with the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The aim of this study was to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of interactions between wildlife and cattle in a low bovine tuberculosis prevalence Atlantic region. Camera traps were set during a one-year period in cattle farms with a history of tuberculosis and/or non-tuberculous mycobacterioses. The frequency and duration of wildlife visits, and the number of individuals per visit, were analysed through generalized linear mixed models. The seasons, type of place, type of point, and period of the day were the explanatory variables. A total of 1293 visits were recorded during 2741 days of camera observation. Only 23 visits showed direct contacts with cattle, suggesting that mycobacteria transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface would occur mainly through indirect interactions. Cattle pastures represented the most appropriate habitat for interspecies transmission of mycobacteria, and badgers' latrines appear to be a potential hotspot for mycobacteria circulation between badgers, wild boars, foxes, and cattle. According to both previous epidemiological information and the interaction patterns observed, wild boars, badgers, foxes, and small rodents are the species or group most often in contact with livestock, and thus may be the most involved in the epidemiology of mycobacterioses in the wildlife-livestock interface in this area.

AB  - We overview an array of common garden genetics trials established across multiple sites and embedded in restoration plantings in the harsh, modified Midlands region of the island of Tasmania, Australia. The steps in establishing the common gardens, the diversity of experimental designs employed and their objectives are described. These trials provide a long-term framework to test species choices and provenancing strategies, as well as enhance our understanding of adaptive genetic variation within key eucalypt species used for ecological restoration. Early results signal genetic-based differences in early-age performance, and we showcase the multiple benefits of integrating research infrastructure into restoration plantings.

AB  - Sepiolite shows great potential to reduce pollution risk of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated rice of acidic paddy soils, but its effect was the synergy of water-organic fertilizer coupling in practical application. In this study, we studied the effect of goat manure (GM) in primordial and sepiolite (SP) amended soil under aerobic, intermittent, and flooded irrigation condition. The results showed that the application of goat manure in SP-amended soil increased soil pH by 15.6%-23.6%. The application of goat manure increased the content of DOM by 244.3%, 135.2% in unamended and sepiolite amended soil, respectively. As a consequence, the application of GM increased available Cd extracted by DTPA in SP-amended soil under aerobic and flooded condition, but decreased available Cd under intermittent irrigation condition. The application of sepiolite alone in Cd polluted soil decreased the accumulation of Cd in unpolished rice at the first year, but Cd content witnessed slight increase at the second year. Under intermittent condition, the application of goat manure in SP-amended soil decreased Cd content by 229.2%, 59.3% of unpolished rice in the first and second year, respectively. As a result, the application of goat manure and intermittent irrigation pattern could present a water-organic fertilizer coupling effect in SP-amended soil and further increased the long-term passivation effect of sepiolite.

AB  - We explored farmers' perceptions of the causes and consequences of human-carnivore conflict in Maze National Park, Ethiopia. We selected 225 household heads randomly from five villages for interview using survey questionnaires. We identified the five villages randomly from the 16 that border the park. The majority (75.1%) of the respondents had a negative perception towards the park and the carnivores due to livestock depredation. Overall, 1142 livestock depredation were reported over 3 years (2017-2019). Cattle, sheep and goats were reportedly the most depredated animals. The numbers of livestock depredated significantly varied among villages and predators. Farmers perceived lions as the major livestock depredator followed by leopards and spotted hyaenas and they perceived that proximity, poor livestock husbandry and low natural prey density were the main causes of livestock depredation. The distance of the household holdings to the park was correlated negatively with the depredation level. Farmers use guarding, cut-and-carry systems and dogs to reduce carnivores' predation. Allocating enough spatial differences between the park and the villages and altering the timing and frequency with which livestock grazing overlaps with the diurnal activities of carnivores may lead to a win-win outcome promoting coexistence.

AB  - Seasonal variations in semen parameters play a critical role in the reproductive efficiency and fertility of domestic animals. Factors such as temperature, photoperiod, and humidity directly impact sperm concentration, viability, motility, morphology, seminal plasma composition, and other semen parameters. Understanding these seasonal variations in semen parameters is crucial for optimising reproductive management practices in domestic animal populations. This comprehensive review provides valuable insights for improving breeding programs, artificial insemination techniques, and overall reproductive management in domestic animals.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence suggests that social interactions and especially bonding between couples influence tumorigenesis, yet whether this is due to lifestyle changes, homogamy (likelihood of individuals to marry people of similar health), or directly associated with host-induced effects in tumors remains debatable. In the present study, we explored if tumorigenesis is associated with the bonding experience in monogamous rodents at which disruption of pair bonds is linked to anxiety and stress. Comparison of lung cancer cell spheroids that formed in the presence of sera from bonded and bond-disrupted deer mice showed that in monogamous Peromyscus polionotus and Peromyscus californicus, but not in polygamous Peromyscus maniculatus, the disruption of pair bonds altered the size and morphology of spheroids in a manner that is consistent with the acquisition of increased oncogenic potential. In vivo, consecutive transplantation of human lung cancer cells between P. californicus, differing in bonding experiences (n = 9 for bonded and n = 7 for bond-disrupted), and nude mice showed that bonding suppressed tumorigenicity in nude mice (p<0.05), suggesting that the protective effects of pair bonds persisted even after bonding ceased. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering indicated that the transcriptomes of lung cancer cells clustered according to the serum donors' bonding history while differential gene expression analysis pointed to changes in cell adhesion and migration. The results highlight the pro-oncogenic effects of pair-bond disruption, point to the acquisition of expression signatures in cancer cells that are relevant to the bonding experiences of serum donors, and question the ability of conventional mouse models to capture the whole spectrum of the impact of the host in tumorigenesis.

AB  - Step-selection analysis (SSA) is ubiquitous for assessing local-scale habitat selection by comparing relocations from telemetry data (used steps) to potential relocations given the movement of the animal (available steps). The case-control design of SSA is intended to estimate selection at the spatiotemporal scale of these steps. However, long-term behaviour associated with recurring use of certain locations or resources may additionally impact movement decisions, potentially impacting the estimates produced by SSA. To determine the impact of recursive behaviour on local selection, we simulated movement trajectories in which animals exhibited patterns of recursion. Based on these simulated trajectories, we evaluated the impact of long-term behaviour on estimates of step-selection. Then, we developed a new approach to identify recursion points based on a time-dependent kernel density estimate including latitude, longitude and time of day. Based on this information, we accounted for recursive behaviour by including the relationship between available steps to recursion points or using recursion points to adjust our sample of available steps. Finally, we apply this approach to estimate the response of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) to sources of risk. Recursive movement resulted in biased estimates of selection when using previously established step-selection methods. However, we found that our correction models were able to produce accurate estimates across differing recursion scenarios. When applied to an empirical deer data set, these methods revealed a pattern of selection and avoidance for human modified areas that was masked by previous approaches. Our results suggest that long-term recursive behaviour may have unappreciated effects on estimates from SSA. Specifically, since the used and available steps in SSA are associated with specific places and times, covariates must account for variation in spatial and temporal patterns of long-term behaviour. Unless properly accounted for, the effects of long-term recursive behaviour will inhibit the ability of SSA to characterize fine-scale behaviours such as predator response or foraging ecology.

AB  - Carnivorous plants reverse the order we expect in nature: here, animals do not feed on plants, but plants hunt and feed on animal prey, primarily insects, thereby enabling these plants to survive in nutrient-poor environments. In addition to this strategy, some carnivorous plants also form unique symbiotic relationships with animals other than insects to access nutrients. Other important interactions of carnivorous plants with insects, such as pollinators and herbivores, have received far less attention or have been largely neglected. This review describes and summarizes various ecologically relevant biotic interactions between carnivorous plants and other organisms reported in recent studies. In particular, our understanding on how carnivorous plants, for example, handle the pollinator-prey-conflict or interact with and respond to herbivores is still incomplete. Strategies and mechanisms on how carnivorous plants address these challenges are presented. Finally, future directions in carnivorous plant research are proposed.

AB  - Animals combine colour change and behavioural choices to enhance concealment and adapt to changes in habitat in time and space. However, non-native and invasive habitat-forming plants and seaweeds can change the landscape, challenging animals to remain camouflaged, especially when the colour of the new habitat differs from the native backgrounds.The chameleon prawn (Hippolyte varians) exhibits remarkable colour variation and effective camouflage against different native seaweeds in shallow tidepools. Individuals optimize crypsis by choosing colour-matching seaweeds and changing colour over time. In some locations, the prawn's native habitats are now replaced by non-native seaweeds of different coloration and structure, making it important to understand whether substrate choice and colour change facilitates the occupation of these seaweeds and enables prawns to camouflage against new backgrounds.Using image analysis and visual modelling of a fish predator, we assessed the colour variation and camouflage of chameleon prawns occupying the non-native seaweeds brown wireweed (Sargassum muticum) and pink harpoon weed (Asparagopsis armata) in southwest UK. We performed laboratory trials to examine whether prawns maintain their preference for colour-matching native substrates when given a choice between them and non-native seaweeds, and if they can change their coloration to improve camouflage against non-native substrates.Prawns exhibit phenotypic diversity and camouflage that varied with the non-native seaweed species, with low colour variation and effective camouflage on pink harpoon weed, but high colour diversity and reduced concealment against brown wireweed. Prawns choose non-native seaweeds when the alternative native substrate provides mismatching coloration, but they did not exhibit any preference between colour-matching native and non-native seaweeds. Once in non-native habitats, prawns change their appearance over a few days to match the background, sometimes faster than when changing on native seaweeds of contrasting coloration.Although human activities considerably modify the coloration of marine landscapes by increasing the establishment of non-native seaweeds, the impacts of those changes appear less severe for colour-changing species, such as chameleon prawns, and will depend on the similarity between the colour of the new substrates and the original native backgrounds, and how animals use behaviour and physiology to match new habitats.

Os camar & otilde;es escolheram as algas n & atilde;o-nativas apenas quando o substrato nativo alternativo proporcionava uma colora & ccedil;& atilde;o em desajuste, mas n & atilde;o demonstraram prefer & ecirc;ncia entre algas nativas que combinavam com sua cor e algas n & atilde;o-nativas. Uma vez nos habitats n & atilde;o-nativos, os camar & otilde;es mudaram sua apar & ecirc;ncia ao longo de alguns dias para a cor do novo ambiente, & agrave;s vezes mais rapidamente do que ao mudar para garantir o ajuste a algas nativas de colora & ccedil;& atilde;o contrastante.Embora as atividades humanas modifiquem consideravelmente a colora & ccedil;& atilde;o das paisagens marinhas ao proporcionar o estabelecimento de algas n & atilde;o-nativas, os impactos dessas mudan & ccedil;as parecem ser menos severos para esp & eacute;cies capazes de mudar de cor, como os camar & otilde;es-camale & atilde;o, e depender & atilde;o da semelhan & ccedil;a entre a cor dos novos substratos e aquela dos habitats nativos, e de como os animais usam o comportamento e a fisiologia para garantir o ajuste aos novos habitats.

AB  - The gonadal primordial germ cells (PGCs) possess a unique state of pluripotency and X chromosome activity. However, extensive evidence indicates developmental variability in PGCs across different species. This study aims to evaluate the pluripotency status, specific gene expression patterns, and X chromosome reactivation (XCR) of pig gonadal PGCs. Single-cell RNA-seq revealed significant heterogeneity within the population of gonadal PGCs. Notably, these PGCs expressed high levels of pluripotency markers OCT4, PRDM14, and NANOG, while lacking SOX2 expression. Through the screening of marker genes and subsequent protein expression validation, we identified growth differentiation factor 3 (GDF3) as a specific surface marker for pig gonadal PGCs, facilitating their efficient purification for further study. Furthermore, analysis of gonadal PGCs demonstrated complete XCR. This was evidenced by the absence of repressive histone modifications (H3K27me3, H3K9me3, and H2AK119ub), the lack of X inactive specific transcript (XIST) RNA FISH signal, and the doubled expression of Xlinked genes. Additionally, these PGCs expressed high levels of genes associated with epigenetic modification, chromatin remodeling, and XIST-associated RNA-binding. These factors likely play a crucial role in regulating pluripotency and X chromosome activity. In summary, this study reveals the heterogeneity in pig gonadal PGCs and identifies GDF3 as a specific surface marker. It also elucidates the expression patterns of pluripotency transcription factors and the events involved in XCR.

AB  - Simple Summary The ovine placenta facilitates transport of oxygen and nutrients to the growing fetus. Placental morphology and placental function are affected by environmental factors, and the changes are not well understood. This study aimed to identify the effect of tissue type (caruncle vs. cotyledon), placentome morphological subtype, and maternal parenteral arginine supplementation in mid-late pregnancy on the placental nutrient transport capacity at 140 days of gestation, using a gene expression approach. Results highlighted that placentome morphology and tissue type are associated with differential expression of specific amino acid (AA) transporter genes, suggesting a potential adaptive response to increase the transport capacity of the placenta. Maternal arginine supplementation influenced expression of genes involved in AA transport, placental efficiency, and angiogenesis, which may affect the placental transport capacity. The results contribute to an increased understanding of placental function and provide new insights into the effects influencing the placental nutrient transport capacity to support fetal growth in sheep.Abstract Placental nutrient transport capacity influences fetal growth and development; however, it is affected by environmental factors, which are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to understand the impact of the ovine placentome morphological subtype, tissue type, and maternal parenteral supplementation of arginine mono-hydrochloride (Arg) on nutrient transport capacity using a gene expression approach. Placentomal tissues of types A, B, and C morphologic placentome subtypes were derived from 20 twin-bearing ewes, which were infused thrice daily with Arg (n = 9) or saline (Ctrl, n = 11) from 100 to 140 days of gestation. Samples were collected at day 140 of gestation. Expression of 31 genes involved in placental nutrient transport and function was investigated. Differential expression of specific amino acid transporter genes was found in the subtypes, suggesting a potential adaptive response to increase the transport capacity. Placentomal tissues differed in gene expression, highlighting differential transport capacity. Supplementation with Arg was associated with differential expressions of genes involved in amino acid transport and angiogenesis, suggesting a greater nutrient transport capacity. Collectively, these results indicate that the morphological subtype, tissue type, and maternal Arg supplementation can influence placental gene expression, which may be an adaptive response to alter the transport capacity to support fetal growth in sheep.

AB  - Camellia oleifera is a vital economic crop of southern China. Accurate mapping and monitoring of Camellia oleifera plantations are essential for promoting sustainable operations within the Camellia oleifera industry. However, traditional remote sensing interpretation methods are no longer feasible for the large-scale extraction of plantation areas. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based method that utilizes GF-2 remote sensing imagery to achieve precise mapping and efficient monitoring of Camellia oleifera plantations. First, we conducted a comparative analysis of the performance of various semantic segmentation models using a self-compiled dataset of Camellia oleifera plantations. Subsequently, we proceeded to validate the prediction results obtained from the most effective deep-learning network model for Camellia oleifera plantations in Hengyang City. Finally, we incorporated DEM data to analyze the spatial distribution patterns. The findings indicate that the U-Net++ network model outperforms other semantic segmentation methods when applied to our self-generated dataset of Camellia oleifera plantations. It achieves a recall rate of 0.89, a precision rate of 0.92, and an mIOU of 0.83, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying and monitoring Camellia oleifera plantations. By combining the predicted results with the data from DEM, we discovered that these plantations are typically situated at elevations ranging from 50 to 200 m, with slopes below 25(degrees), and facing south or southeast. Moreover, a significant positive spatial correlation and clustering phenomenon are observed among the townships in Hengyang City. The method proposed in this study facilitates rapid and precise identification and monitoring of Camellia oleifera plantations, offering significant theoretical support and a scientific foundation for the management and ecological conservation of Camellia oleifera plantations.

AB  - Simple Summary The in-depth understanding of rumen functions would be the greatest achievement of animal nutritionists. Hence, plenty of feed additives and various nutritional techniques are studied in modifying and understand the rumen habitat. In our study, we investigated the effect of alteration of the forage: concentrate (F:C) ratio in goats supplemented with the microalgae Schizochytrium spp. on rumen microbiota communities and enzymatic activity. Our results suggested that even though specific microbes' abundance was altered, their corresponding enzymatic potential did not follow the same trend. Nonetheless, principal ruminal functions such as ammonia accumulation, fibrolytic activity, and degradation rate of specific fatty acids were also modified due to dietary intervention. The inclusion of feed additives and the implementation of various nutritional strategies are studied to modify the rumen microbiome and consequently its function. Nevertheless, rumen enzymatic activity and its intermediate products are not always matched with the microbiome structure. To further elucidate such differences a two-phase trial using twenty-two dairy goats was carried out. During the first phase, both groups (20HF n = 11; high forage and 20HG n = 11; high grain) were supplemented with 20 g Schizochytrium spp./goat/day. The 20HF group consumed a diet with a forage:concentrate (F:C) ratio of 60:40 and the 20HG-diet consisted of a F:C = 40:60. In the second phase, the supplementation level of Schizochytrium spp. was increased to 40 g/day/goat while the F:C ratio between the two groups were remained identical (40HF n = 11; high forage and 40HG n = 11; high grain). By utilizing a next-generation sequencing technology, we monitored that the high microalgae inclusion level and foremost in combination with a high grains diet increased the unmapped bacteria within the rumen. Bacteroidetes and Prevotella brevis were increased in the 40HG -fed goats as observed by using a qPCR platform. Additionally, methanogens and Methanomassiliicoccales were increased in high microalgae-fed goats, while Methanobrevibacter and Methanobacteriales were decreased. Fibrolytic bacteria were decreased in high microalgae-fed goats, while cellulolytic activity was increased. Ammonia was decreased in high grains-fed goats, while docosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids showed a lower degradation rate in the rumen of high forage-fed goats. The alteration of the F:C ratio in goats supplemented with Schizochytrium spp. levels modified both ruminal microbiota and enzymatic activity. However, there was no significant consistency in the relations between them.

AB  - The sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius), is a pest of primary importance of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in Mexico because it negatively affects yield and fiber quality. vThis study was conducted with the objective of determining the densities of the sweetpotato whitefly in cotton, and its relationship to the distance to cantaloupe fields, use of insecticides, yield, and quality of cotton lint; as well as determining the abundance of predatory insects and their relationship to the densities of the sweetpotato whitefly. Populations of whitefly adults and nymphs were recorded weekly by visual inspection of the underside of the fifth main-stem leaf from cotton plant terminal in six cotton fields located 300 to 23,200 m away from cantaloupe fields, from 29 May to 27 August 2019. Predatory insect densities were sampled weekly with a sweep net. The number of insecticide applications, seed cotton yield, and lint quality were obtained in each cotton field. A negative relationship between whitefly densities in cotton and distance to cantaloupe fields was observed. Cotton fields close to cantaloupe fields (300 to 1400 m) had high whitefly populations (average of 27.1 adults/leaf); while distant cotton fields (13,600 to 23,200 m) had low whitefly populations (average of 3.2 adults/leaf). Seed cotton yield, as well as lint length, fineness, and strength were not significantly affected by observed whitefly densities. The white color of the cotton lint (reflectance value, Rd) was significantly reduced by increasing the density of whitefly adults and nymphs during the time of open boll formation. Thirteen species of predatory insects were found, with Chrysoperla sp., Orius sp., Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville, and Chrysopa sp. being the most abundant. The cotton fields with 10 to 12 insecticide applications had lower densities of total predatory insects (10.3 to 10.8 predators per 100 sweeps), compared to those with 2 to 7 insecticide applications (22.3 to 75.5 predators per 100 sweeps). A positive (r = 0.54 to 0.89) and significant correlation was found between whitefly densities and those of Orius sp., Chrysoperla sp., Chrysopa sp., and total predators, indicating a good density-dependence relationship between these predators and their prey. Th results indicated need for proper management of the whitefly in cotton, considering the distance to melon-producing areas, the negative effect of abundant pests on fiber color, which has caused punishment or discounts on price, and conservation of beneficial entomofauna by using selective insecticides.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the effects of seminal insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) supplementation on structural and functional properties of buffalo sperm post cryopreservation. Semen ejaculates from buffalo bulls (n = 6) were proportioned into four aliquots and diluted with egg yolk-based extender. Prior to equilibration, IGF-1 was added to extender as four treatments: group IGF0 (no supplementation), IGF150 (150 ng/mL), IGF250 (250 ng/mL) and IGF350 (350 ng/mL). The extended semen was transferred into 0.25 mL mini-straws, equilibrated (4 degrees C at 4 h), and cryopreserved. Total sperm motility was greater (P < 0.05) when there was the IGF150 treatment compared with values for other groups. Furthermore, with the IGF150 treatment there was the least and greatest (P < 0.05) mitochondrial superoxide status and membrane potential, respectively. Similarly, with the IGF150 treatment there was a greater (P < 0.05) sperm membrane integrity with a lesser (P < 0.05) calcium status compared to values for the other groups. In conclusion, seminal IGF-1 supplementation affects the structural and functional properties of buffalo sperm following cryopreservation.

AB  - The weaning period is a critical phase for nursery pigs that is characterized by rapid growth and alterations in the intestinal microbiome associated with nutrient utilization. The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of halquinol, when used as an antibiotic (ABO), on the growth performance, diarrhea incidence, coefficient of apparent total tract digestibility (CATTD), fecal volatile fatty acids (VFAs), and microbiota in pigs. A total of 210 healthy weaned pigs with an average initial weight of 6.9 kg and aged 28 +/- 2 days were assigned to five treatments (six pens/treatment) in a complete randomized design, including a control group (T1, CON; feed with no ABO), a colistin group (T2, CLT; feed containing 120 ppm colistin), and three halquinol groups (T3 to T5, HAL; feed containing 180, 240, and 360 ppm halquinol, respectively). The experiment period lasted for 10 days. Field recordings, observation, and feces collection were performed on D1, D5, and D10. CATTD and VFA assessments were conducted on D10. The composition of the fecal microbiota was analyzed via 16S rRNA gene sequencing using the Illumina Miseq platform. The results demonstrated that the in-feed ABO groups exhibited a significantly lower ADFI (p < 0.01). Pigs fed the T3 and T4 diets had the lowest FCR (p < 0.01) on D5 and D10 and, thus, had reduced ADFI (p < 0.01). A quadratic contrast was found in ADFI and FCR on D5 and D10, indicating a negative correlation with HAL concentration (p < 0.01). Pigs fed CLT and HAL had significantly reduced levels of coliform (p < 0.01) and E. coli (p < 0.01). Moreover, pigs receiving ABO also had a lower fecal score compared to those on the CON diet (p < 0.01). Dietary in-feed ABO had no effect on all the parameters of the CATTD on D10 (p > 0.05), except for fat digestibility in pigs that received T4 (p < 0.01). Pigs fed the T4 and T5 diets had higher propionate concentrations and lower A/P ratios than pigs fed T1, T2, and T3 (p < 0.01). The microbial diversity shifted quickly through the early weaning period. The relative abundance of beneficial Enterococcus microbes increased in pigs fed in-feed ABO, whereas the relative prevalence of pathogenic bacteria, such as Escherichia and Klebsiella, decreased. Escherichia and Bacteroides were negatively correlated with carbohydrate digestibility and butyric and valeric acid production (p < 0.05). Overall, the appropriate HAL dosage was 240 ppm (T4), and this antimicrobial can potentially be characterized as an in-feed colistin replacer that improves feed efficiency and fat digestion, enhancing VFA production, alleviating post-weaning diarrhea, and protecting ABO-resistant piglets.

AB  - The neo-Darwinian theory of evolution and adaptation by natural selection has got us used to considering organisms' features as solutions to problems set by the environment. However, no living system faces an outside reality independent of itself: organisms and groups of organisms, by their constitution and activity, specify the content, events and properties of the world in which they live. In this perspective & mdash;the theory of enaction & mdash;, the organism does not need to be optimal but simply viable, and it appears as a fundamental actor of the becoming of its lineage at the scale of phylogeny.

AB  - In this study, we perform a study on TRIstructural ISOtropic (TRISO) Silicon Carbide (SiC) layer failure using the BISON fuel performance code. SiC thermomechanical behavior is analyzed during both steady-state and accident scenarios pertaining to a Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor (FHR). A monodimensional single particle model is adapted from a previous analysis and run at 140 mW/particle for 500 days. The maximum burnup reached is 18.49% FIMA. A total of three accident scenarios are simulated at both fresh fuel conditions and following multiple irradiations at 2% FIMA increments up to 18.49% FIMA. The instances include an overcooling transient, a Control Rod Withdrawal (CRW) and a Loss of Forced Cooling Accident (LOFA). SiC hoop stress and failure probability predictions are evaluated for all simulated cases. A consistent tangential compressive stress state is found as a function of burnup for SiC. The maximum compressive hoop stress reaches approximately -400 MPa. The maximum SiC failure probability as a function of burnup is 2 center dot 10(-13)% at steadystate and no increases are predicted during transient simulations. It is concluded that the selected accident scenarios, under our modeling assumptions, are not predicted to pose a challenge to SiC integrity due to their relatively slow progression and low temperature increments, for both fresh fuel and at burnup values up to 18.49% FIMA. A 2D model is used, along with XFEM, to simulate a crack in the Inner Pyrolytic Carbon (IPyC). Conservative IPyC failure predictions are obtained with Weibull statistics approximately 38 days after beginning of irradiation. After crack formation, hoop stress concentrations are predicted in SiC using conservative assumptions, with failure probability increasing to 3.3 center dot 10(-4)%. 2D BISON simulations of the base irradiation are then carried out to the maximum burnup and transient conditions are subsequently applied. SiC maximum tensile hoop stress is predicted at the time of crack initiation, after which crack expansion reduces the predicted stress magnitude in the material. The results presented in the work are interpreted under the selected modeling assumptions and conclusions are based on a comparison with a parallel analysis on a High-Temperature GasCooled Reactor design to evaluate the effects of power density and burnup on SiC performance.

AB  - Pathogens like bacteria and protozoa, which affect human and animal health worldwide, can be transmitted by vectors like ticks. To investigate the epidemiology and genetic diversity of bacteria and protozoans carried by ticks in Chengmai county of Hainan province, China, 285 adult hard ticks belonging to two species [Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato): 183, 64.21% and Rhipicephalus microplus: 102, 35.79%] from dogs, cattle, and goats were collected. Microbial families were identified in these ticks by amplifying the 18S rRNA, 16S rRNA (rrs), citrate synthase (gltA), and heat shock protein (groEL) genes. Our data revealed the presence of four recognized species and two Candidatus spp. of Anaplasmataceae and Coxiellaceae.

AB  - Simple Summary Saponins are famous for their anti-methane effects; however, due to their structural differences that have different fates of antimicrobial activity in the rumen, their effects are not consistent in the literature. Thus, the current study used polymeric media-coated gynosaponin (PMCG) to estimate the time-dependent effects on the methanogenesis, rumen fermentation properties and microbial abundance in goats. We used Xinjiang goats (n = 8) that were divided into two groups, i.e., the PMCG group (8 g/kg DMI) and a control group (0 g/kg DMI). Ruminal contents were analyzed for rumen fermentation properties and microbial abundance. Protozoa numbers were counted to calculate the abundance of methanogens, rumen fungi and cellulolytic bacteria using real-time PCR. The results indicated that PMCG significantly reduced the methane production, and decreased the acetate to propionate ratio and total VFA concentration. The protozoa numbers and gene copies of methanogens, total bacteria and F. succinogens relative to the 16 s rDNA were all slightly decreased. Overall, the addition of PMCG had an inhibitory effect on methane production. Gynosaponin is known to modulate rumen methanogenesis and microbial fermentation characteristics in ruminants. The current experiment aimed to determine the time-dependent effects of intraruminal polymeric media-coated gynosaponin (PMCG) supplementation on the methanogenesis, rumen fermentation properties and microbial abundance in Xinjiang goats. Eight goats were used in a 2 x 2 crossover arrangement with a PMCG group (8 g/kg DMI) and a control group (0 g/kg DMI). The experiment was divided into four phases, each lasted 21 d. Ruminal contents were obtained for analysis of rumen fermentation properties and microbial abundance. Protozoa numbers were counted by microscope and the abundance of methanogens, rumen fungi and cellulolytic bacteria were quantified by real-time PCR. The results indicated that PMCG significantly reduced methane production (p < 0.05) during the first two phases but this increased to baseline again during the last two phases. Meanwhile, the concentration of acetate decreased remarkably, which resulted in a significant reduction in the acetate to propionate ratio and total VFA concentration (p < 0.05). However, other rumen properties and dry matter intake were not affected (p > 0.05). During the first and second phases, the protozoa numbers and gene copies of methanogens, total bacteria and F. succinogens relative to the 16 s rDNA were all slightly decreased, but the statistical results were not significant. However, the ruminal supplementation of PMCG had little effect on other tested microbes. Accordingly, it was concluded that the addition of PMCG had an inhibitory effect on methane production probably due to a decline in methanogen numbers.

AB  - Local communities' knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceptions (KAP) are at the center of wildlife governance, particularly the discourse on conservation of megafauna such as the African savannah elephant. Yet, there is limited scholarship on (KAP) related to different levels of wildlife governance and the consequences, especially in the global South. Local KAP are likely diverse and multifaceted and often contradict higher-level perspectives. To contribute to the understanding of KAP of the local communities about wildlife governance, this study applied a multi-method approach utilizing the Q methodology and focus group discussions (FDG) in the Hwange Tsholotsho Wildlife Area of Zimbabwe. Fifty-nine (59) purposively selected participants sorted forty-nine (49) statements collected from related literature. Data from the Q-method was analyzed for factors and compared with emerging themes from the FGD. Four distinct clusters emerged i.e. the progressive and collaborative perspective; the pro-multilateralism perspective; the disenfranchised and radical reforms perspective; and the, balanced perspective. The clusters indicate that while respondents agree on the need for multilevel wildlife governance systems, there is a general concern about the restrictive and opaque nature of decisions outside their scope with little recognition of their views. While there is scope for collaborative approaches and best practices, local interests should guide decisions on concepts, conservation, and participation. This work adds to the dearth of scholarship on wildlife governance, particularly in Africa, through the use of mixed methods which exhibited potential for application in studies that address complex environmental management challenges.

AB  - Brucellosis is a prevalent zoonotic disease worldwide. However, the spatiotemporal patterns evolution and its driving factors of Brucellosis have not been well explored. In this study, spatiotemporal scan statistics were applied to describe the spatiotemporal pattern of evolution in Brucellosis from 2003 to 2019 in mainland China, and GeoDetector analysis was further conducted to explore the driving effects of environmental, meteorological, and socioeconomic factors. We identified a distinct seasonal pattern for Brucellosis, with a peak in May and lowest incidence between September and December. High-risk clusters were first observed in the northwestern pastoral areas and later expanded to the southern urban areas. The spatiotemporal heterogeneity was mainly explained by total SO2 emissions, average annual temperature, sheep output, and consumption of meat per capita with explanatory powers of 45.38%, 44.60%, 40.76%, and 30.46% respectively. However, the explanatory power changed over time. Specifically, the explanatory power of average annual temperature tended to decrease over time, while consumption of meat per capita and total output of animal husbandry tended to increase. The most favorable conditions for the spread of Brucellosis include 0.66-0.70 million tons of SO2 emissions, 9.54-11.68 degrees C of average annual temperature, 63.28-72.40 million heads of sheep output, and 16.81-20.58 kg consumption of meat per capita. Brucellosis remains more prevalent in traditional pastoral areas in Northwest China, with the tendency of spreading from pastoral to non-pastoral, and rural to urban, areas. Total SO2 emission, average annual temperature, sheep output, and consumption of meat per capita dominated the spatial heterogeneity of Brucellosis with changes in explanatory power over time.

AB  - Crop straw return and organic manure application are effective and environmentally friendly methods used by farmers to improve soil structure, fertility and agricultural productivity. Sweet potato is a typical "potassium (K)-favoring" food crop and widely grown throughout the world. However, the regulation effects of long-term organic fertilization on soil aggregates-associated K stocks and K uptake by sweet potato are less understood. Herein, a long-term fertilization experiment since 2007 including chemical fertilizer (NPK), NPK combined with commercial manure (NPK+CM), NPK combined with pig manure (NPK+PM), and NPK combined with rice straw (NPK+RS) treatments under peanut-sweet potato crop rotation was employed. Long-term fertilizer application contributed to higher yield, yield stability, and K uptake of sweet potato. NPK+PM and NPK+RS treatments both showed the best promoting effect on plant growth. NPK+PM and NPK+RS treatments showed remarkable increasement of aggregate-associated exchangeable potassium (EK) and non-exchangeable potassium (NEK) stocks, particularly for small-macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm) and large-macroaggregates (> 2 mm). Total potassium (TK), EK and NEK stocks in large and small-macroaggregates displayed positive effects on K uptake and yield for sweet potato. Pearson's correlation and random forest model analysis revealed that EK and NEK stock in large-macroaggregate were the most key factors for K uptake and yield of sweet potato under long-term fertilization. Overall, our study highlights the prominent advantage of long-term organic fertilization

AB  - Simple Summary The domestic yak, a type of cattle native to the Himalayan region and Siberia, is known for its ability to withstand harsh climatic conditions at high altitudes and is primarily domesticated for its milk, wool, and meat. Most of the research on yaks has been conducted in China, where approximately 94% of the total estimated yak population can be found. In this study, the authors conducted an ethology study on the social behaviour of yaks in the Annapurna Valley of Nepal, where they are raised for their milk, wool, and meat and are also used for transportation. The authors used ethnographic inquiries to gather data on the social behaviour of yaks and the coping strategies used by herders to manage them. They also equipped cattle with one Actigraph wgt3x-BT to measure activity using an accelerometer and spatial associations using a proximity recorder. They found that yaks in both herds exhibited cohesive and synchronized behaviour, with similar activity patterns during the day and a peak of activity at night. They also observed that yaks in the first herd were more reactive to the presence of humans, while those in the second herd were more reactive to the presence of other yaks. The authors suggest that these differences in behaviour may be due to the different herding management practices used in each herd. Herdsmen use different techniques, as per varying geographies and cultures, to keep the cohesion within herds and avoid animals getting lost or predated. However, there is no study on the social behaviour of yaks and herdsmen management practices. Therefore, this ethology study was initiated by ethnographic inquiries. In Manang, the success of the shepherd is dictated by his personal attribute of 'Khula man' or open-heartedness. This attribute refers to good intentions and emotions such as empathy, which allow the shepherd to focus more on others than on himself. This cultural way of assessing the skills required to become a successful and knowledgeable shepherd guided us to study the effect of cultural values on the herd's social behaviour. We collected data from two herds living at the same settlement (Yak kharka, 4100 m altitude, Nepal) by equipping them with loggers. One of the herdsmen used the tether rope while the other one did not. Moreover, the Thaku herd had a more proactive shepherd than the Phurba one. In each herd, 17 animals were equipped with one Actigraph wgt3x-BT to measure activity using an accelerometer and spatial associations using a proximity recorder. One of the herds was equipped with GPS (N = 11) as well. Using GPS locations and activity, we showed that the two herds were cohesive and synchronised their activities but the Thaku herd (tether rope herd) was more cohesive than the Phurba herd based on the Actigraph signals. The shepherds also have personal knowledge of the social relationships of individual animals in their herds and use these relationships to keep the group cohesive and to manage cattle well.

AB  - Simple Summary Proper handling of dead and sick pig carcasses is a significant concern for farmers, the general public, academia, and government. By drawing on the existing literature, the study selects various determinants of sick and dead pig recycling and evaluates the impacts of rewards and punishment mechanisms on farmers' commitment to proper handling of dead and sick pigs. We utilized face-to-face discussion accompanied by a structured questionnaire to grasp the opinion of the Chinese pig farmers. The article elucidates the moderating effects of reward and punishment mechanisms, which will be crucial for understanding the on-hand experience of the farmers towards dead and sick pig recycling. Improper handling of sick and dead pigs may seriously affect public health, socio-economic conditions, and eventually cause environmental pollution. However, effective promotion of sick and dead pig (SDP) waste recycling has become the prime focus of current rural governance. Therefore, the study explores the impact of commitment, rewards, and punishments to capture the recycling behavior of farmers' sick and dead pig waste management. The study employs factor analysis, the probit model, and the moderating effect model to craft the findings. The study's empirical setup comprises the survey data collected from the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces, representing the major pig-producing provinces in China. The study found that the commitment, reward, and punishment mechanisms are essential factors affecting the farmers' decision-making on recycling sick and dead pig waste. The marginal effect analysis found that the reward and punishment mechanism is more effective than the farmers' commitment. The study confirmed that in the recycling treatment of sick and dead pig waste, the farmers' commitment and the government's reward and punishment policy are the main factors that influence farmers to manage sick and dead pig waste properly. Therefore, the government should highlight the importance of effective waste management, and training facilities should also be extended firmly. The government should impose strict rules and regulations to restrict the irresponsible dumping of farm waste. Monitoring mechanisms should be put in place promptly.

AB  - Aerobic composting is increasingly regarded as a promising technology for the recycling of spent mushroom substrate (SMS), and an applicable nitrogen source is necessary to improve the process. This study is the first to investigate the effects of protein-like N source (chicken manure, CM) and high-N source (urea, UR) on humification process and P dynamics during SMS composting. The effect of different N sources on microbial succession was also studied. Results showed that CM addition achieved a longer thermophilic phase (16 d vs 9 d), greater germination indices (131.6% vs 106.3%), and higher total phosphorus content (13.1 g/kg vs 6.56 g/kg) in the end products, as compared to UR. The addition of CM showed beneficial effects on humification and stabilization, including decreased weight loss and fluctuations in the level of functional groups. The P produced in the compost was interconverted and leached in the P pool. In this case, the P detected in the compost was in the form of orthophosphate and MgNH4PO4 center dot 6H(2)O crystal as inorganic P and orthophosphate monoester as organic P. The most abundant microorganisms at the phylum level mainly include Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, accounting for more than 88% of the total microorganisms. The addition of CM to SMS compost resulted in higher organic matter degradation rates. This work clarified the role of various N sources in SMS composting and presented an appropriate waste management method beneficial to bioresource technology and sustainable development of the edible fungi business.

AB  - Simple Summary Various thermal indices have been developed to evaluate the heat stress in animals. In this study, the temperature and humidity index (THI), effective temperature (ET), enthalpy (H), and the equivalent temperature index of sows (ETIS) from the part 1 of this paper series have been reviewed and analyzed in the process of sow production. Four approaches have been proposed to analyze these commonly applied thermal indices: (1) equivalent temperature change method; (2) the method based on the change of thermal index under different wind speeds; (3) the psychrometric chart method; and (4) CFD simulation method. In the analysis among those thermal indices, the ETIS performed best in evaluating the sow's thermal environment, followed by THI2, THI4 and THI7. This research provides a theoretical basis for selecting an appropriate thermal index for thermal environment evaluations in the sow production. Heat stress has an adverse effect on the production performance of sows, and causes a large economic loss every year. The thermal environment index is an important indicator for evaluating the level of heat stress in animals. Many thermal indices have been used to analyze the environment of the pig house, including temperature and humidity index (THI), effective temperature (ET), equivalent temperature index of sows (ETIS), and enthalpy (H), among others. Different heat indices have different characteristics, and it is necessary to analyze and compare the characteristics of heat indices to select a relatively suitable heat index for specific application. This article reviews the thermal environment indices used in the process of sow breeding, and compares various heat indices in four ways: (1) Holding the value of the thermal index constant and analyzing the equivalent temperature changes caused by the relative humidity. (2) Analyzing the variations of ET and ETIS caused by changes in air velocity. (3) Conducting a comparative analysis of a variety of isothermal lines fitted to the psychrometric chart. (4) Analyzing the distributions of various heat index values inside the sow barn and the correlation between various heat indices and sow heat dissipation with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology. The results show that the ETIS performs better than other thermal indices in the analysis of sows' thermal environment, followed by THI2, THI4, and THI7. Different pigs have different heat transfer characteristics and different adaptability to the environment. Therefore, based on the above results, the following suggestions have been given: The thermal index thresholds need to be divided based on the adaptability of pigs to the environment at different growth stages and the different climates in different regions. An appropriate threshold for a thermal index can provide a theoretical basis for the environmental control of the pig house.

AB  - The continual consolidation and concentration of animal feeding operations (AFOs) raises various environmental challenges, including air pollutant emission. Cost-effective mitigation technologies are pursued to protect the health and wellbeing of animals and farmers as well as the environment. Previous lab studies utilized ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2), two major air pollutants in AFOs, for microalgal cultivation. However, the field performance of this algae-based mitigation approach has yet to be investigated. In this study, two photo-bioreactors (PBRs) were tested in a nursery pig barn to mitigate NH3 and CO2 while growing Scenedesmus dimorphus (S. dimorphus). Pit air was fed into the PBRs where the two pollutants were adsorbed by S. dimorphus as nutrients to produce algal biomass and oxygen gas (O-2). The cleaned air then recirculated back to the room space. S. dimorphus reached its maximum cell count on the 17th day of the experiment when NH3 and CO2 concentrations in the pit air were 25.6 ppm and 3150 ppm, respectively. The maximum biomass concentration occurred on the 11th day when the NH3 and CO2 concentrations were 14.6 and 2250 ppm, respectively. The average mitigation efficiency was 31-50% for NH3 and 1-1.7% for CO2. The costs for removing 1 g NH3 and CO2 were estimated to be $3.77 and $0.20, respectively. This study shows that an integrated PBR system is technically feasible for reducing pig barn air pollutant emission while producing microalgae as a valuable product.

AB  - Bangladesh holds 191 km(2) semi-evergreen northeastern (NE) forests where systematic camera-trapping has never been carried out. An effort of 587 trap nights in Satchari National Park, a NE forest, revealed ten carnivores, two ungulates, two primates, two rodents, and one treeshrew (12 threatened in Bangladesh; of which three globally threatened; dhole and northern treeshrew were new discoveries). Pairwise circadian homogeneity, coefficient of temporal overlap ((Delta) over cap), and spatial cooccurrence pattern were measured. High values ((Delta) over cap > 0.75) were noted in 36 pairwise comparisons, and positive spatial association (P-gt < 0.05) in five. Anthropogenic activities overlapped with diurnal -species (0.65 <= <(Delta)over cap>(1) <= 0.88) but stood dissimilar (P < 0.05 in the Mardia-Watson-Wheeler test) except for yellow-throated marten-livestock movement (<(Delta)over cap> 1 = 0.70). Although species-specific dietary or -temporal preference explains the observed associations, low detection of the jungle cat (2) compared to the leopard cat (56), absence of the fishing cat, homogenous activity (P > 0.05) in yellow-throated marten-crab-eating mongoose ((Delta) over cap (1) = 0.83) and rhesus macaque-pig-tailed macaque ((Delta) over cap (4) = 0.93) pairs need further research. These insights are remarkable as NE forests, the western cusp of the Indo-Burma biodiversity hotspot, are contrarily deemed `empty', receiving least scientific investments.

AB  - Agricultural insect herbivores show a remarkable ability to adapt to modern agroecosystems, making them ideal for the study of the mechanisms underlying rapid evolution. The mobilization of transposable elements is one mechanism that may help explain this ability. The Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, is a highly adaptable species, as shown by its wide host range, broad geographic distribution, and tolerance to insecticides. However, beetle populations vary in insecticide tolerance, with Eastern US beetle populations being more adaptable than Western US ones. Here, we use a community ecology approach to examine how the abundance and diversity of transposable elements differs in 88 resequenced genomes of L. decemlineata collected throughout North America. We tested if assemblages and mobilization of transposable elements differed between populations of L. decemlineata based on the beetle's geography, host plant, and neonicotinoid insecticide resistance. Among populations of North American L. decemlineata, individuals collected in Mexico host more transposable elements than individuals collected in the United States. Transposable element insertion locations differ among geographic populations, reflecting the evolutionary history of this species. Total transposable element diversity between L. decemlineata individuals is enough to distinguish between populations, with more TEs found in beetles collected in Mexico than in the United States. Transposable element diversity does not appear to differ between beetles found on different host plants, or relate to different levels of insecticide resistance.

AB  - Herbivores can negatively impact plant reproduction by altering floral traits, pollination, and fruit production. To counteract this, plants developed defense mechanisms, such as the biotic defense resulting from associations with ants. The aim of this study was to investigate whether leaf herbivory at different intensities influences reproductive success and extrafloral nectar secretion patterns in a savanna plant, Banisteriopsis malifolia (Malpighiaceae). Plants were subjected to simulated leaf herbivory and divided into three groups: Control (damage < 5%), T15 (15% leaf area removed), and T50 (50% leaf area removed). Assessments continued until fruiting. The findings indicate an increase in extrafloral nectar sugar concentration after simulated herbivory. Increasing foliar damage significantly delayed the time to bloom, decreased the number of inflorescences per plant, and reduced the size of buds and flowers. Foliar damage significantly decreased fruit size. Furthermore, ant foraging was influenced by herbivory, with a predominance of aggressive ants on plants with high levels of damage. Our study shows that varying levels of leaf damage affect extrafloral nectar secretion, ant foraging behavior, and plant reproductive structures. These findings highlight how insect herbivores and the level of damage they cause influence plant fitness and consequently community structure.

AB  - Although pastoral systems make a significant contribution to food security, they are also pointed out as being responsible for substantial environmental impact. Ecological intensification through process- rather than input-based technologies has been proposed as a means to achieve economic, environmental, and social win-win situations. We studied structural diversity, technology adoption, farmer strategies, and functional attributes (productivity, reproductive efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, diversification, and self-sufficiency) of pastoral systems in North Patagonia based on interviews of 70 farms with the following objectives: (a) to analyze farm structural characteristics as drivers of technology adoption for ecological intensification, (b) to describe their association with farmers livelihood strategies, and (c) to explore trade-offs and synergies among functional attributes. An ongoing ecological intensification was revealed based on the adoption of technologies towards animal's welfare, survival, and overall systems efficiency, on-farm produced feed (self-sufficiency), and product diversification, promoting nutrient re-cycling within farm boundaries. Four farm types were differentiated by their access to information exchange channels, which together with labor characteristics determined technology adoption and farmers strategies. The main strategy of family farms that exhibited low to no hired labor, and intermediate to low access to information, was the diversification of products or incomes. Larger farms, with hired labor and access to information exchange channels, had an entrepreneurial strategy towards increasing production efficiencies. Enteric emission intensity per unit product and area exhibited significant trade-offs with meat production (Spearman rho = 0.87; Y = 0.459 X + 0.352; R-2 = 0.95), and synergies with reproduction efficiency (Spearman rho = 0.51; Y = -0.013 X + 1.612; R-2 = 0.28), respectively. Improving individual animal production instead of per unit area is encouraged to prevent overgrazing and land degradation, searching for win-win's between emission mitigation and livestock production.

AB  - Background Identifying the behavioral state for wild animals that can't be directly observed is of growing interest to the ecological community. Advances in telemetry technology and statistical methodologies allow researchers to use space-use and movement metrics to infer the underlying, latent, behavioral state of an animal without direct observations. For example, researchers studying ungulate ecology have started using these methods to quantify behaviors related to mating strategies. However, little work has been done to determine if assumed behaviors inferred from movement and space-use patterns correspond to actual behaviors of individuals. Methods Using a dataset with male and female white-tailed deer location data, we evaluated the ability of these two methods to correctly identify male-female interaction events (MFIEs). We identified MFIEs using the proximity of their locations in space as indicators of when mating could have occurred. We then tested the ability of utilization distributions (UDs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) rendered with single sex location data to identify these events. Results For white-tailed deer, male and female space-use and movement behavior did not vary consistently when with a potential mate. There was no evidence that a probability contour threshold based on UD volume applied to an individual's UD could be used to identify MFIEs. Additionally, HMMs were unable to identify MFIEs, as single MFIEs were often split across multiple states and the primary state of each MFIE was not consistent across events. Conclusions Caution is warranted when interpreting behavioral insights rendered from statistical models applied to location data, particularly when there is no form of validation data. For these models to detect latent behaviors, the individual needs to exhibit a consistently different type of space-use and movement when engaged in the behavior. Unvalidated assumptions about that relationship may lead to incorrect inference about mating strategies or other behaviors.

AB  - The Rio Grande Valley (RGV) in southern Texas is well-suited for vegetable production due to its relatively mild/warm weather conditions in the fall and winter. Consequently, insects inflict year-round, persistent damage to crops in the RGV and regions with similar climate. Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) (Hemiptera: Triozidae), commonly known as the potato psyllid, is a known vector of Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum (CLso) (Hyphomicrobiales: Rhizobiaceae), a fastidious phloem-limited bacterium associated to vein-greening in tomatoes and Zebra Chip in potatoes. Vector control is the primary approach of integrated pest management (IPM) strategies that aim to prevent plant diseases in commercial agricultural systems. However, resistance-selective pressures that decrease the effectiveness of chemical control (insecticide) applications over time are of increasing concern. Therefore, we explore an ecological approach to devising alternative IPM methodologies to manage the psyllid-transmitted CLso pathogen to supplement existing chemical products and application schedules without increasing resistance. In this study, our objective was to examine the effects of plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on host-vector-pathogen interactions. Soil-drench applications of PGPRs to Solanum lycopersicum (Solanales: Solanaceae) seedlings revealed structural and possible physiological changes to the plant host and indirect changes on psyllid behavior: host plants had increased length and biomass of roots and exhibited delayed colonization by CLso, while psyllids displayed changes in parental (F-0) psyllid behavior (orientation and oviposition) in response to treated hosts and in the sex ratio of their progeny (F-1). Based on our results, we suggest that PGPR may have practical use in commercial tomato production.

AB  - Warming-induced shifts in plant phenology have been frequently reported in recent decades. Previous studies primarily focused on isolated phenological events; however, the entire phenological sequences of a given species were rarely examined simultaneously, limiting our knowledge about aggregate life history response to climate warming. Here, using 210,000 in situ phenological observations across 2493 European sites during 1980-2015, we examined the responses of four typical phenological events (leaf unfolding, flowering, fruiting, and leaf coloring) of Aesculus hippocastanum (horse chestnut), a common temperate tree species, to climate warming. We found that all four phenophases of A. hippocastanum advanced, i.e., the entire life cycle during the year shifted earlier with climate warming. However, the early-season phenophases (leaf unfolding and flowering) advanced faster than late-season phenophases (leaf coloring and fruiting), leading to the extension of both growing season (from leaf unfolding to leaf coloring) and reproductive season (from flowering to fruiting). The extension rate of the reproductive season was slightly greater than that of the growing season. This implied that under warming climate, more time was devoted to both vegetative growth and reproduction, particularly the latter one, in A. hippocastanum. In addition, significantly positive correlations were observed among four phenological events, particularly for pairwise consecutive events, indicating that the responses of phenological sequences to warming were highly correlated. By simultaneously studying the responses of four key phenological events to climate warming, our findings demonstrate the differences in the phenological plasticity among phenological sequences in A. hippocastanum, deepening our understanding about the impact of climate warming on life history rather than examining individual phenological events in isolation.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary naringin supplementation on rumen fermentation, inflammatory response and bacterial communities in fattening goats fed high-concentrate diet. Twenty four Boer male goats were randomly divided into three groups and assigned to receive dietary treatments. The three dietary treatments were a normal diet, a high-concentrate diet and a high-concentrate diet supplemented with 500 mg of naringin/kg of dry matter intake. Rumen fluid and plasma samples were collected at the end of the animal trial. Rumen fluid were analysed for pH, short-chain fatty acids, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and microbiota. Illumina Miseq sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was applied to investigate ruminal bacterial communities. The concentrations of interleukin -6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha as well as LPS-binding protein, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A and the activities of antioxdant enzymes in plasma were analysed. The result showed that feeding the high concentrate diet shifted the ruminal fermentation pattern from acetate towards propionate and valerate, and improved growth performance compared with the control group. However, the high concentrate diet promoted ruminal pH reduction and LPS release, modified bacterial communities and increased systemic inflammatory response. Naringin supplementation increased molar proportions butyrate and decreased valerate. Naringin supplementation decreased inflammatory response and increased the activities of antioxdant enzymes in plasma. Moreover, naringin addition increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes at the phylum level and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group at the genus level. Taken together, these results suggest that dietary supplementation with naringin attenuates high grain diet-induced inflammatory response and modifies ruminal fermentation.

AB  - Introductions of novel plant species can disturb the historical resource environment of herbivorous insects, resulting in strong selection to either adopt or exclude the novel host. However, an adaptive response depends on heritable genetic variation for preference or performance within the targeted herbivore population, and it is unclear how heritability of host-use preference may differ between novel and historical hosts. Pieris macdunnoughii butterflies in the Rocky Mountains lay eggs on the nonnative mustard Thlaspi arvense, which is lethal to their offspring. Heritability analyses revealed considerable sex-linked additive genetic variation in host preference within a population of this butterfly. This was contrary to general predictions about the genetic basis of preference variation, which are hypothesized to be sex linked between populations but autosomal within populations. Evidence of sex linkage disappeared when butterflies were tested on methanol-based chemical extracts, suggesting these chemicals in isolation may not be the primary driver of female choice among available host plants. Although unexpected, evidence for within-population sex-linked genetic variation in preference for T. arvense over native hosts indicates that persistent maladaptive oviposition on this lethal plant must be maintained by alternative evolutionary dynamics such as migration- or drift-selection balance or pleiotropic constraints.

AB  - Changing electrical environments can influence the performance of herbivorous insects and adversely affect their control strategies. The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), is a pest that devastates cruciferous vegetables. An age-stage, two-sex life table of P. xylostella over multiple generations was established to describe the effect of varying high-voltage electrostatic field (HVEF) exposure on their performance after the age-cohort eggs were exposed to HVEF at an intensity of 5.0 kV/cm for different durations. The results show that direct HVEF exposure adversely affected the population dynamics parameters of P. xylostella over multiple generations. In particular, the net reproduction rate, intrinsic natural increase rate, and finite increase rate of the P. xylostella population significantly decreased in the third and fifth generations under HVEF exposure for 10 min, while the mean generation time and doubling time significantly increased. Similarly, HVEF exposure for 10 min rapidly reduced the survival rate of adult P. xylostella in the first generation, and subsequently, it declined evenly and slowly. Meanwhile, the fecundity parameters of P. xylostella revealed that HVEF exposure for 10 min had the strongest inhibition effect on reproduction over five consecutive generations. In addition, HVEF exposure significantly increased the superoxide dismutase activity to produce extra hydrogen peroxide; however, increased catalase and peroxidase activity or reduced peroxidase activity triggered the accumulation of malondialdehyde in instar P. xylostella, especially after 10 min of treatment. The present findings provide experimental evidence and a theoretical basis for developing control strategies for P. xylostella under new HVEF environments.

AB  - Anthropogenic nutrient input is one of the greatest causes of freshwater and coastal eutrophication worldwide. In many catchments, nutrient losses must be reduced to meet the water quality outcomes sought by communities and regulators. To achieve this, policy makers must find an acceptable balance between the economic value of land use activities and sustained health of the receiving ecosystem. Abatement policies for an intermittently closed and open lagoon catchment ecosystem in the Southland region of New Zealand were evaluated. The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of different policies aimed at reducing nutrient loads entering the lagoon while minimizing reductions in farm operating profit by considering production losses and costs of mitigations. An economic-environmental optimization model that selects farm system (e.g., reduced fertilizer input and stocking rate) and edge-of-field (e.g., constructed wetlands) mitigations most suitable to each pastoral farm (dairy, dairy support, sheep and beef) was developed. Three optimization strategies, either with a focus on nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), or both, were evaluated: a differentiated strategy considering nutrient loss and profitability differences between farms; a uniform strategy requiring a similar proportional reduction for all farms; and a nutrient cap strategy requiring all farms to achieve losses below a set cap in kg ha- 1 year- 1. Results indicate that it will be a challenge to achieve the currently recommended target of 50 % reduction in the load of both nutrients. When N was the focus, the best outcomes achieved around 50 % and 30 % reduction in N and P loads respectively, but it required a reduction in total farm income, before interest and tax, of 22-38 % (approximately NZ$5-9 M year- 1 at current prices). The catchment-wide differentiated policy was the most costeffective from a farmer and economic point of view, but still required land retirement for approximately 30 % of the farm businesses. A double nutrient cap strategy of 40 kg ha- 1 for N and 1 kg ha- 1 for P only achieved around 20 % reduction in both nutrients at 10 % reduction in farm income. Another option, a nutrient cap strategy of 40 kg ha- 1 for N and 0.8 kg ha- 1 for P, resulted in 30-35 % reduction in both nutrients at around 17 % reduction in profit (NZ$4 M year- 1). The work demonstrates the importance of evaluating the cost-efficiency of nutrient loss mitigations at farm scale when evaluating different abatement policy options at catchment scale. It demonstrates utility for other similar sites by showing how the focus can be on individual farm businesses, while searching for balanced environmental and economic outcomes at the larger scale.

AB  - The relationship between the rate of development (DR) of bud-burst and temperature may be nonlinear, which could lead to varying temperature sensitivity (TS) of budburst date under different climate conditions. In order to determine the functional form between DR/TS and temperature, we gathered twigs with flower buds of five woody plants (Malus halliana, Forsythia suspense, Crataegus pinnatifida, Prunus cerasifera F. atropurpurea, and Berberis thunbergii var. atropurpurea Chenault) in early spring of 2017 at Beijing, and placed them in six growth chambers at same daylength but different temperature conditions (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C). The proportion of bud- burst was recorded every 2 or 3 days for each species at each temperature condition. The results showed that the proportion of bud-burst followed the logistic function over time at a given temperature. Subsequently, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the proportion of bud-burst at any temperature and date. The DR and TS were parameterized using a differential method. The simulation results showed that the DR increased monotonically with the rise in temperature, but only two species could reach the maximum value at 30 degrees C. The TS decreased with the increase in temperature, but this effect was weak when the temperature was high enough. These findings suggested that the predicted warming in the future may result in a slowdown in the advance of spring phenology of woody plants.

AB  - In Kerala, human-elephant conflicts (HEC) are reported in almost all parts of the Western Ghats region, exceptionally high in Wayanad. In recent years, there has been a notable surge in HEC occurrences throughout the state, leading to the loss of property, animals, and life. The dependency of humans on enclosures, the transformation of natural areas into plantations, and the fragmentation of natural ecosystems are the main reasons for the escalating conflict between people and elephants. As a result, it is necessary to study the suitability of habitat for elephants and ensure their conservation. The study aims to identify suitable elephant habitats in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary using geospatial data based on their known association with environmental variables. This study employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), an approach to determining the weightings of individual parameters in assessing habitat suitability. The analysis findings indicated that the central portion of the study area within the Sultan Bathery (43.63 sq. km), range represents the most suitable area for elephant habitat followed by Kurichat (33.59 sq. km) and Tholpetti (19.45 sq. km). The final output of the study, the Habitat Suitability Map was validated by adding the human-elephant conflict locational data, which illustrates that the Kurichiat range recorded the highest HEC conflict (50%), followed by Muthanga (29%), Sulthan Bathery (12%), and Tholpetti (9%). The map could assist in managing, conserving, and protecting forest resources and aid in decision-making activities.

AB  - The dermis and epidermis, crucial structural layers of the skin, encompass appendages, hair follicles (HFs), and intricate cellular heterogeneity. However, an integrated spatiotemporal transcriptomic atlas of embryonic skin has not yet been described and would be invaluable for studying skin-related diseases in humans. Here, single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses are performed on skin samples of normal and hairless fetal pigs across four developmental periods. The cross-species comparison of skin cells illustrated that the pig epidermis is more representative of the human epidermis than mice epidermis. Moreover, Phenome-wide association study analysis revealed that the conserved genes between pigs and humans are strongly associated with human skin-related diseases. In the epidermis, two lineage differentiation trajectories describe hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and epidermal development. By comparing normal and hairless fetal pigs, it is found that the hair placode (Pc), the most characteristic initial structure in HFs, arises from progenitor-like OGN+/UCHL1+ cells. These progenitors appear earlier in development than the previously described early Pc cells and exhibit abnormal proliferation and migration during differentiation in hairless pigs. The study provides a valuable resource for in-depth insights into HF development, which may serve as a key reference atlas for studying human skin disease etiology using porcine models.
   Pigs are a valuable resource for human medical research. This study presents a high resolution spatial-temporal transcriptome atlas to study embryonic pig skin. The results indicate notable similarities between pigs and humans in early skin development. Furthermore, by comparing normal and hairless pig fetuses, the study reveals a cell subpopulation causing lower hair placode density and further hairless in pigs. image

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurring obsessive thoughts and repetitive behaviors that are often associated with anxiety and perturbations in cortico-striatal signaling. Given the suboptimal response of OCD to current serotonergic interventions, there is a need to better understand the psychobiological mechanisms that may underlie the disorder. In this regard, investigations into adenosinergic processes might be fruitful. Indeed, adenosine modulates both anxiety- and motor behavioral output. Thus, we aimed to explore the potential associations between compulsive-like large nest building (LNB) behavior in deer mice, anxiety and adenosinergic processes. From an initial pool of 120 adult deer mice, 34 normal nest building (NNB)- and 32 LNB-expressing mice of both sexes were selected and exposed to either a normal water (wCTRL) or vehicle control (vCTRL), lorazepam (LOR) or istradefylline (ISTRA) for 7- (LOR) or 28 days after which nesting assessment was repeated and animals screened for anxiety-like behavior in an anxiogenic open field. Mice were then euthanized, the striatal tissue removed on ice and the adenosine A2A receptor expression quantified. Our findings indicate that NNB and LNB behavior are not distinctly associated with measures of generalized anxiety and that ISTRA-induced changes in nesting expression are dissociated from changes in anxiety scores. Further, data from this investigation show that nesting in deer mice is directly related to striatal adenosine signaling, and that LNB is founded upon a lower degree of adenosinergic A2A stimulation.

AB  - To gain insight into the mitochondrial mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in high-altitude natives, we examined left ventricle mitochondrial function of highland deer mice compared with lowland native deer mice and white-footed mice. Highland and lowland native deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and lowland white-footed mice (P. leucopus) were first-generation born and raised in common lab conditions. Adult mice were acclimated to either normoxia or hypoxia (60 kPa) equivalent to similar to 4300 m for at least 6 weeks. Left ventricle mitochondrial physiology was assessed by determining respiration in permeabilized muscle fibers with carbohydrates, lipids, and lactate as substrates. We also measured the activities of several left ventricle metabolic enzymes. Permeabilized left ventricle muscle fibers of highland deer mice showed greater rates of respiration with lactate than either lowland deer mice or white-footed mice. This was associated with higher activities of lactate dehydrogenase in tissue and isolated mitochondria in highlanders. Normoxia-acclimated highlanders also showed higher respiratory rates with palmitoyl-carnitine than lowland mice. Maximal respiratory capacity through complexes I and II was also greater in highland deer mice but only compared with lowland deer mice. Acclimation to hypoxia had little effect on respiration rates with these substrates. In contrast, left ventricle activities of hexokinase increased in both lowland and highland deer mice after hypoxia acclimation. These data suggest that highland deer mice support an elevated cardiac function in hypoxia, in part, with high ventricle cardiomyocyte respiratory capacities supported by carbohydrates, fatty acids, and lactate.

AB  - Myrmecophytes have mutualistic relationships with symbiotic ants. Although myrmecophytic Macaranga (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae) species are well protected by aggressive Crematogaster (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) ants, some bug species occur on the myrmecophytes. To clarify the associations of these bugs with the plants and the ants, we studied the food habits of 3 bug species, Pilophorus lambirensis Nakatani et Komatsu, 2013 (Hemiptera: Miridae: Phylinae), Phylinae sp. 1, and Arbela sp. 1 (Hemiptera: Nabidae). We conducted field observations in a Bornean rainforest. First, we located these bugs and studied their behavioral responses to the ants on Macaranga species; we then conducted stable isotope analyses. All bugs avoided direct contact with ants, but they occurred only on trees with active ants. Pilophorus lambirensis and Phylinae sp. 1 were most commonly observed on the apical parts of host trees, whereas Arbela sp. 1 was mainly in areas distant from the apical parts where ants were sparse. The stable isotope ratios indicated that Phylinae sp. 1 fed on food bodies, which are nutrient-rich spherical bodies produced by Macaranga trees on the apical parts for ants. Although the main diet of the other 2 species remains unclear, nitrogen isotopic signatures demonstrated that P. lambirensis is herbivorous, whereas Arbela sp. 1 is carnivorous. However, the distant location from ants and its isotopic signatures indicated that Arbela sp. 1 rarely fed on the ants. At least 2 mirid bug species might obtain enemy-free space in addition to the food provided by the myrmecophytes.

AB  - In agriculture, overfertilization with liquid organic manures (LOM) is causing environmental issues including eutrophication of non-agricultural ecosystems and nitrate pollution of groundwater. To avoid such problems, a precise and demand-oriented fertilization with LOM is needed. This can only be achieved if the nutrient composition of the LOM is known. However, traditional chemical analysis is cost-and time-intensive and furthermore dependent on a representative sample. Optical spectrometry in the visible and near-infrared range could provide an efficient alternative, if a chemometric calibration assures sufficient accuracy. To improve chemometric calibration, this study investigated several spectral preprocessing and regression algorithms, and compared predictions based either on dry or wet weight concentration. In addition, the capability of low-cost spectrometers was evaluated by simulating low-resolution spectra with smaller wavelength ranges. The reflectance spectra of 391 pig manure, 155 cattle manure, and 89 biogas digestate samples were used to predict plant macronutrients (N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S), micronutrients (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, B), dry matter (DM) and pH. The experiments demonstrate the general aptness of optical spectrometry to accurately predict DM, pH and all nutrients except boron in pig, cattle, and digestate LOM, even with simulated low-cost spectrometers. Best results show r2 between 0.80 and 0.97, ratios of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) between 2.1 and 7.8, and mean absolute errors normalized by the median (nMAE) between 5 and 36 %. The regression methods PLSR, LASSO, and least angle regression predominantly performed best. The innovative preprocessing methods named simple ratios (SR) and normalized differences (ND) proved to be very useful algorithms, especially for N and P predictions, outperforming the accuracy of classical techniques in several cases. Concentrations on dry weight basis improved predictions of K, Mn, and pH.

AB  - White-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmermann) (Artiodactyla: Cervidae) are the main host for adult Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (blacklegged tick) and all stages of Amblyomma americanum Linnaeus (Acari: Ixodidae) (lone star tick). However, literature describing the feeding and reproductive parameters of these tick species when feeding on this host is limited. We experimentally infested white-tailed deer with adult pairs of either I. scapularis or A. americanum to improve our understanding of these tick-host relationships. Our study used tick-naive white-tailed deer and restricted host grooming throughout the infestation. For I. scapularis, the days to repletion (mean +/- SE, 6.04 +/- 0.07), engorgement weight of replete females (0.20 +/- 0.0032 g), duration of oviposition (32 +/- 0.45 d), egg mass weight (0.10 +/- 0.0027 g), and number of eggs laid per tick (1,803.00 +/- 49.00) were recorded. Data from A. americanum were also recorded, including days to repletion (11.00 +/- 0.063), engorgement weight of replete females (0.63 +/- 0.025 g), duration of oviposition (37.00 +/- 1.30 d), egg mass weight (0.34 +/- 0.017 g), and number of eggs laid per tick (5,873.00 +/- 291.00). These biological parameter data could be used as variables in models (e.g., LYMESIM 2.0) to determine how white-tailed deer influence I. scapularis and A. americanum populations in nature, and to evaluate the protective efficacy of tick-antigen-based antitick vaccines.

AB  - This work proposes a series of strategies and tools for the design and characterization of natural treatment systems of wastewater (NTSW) applied in livestock farms, considering the parameters of flow rate (Q), conductivity (EC) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) of the waste generated, farm location, hydraulic retention time (HRT), and removal/reduction rate targets. The high organic load of the effluent generated in these farms has an important environmental impact, which is amplified in insular or isolated territories. The application of such treatment systems has demonstrated their suitability in these environments, but their design lacks proper characterization and sizing tools for their adequate operation. The proposed tools in this work are based on a collection of experimental data over a ten-year period of application of NTSW in real farms. This work contributes to facilitate the design and implementation of NTSW in farms located in isolated, island, or similar-size environments. Finally, as a practical application, an inventory and implementation of the tool developed for livestock farms on the island of Gran Canaria (Spain) is carried out.

AB  - Tea plants are economically important woody plants that originated in southwestern China. The Yunnan Province in China is regarded as the central origin of tea plants owing to the abundance and diversity of the tea germplasm present in this region. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships among tea plants in this region. Here, a total of 266,397 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained using double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing from 468 tea accessions collected from Yunnan. The phylogenetic relationship and population structure of the 468 tea accessions revealed remarkable inter- and intraspecific introgression across different sect. Thea species. We found that Camellia taliensis (W. W. Smith) Melchior is the main genetic donor that greatly contributed to the domestication of C. sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, as evidenced by the frequent generation of genetic intermediates derived from the hybridization between C. sinensis and C. taliensis in Lincang, Xishuangbanna, and Pu'er. Notable genetic differences were observed across the populations from distinct regions of Yunnan. Additionally, the Lancang River may have attenuated the genetic interflow between Lincang and Pu'er. Finally, a core collection of 50 tea accessions was constructed based on the genetic diversity of the 468 tea accessions. Our results provide novel insights into the evolutionary and domestication history of tea plants in Yunnan Province and can facilitate the development of strategies for the conservation, breeding, and utilization of the core collection.

AB  - Hermaphrodite systems offer unique opportunities to study sexual differentiation, due to their high degree of sexual plasticity and to the fact that, unlike gonochoristic systems, the process is not confined to an early developmental stage. In protandric shrimp species, such as Hippolyte inermis and Pandalus platyceros, male differentiation is followed by transformation to femaleness during adulthood. The mechanisms controlling sexual differentiation have not been fully elucidated in crustaceans, but a key role has been attributed to the insulin-like hormone (IAG) produced by the androgenic gland (AG), a crustacean masculine endocrine organ. To uncover further transcriptomic toolkit elements affecting the sexual differentiation of H. inermis, we constructed eye and whole body RNA libraries of four representative stages during its protandric life cycle (immature, male, young female and mature female). The body libraries contained transcripts related to the reproductive system, among others, while the eye libraries contained transcripts related to the X-organ-sinus gland, a central endocrine complex that regulates crustacean reproduction. Binary pattern analysis, performed to mine for genes expressed differentially between the different life stages, yielded 19,605 and 6,175 transcripts with a specific expression pattern in the eye and body, respectively. Prominent sexually biased transcriptomic patterns were recorded for the IAG and vitellogenin genes, representing, respectively, a key factor within the masculine IAG-switch, and a precursor of the yolk protein, typical of feminine reproductive states. These patterns enabled the discovery of novel putative protein-coding transcripts exhibiting sexually biased expression in the H. inermis body and eye transcriptomes of males and females. Homologs to the above novel genes have been found in other decapod crustaceans, and a comparative study, using previously constructed transcriptomic libraries of another protandric shrimp, P. platyceros, showed similar sexually biased results, supporting the notion that such genes, mined from the H. inermis transcriptome, may be universal factors related to reproduction and sexual differentiation and their control in other crustaceans. This study thus demonstrates the potential of transcriptomic studies in protandric species to uncover unexplored layers of the complex crustacean sex-differentiation puzzle.

AB  - Combined water, sanitation, and handwashing (WSH) interventions could reduce fecal contamination along more transmission pathways than single interventions alone. We measured Escherichia coli levels in 3909 drinking water samples, 2691 child hand rinses, and 2422 toy ball rinses collected from households enrolled in a 2-year cluster-randomized controlled trial evaluating single and combined WSH interventions. Water treatment with chlorine reduced E. coli in drinking water. A combined WSH intervention improved water quality by the same magnitude but did not affect E. coli levels on hands or toys. One potential explanation for the limited impact of the sanitation intervention (upgraded latrines) is failure to address dog and livestock fecal contamination. Small ruminant (goat or sheep) ownership was associated with increased E. coli levels in stored water and on child hands. Cattle and poultry ownership was protective against child stunting, and domesticated animal ownership was not associated with child diarrhea. Our findings do not support restricting household animal ownership to prevent child diarrheal disease or stunting but do support calls for WSH infrastructure that can more effectively reduce household fecal contamination.

AB  - Simple Summary The tri-trophic interactions between plants, insects, and insect predators and parasitoids are a dominant component of many terrestrial ecosystems. Within these interactions, many predators of herbivorous arthropods use chemical signals provided by the host plants when searching for prey. The exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) often induces the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) similar to those induced by herbivores in plants. Therefore, it has been used as a method to estimate attraction to VOCs in arthropod and avian predators. In this study, we examined whether potential differences in the composition of VOCs produced by herbivore-induced and MeJA-treated Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) were related to differential avian attraction. Results showed that the overall emission of volatiles produced by MeJA-treated and herbivore-induced trees did not differ and were higher than emissions of Control trees. However, MeJA-treated trees seem to exhibit a higher reaction and release several specific compounds, which may explain the lack of avian attraction to MeJA-treated trees observed in some previous studies. The tri-trophic interactions between plants, insects, and insect predators and parasitoids are often mediated by chemical cues. The attraction to herbivore-induced Plant Volatiles (HIPVs) has been well documented for arthropod predators and parasitoids, and more recently for insectivorous birds. The attraction to plant volatiles induced by the exogenous application of methyl jasmonate (MeJA), a phytohormone typically produced in response to an attack of chewing herbivores, has provided controversial results both in arthropod and avian predators. In this study, we examined whether potential differences in the composition of bouquets of volatiles produced by herbivore-induced and MeJA-treated Pyrenean oak trees (Quercus pyrenaica) were related to differential avian attraction, as results from a previous study suggested. Results showed that the overall emission of volatiles produced by MeJA-treated and herbivore-induced trees did not differ, and were higher than emissions of Control trees, although MeJA treatment showed a more significant reaction and released several specific compounds in contrast to herbivore-induced trees. These slight yet significant differences in the volatile composition may explain why avian predators were not so attracted to MeJA-treated trees, as observed in a previous study in this plant-herbivore system. Unfortunately, the lack of avian visits to the experimental trees in the current study did not allow us to confirm this result and points out the need to perform more robust predator studies.

AB  - Background Reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulator 1 (ROMO1) is a mitochondrial membrane protein that is essential for the regulation of mitochondrial ROS production and redox sensing. ROMO1 regulates ROS generation within cells and is involved in cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, senescence, and death. Our purpose is to investigates the impact of ROMO1 on the mitochondria during porcine embryogenesis. Results We found that high expression of ROMO1 was associated with porcine preimplantation embryo development, indicating that ROMO1 may contribute to the progression of embryogenesis. Knockdown of ROMO1 disrupted porcine embryo development and blastocyst quality, thereby inducing ROS production and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential. Knockdown of ROMO1 induced mitochondrial dysfunction by disrupting the balance of OPA1 isoforms to release cytochrome c, reduce ATP, and induce apoptosis. Meanwhile, ROMO1 overexpression showed similar effects as ROMO1 KD on the embryos. Overexpression of ROMO1 rescued the ROMO1 KD-induced defects in embryo development, mitochondrial fragmentation, and apoptosis. Conclusions ROMO1 plays a critical role in embryo development by regulating mitochondrial morphology, function, and apoptosis in pigs.

AB  - Northern Alaska is home to the largest designated wilderness landscape in the United States and among the world's largest remaining roadless regions. Under the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a semi-public corporation of the state of Alaska, proposed an industrial road to access the Ambler Mining District that would run approximately 320 km along the southern edge of the western Brooks Range, crossing federal, state, and Native Corporation lands. Two alternative routes are being considered that cross the Kobuk Preserve portion of Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve, with the northern route running outside of but adjacent to Gates of the Arctic Wilderness. Both Kobuk Preserve and Gates of the Arctic Wilderness are managed by the National Park Service to preserve wilderness character under existing federal law and agency policy. This study evaluates the potential impacts of both routes on wilderness character in the Kobuk Preserve and adjacent Gates of the Arctic Wilderness. We use a hierarchical conceptual framework to identify spatially explicit measures that show the potential impacts of the road on wilderness character. The impacts from each measure are combined using a weighting scheme to generate a series of maps that quantify the potential impacts of these two proposed routes. Our results show that both routes would degrade wilderness character within the Kobuk Preserve, and that the northern route, which is the state's preferred alternative for the road corridor, would have a significantly greater impact in terms of degrading wilderness character in the adjacent Gates of the Arctic Wilderness.

AB  - Twenty-four Tan sheep were randomly assigned into 4 groups to study the capability of tannin supplementation (0.5% in dietary DM) to lower blood lipid levels mediated through the gut microbiota. The control (NC) group was offered a basic diet, while the 3 treatment groups were the TA group, which received supplementary tannic acid (TA); GSPE group, which received supplementary procyanidins (GSPE); and the TA + GSPE group, which received supplementary TA and GSPE, besides being supplied with the basic diet for 8 weeks feeding. At the end of the experiment, the serum glucose, insulin, lipids, and cytokines were measured, and the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the colon were tested by GC/MS. Moreover, the jejunal and colonic microbiota were detected by 16S rRNA sequencing. Significant reductions in serum triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein were found in all treatments. The total SCFAs decreased, while the iso-acids were significantly increased in the TA and TA + GSPE groups. The sheep showed noticeably lower MCP-1 and higher COX-2 levels in the GSPE group than that in the NC group. IL-6 was increased in the sheep fed with TA. The tannins still caused a noticeable shift in the colonic microbiota, with significant increases in the abundances of Adlercreutzia and Oscillospira. Ultimately, it was found that the diet with low levels of tannin could reduce blood triacylglycerol and cholesterol in sheep significantly by affecting the composition of the gut microbiota.

AB  - Economic risks for livestock production are caused by volatile commodities and market conditions, but also by environmental drivers such as increasing uncertainties due to weather anomalies and global warming. These risks impact the gross margin of farmers and can stimulate investment decisions. For confined pig and poultry production, farmers can reduce the environmental impact by implementing specific adaptation measures (AMs) to reduce heat stress. A simulation model driven by meteorological data was used to calculate indoor climate for 1981 to 2017. This dataset was extrapolated for a projection in the year 2030. The heat stress was calculated for a business-as-usual livestock building and for several AMs. For 2030, the expected value of the reduction of the gross margin was calculated by EUR 3.98 a(-1) per animal place for the business-as-usual scenario. The results show that only energy-saving adaptation measures to reduce the inlet air temperature are appropriate to reduce the economic risk to the level of the year 1980 between EUR 0.03 a(-1) and EUR 1.02 a(-1) per animal place. The efficiency of other AMs to reduce heat stress is distinctly lower (between EUR 2.62 a(-1) and EUR 3.80 a(-1) per animal place). The results in this study can support the decision making of farmers concerning adaptation management and investments. It can inform agricultural policy design as well as technological development.

AB  - Sheep (Ovis aries) provide a vital source of protein and fibre to human populations. In coming decades, as the pressures associated with rapidly changing climates increase, breeding sheep sustainably as well as producing enough protein to feed a growing human population will pose a considerable challenge for sheep production across the globe. High quality reference genomes and other genomic resources can help to meet these challenges by: (1) informing breeding programmes by adding a priori information about the genome, (2) providing tools such as pangenomes for characterising and conserving global genetic diversity, and (3) improving our understanding of fundamental biology using the power of genomic information to link cell, tissue and whole animal scale knowledge. In this review we describe recent advances in the genomic resources available for sheep, discuss how these might help to meet future challenges for sheep production, and provide some insight into what the future might hold.

AB  - Soil health and fertility are indexed by soil organic carbon (SOC) content. Soil management through good agricultural practices that enhance and sustain SOC is vital for soil fertility. We examined the influence of soil fertility management strategies on SOC concentrations in different particle size fractions under a maize cropping system. We laid the experiment in a randomized complete block design, with 14 treatments replicated 4 times, and used the following inputs: inorganic fertilizer (Mf), maize residue +inorganic fertilizer (RMf), maize residue + inorganic fertilizer, and goat manure (RMfM), maize residue + goat manure + Dolichos Lablab L intercrop (RML), maize residue + Tithonia diversifolia + goat manure (RTiM) and maize residue + Tithonia diversifolia + phosphate rock (Minjingu) (RTiP) and a Control (no inputs) under reduced tillage (Mt) or conventional tillage (Ct). Soil samples were collected from two depths, 0-5 cm, and 5-15 cm. We determined the content of organic carbon in three physical fractionation: coarse fractions (1.7 mm, 500 mu m sieve), medium fractions (250 mu m and 90 mu m), and a fine fraction (75 mu m). Results showed that treatment with maize residues, goat manure, and legume intercrop (MtRML and CtRML) resulted in higher SOC in most fractions, irrespective of the soil depth. The SOC concentration significantly (p < 0.0001) differed across treatments and depth. It was followed by maize residue, goat manure, and inorganic fertilizer treatments, and the least was inorganic fertilizer treatment. This underpins the importance of manure application and crop residue retention in increasing SOC amounts. Reduced tillage did not influence the SOC amounts during the sampling period in the experimentation site. This study highlights the possibility of improving agricultural productivity by improving soil fertility through a combination of different agricultural soil fertility amendments in Sub-Saharan Africa.

AB  - ContextA long-term and highly dynamic understanding of terrestrial habitats is of extreme importance for enhancing wildlife conservation, habitat management, human-wildlife conflict mitigation in a timely manner. Currently, however, fine-resolution, multi-decade, and inter-annual habitat mapping remains rare due to high costs and data scarcity of wildlife presence/absence data. Moreover, the existing land cover datasets used for habitat mapping have high uncertainty in classification systems, which tend to lead to uneven spatial and discontinuous temporal domains.ObjectivesThe main objectives of this study aim to explore an ensemble method of long-term annual habitat mapping by integrating yearly land cover maps and wildlife habitat preferences derived by a meta-analysis, and to reveal interannual changes in habitat of China's wild elephant in the context of rapid economic development. Our work innovatively integrates long-term multi-temporal land use/cover data with multi-source environmental factors and applies meta-analysis techniques to overcome habitat mapping and change detection challenges.MethodsRandom forest (RF) models and hidden Markov model (HMM) were used to produce a highly-accurate annual land cover dataset based on Landsat time series images from 1988 to 2020. Combined with the meta-analysis-derived habitat preferences of wild elephants and multi-temporal remote sensed environmental factors, yearly habitat maps were generated by calculating the habitat suitability index (HSI).ResultsThe results indicated that the elephant habitat decreased significantly (alpha = 0.05), by 4135.93 km2 in their current range from 1988-2020. The area of habitat loss reached approximately 24.32% (1533.33 km2) and 19.04% (2602.20 km2) in the elephants' native (in the late 1980s) and newly expanded ranges, respectively. Moreover, the degree of habitat fragmentation was higher in the newly expanded range than in the native range. Over the past 33 years, habitat degradation mainly occurred before 2008 in the native range and after 2008 in the newly expanded range.ConclusionsThese findings demonstrated that the degree and process of wild elephants' habitat reduction were distinctly different between the native and newly expanded ranges; this highlights the need for different habitat conservation and management policies for different regions.

AB  - Early adversities, including prenatal drug exposure (PDE) and a negative postnatal emotional caregiving environment, impact children's long-term development. The protracted developmental course of memory and its underlying neural systems offer a valuable framework for understanding the longitudinal associations of pre- and postnatal factors on children with PDE. This study longitudinally examines memory and hippocampal development in 69 parent-child dyads to investigate how the early caregiving emotional environment affects children with PDE's neural and cognitive systems. Measures of physical health, drug exposure, caregiver stress, depression, and distress were collected between 0 and 24 months At age 14 years, adolescents completed multiple measures of episodic memory, and at ages 14 and 18 years, adolescents underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Latent constructs of episodic memory and the caregiving environment were created using Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Multiple regressions revealed a negative emotional caregiving environment during infancy was associated with poor memory performance and smaller left hippocampal volumes at 14 years. Better memory performance at 14 years predicted larger right hippocampal volume at 18 years. At 18 years, the association between the emotional caregiving environment and hippocampal volume was moderated by sex, such that a negative emotional caregiving environment was associated with larger left hippocampal volumes in males but not females. Findings suggest that the postnatal caregiving environment may modulate the effects of PDE across development, influencing neurocognitive development.

AB  - Simple Summary Feeding with a diet high in rice often results in several adverse effects for animals, such as ruminal acidosis, the translocation of endotoxin into the bloodstream, gastrointestinal barrier impairment, liver injures, and inflammation. A high rice grain-based diet also provides excess energy for human beings, which usually induces obesity via an miRNA-based mechanism. Currently, whether high-rice diets affect spleen growth and related molecular events remains unknown. Therefore, we take goats as an artiodactyl model to investigate the effects of feeding a highly concentrated diet, based on rice grains, on the growth and microRNA expression profiles in the goat spleen. Here, we first report about the splenic microRNA profile in artiodactyls fed a highly concentrated diet based on rice. Our results shed light on the miRNA-based regulatory mechanism that contributes to the development of high calorie-induced metabolic diseases in mammals. Several researchers have testified that feeding with diets high in rice grain induces subacute ruminal acidosis and increases the risk of gastrointestinal inflammation. However, whether diets high in rice grain affect spleen growth and related molecular events remains unknown. Therefore, the present study was conducted to investigate the effects of feeding a high-concentrate (HC) diet based on rice on the growth and microRNA expression profiles in goat spleen. Sixteen Liuyang black goats were used as an artiodactyl model and fed an HC diet for five weeks. Visceral organ weight, LPS (lipopolysaccharide) concentration in the liver and spleen, and microRNA expression were analyzed. The results showed that feeding an HC diet increased the heart and spleen indexes and decreased the liver LPS concentration (p < 0.05). In total, 596 microRNAs were identified, and twenty-one of them were differentially expressed in the spleens of goats fed with the HC diet. Specifically, several microRNAs (miR-107, miR-512, miR-51b, miR-191, miR-296, miR-326, miR-6123 and miR-433) were upregulated. Meanwhile, miR-30b, miR-30d, miR-1468, miR-502a, miR-145, miR-139, miR-2284f, miR-101 and miR-92a were downregulated. Additionally, their target gene CPPED1, CDK6, CCNT1 and CASP7 expressions were inhibited (p < 0.05). These results indicated that the HC diet promoted the growth of the heart and spleen. The HC diet also regulated the expression of miR-326, miR-512-3p, miR-30b, miR-30d, miR-502a and their target genes (CPPED1, CDK6 and CCNT1) related to the enhancement of splenocyte proliferation. The HC diet also modulated the expression of miR-15b-5p, miR-1468 and miR-92a, related to the suppression of splenocyte apoptosis.

AB  - Herbivores sharing host plants are often temporally and spatially separated, limiting direct interactions between them. Nevertheless, as observed in numerous aboveground study systems, they can reciprocally influence each other via systemically induced plant responses. In contrast, examples of such plant-mediated interactions between belowground herbivores are scarce; however, we postulated that they similarly occur, given the large diversity of root-interacting soil organisms. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the performance of cabbage root fly (Delia radicum) larvae feeding on the main roots of field mustard (Brassica rapa) plants whose fine roots were infected by the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita). Simultaneously, we studied the effects of M. incognita on D. radicum-induced defense responses and the accumulation of primary metabolites in the main root. We observed that almost 1.5 times as many D. radicum adults emerged from nematode-infected plants, indicating a facilitation effect of M. incognita infection. Although we observed increases in the accumulation of proteins and 2 essential amino acids, the strongest effect of nematode infection was visible in the defense response to D. radicum. We observed a 1.5 times higher accumulation of the defense-related phytohormone JA-Ile in response to D. radicum on nematode-infected plants, coinciding with a 75% increase in indole glucosinolate concentrations. Contrastingly, concentrations of aliphatic glucosinolates, secondary metabolites negatively affecting D. radicum, were 10% to 25% lower in nematode-infected plants. We hypothesize that the attenuated aliphatic glucosinolate concentrations result from antagonistic interactions between biosynthetic pathways of both glucosinolate classes, which was reflected in the expression of key biosynthesis genes. Our results provide explicit evidence of plant-mediated interactions between belowground organisms, likely via systemically induced responses in roots.
   Delia radicum larvae feeding on nematode-infected Brassica rapa roots have higher performance due to reduced chemical defenses and increased primary metabolite and protein content in infested plants.

AB  - The application of pig slurry as fertilizer in agriculture provides nutrients, but it can also contain veterinary medicines, including antibiotic residues (ABs), which can have an ecotoxicological impact on agroecosystems. Furthermore, uptake, translocation, and accumulation of ABs in crops can mobilize them throughout the food chain. This greenhouse study aims to assess AB uptake from soil fertilized with pig slurry and its phenotypical effects on Lactuca sativa L. The plants were cropped in loamy clay soil dosed at 140 kg total N/ha and containing antibiotics (lincomycin, sulfadiazine, oxytetracycline, and enrofloxacin) at different concentration levels (0, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg fresh weight, fw). Whereas sulfadiazine (11.8 ng/g fw) was detected in lettuce leaves at the intermediate doses (0.5 mg/kg), lincomycin and its transformation products (hydroxy/sulfate) were only detected at the 50 mg/kg fw dose. In addition, increased AB doses in the pig slurry resulted in decreased lettuce fresh weight and lipid and carbohydrate content and became lethal to lettuce at the highest AB con-centrations (500 mg/kg fw). Nevertheless, even at higher doses, the AB content in lettuce following pig-slurry fertilization did not pose any direct significant human health risk (total hazard quotient<0.01). However, the promotion of antimicrobial resistance in humans due to the intake of these vegetables cannot be ruled out.

AB  - .-Hunter counts of waterfowl and other game birds have been neglected as a source of information in long-term monitoring, with unknown errors in estimations calling for a verification of the performance of hunter counts in reflecting population dynamics. This study aimed to do so by comparing late-winter hunter counts of four Heron Ardea cinerea) in the Czech Republic with estimates generated by a better-defined and more rigorous monitoring scheme, the International Waterbird Census. While hunter counts were positively related to IWC-based population sizes in all species, annual population growth derived from hunter counts and the IWC did not correspond except in the Great Cormorant. Long-term trends derived from hunter counts were stronger than those derived from the IWC in all species. Whether hunter counts are valid for population monitoring of waterfowl and other game birds is not clear, mainly because of interspecific and temporal variations in counting effort and their likely dependence on population size. Revisions to the counting methodology and clarifying the monitoring protocol are encouraged for late-winter hunter counts to provide relevant information for the long-term population monitoring

AB  - Crop cultivation suitability plays a vital role in determining the distribution, quality, and production of crop and can be greatly affected by climate change. Therefore, evaluating crop cultivation suitability under climate change and identifying the factors influencing it can optimize crop cultivation layout and improve production and quality. Based on comprehensive datasets including geographical distribution points, climate data, soil characteristics, and topography, our study employed the MaxEnt model to simulate the potential distribution of Pu'er tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) cultivation suitability in Yunnan Province from 1961 to 2020. Furthermore, we assessed the consistency between the simulated suitable areas and the actual production of Pu'er tea. The results showed that precipitation of the warmest quarter, precipitation of the driest month, and average temperature in January were the three dominant environmental variables affecting the cultivation distribution of Pu'er tea. The high suitable areas for Pu'er tea cultivation in Yunnan Province were mainly distributed in the western and southern regions, accounting for 13.89% of the total area of Yunnan Province. The medium suitable areas are mainly distributed in the central and western regions of Yunnan Province, accounting for 20.07% of the total area of Yunnan Province. Over the past 60 years, the unsuitable area for Pu'er tea has increased, while the suitable area has shown a trend of migration to the southwest. Changes in precipitation and temperature were found to be the main drivers of the changes in the distribution of suitable areas for Pu'er tea. We also found a mismatch between the cultivation suitability and the actual production of Pu'er tea. Our study provides an accurate assessment and zoning analysis of the suitability of Pu'er tea cultivation in Yunnan Province, which can help optimize the layout of Pu'er tea cultivation and reduce potential climate risks.

AB  - Species C rotaviruses (RVC) are the second most common rotavirus species known to cause gastroenteritis in humans and pigs and with occurrence documented in cattle, dogs, ferrets, and sloth bears. Despite the hostspecific nature of RVC genotypes, cross-species transmission, reassortment, and recombination events are also documented. In the present study, we inferred the evolutionary history of globally circulating RVC strains, including time scale stasis, the most probable ancestral country, and the most probable source host using Bayesian methods implemented in BEAST v.1.8.4.The human-derived RVC strains were majorly monophyletic and further grouped into two lineages. The RVC strains derived from pigs were monophyletic for the VP1 and the remaining genes were classified into 2 to 4 groups based on the high posterior support. The root mean age for all the genes indicated the circulation of RVC for over 800 years. Overall, the time to Most Recent Common Ancestor of human RVC strains dated back to the beginning of the 20th century. The VP7 and NSP2 genes had the lowest rates of evolution compared to other genes. The majority of the genes of RVC showed their origin in Japan except for VP7 and VP4 genes in South Korea. The phylogeographic analysis with the country as a trait showed the role of Japan, China, and India in the dispersion of the virus. In the current study, significant transmission links between different hosts were analyzed for the first time using the host as a trait. Significant transmission links between pigs and other animal species as well as humans indicate possible transmission from the pig as a source host and suggest monitoring of proximity with animals.

AB  - An in silico approach was used for hydrolysis of sheep milk proteins (alpha-s1, alpha-s2, beta-casein, kappa-Cn, alpha-lactalbumin, and beta-lactoglobulin) by gastrointestinal enzymes in order to generate bioactive peptides (BAPs) that can inhibit ACE and DPP-IV. Sheep milk proteins showed higher similarity with goat milk proteins. These data were acquired via the Clustal Omega tool to perform sequence alignment analysis. The BIOPEP-UWM database was used to examine the ability of sheep milk protein sequences to generate BAPs, which included a description of their potential bioactivity as well as the frequency of fragments with specified activities. Using the "Enzyme(s) action" tool (BIOPEP-UWM), digestive enzymes pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, and three enzyme combinations were selected to computationally hydrolyze milk proteins for obtaining information about ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. Other online programs were used to test potential peptides for bioactivity, toxicity, and physicochemical properties. BAPs produced from PTC-hydrolyzed proteins were analyzed using a peptide ranker, and their inhibitory effects on ACE and DPP-IV were determined using molecular docking. Consequently, the results of molecular docking analysis show that the peptide PSGAW (alpha S1-Cn f155-159) binds to DPP-IV with binding energy (-8.9 kcal/mol). But in the case of ACE, two potential BAPs were selected: QPPQPL (beta-Cn f161-166) and PSGAW. These two BAPs revealed a higher binding affinity for ACE with a binding energy of -9.8 kcal/mol. Thus, the results showed that sheep milk proteins were a promising source of antidiabetic and hypotensive peptides. However, experimental and pre-clinical studies are necessary to assay their therapeutic effects. Practical applications Sheep milk proteins are known as a high-quality milk protein resource. Effective enzymatic hydrolysis of sheep milk proteins can release bioactive peptides and also release potential ACE and DPP-IV inhibitory peptides. This in silico study specifies a theoretical root for sheep milk proteins as a novel source of potential bioactive peptides and may offer guidance for invitro hydrolysis of proteins for the production of bioactive peptides valuable for human consumption.

AB  - While predators benefit from spatial overlap with their prey, prey strive to avoid predators. I used an individual-based simulation comprising sit-and-wait predators, widely foraging herbivores, and plants, to examine the link between predator ambush location, herbivore movement, and plant aggregation. I used a genetic algorithm to reach the best strategies for all players. The predators could ambush herbivores either inside or outside plant patches. The herbivores could use movement of varying directionality levels, with a change in directionality following the detection of plants. When the predators were fixed outside plant patches, the herbivores were selected to use a directional movement before plant encounter followed by a tortuous movement afterwards. When predators were fixed inside patches, herbivores used a continuous directional movement. Predators maintained within-patch positions when the herbivores were fixed to use the directional-tortuous movement. The predator location inside patches led to higher plant aggregations, by changing the herbivore movement. Finally, I allowed half of the predators to search for herbivores and let them compete with sit-and-wait predators located inside plant patches. When plants were clumped and herbivores used a directional-tortuous movement, with a movement shift after plant detection, ambush predators had the highest success relative to widely foraging predators. In all other scenarios, widely foraging predators did much better than ambush predators. The findings from my simulation suggest a behavioral mechanism for several observed phenomena of predator-prey interactions, such as a shorter stay by herbivores in patches when predators ambush them nearby, and a more directional movement of herbivores in riskier habitats.

AB  - Modified landscapes can restrict the movement of organisms, leading to isolation and reduced population viability, particularly for species with extensive home ranges and long-distance travel, such as white-lipped peccaries (WLPs, Tayassu pecari). Previous studies have indicated that forested areas favor WLP herd movements, but the impact of the non-forested areas on their genetic connectivity is unknown. In this study, we used land use and land cover maps and population genetic data to investigate the impact of non-forested matrices on WLP's genetic connectivity in the Pantanal floodplain and surrounding Cerrado plateau of central-west Brazil. We compared isolation-by-distance (IBD), isolation-by-barrier, and isolation-by-resistance models and tested 39 hypotheses within a modeling framework. Finally, we identified the optimal areas for ecological corridors based on the most effective landscape model. Barrier and landscape resistance were more strongly correlated with genetic relatedness than the IBD model. The model that received the most robust support considered only forest as habitat. All other classes formed a matrix that impeded gene flow, including agriculture, grassland, savannah, and paved and unpaved roads. WLP herds living in landscapes with reduced forest cover are more vulnerable to the effects of genetic isolation. To maintain gene flow, conservation programs should prioritize strategies that strengthen connections between habitats, including facilitating wildlife road-crossing structures and creating/restoring ecological corridors to link isolated habitat fragments.Abstract in Portuguese is available with online material.

Neste estudo, utilizamos mapas de uso e cobertura da terra e dados gen & eacute;ticos populacionais para investigar o impacto de matrizes n & atilde;o florestadas na conectividade gen & eacute;tica das queixadas na plan & iacute;cie alag & aacute;vel do Pantanal e no planalto adjacente do Cerrado no centro-oeste do Brasil. Comparamos modelos de isolamento por dist & acirc;ncia (IBD), isolamento por barreira e isolamento por resist & ecirc;ncia, testando 39 hip & oacute;teses dentro de uma estrutura de modelagem. Por fim, identificamos as & aacute;reas mais adequadas para corredores ecol & oacute;gicos com base no modelo de paisagem mais eficaz. Barreiras e resist & ecirc;ncia da paisagem apresentaram correla & ccedil;& atilde;o mais forte com a rela & ccedil;& atilde;o gen & eacute;tica do que o modelo IBD. O modelo com maior suporte considerou apenas a floresta como habitat, enquanto todas as outras classes formaram uma matriz que impedia o fluxo g & ecirc;nico, incluindo agricultura, pastagens, savana e estradas pavimentadas e n & atilde;o pavimentadas. Bandos de queixadas vivendo em paisagens com menor cobertura florestal s & atilde;o mais vulner & aacute;veis aos efeitos do isolamento gen & eacute;tico. Para manter o fluxo g & ecirc;nico, programas de conserva & ccedil;& atilde;o devem priorizar estrat & eacute;gias que fortale & ccedil;am as conex & otilde;es entre habitats, incluindo a facilita & ccedil;& atilde;o de estruturas para travessia de fauna em estradas e a cria & ccedil;& atilde;o/restaura & ccedil;& atilde;o de corredores ecol & oacute;gicos para conectar fragmentos de habitat isolados.

AB  - ObjectiveCaffeine has a wide range of effects in humans and other organisms. Caffeine activates p38 MAPK, the human homolog to the Hog1 protein that orchestrates the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) response to osmotic stress in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Caffeine has also been used as an inducer of cell-wall stress in yeast via its activation of the Pkc1-mediated cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. In this study, using immunodetection of phosphorylated Hog1, microscopy to score nuclear localisation of GFP-tagged Hog1 and a pseudohyphal growth assays, the effect of caffeine on the HOG-pathway and filamentous growth in yeast was studied.ResultsIt was found that caffeine causes rapid, strong and transient Hog1 dual phosphorylation with statistically significant increases at 20, 30 and 40 mM caffeine. In response to caffeine treatment Hog1 was also rapidly localized to the nucleus, supporting the caffeine-induced phosphorylation and activation of Hog1. We also found that caffeine inhibited the pseudohyphal/filamentous growth in diploid cells, but had no effect on invasive growth in haploids. Our data thus highlights that the HOG signalling pathway is activated by caffeine, which has implications for interpreting caffeine responses in yeast and fungi.

AB  - Airflow is a crucial variable for insect orientation and navigation, particularly in flying insects whose antennae have several setae with flexible sockets. Termites occasionally dispatch their soldier caste to the frontline of the nest or shelter tube opening as the colony is alerted by the disturbances or preparing the alates' nuptial flight. Hence, soldier termites' contact with airflow outside the nest is inevitable. We analyzed subterranean termite (Coptotermes formosanus) soldiers' sensitivity and orientation toward sustained airflow by manipulating the organs that bear setae with flexible sockets (e.g., antennal trimming, thorax pronotum covering). Four functional groups of soldier termites were tested against 10 min sustained airflow in three test chamber types. Soldier termites showed highly variable sensitivity and orientation toward airflow. The soldiers with antennae tended to orient and spend more time in the "region of interest" near the chamber opening. Adding airflow into the chamber increased movement. Significantly lower sensitivity toward the airflow source occurred when the antennae were trimmed and the pronotum was covered. When the antennae were trimmed, setae on the pronotum and other body parts might enhance the sensitivity to airflow, but their spatial ability was reduced as the soldiers demonstrated an alerting behavior by frequently bumping into the wall and opening their mandibles. The alerting behavior was significantly lower when air flowed into the chamber. These results demonstrated that setae with flexible sockets on the antennae and pronotum assisted soldier termites' orientation to the airflow and enhanced their spatial ability.

AB  - The process of composting is a feasible biological treatment for the recycling of organic wastes as an amendment or fertilizer. The objective of this study was to qualify an optimum consortium during 120 days composting for different beds (manure, sawdust, leaves and straw) in order to understand the process of composting. Different parameters such as total organic carbon, total nitrogen and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio were measured at the first, middle and end of composting period. The pH widely fluctuated (6.59-9.38) in rotten caw manure (RCM) consortia; but, the same trend has been observed in other consortia during the experiment. There were significant differences among the treatments with increase in organic matter loss (OM loss) and decrease of total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over time. During composting process, total nitrogen in RCM and Pantoea Agglomerans bacteria (PAB) consortia increased to 2.95% and 3.02%, respectively, which led to significant decrease in carbon-to-nitrogen ratio for some treatments at the end of experiment. Manure treated-consortia recorded numerically higher solution forms of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio normally ranged between standard limit of other studied beds. Manure-composted RCM that reached the standard values to efficiency improves soil and plant properties than other combinations. The new consortia will be able to reduce the required time for decomposition by supplying the nutrient enriched compost products.

AB  - If not carefully managed, harvesting of Antarctic krill risks disturbing the ecological balance of many Antarctic and sub-Antarctic sites where krill-dependent predators feed. One of the least disturbed sites anywhere within the Southern Ocean and one where krill fishing has so far been virtually non-existent is the South Sandwich Islands volcanic archipelago. Some of the main krill predators breeding at the South Sandwich Islands are penguins, with five species breeding on the islands, the dominant species of which is the chinstrap penguin. In this paper we report on the results of ARGOS PTT deployments during the chinstrap penguin chick-rearing period, using the recorded foraging trips to develop habitat models. Foraging habitats used by chinstrap penguins during this period were best characterised by distance from the colony and sea surface temperature and, using these two covariates, we predicted the chick-rearing foraging habitat use around all islands. We show that the provisions of the South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands Marine Protected Area ensure that chinstrap penguins, and other krill-dependent predators with similar foraging ranges, likely have robust protection during the summer. During the winter, when krill predators are likely to forage further offshore, seasonal sea ice provides a physical barrier to exclude the fishery, again ensuring the islands??? unique biodiversity receives strong protection. However, to the north of the marginal sea ice zone, competition between krill predators and the fishery could exist if the fishery were ever to explore new locations for resource extraction. We make a number of conclusions, including the need for winter tracking data to inform future management options.

AB  - Previous studies have reported a relationship between brain size and cognitive ability in several species. In this study, we found that adult chestnut thrushes were less exploratory than juveniles. Chestnut thrushes with a larger head volume were more likely to learn a novel skill than individuals with a smaller head volume. Furthermore, individuals with a larger head volume relative to their tarsus length learned the novel skill more quickly.
   Recent comparative studies on fish and mammals have suggested that brain size is associated with cognitive ability, such as problem solving and self-control; larger-brained individuals are assumed to have better cognitive ability. However, it remains largely unexplored whether larger-brained birds perform better in learning and spatial memory tests. Here, we used two experiments (novel skill learning task and spatial memory task) to examine whether head volume (proxy for brain size) could predict the learning performance and spatial performance in wild chestnut thrushes (Turdus rubrocanus). First, we found that chestnut thrushes with larger head volume were more likely to learn the novel skill than individuals with smaller head volume. Second, individuals with larger head volume relative to their tarsus (relative head volume) learned the novel skill faster. Age, sex, and exploratory tendency of individuals were not related to learning performance or learning speed. Finally, head volume, relative head volume and age was not associated with spatial performance in the spatial memory tasks. Together, these findings provided empirical evidences for the relationship between head volume and the ability of novel skill learning, and also provide a non-invasive method for studying the relationship between cognitive ability and head volume in other bird species.

AB  - Bioactive peptides (BAPs) have attracted considerable interest in scientific research due to their heterogeneity in sequence and structure, which underpins various biological functionalities. In this context, goat casein, an abundant by-product of the dairy industry, emerges as a valuable source of BAPs. The present study undertook a meticulous evaluation of the bioactive potentials of goat casein-derived peptides through an integrated approach combining computational simulations, high-throughput screening, and molecular docking techniques. The initial phase involved the enzymatic digestion of goat milk casein using trypsin, followed by the identification of peptides via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), uncovering a total of 597 peptides. Subsequent prioritization using the PeptideRanker algorithm identified 70 peptides exhibiting potential bioactivity, as denoted by scores above 0.8. Advanced screening employing the BIOPEP database and the AutoDock and CAMPR4 tools facilitated the elucidation of 16 antioxidant, 59 hypotensive, 63 hypoglycemic, 70 hypolipidemic, and 25 antimicrobial peptides. Molecular docking studies further elucidated the spontaneous nature of the interactions between the peptides and their respective receptors, predominantly mediated by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. Four peptides specifying all activities simultaneously were synthesized, and their activities were verified by in vitro experiments. These results not only highlight an effective strategy for the high-throughput screening of goat casein-derived peptides but also underscore the potential of utilizing casein as a viable source of functional food ingredients. This study thereby contributes significantly to the expanding field of functional food research, suggesting a sustainable approach to explore the potential of dairy by-products.

AB  - Diabetes, one of the most serious and common chronic metabolic diseases affecting people worldwide in the 21st century, has become a major problem that needs to be addressed urgently. This study was designed to elucidate the anti-diabetic effect of yak yogurt-derived Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum SHY130 on C57BL/6J mice fed high-fat diet and streptozotocin (HFD/STZ), and the potential regulatory mechanisms involved. Mice were divided into 3 groups: normal control, diabetes, and diabetes treated with L. plantarum SHY130 (SHY130). Treatment with L. plantarum SHY130 had a regulatory effect on blood glucose and clearly ameliorated insulin resistance in T2DM mice. L. plantarum SHY130 inhibited the reduction in beta-cell mass and alpha-cell proliferation in the pancreas and increased the expression of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptors GPR43 and GPR41 in the colon of T2DM mice. Furthermore, L. plantarum SHY130 treatment readjusted intestinal flora structure, enhanced the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria, such as Faecalibaculum, Odoribacter, Alistipes, and increased the levels of SCFAs in diabetic mice. In summary, L. plantarum SHY130 ameliorated hyperglycemia in HFD/STZ-induced diabetic mice by regulating the enteroinsular axis.

AB  - In regions with intensive livestock production, managing the environmental impact of manure is a critical challenge. This study, set in Flanders (Belgium), evaluates the effectiveness of integrating process intensification measures into the treatment of piggery manure to mitigate nitrogen (N) surplus issues. The research investigates the techno-economic benefits of implementing three key interventions: pure oxygen (PO) aeration, ammonia (NH3) stripping-scrubbing (SS) pretreatment, and tertiary treatment using constructed wetlands (CW), within the conventional nitrification-denitrification (NDN) process. Conducted at a full-scale pig manure treatment facility, our analysis employs steady-state mass balances for N and phosphorus (P) to assess the impact of these process intensification strategies. Findings indicate that the incorporation of advanced treatment steps significantly enhances the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the manure management system. Specifically, the application of PO aeration is shown to reduce overall treatment costs by nearly 4%, while the addition of an NH3 SS unit further decreases expenses by 1-2%, depending on the counter acid utilized. Moreover, the implementation of a CW contributes an additional 4% in cost savings. Collectively, these measures offer substantial improvements in processing capacity, reduction of by-product disposal costs, and generation of additional revenue from high-quality fertilising products. The study highlights the potential of advanced treatment technologies to provide economically viable and environmentally sustainable solutions for manure management in livestock-dense regions, emphasizing the cumulative economic benefit of a holistic approach to process intensification (10%).

AB  - Trypanosomatids are obligatory parasites, some of which are responsible for important human and animal diseases, but the vast majority of trypanosomatids are restricted to invertebrate hosts. Isolation and in vitro cultivation of trypanosomatids from insect hosts enable their description, characterization, and subsequently genetic and genomic studies. However, exact nutritional requirements are still unknown for most trypanosomatids and thus very few defined media are available. This mini review provides information about the role of different ingredients, recommendations and advice on essential supplements and important physicochemical parameters of culture media with the aim of facilitating first attempts to cultivate insect-infesting trypanosomatids, with a focus on monoxenous trypanosomatids.

AB  - Background Predicting invasiveness requires an understanding of the propensity of a given species to thrive in areas with novel ecological challenges. Evaluation of realized niche shift of an invasive species in its invasive range, detecting the main drivers of the realized niche shift, and predicting the potential distribution of the species can provide important information for the management of populations of invasive species and the conservation of biodiversity. The Australian redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, is a widow spider that is native to Australia and established in Japan, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia. We used ecological niche models and ordinal comparisons in an integrative method to compare the realized niches of native and invasive populations of this spider species. We also assessed the impact of several climatic predictor variables and human activity on this niche shift. We hypothesized that human impact is important for successful establishment of this anthropophilic species, and that climatic predictor variables may determine suitable habitat and thus predict invasive ranges. Results Our models showed that L. hasselti distributions are positively influenced by human impact in both of the native and invasive ranges. Maximum temperature was the most important climatic variable in predictions of the distribution of native populations, while precipitation seasonality was the most important in predictions of invasive populations. The realized niche of L. hasselti in its invasive range differed from that in its native range, indicating possible realized niche shift. Conclusions We infer that a preference for human-disturbed environments may underlie invasion and establishment in this spider species, as anthropogenic habitat modifications could provide shelters from unsuitable climatic conditions and extreme climatic stresses to the spiders. Because Australia and the countries in which the species is invasive have differing climates, differences in the availability of certain climatic conditions could have played a role in the realized niche shift of L. hasselti.

AB  - Astragalus is the most diverse genus within flowering plants with almost 2500 species, it is widely distributed around the world, very abundant in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, in central and western Asia, Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan, central Asia, Europe, Mongolia, Siberia, northeastern China, and Japan. In the American continent it is especially abundant in Canada, western United States, Mexico, and South America. Given the diversity of Astragalus species present in Mexico, the recent description of at least 15 new species for this country, the absence of a recent study that encompasses all the new findings and that the last general study for Mexico dates back almost 60 years, we consider necessary a new taxonomic synopsis that encompasses all the new information, which is presented here. The study records 102 species ofAstragalus in Mexico. This work is based essentially on the review of collections of specimen samples, type specimens in national and foreign herbaria, data bases, and the collection of specimens of this genus by the authors in the last 40 years and that covers practically the entire area where this genus is distributed in Mexico. In this study we recorded 102 species and 46 infraspecific taxa; seventy one species and 17 varieties are endemic to Mexico. Baja California (32), Chihuahua (25), Durango (23), Sonora (22), Coahuila (20), San Luis Potosi (17), Nuevo Leon (17), and Zacatecas (15) are the states with the greatest species richness. In Mexico, the diversity of Astragalus species decreases from north to south and from west to east. Most of the species of Astragalus in Mexico are distributed in the mountains, followed by low and arid plains, including coastal dunes, those last ones, exclusively of the northwestern region. There are no records of any Astragalus species in Campeche, Tabasco, Quintana Roo or Yucatan. The dichotomous keys are based mainly on the color of flowers, the shape of the pod and if the fruit is sessile or stipitate. For each species is included also a morphological description, habitat, altitudinal range, and distribution map.

AB  - Livestock is one of the country's important economic resources, nevertheless, an unsystematic livestock farm management system contributes to microplastic pollution. Microplastics (MPs) pollutant hurts the environment and human life, limited studies have been done in Malaysia's freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, this research was to determine the abundance of MPs in surface water and sediments from the nearby river and the last catchment pond of pig farm effluent in Paya Mengkuang and Sungai Tuang, Melaka. The concentration of MPs was compared with six water quality parameters (pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), dissolved oxygen (DO), total ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and chemical oxygen demand (COD). This study found that the average concentration of MPs was 487.38 particles/L and 50.96 particles/g for water and sediment samples consequently. This study showed a significant correlation between COD concentration and microplastic count in sediment samples. The source of microplastics in rivers is associated with anthropogenic activities such as unsystematic garbage disposal and poultry manure. The prevalence of microplastics in the environment of MPs could threaten the safety of resource utilization as MPs enter the food chain in aquatic ecology and pose a severe threat to aquatic organisms directly and subsequently to humans. Our study provides essential data on microplastic pollution in river estuaries and livestock farm areas.

AB  - The purpose of the study had to conducted an analasys on the physicochemical and fatty acid composition in white brined cheese obtained after technological processing by buffalo milk and addition of tobacco seed in different concentrations. Technological processing of buffalo milk to white brined cheese with different amounts of tobacco seed leads to technological losses of protein and fat as a result of proteolytic and lipolytic processes during the ripening process, which in turn leads to a decrease in the content of total solids in white brined cheeses with additives relative to the control group. The addition of tobacco seed supplements does not affect the technological process of ripening of white brined cheese, which is established and proven by the indicator of the degree of maturity. The total fat in the studied white brined cheeses increases significantly with the addition of the addition of tobacco seed (P <= 0.001). Fat in the control group of white brine cheeses was 10.8% and increased to 23.85% when the 7.5% supplement was applied. Protein decreased significantly (P <= 0.001) with the application of 7.5% tobacco seed to 9.18% compared to the control group of white brine cheese - 11.3%. The content of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in white brine cheese with the addition of different amounts of tobacco seed decreases, while the concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids increases with increasing additive content in white brine cheese, which is due to the high levels of unsaturated fatty acids in the additive.

AB  - Serum response factor (SRF) regulates differentiation and proliferation by binding to RhoA-actin-activated MKL or Ras-MAPK-activated ELK transcriptional coactivators, but the molecular mechanisms responsible for SRF regulation remain unclear. Here, we show that Nemo-like kinase (NLK) is required for the promotion of SRF/ELK signaling in human and mouse cells. NLK was found to interact with and phosphorylate SRF at serine residues 101/103, which in turn enhanced the association between SRF and ELK. The enhanced affinity of SRF/ELK antagonized the SRF/MKL pathway and inhibited mouse myoblast differentiation in vitro. In a skeletal muscle-specific Nlk conditional knockout mouse model, forming muscle myofibers underwent hypertrophic growth, resulting in an increased muscle and body mass phenotype. We propose that both phosphorylation of SRF by NLK and phosphorylation of ELKs by MAPK are required for RAS/ELK signaling, confirming the importance of this ancient pathway and identifying an important role for NLK in modulating muscle development in vivo.

AB  - Browsing enrichment may aid in developing species-specific behaviors for giraffes managed in zoos as a means of improving animal welfare. By nature, giraffes are tree-feeding animals, including tree bark, but the extent of food other than leaves as a form of browsing enrichment has not been well investigated. Therefore, to investigate the effectiveness of non-leaf foraging, three giraffes at the Kyoto City Zoo in Japan were observed for 228 h from May 2019 to February 2020. In conjunction with behavioral instantaneous sampling, tree use (landscape tree or enrichment branch) and plant part (leaves, twigs, or barks) were recorded by the 1-0 sampling method. There was no significant change in the foraging behavior on the leaves of enriched branches, nor was there any significant change in the foraging behavior of the giraffes, except for one animal in the deciduous phase. No significant changes were observed in rumination or other behaviors between the two phases. Although vegetation foraging behavior significantly decreased, except for one animal, dry hay foraging behavior significantly increased in all the animals during the deciduous phase. Some individuals also showed a significant increase in the foraging behavior for non-leafy parts of the enrichment branches (twigs and bark) during the deciduous phase. This suggests that in some tree species, giraffes forage on the bark and twigs to compensate for the loss of leaves during the deciduous phase, similar to feeding on hay or hay cubes as a substitute for tree leaves.

AB  - The intramuscular fat (IMF) content of yak beef is critical for determining its quality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a group of endogenous non-coding RNAs that have emerged as important factors in the regulation of IMF deposition. However, the molecular mechanisms through which circRNAs regulate IMF deposition, particularly in yaks, remain unclear. In the present study, a novel circRNA, circCDK14 (originating from the yak's CDK14 gene), was identified by sequencing and RNase R treatment. In our previous study, we successfully established a ceRNA network map and identified miR-4492-z, which interacts with circCDK14. Furthermore, using methylation prediction software, we predicted two genes, SRSF3 and hnRNP A1, that have a strong binding relationship with circCDK14; existing research has confirmed their close association with m6A methylation modifications. On the basis of these findings, we comprehensively evaluated the effects of circCDK14, miR-4492-z, SRSF3 and hnRNP A1 on the proliferation and differentiation of yak intramuscular pre-adipocytes using EdU, CCK-8, BODIPY, Oil Red O and qRT-PCR analyses. Mechanistically, the interaction between circCDK14 and miR-4492-z was validated using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and rescue experiments. RIP assays revealed the binding interaction of circCDK14 with SRSF3 and hnRNP A1. The MeRIP experiments showed modification of circCDK14 methylation, with SRSF3 and hnRNP A1 promoting the methylation and translocation of circCDK14 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In summary, our results suggest that m6A-modified circCDK14 plays a crucial role as an miR-4492-z sponge in regulating IMF deposition in yaks and that the nuclear export of circCDK14 correlates with the expression levels of SRSF3 and hnRNP A1. This study provides a theoretical basis for the improvement of yak meat quality and promotes the development of molecular yak breeding.

AB  - Tea is an economical and most widely used beverage across the globe owing to its unique fragrance and flavor. Plant microbe interaction has emerged as an important topic which got the attention of scientists to improve plant performance. Tea microbes remained a prominent research topic for scientists over the years as tea microbes helps in nutrient cycling and stress management which in turn improve the tea growth, yield and quality. The roots of tea plants are colonized by various microbes including arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), bacterial communities, and endophytes increase root growth, development and nutrient uptake which in turn improve tea growth, yield and quality. These microbes also increase the concentration of nutrients, amino acids, soluble proteins, flavonoids, catechuic acid, glucose, fructose, sucrose contents caffeine, and polyphenols concentration in tea plants. Besides this, these microbes also protect the tea plants from harmful pest and diseases which in turn leads to an appreciable improvement in plant growth and development. The most important goal of any farming system is to establish a system with production of maximum food while minimizing impacts on the environment. The present review article highlights the role of various microbes in improving the growth, yield and quality of tea plants. In addition, we also discussed the research gaps to improve our understanding about the role of tea microbes in improving tea growth, yield, pest and diseases resistance. We believe that this review will provide a better insight into the existing knowledge of tea microbes in improving tea growth and yield.

AB  - To elucidate the mechanism by which nerve growth factor (NGF) influences the LH secretory pathway in camelids, a series of experiments were done to determine the involvement of the hypothalamus (Experiment 1), the role of GnRH neurons (Experiment 2), and the effect of progesterone (Experiment 3) on the NGF-induced LH surge and ovulation in llamas. In Experiment 1, the declining phase of the NGF-induced LH surge was used to determine if the decline is a result of pituitary depletion or hypothalamic unresponsiveness. Female llamas were treated with NGF and, 7 h later, assigned to three groups and given a second dose of NGF (n=5), a dose of GnRH (n=5), or saline (n=6). The LH response was attenuated after the second dose of NGF vs GnRH. In Experiment 2, Fos expression (marker of neuronal activation) in GnRH neurons was examined in the hypothalamus of llamas after NGF or saline treatment (n= 3 per group). Despite an LH surge in the NGF group but not in the saline group, no differences were detected between groups in Fos/GnRH co-expression. In Experiment 3, llamas in low-, medium-, and high-plasma progesterone groups (n=4 per group) were treated with NGF. The NGF-induced LH surge did not differ among treatment groups. Results from the present study show that the induction of a preovulatory LH surge by NGF may be controlled by a novel pathway involving GnRH neuro-terminals downstream of the hypothalamus and is independent of progesterone influence.

AB  - Biological control methods may provide efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for curbing invasive weeds. Miconia calvescens DC (Melastomataceae) is an invasive weed of forest ecosystems on oceanic islands and one of the most invasive alien species. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify and assess the population dynamics of herbivorous insects that feed on M. calvescens in Brazil. The following species were found on M. calvescens plants at our three study locations: Apion sp. (Brentidae), Agrilus sp. (Buprestidae), Cryptorhynchus sp., Naupactus spp. (Curculionidae), Brasilaphthona sp., Cerotoma sp., Chrysodina sp., Colaspis sp., Diabrotica speciosa, and one unidentified species of the subfamily Cassidinae (Chrysomelidae). According to host specificity and impact caused to M. calvescens, the fruit-feeding Apion sp. and the stem-boring Cryptorhynchus sp. have high potential for this weed's biological control. Thus, our results provide useful information for potential biological control programmes for M. calvescens using herbivorous insects and will be helpful for companies working on natural weed control for this species.

AB  - The metabolome represents an important functional trait likely important to plant invasion success, but we have a limited understanding of whether the entire metabolome or targeted groups of compounds confer an advantage to invasive as compared to native taxa. We conducted a lipidomic and metabolomic analysis of the cosmopolitan wetland grass Phragmites australis. We classified features into metabolic pathways, subclasses, and classes. Subsequently, we used Random Forests to identify informative features to differentiate five phylogeographic and ecologically distinct lineages: European native, North American invasive, North American native, Gulf, and Delta. We found that lineages had unique phytochemical fingerprints, although there was overlap between the North American invasive and North American native lineages. Furthermore, we found that divergence in phytochemical diversity was driven by compound evenness rather than metabolite richness. Interestingly, the North American invasive lineage had greater chemical evenness than the Delta and Gulf lineages but lower evenness than the North American native lineage. Our results suggest that metabolomic evenness may represent a critical functional trait within a plant species. Its role in invasion success, resistance to herbivory, and large-scale die-off events common to this and other plant species remain to be investigated.

AB  - Frass, a byproduct of insect rearing, has become popular for its potential use in sustainable agriculture. The rapid growth of insect production results in an increased frass output. This study examined the effects of frass as soil amendment on plant growth and resistance to insect herbivory. In greenhouse experiments, Brassica rapa L. (Brassicaceae), was grown in unamended soil (NoFrass; control) or soil amended with frass (2 g kg-1) from larvae of black soldier fly (BSFF), Hermetia illucens L. (Diptera: Stratiomyidae), or yellow mealworm (MWF), Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Frass was applied as raw, incubated, or composted frass before seed germination. Plant growth and performance were measured of larvae of root-feeding Delia radicum L. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae) and shoot-feeding Plutella xylostella L. (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae). Initially, raw BSFF and MWF reduced the growth of B. rapa and resulted in a smaller leaf area than NoFrass. However, over time, a notable trend emerged. Whereas the difference in leaf area between MWF and NoFrass disappeared, BSFF consistently resulted in a smaller leaf area than MWF and NoFrass. Raw BSFF reduced D. radicum larval survival and pupal biomass and larval survival of P. xylostella. In contrast, raw MWF increased larval survival and biomass of D. radicum and the survival of P. xylostella larvae. Interestingly, incubation of frass in the soil for 16 days before seed germination removed plant growth inhibition and increased plant leaf area, especially for MWF compared to NoFrass. In addition, composting MWF increased leaf growth. Therefore, frass may be used as a sustainable and natural alternative to conventional organic fertilisers, promoting plant growth and enhancing resistance to herbivory. Our results indicate that soil amendment with raw BSFF may negatively impact herbivore performance, whereas raw MWF may enhance herbivore performance.

AB  - Simple Summary This study focused on 50 Hu sheep from Gansu to analyze the genetic diversity and kinship relationships within the population and to construct family pedigrees. Candidate genes related to growth development and high reproductive performance in Hu sheep were identified. These findings provide a reference for future Hu sheep breeding, genetic evaluation, and population utilization.Abstract This research is designed to examine the genetic diversity and kinship among Hu sheep, as well as to discover genes associated with crucial economic traits. A selection of 50 unrelated adult male Hu sheep underwent genotyping with the SNP50K BeadChip. Seven indicators of genetic diversity were assessed based on high-quality SNP data: effective population size (Ne), polymorphic information content (PIC), polymorphic marker ratio (PN), expected heterozygosity (He), observed heterozygosity (Ho), effective number of alleles, and minor allele frequency (MAF). Plink software was employed to compute the IBS genetic distance matrix and detect runs of homozygosity (ROHs), while the G matrix and principal component analysis were performed using GCTA software. Selective sweep analysis was carried out using ROH, Pi, and Tajima's D methodologies. This study identified a total of 64,734 SNPs, of which 56,522 SNPs remained for downstream analysis after quality control. The population displayed relatively high genetic diversity. The 50 Hu sheep were ultimately grouped into 12 distinct families, with families 6, 8, and 10 having the highest numbers of individuals, each consisting of 6 sheep. Furthermore, a total of 294 ROHs were detected, with the majority having lengths between 1 and 5 Mb, and the inbreeding coefficient FROH was 0.01. In addition, 41, 440, and 994 candidate genes were identified by ROH, Pi, and Tajima's D methods, respectively, with 3 genes overlapping (BMPR1B, KCNIP4, and FAM13A). These results offer valuable insights for future Hu sheep breeding, genetic assessment, and population management.

AB  - Livestock farm is a major source of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) pollution. ARGs can directly enter the environment through runoff and air deposition. The impact extent and the driving factors require further investigation to inform effective policies and actions to mitigate their spread. This study investigated a smallholder pig farm and its surrounding areas to understand the spread of ARGs. Topsoil samples were collected from 56 different sites within one kilometer of the farm, and a comprehensive analysis was conducted to reveal effects of soil properties, antibiotic residues, microbiome, mobilome on the variation of typical ARGs. The results confirmed that the ARGs reduced exponentially with increasing distance from the farm, with a goodness of fit (R2) of 0.7 for total ARGs. For tetracyclines (TC) and sulfonamides (SA) resistance genes, the fitting R2 exceeded 0.9. Model estimates allowed for quantitative comparisons of in-farm increments, out-farm background levels, and spread abilities of ARGs with distinct resistance mechanisms. SA-specific resistance genes (SRGs, 0.097 copies/16S rRNA gene) and TC-specific resistance genes (TRGs, 0.036 copies/16S rRNA gene) showed higher within-farm increases compared to multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs, 0.020 copies/16S rRNA gene). MDRGs, however, had a higher background level and a greater impact distance (0.18 km, 4.4 times the farm radius). Additionally spread abilities of TRGs varied by resistance mechanism, with ribosome protection proteins showing greater spread than TC inactivating enzymes and TC efflux pumps, likely due to different fitness costs. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling indicated that changes in bacterial community composition and mobilome are primary factors influencing ARGs variation during their spread. Abiotic factors like soil nutrients and antibiotics also selectively enriched ARGs within the farm. These findings provide insights into the ARGs dissemination and could inform strategies to prevent their spread from smallholder livestock farms.

The functional response in habitat selection posits animals adjust their habitat selection to availability, but population-level responses to availability may differ from individual responses. Generalized functional response (GFR) models account for functional responses by including fixed effect interactions between habitat availability and selection. Population-level resource selection functions instead account for individual selection responses to availability with random effects. We compared predictive performance of both approaches using a functional response in elk (Cervus canadensis) selection for mixed forest in response to road proximity, and avoidance of roads in response to mixed forest availability. We also investigated how performance changed when individuals responded differently to availability from the rest of the population. Individual variation in road avoidance decreased performance of both models (random effects: beta = 0.69, 95% CI 0.47, 0.91; GFR: beta = 0.38, 95% CI 0.05, 0.71). Changes in individual road and forest availability affected performance of neither model, suggesting individual responses to availability different from the functional response mediated performance. We also found that overall, both models performed similarly for predicting mixed forest selection (F-1,F- 58 = 0.14, p = 0.71) and road avoidance (F-1,F- 58 = 0.28, p = 0.60). GFR estimates were slightly better, but its larger number of covariates produced greater variance than the random effects model. Given this bias-variance trade-off, we conclude that neither model performs better for future space use predictions.

AB  - Simple Summary It is common for sheep to have tails docked as lambs, predominantly to reduce flystrike. It is recommended that tails are docked long enough to cover the vulva in ewes and at a similar length in males. There are many ways that tail length in sheep is described and measured, but there is a lack of congruency across the different description and measurement methods. This study aimed to investigate the reliability of three common ways to measure and describe docked sheep tail length, using 99 Merino ewes, 51 yearlings (1.4-year-olds) and 48 weaners (5-month-olds). Length and vulva cover assessment were the methods with the most reliable results, joint palpation was the least reliable method of tail measurement. The tails in this sample that were of the recommended length, covering the vulva, measured 10.8-16.2 mm longer than tails not covering the vulva, at 63.7 mm for weaners and 57.6 mm for yearlings on average, and contained more than two coccygeal vertebrae. This research presents two reliable methods of sheep tail measurement for two age groups and provides a foundation for future research into method refinement and tail length monitoring. Docking sheep tails is a long-standing practice that, when done at the recommended length, reduces the risk of flystrike. The recommended length is to cover the vulva of ewes and to a similar length in males. This length is often equated to three coccygeal joints left intact, and there are many other ways the recommended length is described by researchers, industry, and government. This study compared the observer consistency and retest consistency using three different tail length measurement methods: vulva cover assessment, length (mm), and joint palpation. The tails of 51 yearling and 48 weaner Merino ewes were assessed by two observers. Length and vulva cover assessment methods provided the most reliable results, and joint palpation was the least reliable method of tail measurement. In the sample, tails that covered the vulva of yearlings and weaners measured 57.6 mm (n = 14) and 63.7 mm (n = 30) on average, respectively, and contained two coccygeal joints (more than two coccygeal vertebrae). Tails that did not cover the vulva of yearlings and weaners measured 41.3 mm (n = 36) and 52.8 mm (n = 17) on average, respectively, and had less than two coccygeal joints. The two most reliable methods enable valid comparison to the best practice recommendations.

AB  - Plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and their attendant ants are part of a mutualistic, facultative and generalized interaction. The final balance of this interaction can vary greatly over time and space, making the outcome context-dependent. In this study, we investigated how nectar volume and concentration mediate ant attraction and ant predatory activity on a legume species, as well as evaluate their daily variation in a seasonally dry tropical forest in northeastern Brazil. Our study model was the tree species Pityrocarpa moniliformis (Benth.) Luckow & R. W. Jobson (Fabaceae), and we used simulated herbivores (termites) to assess the predatory activity of ants. We found that ants interacted more on the EFNs of plants that produce higher nectar volumes, but not to those producing higher nectar concentrations. Ant predatory activity was not influenced by the volume or concentration of extrafloral nectar. Regarding the daily variation in nectar secretion, we found higher volumes secreted at nighttime, but no difference in nectar concentrations between day and night. Ant predatory activity was similar throughout the day and night. Our results indicate that ants are more sensitive to variations in nectar volume than concentration and that the volume secreted is higher at night; both probably due to the water restriction of the Caatinga. However, ant predatory activity is not related to nectar secretion volume or concentration, highlighting the complexity of mechanisms mediating the interaction between EFN-bearing plants and ants.

AB  - Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor preventing estrogen synthesis from testosterone, is used as an adjuvant therapy in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients. However, like other aromatase inhibitors, it induces many side effects, including impaired cognition. Despite its negative effect in humans, results from animal models are inconsistent and suggest that letrozole can either impair or improve cognition. Here, we studied the effects of chronic letrozole treatment on cognitive behavior of adult female BALB/c mice, a relevant animal model for breast cancer studies, to develop an appropriate animal model aimed at testing therapies to mitigate side effects of letrozole. In Morris water maze, letrozole 0.1 mg/kg impaired reference learning and memory. Interestingly, most of the letrozole 0.1 mg/kg-treated mice were able to learn the new platform position in reversal training and performed similar to control mice in a reversal probe test. Results of the reversal test suggest that letrozole did not completely disrupt spatial navigation, but rather delayed acquisition of spatial information. The delay might be related to increased anxiety as suggested by increased thigmotactic behavior during the reference memory training. The learning impairment was water maze-specific since we did not observe impairment in other spatial tasks such as in Y-maze or object location test. In contrast, the dose of 0.3 mg/kg did not have effect on water maze learning and facilitated locomotor habituation and recognition in novel object recognition test. The current study shows that letrozole dose-dependently modulates behavioral response and that its effects are task-dependent.

AB  - We investigated how developmental stage affects seed traits, including the relative level of desiccation tolerance of Quercus serrata. We tested the hypothesis that the relative level of desiccation tolerance is a quantitative trait associated with seed development and that a maximum relative level of desiccation tolerance is reached during development. Seed growth and physiological traits of Q. serrata from a subtropical forest were examined in detail during the developmental process. During seed development, the relative level of desiccation tolerance and other seed traits of Q. serrata varied. Dry matter accumulation in seed components increased rapidly beginning in mid-August, and moisture content declined. At the peak period of seed dispersal in late September, seeds were fully mature, with 100% germination. Relative level of desiccation tolerance increased up to the point of peak dispersal; however, at this time seeds were still recalcitrant. Post-mature development was accompanied by further increases in seed dry matter and decreases in moisture content, which led to a decrease in seed germination and relative level of desiccation tolerance. Our results suggest that in species with recalcitrant seeds, the relative level of desiccation tolerance and other seed traits are quantitative at the intraspecific level. The relative level of desiccation tolerance for recalcitrant seeds does not increase infinitely during phase II of development. There is a maximum relative level of desiccation tolerance in recalcitrant seeds within a species.

AB  - Simple Summary: Succinate is an important product of the fermentative metabolism of dietary fiber, and similar to propionate, high levels of succinate in the gut modulate the body's inflammatory response, glucose tolerance, and lipid metabolism. Our study showed that the addition of 1% succinate to pig diets promoted growth and fat deposition capacity without affecting feed intake, remodeled the fatty acid content of the longissimus dorsi muscle, and consequently improved meat quality. Further, we isolated and cultured primary porcine preadipocytes. The results showed that succinate increased the expression of genes related to adipogenic differentiation while decreasing the levels of genes related to lipolysis and promoting the formation of cellular lipid droplets. Mechanistically, dietary supplementation with succinate increases succinylation modification in adipose tissue to promote facilitated lipogenesis. This suggests that it is feasible and important to improve fatty acids and meat quality in porcine muscle through dietary succinate supplementation. Succinate, one of the intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is now recognized to play a role in a broad range of physiological and pathophysiological settings, but its role in adipogenesis is unclear. Our study used Bama miniature pigs as a model to explore the effects of succinate on performance, meat quality, and fat formation. The results showed that adding 1% succinate significantly increased the average daily gain, feed/gain ratio, eye muscle area, and body fat content (p < 0.05), but had no effect on feed intake. Further meat quality analysis showed that succinate increased the marbling score and intramuscular fat content of longissimus dorsi muscle (LM), while decreasing the shear force and the cross-sectional area of LM (p < 0.05). Metabolomics analysis of LM revealed that succinate reshaped levels of fatty acids, triglycerides, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids in LM. Succinate promotes adipogenic differentiation in porcine primary preadipocytes. Finally, dietary succinate supplementation increased succinylation modification rather than acetylation modification in the adipose tissue pool. This study elucidated the effects of succinate on the growth and meat quality of pigs and its mechanism of action and provided a reference for the role of succinate in the nutrition and metabolism of pigs.

AB  - Microbial communities in tomb soil change during archaeological excavation, and these changes can accelerate the deterioration of buried heritage. In this study, a high-throughput sequencing method was used to analyze the soil microbial diversity of tomb M88 from the Sujialong Cultural Property after careful excavation in the laboratory. The phylum of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria and Ascomycota predominated in the tomb soil, and the dominant genera, Pseudarthrobacter, Penicillium, and Cladosporium, showed the potential to degrade residual relics in the tomb soil. These findings will help to explore the process of microbial degradation in buried heritage during long-term archaeological excavation and improve careful excavation procedures in the laboratory for further conservation. Additionally, numerous plant species were identified in the tomb soil, and most of the plants belonged to the native vegetation species. However, the identified dominant species, Glycine, Angelica, and Hippophae, should be from residual heritage rather than native species, which may provide clues for the study of funeral customs and cultural exchange in the Zeng State.

AB  - Clusterin (CLU) is a glycoprotein that contains alpha- and 13-chains. CLU exerts multifunctional activities and plays a role in different cell signaling pathways that are associated with various diseases such as proteotoxic and oxidative stress, as well as cell death and survival. However, its role in marine teleost fish remains unclear. Therefore, the present study was carried out to characterize and investigate the immune responses and antiapoptotic effects of CLU of the big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis) (HaCLU) on oxidative stressinduced cell death. The HaCLU open reading frame was 1389 bp long and encoded a protein with 462 amino acids, a molecular weight of 51.28 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.41. In-silico results demonstrated that HaCLU has a signal peptide in the 1-29 amino acid region, while the alpha- and 13-chains were in the 34-227 and 228-455 amino acid regions, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment clarified the low homology of the alpha-chain with other orthologs. The highest HaCLU mRNA expression level was observed in the liver, followed by the heart, spleen, and brain tissues of healthy big-belly seahorses. Further, HaCLU mRNA expression level was elevated in the liver in response to different stimuli, including lipopolysaccharides, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, Edwardsiella tarda, and Streptococcus iniae. HaCLU potentiates cell viability and weakens chromatin condensation in the nucleus of FHM cells following H2O2-induced oxidative stress and subsequent cell death. HaCLU overexpression resulted in a reduced Bax/Bcl-2 mRNA expression ratio.

AB  - The hydrological rhythm of floodplain wetlands affected by natural climate variability and human activities is the driving factor affecting the distribution of herbivorous geese habitats. It has always been challenging to determine its long-term variation, due to the lack of data on species distribution and broad wetland observation. In this study, the key normalized difference vegetation index threshold range suitable for herbivorous geese, greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons, GWG) and bean geese (Anser fabalis, BG), was discovered by combining GPS tracking data with Landsat satellite data. The suitable habitat area and distribution variation characteristics of GWG and BG from 1982 to 2020 were extracted based on the threshold range. The results showed that the suitable habitat area had a declining trend after 2003, that the distribution had moved toward the lake's center, and that its average elevation had decreased by around 1 m, particularly during the arrival period. The change of herbivorous geese habitat is caused by the continuous drying of Poyang Lake. The study can offer a rational scientific foundation for wetland waterbird protection and watershed hydrological management.

AB  - Simple Summary: This study investigates the use of Chongming goats for optimizing laparoscopic ovum pick-up (LOPU) and in vitro embryo production (IVEP). Key metrics such as the recovery rate of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs), the number of ovarian follicles, and the quality of collected COCs are assessed to refine estrus synchronization and superovulation techniques. Additionally, the study examines the effectiveness of LOPU using indicators like cleavage and blastocyst rates to enhance IVEP efficiency, aiming to develop a robust LOPU technology system for small ruminants. The application of laparoscopic ovum pick-up (LOPU) and in vitro production of embryos (IVEP) technologies has opened up a new path for purebred breeding and breed improvement in goats. However, due to the complexity of the procedures and multiple influencing factors, these technologies have not been widely adopted in goat production. This study explores factors affecting the efficiency of LOPU in goats by comparing the use of controlled internal drug release (CIDR) for estrus synchronization, conventional FSH versus long-acting recombinant ovine FSH (R-FSH) for superovulation, and the timing of LOPU at 48 h, 60 h, and 72 h of follicular development. The metrics evaluated included the recovery rate of cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs), the average number of ovarian follicles, the average number of COCs, and the average number of available COCs. The results demonstrated that the efficiency of LOPU was significantly higher with two doses of R-FSH compared to the conventional FSH superovulation protocol and the control group (p < 0.05), with two doses of R-FSH providing a higher LOPU efficiency than one dose (p < 0.05). Using CIDR for estrus synchronization showed no significant difference in LOPU efficiency compared to the non-CIDR group. Similarly, the efficiency of LOPU showed no significant difference between the hormone treatments at 48 h, 60 h, and 72 h. By exploring and optimizing the factors influencing LOPU, we ultimately established a LOPU technology system for goats that meets the production needs of small ruminants.

AB  - Synopsis During feeding in many terrestrial vertebrates, the tongue acts in concert with the hyoid and pectoral girdle. In frogs, these three elements are interconnected by musculature. While the feeding mechanics of the anuran tongue are well-studied, little is known of how the motions of the tongue relate to the movements of the skeleton or how buccal structures move following closure of the mouth. Although features such as the pectoral girdle and hyoid are not externally visible in frogs, their motions can be tracked in X-ray video. We used XROMM (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology) techniques to track the 3D movements of the tongue, hyoid apparatus, pectoral girdle, skull, and jaw during the feeding cycle of the cane toad, Rhinella marina. We show how the movements of these elements are integrated during tongue protrusion and prey capture, as well as during prey transport, swallowing, and recovery. Our findings suggest that the hyoid apparatus is important both for prey manipulation and swallowing. The tongue consistently stretches posterior to the skull during swallowing, often more than it stretches during protrusion to reach the prey. Feeding kinematics are similar between individuals, and the kinematics of unsuccessful strikes generally resemble those of successful strikes. Our data also provide a new perspective on the potential role of the pectoral girdle, an element with a predominant locomotor function, during feeding events. This work raises new questions about the evolution of feeding in frogs, as well as how the diversity of pectoral and buccal anatomy observed across anurans may influence feeding kinematics.

AB  - Simple Summary
   In Central Italy Apennine sheep represent the most bred species, which is still bred today in a semi-extensive manner, exploiting the natural pastures. However, the increase in summer aridity induces a decrease in the pastoral value of the grasslands, resulting in poor animal performance and production. Only research-derived innovation can support farmers' economy in order to maintain the pastoral activities. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of cereals supplementation on body condition score and metabolic hormones profile in milking ewes grazing on semi-natural pastures on mid mountain rangelands. Our findings showed that feed supplementation preserves grazing ewes from the usual lowering of the body state associated to the lactation period and sustains the metabolic status of animals. Taken together, our results could represent a helpful instrument in the farm management practices.
   This study aimed to investigate the effects of feed supplementation on body condition score (BCS) and different metabolic hormones concentration in lactating sheep reared in Italian Central Apennine pastures during the grazing summer period. In this study, 24 Comisana x Appenninica pluriparous ewes from June until August were divided into two homogenous groups: the control group (UNS) was free to graze, while the other group (SUP), in addition to grazing, was supplemented with 600 g/day/head of cereals. At the start of the supplementation and at an interval of 9-10 days until the end of experimentation, BCS evaluation and blood withdrawal to assay nesfatin-1, insulin, glucagon, leptin, triiodothyronine and cortisol levels were performed. Univariable analysis showed no remarkable differences between the groups, while multivariable analysis suggested that the UNS group was characterized by a lower BCS and greater nesfatin-1 than the SUP group. These findings can be considered in relation to milk production, which shows a clear better persistence in the SUP group. Our results indicate that nutritional supplementation has protected ewes from the usual lowering of the body state linked to lactation and provides a good maintenance of milk production, determining also a better overall body and metabolic state of the animals, which is important at the beginning of the sexual season.

AB  - The aim of this research was to assess the simultaneous effect of zeolite and bischofite on estruvite production in an anaerobic digester treating pig slurry as substrate. Three ratios (5:1, 6:1 and 7:1) of Mg-P were used for evaluating the effect of only bischofite on anaerobic digestion. For assessing the simultaneous effect of zeolite and bischofite on anaerobic digestion, three mass ratios of zeolite:bischofite (1, 5 and 10%) were used. As results, bischofite as Mg+2 source served to decrease the total phosphorous (TP) concentration in the anaerobic digestion of pig manure without affecting the maximum methane production rate or methane yield of the system. An average 82.5% TP removal was found in the reactors with bischofite during the first 5 days of digestion. Nevertheless, bischofite increased the lag-phase of the system. The simultaneous presence of zeolite and bischofite (1% ratio with respect to bischofite) caused a TP removal of 65.6% and increased the methane yield by up to 19.9% compared to a system without zeolite or bischofite. Thus, it is feasible to use bischofite and zeolite as enhancers for the simultaneous production of biogas and struvite inside an anaerobic digester treating piggery wastewater.

AB  - Follicle development in dairy goats is lower after induced estrus during the non-breeding season, reducing conception rates and challenging year-round milk supply. This study investigated follicle development during the breeding and non-breeding seasons and explored molecular mechanisms for variations in the proportions of follicles of different sizes using ovarian RNA-seq and in vitro experiments. Induced estrus during the non-breeding season used a simulated breeding season short photoperiod and male effect methods, while the male effect method was used during the breeding season. This study identified an increase in follicle size during the breeding season and performed RNA-seq on ovaries to explore the underlying causes. The RNA-seq analysis elucidated pathways associated with cellular and hormonal metabolism and identified adenylyl cyclase 5 (ADCY5) as a key differentially expressed gene. In vitro experiments demonstrated that interfering with ADCY5 in ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) reduced steroid synthesis. Conversely, the overexpression of ADCY5 increased steroid synthesis. ADCY5 affects the biological function of GCs and consequently influences follicle development through the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (MAPK) pathways. Overall, our findings demonstrate that follicle development in dairy goats differs between the breeding and non-breeding seasons and that the differential expression levels of the ADCY5 gene contribute to this discrepancy.

AB  - Many Apiospora species have been isolated from bamboo plants - to date, 34 bambusicolous Apiospora species have been recorded. They are known as saprophytes, endophytes, and plant pathogens. In this study, 242 bambusicolous Apiospora were isolated from various bamboo materials (branches, culms, leaves, roots, and shoots) and examined using DNA sequence similarity based on the internal transcribed spacer, 28S large subunit ribosomal RNA gene, translation elongation factor 1-alpha, and beta-tubulin regions. Nine Apiospora species (Ap. arundinis, Ap. camelliae-sinensis, Ap. hysterina, Ap. lageniformis sp. nov., Ap. paraphaeosperma, Ap. pseudohyphopodii sp. nov., Ap. rasikravindrae, Ap. saccharicola, and Ap. sargassi) were identified via molecular analysis. Moreover, the highest diversity of Apiospora was found in culms, and the most abundant species was Ap. arundinis. Among the nine Apiospora species, two (Ap. hysterina and Ap. paraphaeosperma) were unrecorded in Korea, and the other two species (Ap. lageniformis sp. nov. and Ap. pseudohyphopodii sp. nov.) were potentially novel species. Here, we describe the diversity of bambusicolous Apiospora species in bamboo organs, construct a multi-locus phylogenetic tree, and delineate morphological features of new bambusicolous Apiospora in Korea.

AB  - Citizen science activities were performed using sheep as an animal model and involving 252 students aged between 9 and 11 years. The study focused on three pillars: hill/mountain landscape biodiversity, animal welfare and the social utility of research. Two types of tests-"attitude questionnaires" (AQs) and "maximum performance tests" (MPTs)-were administered. The AQ was administered before and at the end of the project to compare the children's sensitivity to the treated topics and to assess their awareness of the project's pillars. For each AQ item children expressed their agreement/disagreement by choosing from five response modes. The MPT aim was to evaluate if children had understood the explained topics by true/false options in respect to a sentence. The correlations between MPT scores and school evaluations for science subjects were analyzed. Among the fifteen AQ items specific to the pillars, four items related to biodiversity, three items related to animal welfare and two items related to the social utility of research, showing a significant difference (p < 0.05) for the second AQ's responses. Two items showed sex-related differences. The analysis of the data from the MPT showed that the didactic methodology used was effective and improved the position of most children by bringing them into higher science evaluation groups.

AB  - Intrataxonomic differences in terms of angiosperm suitability for herbivorous insects stem from variables such as plant structure, palatability, and chemistry. It has not yet been elucidated whether these differences also occur in terms of the bryophyte's suitability to bryophages. Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw. is a morphologically variable moss species frequently inhabited or fed by insects. In this investigation, we offered five morphotypes of H. cupressiforme to two bryophagous species of Byrrhidae (Coleoptera) to reveal whether the intrataxonomic variability affects beetles' preferences. The morphotypes were offered with preserved and removed spatial structures. There were no significant differences in morphotype preferences when spatial structures were preserved, although during the daytime, the beetles moved from the flat morphotype to the usual and turgid morphotypes. The beetles preferred the turgid morphotype when the spatial structures were removed. The results suggest that the spatial structure variations in the H. cupressiforme complex are accompanied by different chemical, physiological, or microscopic morphological profiles that are recognized by the bryophagous insects. Phylogenetic and epigenetic analyses can reveal multiple differences within the H. cupressiforme complex. Their interconnection with information about the preferences of bryophagous insects can help us to elucidate which of these differences are ecologically relevant.

AB  - The aim of this research was to assess genetic parameters for first lactation production and reproduction traits in Murrah buffaloes by employing additive and maternal effects. Data on pedigree and specific traits of 640 Murrah buffaloes were gathered from 1997 to 2020. These traits encompassed first lactation milk yield (FLMY), 305-day first lactation milk yield (305FLMY), first lactation length (FLL), first lactation peak yield (FPY), first service period (FSP), first calving interval (FCI) and first dry period (FDP). Genetic evaluations employed six univariate animal models, accounting for both direct and maternal effects, facilitated by THRGIBBS1F90 and POSTGIBBSF90 programs. Fixed factors included in the analysis were period of calving, season of calving and age at first calving. The Bayesian estimates for direct heritability, derived from the most suitable model, were as follows: FLMY: 0.28 +/- 0.01, 305FLMY: 0.30 +/- 0.01, FLL: 0.19 +/- 0.01, FPY: 0.18 +/- 0.01, FSP: 0.12 +/- 0.01, FCI: 0.14 +/- 0.01 and FDP: 0.12 +/- 0.01. Maternal effects were found significant, ranging from 5% to 10%, in first lactation traits under Model 2 and Model 5. Additionally, positive and significant genetic and phenotypic correlations were observed among the studied traits. In conclusion, selection based on 305-day first lactation milk yield suggests potential for genetic enhancement in Murrah buffaloes, advocating its inclusion in breeding programmes to bolster early performance. Also, consideration of maternal influences is necessary for genetic progress of animals.

AB  - Dark animal fiber is bleached to satisfy the demand of color diversity for clothing. Comparing with frequentlyused Fe 2+ catalyzed H 2 O 2 (Fe 2+ /H 2 O 2 ) bleaching method, the ammonium persulfate (APS)/H 2 O 2 bleaching method based on the persulfate (PDS)-based advanced oxidation process is considered to be an environmentally animal fiber bleaching method, which is advantageous in high efficiency, heavy metal -free and low damage. However, the degradation mechanism of eumelanin of APS/H 2 O 2 bleaching method remains to be explored. Herein, standard eumelanin (SM) which has higher purity of eumelanin was used as reaction model, and SM was proved to degrade into five soluble oligomers by chemical structure analysis. Therefore, a new degradation pathway of eumelanin in APS/H 2 O 2 solution was simulated and proposed by in vitro experiment. In addition, the yak wool fiber was low damage by testing the fiber structure before and after bleaching. The dyeing property of yak wool fabrics had no effect on APS/H 2 O 2 bleaching. This investigation of degradation products provides new insights into the bleaching mechanism of APS/H 2 O 2 environmentally dark animal fiber bleaching method.

AB  - Simple Summary Castration is a routine procedure in sheep farming, and immunocastration is beginning to be used in animal production as an alternative to surgical castration. Currently, there are few studies on the intra-rumen environment after immunocastration in sheep. Therefore, in this study, male Xizang sheep were selected for surgical castration and GnRH immunocastration treatment, the intact control group and immunocastrated group were selected in combination with body weight data, and microbiology and metabolomics techniques were used to analyze the effects of GnRH immunocastration on the rumen internal environment of male Xizang sheep. The results showed that GnRH immunocastration had a more obvious effect on body weight gain while achieving the effect of de-population; immunocastration increased the ratio of rumen thick-walled bacterial phylum to anamorphic bacterial phylum, which improved the digestive utilization of forage feed in male Xizang sheep. Secondly, GnRH immunocastration can maintain the balance of the rumen internal environment and the health of rumen epithelial cells by improving the levels of certain metabolites in the rumen.Abstract Castration is a prevalent and indispensable practice in sheep husbandry, aiding in enhancing meat quality, mitigating aggressive behavior, and managing unwanted reproduction. Nevertheless, the conventional surgical castration procedure poses several challenges, including heightened stress and pain, detrimental impacts on animal welfare, and diminished economic efficacy in farming operations. Consequently, immunocastration methods, serving as substitutes for surgical castration, are progressively finding application in livestock. The rumen, an essential and distinctive digestive and absorptive organ in ruminants, has been associated with enhanced meat quality and productive performance following castration in previous research studies, albeit fewer investigations have explored the potential impacts of GnRH immunization on the rumen's internal milieu in sheep post-de-escalation. Hence, the present study delved into evaluating the impact of GnRH immunocastration on the rumen microbiome and metabolomics in male Xizang sheep. This was achieved through the establishment of a GnRH immunocastration animal model and the collection of rumen fluid for microbiological and comprehensive metabolomics investigations. The outcomes of this investigation unveiled that the impact of GnRH immunocastration on body weight gain was more pronounced during the achievement of the castration objective. In addition, the Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidota ratio in the immune male (IM) group exceeded that of the control group (EM), suggesting that GnRH immunodeficiency may enhance the digestion and absorption of feed in male Xizang sheep. At the taxonomic level, the elevated presence of Prevotella and Quinella bacteria in the IM group compared to the EM group indicated that castration influenced a segment of the rumen microbiota in male Xizang sheep, thereby bolstering the digestive and metabolic efficacy of the rumen concerning nutrient utilization, particularly in the breakdown and absorption of proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids, ultimately expediting the fattening process and weight gain in male Xizang sheep following castration.
   Moreover, analysis of ruminal fluid metabolomics revealed that GnRH immunization had notable impacts on certain metabolites in the ruminal fluid of male Xizang sheep, with metabolites like 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid and 3-hydroxyindole acetic acid showing significant downregulation in the IM group compared to the EM group, while niacin and tyramine exhibited significant upregulation. These findings indicate a profound influence of GnRH immunization on the maintenance of ruminal equilibrium and ruminal health (including the health of ruminal epithelial cells). This study validates that GnRH immunocastration not only achieves the objectives of castration but also enhances ruminal health in male Xizang sheep, thus laying a foundational theoretical basis for the application and dissemination of GnRH immunocastration technology.

AB  - Spotted pod borer, Maruca vitrata (F.), is one of the severe threats to grain legumes in the tropics and subtropics owing to its destructiveness and broad host range. It is imperative to look for safer alternatives for its management, such as the utilization of host plant resistance which can be induced upon the exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA). We studied the changes induced in the digestive and detoxifying enzymes of M. vitrata upon its feeding on JA and SA-treated pigeonpea plants in comparison with the untreated plants. Both JA and SA induced a defense response in pigeonpea plants against M. vitrata, which in turn affected the pest's development and physiology. The effect on the digestive enzymes (amylase, total proteases, elastase, lactate dehydrogenase) and developmental parameters (larval duration, larval weight, pupal weight, pupal percent, adult emergence and adult longevity) of M. vitrata was more pronounced and significant in the plants pre-treated with JA and then infested with M. vitrata after 12 h of JA application, compared to other treatments and untreated plants. The resistant genotype, AL 1747 responded better to the exogenous application of elicitors and M. vitrata infestation than the susceptible genotype MN 1. As a counter-response to induced plant defenses, an increase in the activity of glutathione-S-transferases (GST) and glucose oxidase (GOX) enzymes was observed in M. vitrata. Despite elevating its GOX activity upon elicitor application, the pod borer was unable to overcome the induced pigeonpea defences consequent of elicitor application as was indicated by its reduced larval weight and other biological parameters. SA also altered the activities of digestive and defense-related enzymes in M. vitrata; however, the effect was not as pronounced as JA. Both JA and SA seem to be involved in triggering the pigeonpea defenses and their exogenous application can be utilized to develop sustainable pest management strategies against M. vitrata.

AB  - Coral reef artisanal fisheries are an important source of nutrition and economic wellbeing for coastal communities, but their management is subject to conflicts and tradeoffs between short-term food security benefits and long-term ecological function. One potential tradeoff is between nutrient capture and fish yields, where targeting small, nutrient-dense species may be more valuable for food security than maximizing fish yields, which is more closely aligned with supporting biodiversity and ecological function. We explored these potential tradeoffs by comparing two similar gears: traditional African basket traps and traps modified with an escape gap. Traps without escape gaps captured a higher frequency of fish with body sizes below their estimated lengths at maximum sustainable yield than gated traps. Estimates of nutrient yields for six micronutrients among the 208 captured species indicated high hump-shaped relationships for gated traps and low and linear positive relationships for traditional traps. Maximum nutrients in gated traps frequently corresponded to body sizes at maximum sustainable yield. Daily capture rates of nutrients were above daily needs more often in gated than traditional traps, but calcium values were low in both trap designs. Gated traps were more likely to capture species with unique and potentially important functional traits, including browsing herbivores, which could have negative effects on ecological functions and reef recovery. However, gated traps also catch fewer immature fish and fewer predators. Our results indicate that nutrient yields can be maximized while using a gear that captures larger and more sustainable body sizes in coral reef artisanal fisheries. Preferential targeting of nutrient-dense fishes is only one of many metrics for evaluating a nutrition-centered management strategy and may only be a management target in specific contexts.

AB  - Biotic interactions are said to be more specialized in the tropics, and this was also proposed for the pollination systems of columnar cacti from North America. However, this has not yet been tested for a wider set of cactus species. Here, we use the available information about pollination in the Cactaceae to explore the geographic patterns of this mutualistic interaction, and test if there is a latitudinal gradient in its degree of specialization. We performed a bibliographic search of all publications on the pollination of cacti species and summarized the information to build a database. We used generalized linear models to evaluate if the degree of specialization in cacti pollination systems is affected by latitude, using two different measures: the number of pollinator guilds (functional specialization) and the number of pollinator species (ecological specialization). Our database contained information about the pollination of 148 species. The most frequent pollinator guilds were bees, birds, moths and bats. There was no apparent effect of latitude on the number of guilds that pollinate a cactus species. However, latitude had a small but significant effect on the number of pollinator species that service a given cactus species. Bees are found as pollinators of most cactus species, along a wide latitudinal gradient. Bat and bird pollination is more common in the tropics than in the extra-tropics. The available information suggests that cacti pollination systems are slightly more ecologically specialized in the tropics, but it does not support any trend with regard to functional specialization.

AB  - Simple Summary Suckling lamb meat is the secondary product of the Mediterranean traditional dairy sheep industry. Similar to the main production, i.e., milk, lamb meat contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), whose main portion is represented by enteric methane produced by the lamb dams. Such an emission, although limited in quantitative terms, should be mitigated by appropriate feeding or compensation techniques. Among all the sources of variation of meat lamb emissions, sex of the lamb and type of lambing (single or twins) showed the largest effect. The aim of this study was to estimate the methane-linked carbon footprint (CF) of the suckling lamb meat of Mediterranean dairy sheep. Ninety-six Sarda dairy ewes, divided into four groups of 24 animals each, were assigned to 2 x 2 factorial design. The experiment included the suckling lamb feeding system: traditional (TS), in which lambs followed their mothers on pasture during grazing time, vs. separated (SS), in which lambs remained indoors, separated from their mothers during the grazing time. Each group was divided into high (HS) and low (LS) supplemented ewes (600 g/d vs. 200 g/d of concentrate). The estimated CH4 emission of the ewes, calculated per kg of body weight (BW) gain of the lamb during the suckling period, was then converted to CO(2)eq with multiplying factor of 25. The TS lambs showed lower methane-linked emissions than SS ones (p < 0.05). The sex of lambs affected their methane-linked CF, with males having lower (p < 0.05) values than females. Twins displayed much lower methane-linked CF than singles (4.56 vs. 7.30 kg of CO(2)eq per kg of BW gained), whereas the level of supplementation did not affect greenhouse gases (GHG) emission. Interaction displayed lower and not-different GHG emissions for both indoor- and outdoor-reared twins. In conclusion, the methane-linked CF of the suckling lamb meat can be reduced by maintaining the traditional lamb rearing system and by improving flock prolificacy.

AB  - Kuching Bay is a significant area for artisanal fishing activities as well as an Important Marine Mammal Area (IMMA) for coastal cetaceans. A total of 286 fishers from eight fishing communities were interviewed between 2011 and 2019 to determine the nature and extent of cetacean-fishery interactions in the area. The main types of fishing gears recorded were gillnets, trammel nets, trawl nets, longlines, handlines and crab traps, with the use of gears varying by season and target species. Depredation, net damage, and entanglements in fishing gear were the most frequently reported negative interactions with cetaceans. Thirty-six percent of fishers reported having experienced a cetacean entanglement in their fishing gear at least once. More than half (58.1%) of the respondents who experienced bycatch were able to disentangle and release the animals alive. The more conservative calculated bycatch rate of 0.36 cetaceans per fisher over a fishing career indicates that a minimum estimated average of 19 cetaceans are involved in bycatch annually in Kuching Bay, with as many as nine of these incidents likely resulting in mortality. However, a less conservative method yields a bycatch rate of 0.57 per fisher, and estimated an average of 30 bycaught cetaceans per year. Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) were reported to be at the highest risk (72.9% of reported incidents), with an estimated minimum of seven individuals caught and killed per year. Despite the negative interactions, 77.2% of respondents reported a generally positive attitude toward cetaceans based on their value for tourism and as indicators of fish presence and a healthy ecosystem. Mutualistic relationships between fishers and cetaceans were documented, with 53% of respondents reporting that they feed discarded fish to cetaceans. The results of this study can be used to guide effective mitigation measures, which should focus on training fishers in safe handling and release of entangled cetaceans, and, more importantly, methods to prevent interactions with gillnets.

AB  - Simple Summary In recent years, pigs involved in the dry-cured ham production system have suffered from excessive leanness. This has led to the increase of slaughter weight (SW) to achieve greater carcass and ham fatness statuses to compensate for the loss in dry-curing aptitude. The production guidelines for the production of Italian dry-cured ham are currently under revision and an extension of the range of carcass weights from 126 to 168 kg, corresponding to about 146 to 210 kg of SW, has been proposed. However, little is known about the influence of SW in the range of 140-200 kg on growth performance, feed efficiency, carcass quality and ham curing aptitude. We hypothesized that an increased SW could exert a positive influence on ham characteristics. Data from 159 pigs fed ad libitum with diets, unlimiting for nutrient contents, up to 8 or 9 months of age (140-200 kg SW) were used. Greater SWs were linearly and positively associated with the growth performance of the pigs and with better ham quality traits. Greater SW increased ham weight, muscularity, and greater fat covering, according to the dry-cured ham industry's expectations. Barrows produced hams with greater weight and marbling than gilts. Slaughter weight (SW) is critical for dry-cured ham production systems with heavy pigs. A total of 159 C21 Goland pigs (gilts and barrows) at 95 +/- 9.0 kg body weight (BW) from three batches were used to investigate the impact of ad libitum feeding on SW, growth performance, feed efficiency, and carcass and green ham characteristics. Diets contained 10 MJ/kg of net energy and 7.4 and 6.0 g/kg of SID-lysine. Slaughter weight classes (SWC) included <165, 165-180, 180-110 and >210 kg BW. In each batch, pigs were sacrificed at 230 or 258 d of age. Left hams were scored for round shape, fat cover thickness, marbling, lean colour, bicolour and veining. Data were analyzed with a model considering SWC, sex and SWC x Sex interactions as fixed factors and the batch as a random factor. The linear, quadratic and cubic effects of SWC were tested, but only linear effects were found. Results showed that pigs with greater SWC had greater average daily gain and feed consumption, with similar feed efficiency and better ham quality traits: greater ham weight, muscularity, and fat coveringin correspondence of semimembranosus muscle. Barrows were heavier and produced hams with slightly better characteristics than gilts.

AB  - Radiocesium contaminations in Diptera (Muscidae, Calliphoridae) was investigated at three distances (11 km, 14 km, and 25 km) from the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant. The Cs134+137 concentrations in adults of coprophagous Musca hervei Villeneuve and necrophagous Chrysomyia pinguis (Walker) at an 11-km point were 3 and 2.8-4 times higher than those of a 14-km point, respectively. The Cs134+137 concentration in adults C. pinguis throughout three years from 2014 to 2016 with maximum 6886 Bq kg(-1) was significantly higher than that of M. hervei. In rearing experiments, eggs of uncontaminated Neomyia cornicina (Fabricius) and Lucilia caesar Linnaeus were inoculated onto cattle dung and meat samples (cattle and the Japanese monkey) contaminated with radiocesium. The Cs134+137 concentrations in pupae of N. cornicina reared from two contamination levels of dung samples were 217 +/- 4.9 Bq kg(-1) and 597 +/- 22 Bq kg(-1), respectively; those in pupae of L. caesar reared from two contamination levels of monkey meat samples were 55 +/- 4.3 Bq kg(-1) and 3390 +/- 55 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The Cs134+137 concentrations in adults emerged from pupae for cattle dung and meat suggest that most of the Cs134+137 in pupae transfer to adults during metamorphosis in cyclorrhaphous Diptera.

AB  - Efforts to promote human-wildlife coexistence may be overly focused on wildlife-related costs and benefits. We conducted research in Mozambique to gain insights into how governance of wildlife influences potential for human-wildlife coexistence. Mozambique is an under-studied region with a unique history of Portuguese rule, extended civil unrest, substantial wildlife trafficking, and current re-wilding efforts. We conducted surveys, logistic regression, and hotspot analysis to assess which variables are correlated with positive attitudes toward living with wildlife. Most respondents (61%) expressed positive attitudes toward living with wildlife. Attitudes were positively correlated with age, gender, distance from the park, wildlife benefits, restricted access to natural resources, and agreement with wildlife rules. Conflict with wildlife (i.e., livestock predation, human harm, and crop loss) were not significant predictors of attitudes. Respondents who agreed with the rules governing wildlife were 30-times more likely to have positive attitudes. This new and important finding highlights the possibility that institutions that address environmental justice, including the devolution of wildlife to local communities, may be more salient than the conventional measures of costs and benefits for understanding human-wildlife coexistence. Our results suggest that much more attention should be dedicated to the role of local institutions in promoting human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - "People-Forest-Miang" communities are villages located in the cultivated area of Camellia sinensis var. assamica, or Cha Miang, in northern Thailand. Cha Miang forests are a form of agriculture relying on forest-rich bioresources. This study focuses on a survey of the diversity of medicinal plants used by "People-Forest-Miang" communities in Mae Kampong Village, Chiang Mai, Thailand. The results demonstrated that 73 species of medicinal plants were used to prevent and treat various ailments. The highest number of species (30.14%) was used for musculoskeletal system disorders, followed by digestive system disorders (21.92%) and unspecified medicinal disorders (15.07%). The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is the most widely recognized biochemical marker for osteoblast activity. The ALP activity of ethanol and deionized water extracts of the nine selected medicinal plants used for musculoskeletal system disorders were examined in the MG63 cell line. The results showed that the numerous water extracts, including MKP1, MKP2, MKP5, MKP6, MKP7, MKP8, and MKP9, and the ethanolic extracts-namely, MKP2, MKP3, MKP7, and MKP9-significantly increased ALP activity in the MG-63 cell line. The findings indicate that some medicinal plants may be further studied for active chemicals and developed as natural active pharmaceutical ingredients for osteoprotective products.

AB  - A long-standing problem in evolutionary biology is why some populations differentiate into many species while the majority do not. Angiosperms is an excellent group for investigating this problem because their diversity is unevenly distributed in space and phylogeny. Plant hormone participates in growth, development and defense. However, jasmonic acid (JA) was the only hormone response to bites. We first searched jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ), AUXIN/INDOLE ACETIC ACID (IAA / aux), PYR/PYL/RCAR (PYL), DELLA, and SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 -like (SMAX) in 272 plant species. We found the gene number change trends were consistent with origination rates and species numbers of angiosperms. So, 26 representative species were selected as an example for further analysis. The results showed JAZ had experienced two lineage-specific gene expansion events in angiosperms, which coincided with increases in mammalian body size and dental diversity. The proliferation of large herbi-vores as a results of mammalian prosperity after dinosaur extinction may be related to angiosperm evolution and bursting. The proliferation of large herbivores as the result of mammalian prosperity after the extinction of the dinosaurs was related to angiosperm evolution and bursting. Overall, our study uncovered a previously unknown co-evolution mechanism in terrestrial plants exposed to extreme environmental conditions.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) modulates aversive memory and its extinction, with potential implications for treating anxiety- and stress-related disorders. Here, we summarize and discuss scientific evidence showing that CBD administered after the acquisition (consolidation) and retrieval (reconsolidation) of fear memory attenuates it persistently in rats and mice. CBD also reduces fear expression and enhances fear extinction. These effects involve the activation of cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors in the dorsal hippocampus, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and medial prefrontal cortex, comprising the anterior cingulate, prelimbic, and infralimbic subregions. Serotonin type-1A (5-HT1A) receptors also mediate some CBD effects on fear memory. CBD effects on fear memory acquisition vary, depending on the aversiveness of the conditioning procedure. While rodent findings are relatively consistent and encouraging, human studies investigating CBD's efficacy in modulating aversive/traumatic memories are still limited. More studies are needed to investigate CBD's effects on maladaptive, traumatic memories, particularly in post-traumatic stress disorder patients.

AB  - Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are of huge veterinary importance, mainly as vectors of pathogens, such as Bluetongue virus. Currently, there are no effective methods to protect animals against biting midges, as insecticides have limited or short-lived efficacy. Biting midges are attracted to hosts by carbon dioxide and by their body odours, which are mainly produced by skin bacteria. In humans, it has been shown that differences between individuals in attractiveness to mosquitoes is mediated by these skin bacterial volatiles. This opens the possibility to protect individuals from biting insects by supplementing their skin microbiome with probiotics. In this study, we investigated this approach by culturing sheep skin bacteria on various media and assessing their effects against field-caught Culicoides (overwhelmingly Obsoletus group species) as well as laboratory-reared Culicoides nubeculosus (Meigen). Aerococcus urinaeequi, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus subtilis, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus equorum were selected to be tested in a dual-choice Y-tube olfactometer, assessing their behavioural effects on biting midges. We revealed an avoidance effect on laboratory-reared C. nubeculosus when testing B. safensis and B. subtilis. Bacillus safensis and Micrococcus sp. yielded significant repellent potential towards field-caught Culicoides. These two candidates were subsequently tested in a membrane blood-feeding assay. When the bacterial species B. safensis was applied to the membrane, a feeding reduction of 83% was observed with field-caught Culicoides.

AB  - Floral biochemistry and stress physiology is an underexplored aspect of mangroves, which should be investigated as part of preservation and restoration efforts. A thriving true mangrove tree (Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lamk.) and a threatened mangrove-associate species (Heritiera fomes Buch. Ham.) were studied in the Sundarban region of India for seasonal variations in floral odours, non-volatile phytochemicals, antioxidant enzyme activities, and surface water chemistry in surrounding habitat. Both species were found to exhibit significant differences in floral volatilomes, protein contents, antioxidant enzyme activities, total flavonoids, and total phenolic contents between spring and autumn blooms. The bird-pollinated flowers of B. gymnorrhiza also showed considerable seasonal differences in floral anthocyanin and proline contents, indicating vulnerability of the post-anthesis open flowers to environmental factors. Contrarily to previous findings, B. gymnorrhiza floral bouquet appeared to be enriched in various classes of volatiles - dominated by sulphurous compounds in bud stage and terpenoids in open stage. Floral anthocyanins, contributing to the striking colouration of the calyx, were found to comprise cyanidin and delphinidin derivatives. Other glycosides of cyanidin and delphinidin were detected in H. fomes flowers, contributing to visual guides to potential food rewards for pollinating insects. Floral tissue in H. fomes was found to be protected by densely overlapping layers of stellate trichomes containing sesquiterpenoids as phytoprotectants. Comparison of the two floral species suggested that H. fomes flowering is optimized to oligohaline (but not freshwater) vernal conditions; whereas B. gymnorrhiza blooms are adapted for biologically enriched (including abundant herbivores and microbial growth), mesohaline forest habitats.

AB  - Disorders of sex development (DSD) are congenital conditions characterized by atypical development of chromosomes, gonads, or anatomical sex. XX-DSD pigs disrupt the production of highquality breeding pigs and impede the advancement of the pig industry. However, the etiology of XX-DSD pigs remains unclear. Systematic reports on the genetic and pathological characteristics of prepubescent XX-DSD pigs in familial contexts are sparse. This study aimed to investigate the genetic and pathological features of one-month-old XX-DSD pigs within a familial context and to provide phenotypic information to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of XX-DSD pigs. The findings revealed that inbreeding within the XX-DSD family may contribute to the pathogenesis of XX-DSD pigs. All XX-DSD pigs in the family had a chromosomal sex of female and were male pseudohermaphrodites. The degree of masculinization of the reproductive organs varied among XX-DSD pigs, demonstrating phenotypic heterogeneity. HE staining showed that the testes of prepubescent XX-DSD pigs contained vesicles in the seminiferous tubules, with or without vestigial germ cells. Ultrastructural analyses indicated that sertoli cells, leydig cells and germ cells in the testes of XX-DSD pigs exhibited pathological damage, confirming impaired testicular function. Immunofluorescence staining revealed high expression of SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9) in XX-DSD pig testicular tissues, while forkhead box L2 (FOXL2) was minimally expressed. Disordered secretion of reproductive hormones in prepubescent XX-DSD pigs indicated abnormal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPGA) function. This study elucidates the genetic and pathological characteristics of prepubescent XX-DSD pigs in familial case, providing valuable insights for further exploration of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying XX-DSD.

AB  - Glucose metabolism is an essential pathway that indirectly supports cellular redox homeostasis by providing reducing equivalents, such as NADPH, particularly in the highly specialized sperm. Sperm exhibit higher progressive motility in low glucose extender. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate effect of low glucose on sperm metabolism and lactylation modification. After 3 h of incubation, low glucose had an effect on the redox state of boar semen in vitro, particularly in terms of the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reductive products. Furthermore, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was significantly increased at low glucose condition, accompanied by increased lactate accumulation extracellularly. Meanwhile, protein lactylation levels were enhanced, with G6PD identified as one of lactylation proteins. In conclusion, low glucose incubation induced lactylation of G6PD, resulting in increased enzymatic activity that enhanced the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which in turn increased antioxidant capacity and maintained sperm motility in a low glucose environment. The research results provide valuable insights into the adaptation mechanisms of sperm to their environment and offer new perspectives and opportunities for reproductive biology research.

AB  - Simple Summary Sch B is the active component extracted from Sch B Fructus. It shows reproductive protection and spermatogenesis effects in animals. As far as we know, no research has been conducted with Sch B on boar semen preservation at 4 degrees C. Therefore, the current research aimed to explore the effects of Sch B on quality, oxidation resistance, and decapacitation of boar spermatozoa at 4 degrees C. The results showed that the positive effects of 10 mu mol/L Sch B were obvious for boar semen preservation at 4 degrees C. During cold storage, boar spermatozoa undergo oxidative stress, which can impair sperm function and fertilizing capacity. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of Schisandrin B (Sch B) in semen extenders on the quality of boar semen stored at hypothermia. Semen was collected from twelve Duroc boars and diluted in extenders supplemented with different concentrations of Sch B (0 mu mol/L, 2.5 mu mol/L, 5 mu mol/L, 10 mu mol/L, 20 mu mol/L, and 40 mu mol/L). Here, we demonstrated that 10 mu mol/L Sch B provided the best effects on motility, plasma membrane integrity, acrosome integrity, sperm normality rate, average movement velocity, wobbility, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and DNA integrity of sperm. The results of Sch B effects on antioxidant factors in boar sperm showed that Sch B significantly elevated the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and markedly decreased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of sperm. The expression of catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) mRNA was increased, while the expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mRNA demonstrated no change compared to non-treated boar sperm. Compared to the non-treated group, Sch B triggered a decrease in Ca2+/protein kinase A (PKA) and lactic acid content in boar sperm. Similarly, Sch B led to a statistically higher quantitative expression of AWN mRNA and a lower quantitative expression of porcine seminal protein I (PSP-I) and porcine seminal protein II (PSP-II) mRNA. In a further reverse validation test, no significant difference was observed in any of the parameters, including adhesion protein mRNA, calcium content, lactic acid content, PKA, and protein kinase G (PKG) activity after sperm capacitation. In conclusion, the current study indicates the efficient use of Sch B with a 10 mu mol/L concentration in the treatment of boar sperm through its anti-apoptosis, antioxidative, and decapacitative mechanisms, suggesting that Sch B is a novel candidate for improving antioxidation and decapacitation factors in sperm in liquid at 4 degrees C.

AB  - To limit damage from insect herbivores, plants rely on a blend of defensive mechanisms that includes partnerships with beneficial microbes, particularly those inhabiting roots. While ample evidence exists for microbially mediated resistance responses that directly target insects through changing phytotoxin and volatile profiles, we know surprisingly little about the microbial underpinnings of plant tolerance. Tolerance defenses counteract insect damage via shifts in plant physiology that reallocate resources to fuel compensatory growth, improve photosynthetic efficiency, and reduce oxidative stress. Despite being a powerful mitigator of insect damage, tolerance remains an understudied realm of plant defenses. Here, we propose a novel conceptual framework that can be broadly applied across study systems to characterize microbial impacts on expression of tolerance defenses. We conducted a systematic review of studies quantifying the impact of rhizosphere microbial inoculants on plant tolerance to herbivory based on several measures-biomass, oxidative stress mitigation, or photosynthesis. We identified 40 studies, most of which focused on chewing herbivores (n = 31) and plant growth parameters (e.g., biomass). Next, we performed a meta-analysis investigating the impact of microbial inoculants on plant tolerance to herbivory, which was measured via differences in plant biomass, and compared across key microbe, insect, and plant traits. Thirty-five papers comprising 113 observations were included in this meta-analysis, with effect sizes (Hedges' d) ranging from -4.67 (susceptible) to 18.38 (overcompensation). Overall, microbial inoculants significantly reduce the cost of herbivory via plant growth promotion, with overcompensation and compensation comprising 25% of observations of microbial-mediated tolerance. The grand mean effect size 0.99 [0.49; 1.49] indicates that the addition of a microbial inoculant increased plant biomass by similar to 1 SD under herbivore stress, thus improving tolerance. This effect was influenced most by microbial attributes, including functional guild and total soil community diversity. Overall, results highlight the need for additional investigation of microbially mediated plant tolerance, particularly in sap-feeding insects and across a more comprehensive range of tolerance mechanisms. Such attention would round out our current understanding of anti-herbivore plant defenses, offer insight into the underlying mechanisms that promote resilience to insect stress, and inform the application of microbial biotechnology to support sustainable agricultural practices.

   This study evaluated the effects of MIA elicited by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and postnatal metabolic or immune stressors on chemical and inflammatory biomarkers in male and female pigs. Our results provide evidence that MIA interacting with postnatal stressors can have a long-lasting effect on the pig physiology, potentially affecting health, growth, and reproductive performance later in life.
   The effects of maternal immune activation (MIA) elicited by a prenatal stressor and postnatal metabolic or immune stressors on chemical and inflammatory biomarkers were studied in male and female pigs. Pigs exposed to MIA elicited by porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and matching controls were assigned at two months of age to fasting stress, immune stress, or a saline group. The serum levels of over 30 chemistry and immune analytes were studied. Significantly low levels of blood urea nitrogen were detected in females exposed to MIA, while the highest creatinine levels were identified in fasting females exposed to MIA. The levels of interferon gamma and interleukin 8 were highest in pigs exposed to postnatal immune challenge. The profiles suggest that MIA may sensitize pigs to postnatal stressors for some indicators while making them more tolerant of other stressors. Effectiveness of practices to ameliorate the impact of postnatal stressors on the physiology of the pig could be enhanced by considering the prenatal stress circumstances.

AB  - Forty-five-year-long observations of variations in the musk deer abundance in the Ussurisky Nature Reserve are summarized. An analysis of winter route censuses (WRC) has made it possible to assume that these variations are related to the emergence of a new predator, the sable. The decrease in the musk deer abundance in the reserve occurred simultaneously with an increase in the sable abundance and a decrease in abundance of alternative food supplies for medium-sized and small predators. From the early 2000s to the present, the musk deer abundance in the reserve has remained at a level of only "presence" of the species in the fauna.

AB  - Sea pigs (Scotoplanes spp.) are deep-sea dwelling sea cucumbers of the phylum Echinodermata, class Holothuroidea, and order Elasipodida. Few reports are available on the microscopic anatomy of these deep-sea animals. This study describes the histologic findings of two, wild, male and female Scotoplanes sp. collected from Monterey Bay, California. Microscopic findings were similar to other holothuroids, with a few notable exceptions. Sea pigs were bilaterally symmetrical with six pairs of greatly enlarged tube feet arising from the lateral body wall and oriented ventrally for walking. Neither a rete mirabile nor respiratory tree was identified, and the large tube feet may function in respiration. Dorsal papillae protrude from the bivium and are histologically similar to tube feet with a large, muscular water vascular canal in the center. There were 10 buccal tentacles, the epidermis of which was highly folded. Only a single gonad was present in each animal; both male and female had histologic evidence of active gametogenesis. In the male, a presumed protozoal cyst was identified in the aboral intestinal mucosa, and was histologically similar to previous reports of coccidians. This work provides control histology for future investigations of sea pigs and related animals using bright field microscopy.

AB  - Integrating ecological theory with empirical methods is ubiquitous in ecology using hierarchical Bayesian models. However, there has been little development focused on integration of ecological theory into models for survival analysis. Survival is a fundamental process, linking individual fitness with population dynamics, but incorporating life history strategies to inform survival estimation can be challenging because mortality processes occur at multiple scales.We develop an approach to survival analysis, incorporating model constraints based on a species' life history strategy using functional analytical tools. Specifically, we structurally separate intrinsic patterns of mortality that arise from age-specific processes (e.g. increasing survival during early life stages due to growth or maturation, versus senescence) from extrinsic mortality patterns that arise over different periods of time (e.g. seasonal temporal shifts). We use shape constrained generalized additive models (CGAMs) to obtain age-specific hazard functions that incorporate theoretical information based on classical survivorship curves into the age component of the model and capture extrinsic factors in the time component.We compare the performance of our modelling approach to standard survival modelling tools that do not explicitly incorporate species life history strategy in the model structure, using metrics of predictive power, accuracy, efficiency and computation time. We applied these models to two case studies that reflect different functional shapes for the underlying survivorship curves, examining age-period survival for white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus in Wisconsin, USA and Columbian sharp-tailed grouse Tympanuchus phasianellus columbianus in Colorado, USA.We found that models that included shape constraints for the age effects in the hazard curves using CGAMs outperformed models that did not include explicit functional constraints. We demonstrate a data-driven and easily extendable approach to survival analysis by showing its utility to obtain hazard rates and survival probabilities, accounting for heterogeneity across ages and over time, for two very different species. We show how integration of ecological theory using constrained generalized additive models, with empirical statistical methods, enhances survival analyses.

AB  - The objective of the study was to examine the effect of soy lecithin (SL) and cholesterol loaded cryclodestrin (CLC) on cryo-survival of sperm cryopreserved in the presence or absence of seminal plasma in Saanen dairy goats. Tris-based dilutions containing various concentrations of SL (0, 0.5%, 1.0% or 2.0%) and CLC (0, 2.0 g/L, 4.0 g/L or 6.0 g/L CLC) were used to cryopreserve Saanen dairy goat sperm. The quality of frozen-thawed sperm, including progressive motility, viability, acrosome and plasma membrane integrity, as well as fertility were detected. Results found that the optimal combination of the two cryoprotectants was 1.0% SL+4.0 g/L CLC, which significantly increased progressive motility, viability, acrosome and plasma membrane integrity of frozen thawed sperm. The impact of the two cryoprotectants in combination was not affected by the presence of seminal plasma. The conception rates obtained after artificial insemination using sperm cryopreserved with and without seminal plasma were 88.89% and 91.67% (P > 0.05), respectively. The respective values for average number of litter sizes were 1.55 & PLUSMN; 0.17 and 1.56 & PLUSMN; 0.21 (P > 0.05). Therefore, this study improved the cryopreservation efficiency of goat semen, enhanced the sperm cryosurvival, and layed a foundation for the wide application of frozen goat semen.

AB  - Simple Summary: Weaning stress poses significant physiological challenges to piglets, often manifesting as intestinal disturbances, such as inflammation and impaired intestinal function, which ultimately affect growth and health. Probiotics can alleviate these adverse effects of stress and promote healthy growth in piglets. Parabacteroides distasonis (PBd), as a potential probiotic, has shown efficacy in preventing various diseases, but its anti-diarrheal effects in weaned piglets remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of PBd derived from Ningxiang pigs on growth performance, intestinal apoptosis, oxidative damage, and inflammation in Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)-challenged weaned piglets. The results show that oral administration of PBd can improve intestinal health and attenuate ETEC-induced intestinal damage in piglets. Weaning is a critical stage in the growth and development of piglets, often inducing stress reactions. This study aims to investigate the effects of Parabacteroides distasonis (PBd) derived from Ningxiang pigs on growth performance, intestinal apoptosis, oxidative damage, and inflammation in ETEC-challenged weaned piglets. A total of 22 Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) piglets, 24 days old with similar body weights, were randomly divided into three groups: Control (n = 7), ETEC (n = 7), and PBd + ETEC (n = 8). The results show that, compared to the Control group, ETEC challenge led to decreased growth performance, reduced villus height in the duodenum and jejunum, increased crypt depth in the duodenum, a decreased villus-height-to-crypt-depth ratio, increased expression of apoptosis-related genes (Caspase-8 and Caspase-9), increased expression of oxidative damage-related genes (Nrf2, GSH-PX, mTOR, and Beclin1), increased expression of inflammation-related genes (Myd88, P65, TNF-alpha, and IL-6), and reduced the contents of SCFAs in the colonic chyme (acetate, propionate, butyrate, valerate, and total SCFAs). Compared to the ETEC group, the PBd + ETEC group alleviated the reduction in growth performance, mitigated intestinal morphological damage, and reduced the expression of the aforementioned apoptosis, oxidative damage, and inflammation-related genes with the increase in SCFAs. In conclusion, PBd derived from Ningxiang pigs effectively reduces ETEC-induced intestinal damage in weaned piglets, improves intestinal health, and increases the content of SCFAs in the colonic chyme, thereby enhancing growth performance.

AB  - The long-spined sea urchin (Diadema antillarum) is a key herbivore on Caribbean coral reefs, but mass mortality events have severely reduced its populations, diminishing grazing pressure and contributing to reef degradation. In the Florida Keys, where D. antillarum remains scarce, the extent and variability of larval settlement are poorly understood, yet this information is critical for predicting and managing population recovery. To address this, we quantified monthly settlement rates using standardized Astroturf plates deployed across a gradient of reef habitats at nine reef sites from 2017 to 2023. We found that settlement was significantly higher at offshore bank-barrier reefs than inshore patch reefs, with greater settlement observed in the middle/upper Florida Keys compared to the lower Keys. Seasonal variation indicated peak settlement in summer, suggesting that larval supply may be influenced by seasonal oceanographic processes. Despite evidence of settlement, recruitment success remains uncertain, as post-settlement factors such as predation or environmental conditions may limit survival. These findings provide key insights for D. antillarum restoration efforts, highlighting offshore reefs in the middle/upper Florida Keys as priority sites for enhancing settlement and improving post-settlement habitat to support population recovery. Future studies should investigate the biophysical mechanisms driving the spatial and temporal settlement patterns identified here, to develop a predictive framework for settlement events that can further inform population management.

AB  - Background and aims - The manner by which the effects of multiple antagonists combine is a fundamental issue in ecology. This issue has been especially important in plant-herbivore evolutionary ecology-particularly predicting whether the combined fitness impacts of multiple herbivores on a shared host plant can be inferred by simply adding the individual impacts that each herbivore has when feeding alone. Despite accumulating empirical data, relatively little theoretical progress has been made in explaining why impacts of herbivore damage often combine nonadditively, as well as predicting the conditions that lead to a greater-than-additive (synergistic) or to a less-than-additive (subadditive) pattern.
   Material and methods - Based on considerations of limiting resources and source-sink relationships, I proposed and tested two hypotheses: 1) The fitness impacts of two species of herbivores that affect the same resource (i.e. feed on the same tissue in a similar fashion) will combine in a synergistic pattern (if that resource is not limiting reproduction when plants do not experience herbivory), and 2) The fitness impacts of two herbivores that affect different resources (i.e. feed on different tissues) will combine in a subadditive pattern. I performed a field experiment in which horsenettle (Solanum carolinense) was exposed to a factorial combination of four levels of leaf herbivory and five levels of simulated floral herbivory.
   Key results - The results were consistent with both hypotheses: 1) The combined fitness impact of flower damage that was simulated as being caused by two florivorous species feeding on the same plants was greater than the sum of the same total amount of damage when the two species were simulated as feeding individually; and 2) The combined fitness impact of the leaf and floral damage was less than the sum of the same total amount of damage when the two species fed individually.
   Conclusions - The main ecoevolutionary implication of these results is that subadditive impacts of leaf- and flower-feeding herbivores could weaken selection for resistance in horsenettle (or any plant species that hosts multiple herbivores), and thus subadditive impacts may contribute to the maintenance of diverse herbivore communities sharing a species of host plant.

AB  - Circular economy in the context of municipal organic waste management has boosted the emergence of novel composting scenarios, such as community composting and decentralized urban composting in small installations, which favors localized management and valorization of organic waste streams. However, there is little information about the agronomic use of the composts obtained from these new organic waste management systems as an alternative for inorganic fertilization in crop production. In this work, municipal solid waste-derived composts from two decentralized composting scenarios (CM1 and CM2 from community composting, and CM3 and CM4 from decentralized urban small-scale composting plants) were applied and mixed in the top layer of a calcareous clayey-loam soil to assess their effects as alternative substitutes for conventional soil inorganic fertilization (IN) during two successive cultivation cycles of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) grown in pots with the amended soils. These treatments were also compared with an organic waste (goat-rabbit manure, E) and a control treatment without fertilization (B). The effects of the fertilizing treatments on the crop yield and quality, as well as on the properties of the soil considered were studied. In general, the application of the different composts did not produce negative effects on lettuce yield and quality. The compost-derived fertilization showed similar lettuce yields compared to the inorganic and manure-derived fertilizations (IN and E, respectively), and higher yields than the soil without amendment (B), with increases in the initial yield values of B, for the first cycle from 34.2% for CM1 to 53.8% for CM3, and from 20.3% for CM3 to 92.4% for CM1 in the second cycle. Furthermore, the organically amended soils showed a better crop development, obtaining higher values than the control treatment in the parameters studied. In addition, the incorporation of the organic treatments improved the soil characteristics, leading to 1.3 and 1.2 times higher organic matter contents in the soils with CM2 and in the soils with CM1, CM3, and E, respectively, compared to the control soil without fertilizing treatment (B), and 2.0 and 1.8 times greater organic matter contents, respectively, compared to soil with inorganic fertilization (IN). Therefore, the use of municipal solid waste-derived composts from these new organic waste management systems, such as the decentralized composting scenarios studied (community composting and urban decentralized small-scale composting plants), is presented, not only as a sustainable valorization method, but also as an alternative for the use of inorganic fertilizers in lettuce cultivation, while enhancing soil properties, contributing to increasing the circularity of agriculture.

AB  - The partial nitritation/anammox process (PN/A) could be a promising alternative for nitrogen removal from high-strength wastewater. There is, however, a lack of information about suitable aeration and temperature for PN/A in single-stage reactors for high-strength wastewater, such as food waste (FW) digestate treatment. To this end, a laboratory-scale (10 L) partial nitritation/anammox sequencing batch reactor was operated for more than 230 days under four different intermittent aeration strategies and temperature variations (35 degrees C and ambient temperature - 26-29 degrees C) to investigate the feasibility of nitrogen removal from real FW digestate. High ammonium (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN) removal median efficiencies of 81 and 63%, respectively (corresponding to median NH4+-N and TN loads removed of 76 and 67 g.m(-3).d(-1)), were achieved when the aeration strategy comprised by 7 min/14 min off and an airflow rate of 0.050 L.min(-1).L-reactor(-1) was applied. Nitrogen removal efficiencies were not affected by temperature variations in southeastern Brazil. COD, chloride and organic nitrogen (520, 239 and 102.8 mg.L-1, respectively) did not prevent PN/A. Changes of the bacterial community in response to aeration strategies were observed. Candidatus Brocadia dominated most of the time being more resistant to aeration and temperature changes than Candidatus Jettenia. This study demonstrated that optimizations of anoxic periods and airflow rate support PN/A with high nitrogen removal from FW digestate.

AB  - The welfare of growing-finishing pigs is important inherently to the pigs, but also for the societal acceptance and environmental impact of the husbandry system. Nevertheless, methods to monitor pig welfare throughout the whole growing-finishing phase have not yet been successfully developed. One possibility is to use electronic feeding stations to identify the feeding pattern of individual pigs, which consists of feed intake and the behaviours underlying intake (i.e. feeding frequency, duration and rate), and to process this data using an algorithm that links feeding patterns to pig welfare. Before such a monitoring system can be developed, a thorough understanding of both pig feeding patterns and their relationships with pig welfare is required. The aim of this review was to assess the current state of this understanding. We begin with a narrative review that describes the feeding patterns of growing-finishing pigs, and subsequently provide a systematic review of the relationships between pig feeding patterns and welfare. We focused on animal-based parameters of pig welfare, but also included resource-based parameters known to influence welfare (e.g. space allowance, environmental enrichment). We found that so far, studies have focused on physiological and behavioural welfare problems, while the affective part of welfare, both positive and negative, has been largely overlooked. Deviations from basal feeding patterns may occur during reduced welfare states, sometimes even preceding other clinical or behavioural manifestations of the problem. Particularly clear are the links between feed intake and physiological causes of reduced welfare, such as clinical health, thermal stress and tail biting wounds. The behaviours underlying intake provide further information, as they show distinct deviations in response to different physiological welfare problems and as their rapid responses may enable detection of disease at a subclinical stage. However, a wider range of clinical diseases should be studied before this knowledge can be applied. Behavioural welfare problems, such as abnormal behaviours and feed competition, mostly induce deviations in the feeding behaviours underlying intake but not intake itself, though more knowledge is required to confirm this finding. We conclude that feeding patterns are a promising tool to monitor generic pig welfare. Feed intake and the behaviours that underlie it should be used simultaneously, on a short time scale (i.e. within the day). It should be considered that the variation in feeding patterns between and potentially within pigs is large, and that this variation should be well-understood before welfare-relevant variation can be interpreted.

AB  - Low molecular weight proteins, known as chemokines, facilitate the migration and localization of immune cells to the site of infection and injury. One of the first chemokines identified, CXCL8 functions as a key neutrophil activator, recruiting neutrophils to sites of inflammation. Several viral infections, including zoonotic coronaviruses and poxviruses, have been reported to induce the expression of CXCL8. Dromedary camels are known to harbor several potentially zoonotic pathogens, but critical immune molecules such as chemokines remain unidentified. We report here the identification of CXCL8 from the dromedary camel - the first chemokine identified from camelids. The complete dromedary CXCL8 cDNA sequence as well as the corresponding gene sequence from dromedary and two New World camelids - alpaca and llama were cloned. CXCL8 mRNA expression was relatively higher in PBMC, spleen, lung, intestine, and liver. Poly(I:C) and lipopolysaccharide stimulated CXCL8 expression in vitro, while interferon treatment inhibited it. In vitro infection with potentially zoonotic camelpox virus induced the expression of CXCL8 in camel kidney cells. Toxicological studies on camelids have been limited, and no biomarkers have been identified. Hence, we also evaluated CXCL8 mRNA expression as a potential biomarker to assess heavy metal toxicity in camel kidney cells in vitro. CXCL8 expression was increased after in vitro exposure to heavy metal compounds of cobalt and cadmium, suggesting potential utility as a biomarker for renal toxicity in camels. The results of our study demonstrate that camel CXCL8 plays a significant role in immunomodulatory and induced toxicity responses in dromedary camels.

AB  - 1080 toxin (sodium fluoroacetate) is used in New Zealand for possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and ship rat (Rattus rattus) control but can result in unintentional by-kill of native (e.g. kea Nestor notabilis) and non-native (e.g. deer) fauna. A newly developed deer repellent (Prodeer) in 1080 bait has proved highly effective in reducing deer by-kill while not impacting target pest efficacy. The ingredients in Prodeer bait are undisclosed due to commercial sensitivity, thus it is unknown whether this bait type increases acceptability and palatability to kea and increases risk over and above that posed by the standard (RS5) bait type normally used in aerial poisoning operations. During choice trials comparing kea responses to, and consumption of, non-toxic Prodeer and RS5 baits at alpine sites around Arthur's Pass National Park and central Westland we found kea Prodeer and RS5 consumption (per interaction and total) were not significantly different. Most individuals consumed substantially less of both bait types than the estimated lower 1080 LD50 threshold for kea, and vastly less than captive kea consume. We conclude that 1080 operations using Prodeer are unlikely to pose a risk significantly over and above that already presented to kea in standard RS5 1080 operations.

AB  - This article investigates the current status of the livestock industry (cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry) in China and assesses the potential for biogas production from anaerobically digested livestock manure. According to calculation results based on the latest data of livestock released by the National Bureau of Statistics of China in 2018, China produced 2 x 10(12) kg of manure pollution in 2017, with pig waste representing the largest single manure source. Biogas that can be converted from high organic containing manure is a kind of clean bioenergy with low carbon footprint. In 2017, the energy potential from manure-produced biogas was about 5.74 x 10(12)-6.73 x 10(12) MJ, which corresponds to 4-5% of China's total energy demand. Correlation analysis between biogas production and the livestock industry showed that crop production had significant effects on manure-generated biogas production. However, it is necessary to address the challenges when applying AD technology. Bioenergy potential from manure will be lost during material collection and transportation. Although large-scale livestock farming remains controversial, this type of farming can improve the energy recovery rate of livestock manure. How to gain benefits and maintain sustainable development is also a bottleneck for AD promotion. Reducing energy input in AD projects as well as enhancing the efficiency of methanogenesis of livestock manure are key factors for achieving a high net output of biogas projects. More inclusive strategies and a broader vision should be adopted to allow stakeholders to benefit from manure-generated biogas projects.

AB  - Facilitating efficient resource transfer requires building an optimized transportation network which balances cost minimization with benefit maximization. For animals which forage for food located remotely, optimizing their transportation networks is critically related to survival. This process often involves finding and using the shortest route to save time and energy. Subterranean termites forage for wood resources by excavating underground foraging networks for search and transport. Because termites have no prior knowledge of food location during the food searching phase, establishment of a short tunnel between the nest and feeding site is difficult at the beginning of foraging. Thus, finding a short route should logically follow initial food discovery. However, it remains elusive as to how subterranean termites find the shortest route for food transportation. We simulated different scenarios using Coptotermes formosanus by providing different shapes and distances of pre-formed tunnels (straight, detour, and detour + twisting arenas) to food, where food items were located at a fixed distance from the arena entrance. Termites in the straight arena continuously used the pre-formed tunnel, showing negligible branching efforts. However, termites in the detour and detour + twisting arenas followed the pre-formed tunnel only for the initial few hours before excavating many branching tunnels. This branching activity ultimately resulted in termites finding shorter commuting routes than the pre-formed tunnels. In addition, the shortest established routes were widened over time. This study demonstrated that C. formosanus could actively alter tunnel networks to minimize the cost in food transportation by using short and wide tunnels.
   Subterranean termites excavate underground tunnel networks to search for and transport food. With no prior knowledge about food location, termites likely alter tunnel networks to optimize them after food discovery. To understand how termites modify their tunnels, we observed termite tunneling behavior after food discovery. Our results showed that termites collectively found the shortest routes through tunnel branching and optimized further by widening tunnels.

AB  - Microplastics (MPs) are a major concern for marine ecosystems since they can be ingested by a wide range of marine species and transmitted through the food web. However, the potential hazardous impact of MPs in fishes, especially in early developing stages, is relatively unknown. In the present study, we assessed for the first time the ingestion and retention of MPs in early developing seahorses Hippocampus reidi. Seahorses are vulnerable species that may also be affected by both the direct ingestion of MPs through their preys and the accidental ingestion of MPs particles present in the water (i.e., seahorses ingest the prey by suction). We used copepods as both preys for seahorse juveniles and transfer vectors of MPs. Fed or starved copepods previously exposed to polyethylene microspheres (1-5 um in diameter; 10 and 100 ug L-1) for 60 min at 26 degrees C showed fast evacuation of microspheres. The presence of MPs in copepods was significantly higher in previously fasted copepods compared to fed copepods. Seahorse juveniles fed on copepods pre-exposed to MPs, accumulated MPs in the gut proportionally to the concentration of MPs in copepods. A lower concentration of MPs in seahorses was observed at the longer exposure time (60 min), especially in fish fed with fasted copepods. However, after longer exposure, MPs were mainly accumulated close to the anus both individually or forming aggregates. Further studies should be performed to assess secondary effects of MPs ingestion in seahorses since they are considered a flagship species for marine conservation. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We studied the effect of population density on the humoral adaptive immunity in bank (Clethrionomys glareolus) and grey-sided voles (C. rufocanus). We used 20-, 40-, and 60-day old voles born in a vivarium from females captured in the field (May-August). We used the outdoor temperature and illumination. After the labors, the young were kept with females during 20 days. Then we divided the young into two groups with different social conditions. Group 1 included individuals which grew singly. In Group 2, we simulated the conditions of a high-density population: the young were left together with their mothers. In order to activate the immune system, sheep red blood cells (SRBC) were used. To measure the immune response to the antigen, the splenic plaque-forming cells (PFC) technique was applied. We failed to find sex-linked differences in these species, but we observed significant interspecific variations. Thus, C. glareolus (40- and 60-day old voles) showed a higher level of immune reactivity than C. rufocanus did. The effect of a social environment on the immunity depended on species and the timing of the birth of individuals. In the Bank vole, the immune reactivity increased at a high population density. Voles born in May had a low sensitivity to social stimuli. In contrast, individuals born in July and August had the highest sensitivity to social stimuli. The immunity of the Grey-sided vole depended on social factors indirectly, through thermoregulation conditions. In October, the average temperature in the vivarium was maintained at 2.5 degrees C, and the grey-sided voles kept individually demonstrated immune suppression. In contrast, in animals from litters left with females, the level of immunity did not change. In the conditions of a high density, the development of the immune system of both species competed with the growth of animals, but not with sexual maturation.

AB  - The evolutionary history of sengis (Macroscelidea), an order of Afrotheria, has been studied in last decades by molecular phylogenetic approaches. These studies proposed an evolutionary scenario for this group of mammals and, surprisingly, revealed the presence of two new genera, delimited and described in the last five years. However, most research has relied solely upon samples from Southern Africa, while the genetic information from East Africa and the Zambezian region was only fragmentary. Here, we provide the most complete multilocus phylogeny of the subfamily Macroscelidinae, using new material mainly from eastern Africa, Zambia, and Angola. In agreement with previous studies, we confirmed the presence of two major radiations in the group, corresponding to recently defined tribes Macroscelidini and Elephantulini. Contrary to previous studies, however, we provide clear genetic evidence that the widespread East African Rufous Sengi (Elephantulus rufescens) belongs to the recently delimited genus Galegeeska. This finding is in agreement with morphological traits and with general biogeographical patterns in sub-Saharan Africa. Revised divergence dating using a multispecies coalescent approach revealed much younger splits in Macroscelidea, compared with previous studies, with a majority of recent species appearing in the Plio-Pleistocene. The genus Galegeeska thus represents a typical mammalian genus of the Somali-Masai bioregion and its current diversity (at least two recognized species, G. revoilii and G. rufescens) arose during the Pleistocene climatic oscillations, which is in agreement with other studies of small mammals in this region.

AB  - Aspergillus fumigatus is a major fungal pathogen causing life threatening infections in immunocompromised humans and certain animals. The HOG pathway is for two reasons interesting in this context: firstly, it is a stress signaling pathway that contributes to the ability of this pathogen to adapt to various stress conditions and secondly, it is the target of antifungal agents, such as fludioxonil or pyrrolnitrin. In this study, we demonstrate that Ypd1 is an essential protein in A. fumigatus. As the central component of the multistep phosphorelay it represents the functional link between the sensor histidine kinases and the downstream response regulators SskA and Skn7. A GFP-Ypd1 fusion was found to reside in both, the cytoplasm and the nucleus and this pattern was only slightly affected by fludioxonil. A strain in which the ypd1 gene is expressed from a tet-on promoter construct is unable to grow under non-inducing conditions and shows the characteristic features of A. fumigatus wild type hyphae treated with fludioxonil. Expression of wild type Ypd1 prevents this lethal phenotype, but expression of an Ypd1 mutant protein lacking the conserved histidine at position 89 was unable to do so, which confirms that A. fumigatus Ypd1 is a phosphotransfer protein. Generation of ypd1(tet-on) variants of several mutant strains revealed that the lethal phenotype associated with low amounts of Ypd1 depends on SskA, but not on TcsC or Skn7. The Delta sskA ypd1(tet-on), but not the Delta sskA Delta skn7 ypd1(tet-on) mutant, was sensitive to fludioxonil, which underlines the importance of Skn7 in this context. We finally succeeded to delete ypd1, but only if sskA and skn7 were both inactivated, not in a Delta sskA single mutant. Hence, a deletion of ypd1 and an inactivation of Ypd1 by fludioxonil result in similar phenotypes and the two response regulators SskA and Skn7 are involved in both processes albeit with a different relative importance.

AB  - Large genomic rearrangements, such as chromosomal inversions, can play a key role in evolution, but the mechanisms by which these rearrangements arise remain poorly understood. To study the origins of inversions, we generated chromosome-level de novo genome assemblies for four subspecies of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) with known inversion polymorphisms. We identified similar to 8,000 inversions, including 47 megabase-scale inversions, that together affect similar to 30% of the genome. Analysis of inversion breakpoints suggests that while most small (<1 Mb) inversions arose via ectopic recombination between retrotransposons, large (>1 Mb) inversions are primarily associated with segmental duplications (SDs). Large inversion breakpoints frequently occur near centromeres, which may be explained by an accumulation of retrotransposons in pericentromeric regions driving SDs. Additionally, multiple large inversions likely arose from ectopic recombination between near-identical centromeric satellite arrays located megabases apart, suggesting that centromeric repeats may also facilitate inversions. Together, our results illuminate how repeats give rise to massive shifts in chromosome architecture.

AB  - Simple Summary To obtain satisfactory results in artificial insemination, it is necessary to use high-quality ejaculates for the production of insemination doses and then maintain the biological value of the sperm during storage. Boar spermatozoa, owing to the specific structure of the cell membrane, are particularly sensitive to temperature changes. For this reason, cryopreservation cannot be used in artificial insemination practice, and there may be limitations to successful storage of semen in a liquid state. The practice of using boar semen for artificial insemination does not include analyses of the effect of storage time of boar semen on sperm dimensions. Therefore, the aim of the study was to analyse the morphometry of sperm during storage of liquid boar semen. An attempt was also made to evaluate the suitability of three staining methods for assessment of boar sperm morphometry. The morphometric dimensions of boar sperm were shown to change during storage of liquid semen. These changes affected the sperm head more than the tail and were due to the staining method used. The analyses are very important as they provide more information about the morphometric dimensions of the sperm during preservation of boar semen. The applied sperm staining techniques allows for a more accurate assessment of male reproductive cells. The aim of the study was to assess the morphometry of sperm during storage of liquid boar semen at 17 degrees C. An attempt was also made to evaluate the suitability of three staining methods for assessment of boar sperm morphometry. The study was carried out on 20 Landrace boars. Semen was collected from the boars every 5 days by the manual method. Four ejaculates from each boar were analysed (80 ejaculates in total). Analyses were performed five times: at 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 96 h, and 168 h after semen collection. Blisters with insemination doses were opened immediately before the analyses. From each insemination dose, smears were prepared for morphometric evaluation of sperm, which were stained by three methods (eosin-nigrosin-EN, eosin-gentian-EG, and SpermBlue-SB). Morphometric measurements of 15 randomly selected sperm with normal morphology were performed on each slide. The morphometric measurements included the following parameters: sperm head length, width, area, and perimeter; tail length; and total sperm length. The results of the morphometric measurements were used to calculate the head shape index. The morphometric dimensions of the sperm were shown to change during storage of semen at 17 degrees C. The extent of these changes, however, depended on the staining method used, as the three methods result in different morphometric dimensions of sperm, in the case of both the head and the tail. In the slides stained by the eosin-nigrosin method, the dimensions of the head and tail were smaller at every time of storage than in the slides stained by the SpermBlue and eosin-gentian methods.

AB  - Salinomycin (SAL) has caused widespread pollution as a feed additive and growth promoter in livestock such as pigs, exerting a negative impact on public health. The toxicity mechanism of SAL has been widely studied in chickens, but the underlying mechanisms of SAL-induced toxicity to pigs and the ecosystem remain undefined. In this study, we explored the potential damage of SAL in IPEC-J2 cells to identify the effects of excessive SAL on the interplay between mitophagy and oxidative stress. The results showed that a concentration-dependent response was observed for SAL in altering cellular morphology and inducing cell death in IPEC-J2 cells, including the induction of cell cycle arrest and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Meanwhile, we found that excessive SAL led to oxidative damage by activating the Nrf2/Keap1/HO-1 pathway, accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation and the reduction of antioxidant enzyme activity. We also found that PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy was activated by SAL exposure, particularly with mitochondrial membrane potential reduction. Interestingly, SAL-induced oxidative damages were prevented after the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3 MA) treatment, and mitophagy was alleviated following ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) treatment. Overall, our findings showed that SAL stimulated oxidative stress and mitophagy in IPEC-J2 cells resulting in cellular injury, and there was a strong connection between SAL-induced oxidative stress and mitophagy. Targeting ROS/PINK1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy and oxidative stress could be a novel protective mechanism in SAL-induced cell damage.

AB  - The use of local agricultural by-products for animal feed is an alternative that reduces livestock production costs and allows food production of greater environmental sustainability. The aim of this experiment was to study the effect of the inclusion in the dairy goat ration of artichoke by-product silage (ABS) at three levels (25%, 40% and 60%, on a dry matter basis) on the milk yield, composition and quality, and on the metabolic profile of dairy goats. Thirty-six Murciano-Granadina dairy goats in mid-lactation were divided into four groups with homogeneous characteristics. Each group was assigned a diet: a control treatment (C) that consisted of a conventional diet of alfalfa hay and concentrate, and three other treatments that included 25, 40 and 60% ABS: ABS25, ABS40 and ABS60. Small differences were observed in the milk yield and quality and the health status of the animals. Only ABS60 presented a slightly lower milk yield (-20% compared to control group), without relevant differences in the milk composition and mineral profile. Regarding the lipid profile, ABS40 was the treatment with the best milk quality, due to a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (4.37%) and lower atherogenicity (1.90) and thrombogenicity indices (3.05), without differences from C. It was concluded that the maximum inclusion level of ABS in dairy goats' diet should be equal to 40%.

AB  - Simple Summary With the change in meat sheep breeding from traditional farming to large-scale, intensified modern breeding practices, the environmental air quality in sheep barns has gradually started to receive more attention. CO2 concentration is an important environmental indicator in the ambient air of sheep sheds; when excess CO2 accumulates, it can lead to chronic hypoxia, lethargy, loss of appetite, weakness, and stress in sheep, which seriously endangers their healthy growth. Therefore, an accurate understanding of the trend of CO2 concentration changes in sheep housing and the precise regulation of their breeding environment are essential to ensure the welfare of sheep. Inspired by developments in deep learning technology in recent years, we propose a method to predict CO2 mass concentration in sheep barns based on the RF-PSO-LSTM model. The experimental results show that our proposed model has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 75.422 mu g center dot m(-3), a mean absolute error (MAE) of 51.839 mu g center dot m(-3), and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.992. The data predicted by the model are similar to the real data of a sheep barn; in fact, the prediction is better. Our proposed method can provide a reference for the prediction and regulation of ambient air quality in meat sheep barns. In large-scale meat sheep farming, high CO2 concentrations in sheep sheds can lead to stress and harm the healthy growth of meat sheep, so a timely and accurate understanding of the trend of CO2 concentration and early regulation are essential to ensure the environmental safety of sheep sheds and the welfare of meat sheep. In order to accurately understand and regulate CO2 concentrations in sheep barns, we propose a prediction method based on the RF-PSO-LSTM model. The approach we propose has four main parts. First, to address the problems of data packet loss, distortion, singular values, and differences in the magnitude of the ambient air quality data collected from sheep sheds, we performed data preprocessing using mean smoothing, linear interpolation, and data normalization. Second, to address the problems of many types of ambient air quality parameters in sheep barns and possible redundancy or overlapping information, we used a random forests algorithm (RF) to screen and rank the features affecting CO2 mass concentration and selected the top four features (light intensity, air relative humidity, air temperature, and PM2.5 mass concentration) as the input of the model to eliminate redundant information among the variables. Then, to address the problem of manually debugging the hyperparameters of the long short-term memory model (LSTM), which is time consuming and labor intensive, as well as potentially subjective, we used a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to obtain the optimal combination of parameters, avoiding the disadvantages of selecting hyperparameters based on subjective experience. Finally, we trained the LSTM model using the optimized parameters obtained by the PSO algorithm to obtain the proposed model in this paper. The experimental results show that our proposed model has a root mean square error (RMSE) of 75.422 mu g center dot m(-3), a mean absolute error (MAE) of 51.839 mu g center dot m(-3), and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.992.
   The model prediction curve is close to the real curve and has a good prediction effect, which can be useful for the accurate prediction and regulation of CO2 concentration in sheep barns in large-scale meat sheep farming.

AB  - Faecal sample analysis has been the principal method for interpreting animal diet, chosen for its simplicity and ease of non-invasive sampling relative to other sample types. Faecal samples allow diet analysis for scarce or threatened species, with minimal disturbance to their natural behaviour. And where collection can be linked to the individual animal or group, faecal analysis allows unlimited repeated samples to reveal seasonal patterns in diet or responses to experimental treatments. Morphological assessment of undigested remains in faecal samples has been carried out for species ingesting a diverse array of diets, including carnivores, herbivores, nectarivores, frugivores and fungivores. While the morphological method can be time consuming, the wealth of information that can be derived from detailed diet composition through this method has immense ecological value for understanding food webs and species interactions. In this chapter we identify considerations for sample collection in the field, describe laboratory methods for morphological assessment of diet, and detail alternative methods for analysing and presenting dietary data. For each step in the process, and for each alternative method, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the approach to assist researchers in making an informed choice and robust interpretation of animal diets.

AB  - This study was conducted to investigate the effect of diet supplemented with rumen-protected 5-hydroxytryptophan (RPT 5-HTP) on the concentration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) and melatonin (MLT) in the plasma of sheep. Eighteen sheep were assigned randomly to three diet groups (n = 6). The treatment groups included control (CT, corn-soybean meal basal diet), CT + 111 (CT + 111 mg/kg BW RPT 5-HTP), and CT + 222 (CT + 222 mg/kg BW RPT 5-HTP) groups. The experiment lasted for 16 d. On the 16th day of the experiment, blood samples from the sheep were collected at 0 h before feeding and at 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h after feeding in the morning. The plasma concentration of 5-HTP, tryptophan (Trp), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and MLT was determined. The plasma concentration of 5-HTP at 6, 8, and 10 h after feeding in the morning increased (P < 0.05) in response to RPT 5-HTP supplementation when compared with that at 0 h before feeding. The plasma concentration of Trp remained unchanged with RPT 5-HTP supplementation. However, the plasma concentration of 5-HT increased significantly in the sheep of CT + 222 group at 3, 4.5, 6, 8, and 12 h post feeding in the morning when compared with that at 0 h before feeding. The effect of RPT 5-HTP supplementation on the plasma MLT concentration was observed. The concentration of MLT increased (P < 0.05) from 1.5 to 6 h after feeding. In conclusion, RPT 5-HTP supplementation increased the plasma 5-HTP, 5-HT, and MLT concentrations in the sheep. However, the plasma Trp concentration in the sheep remained unchanged after RPT 5-HTP supplementation.

AB  - BackgroundEctoparasitic infestations, particularly lice, are a major challenge to goat farming in India, leading to significant economic losses through reduced productivity and increased mortality. The most common lice species identified in goats are Bovicola caprae (biting louse) and Linognathus africanus (sucking louse), as determined by morphological keys. This study provides the first comprehensive molecular and morphological characterization of lice collected from Indian goats, shedding light on their potential as neglected vectors of disease.ResultsLice were morphologically identified using established taxonomic keys, while molecular identification was carried out by amplifying a fragment of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, a standard marker for species-level identification in arthropods. Phylogenetic analysis of the COI sequences confirmed the identities of B. caprae (PQ602608) and L. africanus (PQ602609), both showing high similarity to previously documented Asian isolates in GenBank (B. caprae-Accession No. (s) MF927687 and MZ817000, L. africanus-Accession No. OP948899). The molecular data also revealed novel insights into the genetic diversity of these lice species, showing close phylogenetic relationships with isolates from neighboring Asian countries, including China, Iran, and Pakistan. L. africanus has been found to harbor vector-borne pathogens such as Theileria spp. and Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp., suggesting that it may be an underestimated vector.ConclusionsThis study provides critical insights into the genetic diversity and vector potential of lice in Indian goats, which could inform more effective control strategies and reduce the substantial economic losses caused by ectoparasitic infestations in goat farming.

AB  - Pareiasaurs were relatively abundant, globally-distributed, herbivorous parareptiles of the mid to late Permian. The basal-most forms, all members of the Bradysauria, are restricted to the Guadalupian (mid-Permian) of South Africa and went extinct in the late Capitanian near the top of the Tapinocephalus Assemblage Zone. Currently four species are recognized in this group: Bradysaurus seeleyi, B. baini, Embrithosaurus schwarzi and Nochelesaurus alexanderi. These taxa have been poorly defined historically and based on a limited number of specimens, leaving the taxonomic diversity of the group open to doubt and limiting their utility in biostratigraphy. Here, we present our fourth and final contribution to improve the understanding of this group by providing a taxonomical and phylogenetic review, updated stratigraphical ranges, and updated diagnoses for each taxon within Bradysauria. Bradysaurus seeleyi is synonymized with Bradysaurus baini, resulting in three valid mid-Permian pareiasaur taxa: Bradysaurus baini, Embrithosaurus schwarzi and Nochelesaurus alexanderi. Our cladistic analysis of cranial and postcranial characters supports the monophyly of Bradysauria with five synapomorphies. Embrithosaurus schwarzi is recovered as the sister taxon to a clade containing Bradysaurus baini and Nochelesaurus alexanderi. By identifying 157 pareiasaur specimens in fossil collections we show that the Bradysauria are stratigraphically restricted to the Abrahamskraal Formation of the Beaufort Group and suggest a staggered appearance. Bradysaurus baini is first to appear, followed by Nochelesaurus alexanderi, and lastly by Embrithosaurus schwarzi. All three taxa perished during the Capitanian mass extinction, and have their highest occurrences near the top of the Abrahamskraal Formation.

AB  - In recent decades, several Roman Period sites, from villas to urban centres, have been studied archaeozoologically in present-day Slovenia, providing a solid understanding of the characteristics of animal husbandry in the first three centuries AD. Much less is known about the production, supply, and use of animal resources in Late Antiquity, mainly due to the meagre amount of (published) data. Of late, however, the study of a handful of contexts from the 4(th) to 7(th) centuries AD has provided an opportunity to gain deeper insights into the cultural changes and transformations in animal husbandry triggered by the unstable political and security conditions of the period. Among the topics addressed are how the intensity of production, the taxonomic richness of livestock, local and transregional supply systems, and the social stratification of the population changed in the turmoil of the collapsing empire. The archaeozoological results were complemented by relevant data reported by ancient authors to contextualise them better. It is suggested that late antique communities in the study area tended to be economically self-sufficient. Animal husbandry seems to have been based on relatively small specimens of primitive local forms, with the keeping of pigs and sheep gradually replacing cattle husbandry in scale.

AB  - True, phocid seals have the shortest known lactations relative to body mass, during which mass transfer of adipose stores from mother to offspring occurs at an unrivalled rate and extent. The mothers of most species of seal fast until weaning whilst their pups gorge on the most fat-rich milks known. This results in a dramatic reduction in maternal blubber mass while pups may triple their body weights before weaning. Mothers mobilise their blubber fat, transport it via blood to their mammary glands and into milk, whilst pups transfer fat in the opposite direction, from their intestines, via blood, to their blubber. Using proteomic analysis of mother and pup sera from Atlantic grey seals, we find that this mirror image flux of lipids between mothers and pups is reflected in an almost inverse relationship in the proteins in their blood specialised to transport fats, lipids, and fat-soluble vitamins. For instance, apolipoproteins ApoB-48/100, ApoA-II and ApoA-IV, which are structural components of the main lipid carrier complexes such as chylomicrons and HDL particles, occur at much higher levels in pups than mothers. Meanwhile, carriers of fat-soluble vitamins such as retinol- and vitamin D-binding proteins are lower in pups and gradually build towards weaning. In contrast, sex hormone-binding globulin occurs at remarkably high relative concentrations in pups. There are therefore dramatic differences between, and an unrealised complexity in, the balance of proteins involved in the rapid transfer of fats and other lipids from mother to pups in preparing their offspring for their post-weaning fasts on land and eventual survival at sea before they can feed again.

AB  - Conifer-feeding bark beetles are important herbivores and decomposers in forest ecosystems. These species complete their life cycle in nutritionally poor substrates and some can kill enormous numbers of trees during population outbreaks. The Eurasian spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) can destroy >100 million m(3) of spruce in a single year. We report a 236.8 Mb I. typographus genome assembly using PacBio long-read sequencing. The final phased assembly has a contig N-50 of 6.65 Mb in 272 contigs and is predicted to contain 23,923 protein-coding genes. We reveal expanded gene families associated with plant cell wall degradation, including pectinases, aspartyl proteases, and glycosyl hydrolases. This genome sequence from the genus Ips provides timely resources to address questions about the evolutionary biology of the true weevils (Curculionidae), one of the most species-rich animal families. In forests of today, increasingly stressed by global warming, this draft genome may assist in developing pest control strategies to mitigate outbreaks.
   Daniel Powell et al. present a high-quality genome assembly of the Eurasian spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, which is known to cause substantial damage to European forests. Their results provide an important resource for investigation of the underlying physiology of this pest species and limit future threats to European forests.

AB  - Altrenogest (ALT), a synthetic progestogen, is used in pig farming for estrus synchronization in gilts. Residues of ALT and its metabolites may reach the aquatic environment via the spread of liquid manure and may present a risk for fish and other higher aquatic organisms due to its endocrine disrupting potential. A pilot study was conducted in which spot urine samples from ALT-treated and non-medicated gilts were collected. We applied LCHRMS analysis to perform targeted analysis of ALT and known metabolites as well as non-targeted metabolomics analyses to find previously unknown metabolites. The targeted investigation showed that glucuronide conjugates of ALT and its photo-isomerization product are main urinary metabolites of ALT in gilts. Furthermore, an unknown isomerization product of ALT was observed at trace level, whereas ALT and ALT sulfate were not found. The chemometric analysis of non-targeted data revealed a clear difference between ALT-treated gilts and control animals. Furthermore, a hydroxylated ALT glucuronide was identified as highly significant in the ALT-treated group. Additional biomarker annotation and pathway mapping revealed changes in the metabolism of ALTtreated animals which can be explained by ALT's hormonal action. This study illustrates the exceptional potential of LC-HRMS and metabolomics for the detection of potentially new environmental contaminants with high biological activity. Further advantages of the method described are the sampling during routine breeding conditions, a relatively small number of animals required and no particular stress for the animals.

AB  - Bats are one of the most diverse mammal groups, with over 1400 species distributed across the planet, and they provide key ecological and economic services. In addition, bats provide an ideal habitat for fungal growth and harbour a high diversity of fungal species. Previous studies have described 423 fungal species associated with bats and bat carcasses. This paper describes a new fungal species, Fusarium rhinolophi, belonging to Nectriaceae, collected from bats in Mengla County, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China. Phylogenetic analyses of the combined ITS, CAM, TEF-1 alpha, TUB, RPB1, and RPB2 dataset confirmed that our fungus forms an independent lineage within the F. nisikadoi species complex. Thus, we describe our fungus as a new species of Fusarium based on morphology and molecular phylogeny. A description, phylogenetic tree showing species placement, and micrographs are provided.

AB  - The ionome-an important expression of the physiological state of organisms-is poorly known for mammals. The focus on particular tissues-such as liver, kidney, and bones-in biomonitoring of environmental pollution and potential deficiencies is based on widely held assumptions rather than solid knowledge of full mammalian ionomes. We examined the full ionome of Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and Wild boar (Sus scrofa), two commonly used mammals for biomonitoring, in a Dutch protected nature reserve (Veluwezoom). We used four individuals per species. We dissected 13 tissues and organs from each individuals (eight in total) of each species and measured 22 elemental concentrations in each. We assessed, for each element, how concentrations varied across tissues within and between individuals. Based on existing literature, we put our findings in the context of their function in the mammalian body. We found that the ionome was highly variable between as well as within the two species. For most elements, tissues containing the highest and lowest concentration differed between individuals. No single tissue accurately represented the accumulation of toxic elements or potential deficiencies in the bodies. Our assessment of the element's biological roles revealed a serious lack of reference values. Our findings imply that analyses of commonly used tissues in biomonitoring do not necessarily capture bioaccumulation of toxins or potential deficiencies. We recommend establishing a centralized database of mammalian ionomes to derive reference values in future. To our knowledge, our study is one of the most complete assessments of mammalian ionomes to date.

AB  - The effect of slurry separation on CH4 and N2O emissions was investigated in two pilot-scale storage experiments during summer (123 days) and winter (159 days). Pig slurry, anaerobically digested slurry and their corresponding liquid fractions after separation were stored in triplicate. The Anaerobic Biodegradation Model was used to interpret the results of pig slurry. The separated liquid fractions had a higher conversion of initial volatile solids content and different explanations are discussed. There was no clear difference in annual emission between separated and unseparated slurry, although variability was high. The conditions in the field experiment were used for the modelled emissions, and the results demonstrated that the initial microbial community, pH, volatile solids content, and slurry temperature can change the results dramatically. These factors should always be reported, to be able to compare literature values and for future modelling work.

AB  - Simple Summary The milk production systems in goats are mainly intensive and semi-extensive. In the former, the goats are housed and are fed a total mixed ration with vitamin supplementation. In the latter, the feeding of the goats is based on grazing, although with some supplementation with compound feed. Retinol and alpha-tocopherol that appear in these animals come from the feeding regime, since the animal cannot synthesize them. The objective of this study was to verify if the vitamins provided in different management systems of Payoya lactating goats are good markers of the production system. For this purpose, the content of carotenoids, retinol and alpha-tocopherol in the milk and plasma of the goats was quantified. Results showed an inverse relationship of the amount of these vitamins between milk and plasma. On the other hand, the metabolism of different vitamins depends on their origin (natural/synthetic), with natural alpha-tocopherol and synthetic retinol showing the highest amount in milk. Finally, it was found that these compounds can be good traceability tools which allows to guaranty to the consumer the origin of the products derived from these animals.
   The retinol and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were quantified (mu g/mL) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in both plasma and milk of goats from three management systems. The aim was to investigate if the compounds pass from feed to animals' fluids and to evaluate their potential use as feeding regime biomarkers. A total of 45 Payoya dams were distributed in three groups according to management system during the first month of lactation: mountain grazing (MG), cultivated meadow (CM) and total mixed ration (TMR). TMR group had higher concentrations of retinol in both plasma (25.92 +/- 3.61 at 30 days postpartum) and milk (8.26 +/- 0.79 at 10 days postpartum), and they were also the unique animals whose milk contained detectable concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (3.15 +/- 0.19 at parturition). However, MG and CM goats showed higher plasma concentrations of alpha-tocopherol (64.26 +/- 14.56 and 44.65 +/- 5.75 at 30 days postpartum, respectively). These results could imply differences in the bioavailability of supplemented vitamin A and natural beta-carotene and between the natural/synthetic forms of alpha-tocopherol. An inverse relationship between the fluids (plasma/milk) in the contents of alpha-tocopherol and retinol was observed as lactation progressed. Since 80% of the animals were correctly classified using a discriminant analysis based on these vitamins, these compounds could be used as traceability biomarkers of feeding system, but further studies are necessary to know the possible passage to kid meat.

AB  - The invasive species Lonicera maackii (Amur Honeysuckle) is an increasing problem sweeping from the eastern United States toward the west, impacting normal forest development and animal survival across multiple taxa. Little is known about the genomics of this species, although a related invasive, Lonicera japonica, has been sequenced. Understanding the genomic foundation of the Lonicera maackii species could help us understand the biochemistry and life history that are the underpinnings of invasive success, as well as potential vulnerabilities and strengths which could guide research and development to control its spread. Here we present a draft, but high-quality, short-read whole-genome sequence, assembly, and annotation of Lonicera maackii, demonstrating that inexpensive and rapid short-read technologies can be successfully used in invasive species research. Despite being a short-read assembly, the genome length (7.93 x 10(8)) and completeness (estimated as 90.2-92.1% by BUSCO and Merqury) are close to the previously published chromosome-level sequencing of L. japonica. No bias, by means of a Gene Ontology analysis, was identified among missing BUSCOs. A duplication of the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase gene in both Lonicera species is identified, and the potential impact on controlling these invasive species is discussed. Future prospects for a diversity analysis of invasive species is also discussed.

AB  - Analyses of the variation in the abortion rate and mass of seeds of tropical trees are scarce, despite their importance in modulating seed production, plant recruitment, and herbivore foraging patterns. We studied these reproductive processes in a tropical dry forest tree species. We studied the patterns of intrafruit abortion and seed mass in fruits of the Guanacaste tree, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, in samples of trees from 5 populations in Mexico and Costa Rica. We analyzed the effects of developmental phase, fruit and maternal tree effects, and seed position within the fruit on the abortion rate and mass of seeds from mature and immature fruits. Naturally pollinated flowers were studied to determine the patterns of ovule fertilization within the ovaries. Overdispersion of the abortion rate per fruit within trees and a higher frequency of abortions in the extreme positions of the fruit were common patterns in all populations. These patterns were observed from the beginning of fruit formation. Ovules in the stylar position do not have higher survival rates, despite their precedence in fertilization. A negative relationship was found between abortion events and seed mass. Fruit-specific fertilization and developmental conditions seem to be the main factors driving the fruit abortion rate and seed mass, causing high variability in seed survival and mass within maternal trees. The correlation between the fruit abortion rate and seed mass may be related to the capacity of the fruit to drain maternal resources. These patterns are common to all studied Guanacaste tree populations.

AB  - Understanding the foraging ecology of predators is critical to identifying the resources and habitats that maintain their populations and is essential for their conservation and management. For marine predators that spend extended periods at sea and underwater, the use of animal-borne video provides a novel method of observing individuals in their environment and the foraging behaviours they employ. The endemic Australian sea lion, Neophoca cinerea, is listed as endangered, with its populations declining by more than 60% over the last 40 years. Due to the highly subdivided genetic structure of Australian sea lion populations, an intimate understanding of their foraging behaviour, throughout their distribution, is needed to support targeted management at the breeding site level. Here, we use animal-borne video collected from 10 adult female Australian sea lions from five colonies in South Australia to identify the prey capture tactics they use across different benthic habitats. We identified a variety of prey capture tactics (probing, chasing, pelagic ambushing of schooling fish, flipping rocks/substrate and sit-and-wait predation), exploiting a range of benthic habitats, including seagrass meadows, bare sand plains and macroalgae reefs, while hunting diverse prey, such as benthic/epibenthic fishes, cephalopods and elasmobranchs. The prey capture tactics most frequently observed were probing and chasing, which were used by all individuals, whereas flipping rocks, sit-and-wait predation and pelagic ambush were less frequent. Using specialist prey capture tactics, such as sit-and-wait predation, may increase the capacity of sea lions to exploit a greater diversity of prey and benthic habitats, which could increase their overall success and fitness. This study underscores the significance of animal-borne video as a crucial tool for identifying and mapping the critical habitats and resources essential for Australian sea lions.

AB  - Soil-dissolved organic matter (DOM) drives the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in agroecosystems. Despite many studies on DOM dynamics, hardly any attention has been directed toward DOM quality, particularly DOM composition. The aim of this study was to elucidate how C and N management practices alter soil water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) in a loess soil agroecosystem. Field experiments were conducted with a winter wheat monoculture. Three N fertilization rates (0, 120, and 240 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) were applied for 17 years (2002-2019), combined with five C practices (zero, low, and high rates of sheep manure or wheat straw) for three years (2016-2019). The results reveal that soil organic carbon (SOC) and water-extractable organic carbon (WEOC) concentrations in the topsoil (0-20 cm) were increased by organic amendments considerably but were not affected by N fertilization. The fluorescence excitation-emission matrix spectra (EEM) of WEOM were resolved to two humic-like components (C1 and C2) and two soluble microbial byproduct-like components (C3 and C4). The proportions of C1 and C2 were increased, while the proportion of C3 was decreased by both C and N management practices. In conclusion, organic amendments increased both WEOM quality and its proportion of humic-like components, whereas N fertilization increased the proportion of humic-like components without variations of WEOM quality in the topsoil of loess soil.

AB  - Background: Anthropogenic ammonia emissions, primarily derived from agriculture, lead to air pollution, soil acidification, and surface water eutrophication, all of which adversely affect human health and ecosystems. Slurry treatment technologies in the form of additives represent an underutilized means of reducing gaseous emissions. Information regarding the potential of additives to reduce ammonia in soil surface-applied slurries is scarce. Aim: This study aims to develop a N-15 mass balance technique to quantitatively measure ammonia losses from different slurries containing multiple additives that are applied to outdoor soil-filled containers. Methods: The experiments were performed under free-air conditions. Isotopically labeled slurries from biogas, cattle, and pigs containing 18 additives were surface-applied to soil-filled containers and exposed for 72 or 48 h. The additives included inorganic and organic adsorbents, five amounts of sulfuric acids, molasses +/- effective microorganisms, and water dilution. After termination of the ammonia loss period, a suite of soil preparation steps for the quantitative recovery of the labeled ammonium remaining in the soil was developed, and subsequently the loss of NH4-N was determined. Results: In the control treatments, ammonia losses from biogas, cattle slurries, and pig slurries averaged 54.4%, 33.9%, and 11.0%, respectively. The adsorbents did not decrease or only slightly decreased ammonia emissions. Ammonia abatement by sulfuric acid was nearly complete at pH values of 5.9 and 5.8 for the biogas and pig slurry, respectively, and about 80% at pH 5.2 for the cattle slurry. In comparison, more moderately decreased pH values with sulfuric acid showed a similar reduction as molasses and a 1:1 dilution for the three slurries. Adding microorganisms to the molasses did not further decrease ammonia losses. Conclusion: The newly developed N-15 mass balance technique, which allows a precise estimate of ammonia losses, can serve as a reference method to assess ammonia losses from field-applied slurries containing various additives and as a standard comparison technique for other ammonia measurement techniques.

AB  - The analysis of phenotypic variation patterns is pivotal in breeding programs when developing new cultivars to fully exploit allelic richness for specific purposes. In this study, we assessed 182 genotypes of elephant grass from partially inbred families, focusing on six phenotypic traits (dry matter yield-DMY, dry matter percentage-DM, number of tillers-NT, plant height-PH, stem diameter-SD, and leaf blade width-LW). Our goal was to quantify the genetic diversity necessary for the management of elephant grass breeding for energy production. Both univariate analysis (descriptive statistics) and multivariate analysis (Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components) were employed to investigate the diversity across partially inbred S1 family genotypes of elephant grass. Significant phenotypic variation was observed between the evaluated traits, with DMY, NT, and LW exhibiting the most pronounced differences. DMY, PH, and NT displayed positive correlations and demonstrated a robust ability to distinguish between the genotypes. Cluster analysis revealed four distinct groups of genotypes. The identification of taller plants with a higher number of tillers offers a valuable means of discriminating superior genotypes. This, in turn, enhances the selection of partial lines to develop new hybrid elephant grass cultivars with the aim of increasing energy biomass production.

AB  - Commercial herbal leys (multispecies swards) are rapidly gaining popularity due to their potential to deliver an enhanced suite of ecosystem services. However, little is known about their impact on lamb production. A 2-ha split-field experiment using an herbal and grass-clover ley (0.33 ha paddock-1, n = 3 per sward) aimed to evaluate the effect of sward-type on forage quality and lamb productivity. Lambs (n = 40 per sward) were rotationally grazed over two experimental seasons: autumn 2020 (males) and spring 2021 (females). Sward quality was measured at the start of each grazing season. Liveweight gain and faecal egg counts (FEC) were measured at week 0, 4 and 6 in autumn and week 0, 4, 9 and 11 in spring. Blood samples were analysed after 11weeks in spring to assess mineral status. General sward nutritional quality (e.g., crude protein) did not improve under the herbal ley, however, higher sward macro- and micronutrient concentrations were observed in both seasons. Spring liveweight gain was significantly greater in lambs grazing the herbal (172 +/- 7 g d-1) vs. grassclover ley (144 +/- 7 g d-1), while autumn liveweight gain showed no difference. Spring lambs grazing the herbal ley compared to the grass-clover ley had elevated plasma cobalt (2.0 +/- 0.1 nmol l- 1 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.1 nmol l- 1) and selenium (0.7 +/- 0.04 mu mol l- 1 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.01 mu mol l- 1), with lower blood urea (7.7 +/- 0.3 nmol l- 1 vs. 10.4 +/- 0.4 nmol l- 1). Spring FEC scores were reduced by 78 % in herbal grazed lambs; there were no significant differences in autumn FEC from either sward. In conclusion, the herbal ley resulted in seasonal improvements in sward micronutrient content and lamb parasite burden, mineral status, and productivity.

AB  - Simple Summary Planthopper outbreaks in rice are associated with excessive fertilizer applications. Public research has focused on developing resistant rice to combat these outbreaks. However, to preserve ecosystem resilience, natural enemy efficacy should be maintained on resistant and susceptible rice. We examined the impact of egg parasitoids on planthoppers (Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) [BPH] and Sogatella furcifera (Horvath) [WBPH]) and a leafhopper (Nephotettix virescens (Distant) [GLH]) in field plots of resistant (IR62) and susceptible (IR64) rice under low and high nitrogen. GLH and WBPH were more abundant in low-nitrogen plots during dry (GLH) and wet (GLH, WBPH) season sampling at an early crop stage. GLH were also more abundant on IR64. Parasitoids killed between 24 and 52% of planthopper eggs during exposures in trap plants. Parasitism by Oligosita and Anagrus wasps was higher on IR64 (BPH eggs) and in high-nitrogen plots (Oligosita spp. on BPH and WBPH eggs; Anagrus spp. on BPH eggs). Parasitism by Anagrus spp. was associated with the presence of honeydew and was highest where honeydew was derived from BPH feeding on IR62; these effects were only observed under high nitrogen. Results suggest that honeydew from IR62 favors parasitoids when plants are most vulnerable (i.e., under high nitrogen), thereby countering nitrogen-induced declines in host resistance. Host plant resistance is the most researched method for the management of planthoppers and leafhoppers in tropical rice. For optimal effects, resistance should be resilient to fertilizer inputs and work in synergy with natural enemies. In field plot experiments, we examined how rice resistance and fertilizer inputs affect mortality of planthopper and leafhopper eggs by hymenopteran parasitoids. We used IR62 as a variety with resistance to Nilaparvata lugens (Stal) [BPH], Sogatella furcifera (Horvath) [WBPH] and Nephotettix virescens (Distant) [GLH], and IR64 as a susceptible control. The herbivores were more abundant during wet season sampling in low-nitrogen plots. During this study, parasitoids killed between 31 and 38% of BPH eggs and 24 and 52% of WBPH eggs during four days of field exposure. Parasitism, mainly due to Oligosita spp., was generally higher in high-nitrogen and IR64 plots. Similar densities of eggs in exposed plants suggest that these trends were mediated by semiochemicals and therefore support the Optimal Defense Hypothesis. Honeydew from BPH on IR62 had more xylem-derived wastes than honeydew on IR64. We applied honeydew from both varieties to sentinel plants. Parasitism by Anagrus spp. was higher on plants of either variety treated with honeydew derived from IR62; however, the effect was only apparent in high-nitrogen plots. Results suggest that Anagrus spp., by responding to honeydew, will counter the nitrogen-induced enhancement of planthopper fitness on resistant rice.

AB  - The cultivation of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) is one of the most important crops in Ecuador. However, the presence of heavy metals in the soil is of concern, with cadmium (Cd) being one of the most worrisome contaminants, and its presence in the kernel has become a limiting factor for export. This work aimed to determine the capacity of arboreal plants to extract Cd. Therefore, nine species were evaluated in sandy-frank soil with 2.4 % MO and a pH of 6.2, contaminated with 3 mg/kg of Cd. The variables evaluated were dry matter, soil and rhizosphere pH, Cd concentration and content, and translocation factor. The weed species that showed high adaptability and absorbed significant amounts of Cd were Pseudelephantopus spiralis, Oplismenus burmannii, Geophila macropoda, and Ipomoea grandifolia. In contrast, Commelina difusa, Pseudelephantopus spiralis, Cissus verticillata, Epipomoea verticillata, and Epipremnum aureum functioned as metal stabilizers, indicating that they can be considered as hyperaccumulators of Cd, facilitating its safe removal from the soil.

AB  - Delphinids display a wide variety of social structures, in which local food availability and defensibility, sexual size dimorphism and interbirth intervals ultimately influence the role of kin within social units. Earlier studies of the social ecology of Risso's dolphins (Grampus griseus) off Pico Island, the Azores, revealed a sexually stratified social structure, with long-term stable, strongly associated male clusters and temporally weakly associated female clusters. Here we test the predictions that inclusive fitness plays a role in social cohesion and structure and that both sexes are philopatric in this population. We found no correlation between association and relatedness for either males or females. Our results therefore do not support inclusive fitness as an explanation for the stable clusters of males, who instead associate with partners of a similar age, less likely to be kin due to a long inter-birth interval. Genetic data did not reveal clear sex-biased dispersal. We propose that unlike the pattern seen in some other dolphin species, the socio-genetic structure found in Risso's dolphins is not associated with inclusive fitness but linked instead to the open oceanic habitat and the species' life history traits.Significance statement Studying societies of wild cetaceans poses additional challenges compared to terrestrial mammals, since we can generally only observe behavior when individuals come (close) to the surface for breathing. Yet such studies can expand our knowledge on the links between ecology and social structure (e.g. the remarkable parallels between societies of sperm whales and elephants). This study makes a meaningful contribution, by establishing that the long-term stable male and temporally stable female associations found in earlier studies of Risso's dolphins in the Azores are not based on kinship. Accordingly, despite very different ecological contexts, there are striking similarities between the male Risso's dolphin clusters and the second-order alliances found in male Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay, Australia. This offers great potential to enhance our understanding of drivers of male cooperation by further comparative research on two long-term studied systems.

In the deep oceanic habitat of Risso's dolphins, defense of food resources is not feasible, so associations by females in nurseries are likely primarily focused on cooperative defense against predation and male aggression. The availability of other females in similar reproductive states is independent of kinship, result-ing in low levels of relatedness between associated females.

AB  - Wild bull Asian elephants spend time in all-male groups. Therefore, managers of ex situ populations increasingly house bulls together. We examined the social interactions of five bull Asian elephants at Denver Zoo, using instantaneous sampling to compare social interactions across adolescent and mature bulls, and bulls with a social history prior to the integration of this group compared to bulls with no social history. Both age and social history significantly affected bull behavior. Adolescent bulls exhibited more affiliative and submissive behaviors when housed with mixed-age and mature social partners compared to with only adolescents, and less non-contact agonistic behavior and less time in proximity to a conspecific with mixed-age groups compared to with only other adolescents. Mature bulls exhibited more affiliative behavior when they were with only adolescent bulls compared to only mature bulls, and more time in proximity to a conspecific and increased contact agonistic behavior with at least one adolescent compared to only mature bulls. Bulls in new social groups engaged in more affiliative, agonistic, and submissive behaviors, and spent less time in proximity, than when they were in previously established social combinations. As more institutions house bulls socially, our results provide insights into factors that may affect bull social interactions.

AB  - Many plant species produce multiple leaf flushes during the growing season, which might have major consequences for within-plant variation in chemistry and species interactions. Yet, we lack a theoretical or empirical framework for how differences among leaf flushes might shape variation in damage by insects and diseases. We assessed the impact of leaf flush identity on leaf chemistry, insect attack and pathogen infection on the pedunculate oak Quercus robur by sampling leaves from each leaf flush in 20 populations across seven European countries during an entire growing season. The first leaf flush had higher levels of primary compounds, and lower levels of secondary compounds, than the second flush, whereas plant chemistry was highly variable in the third flush. Insect attack decreased from the first to the third flush, whereas infection by oak powdery mildew was lowest on leaves from the first flush. The relationship between plant chemistry, insect attack and pathogen infection varied strongly among leaf flushes and seasons. Our findings demonstrate the importance of considering differences among leaf flushes for our understanding of within-tree variation in chemistry, insect attack and disease levels, something particularly relevant given the expected increase in the number of leaf flushes with climate change.

AB  - Krameropteris is an extinct fern genus found in mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber, assigned to the Dennstaedtiaceae, with only one previously described species, i.e., K. resinatus. This study describes a new species, K. calophyllum, also preserved in Myanmar amber. The new species is characterized by branched venation with free veinlets terminating in thickened tips, multicellular hairs along the pinnule margins, and submarginal or medial exindusiate sori at the ends of veinlets. Its sporangia are polypod-type, producing trilete spores. This new species represents the second record of an extinct fern genus of the early-diverging Dennstaedtiaceae lineage found in Myanmar amber. Krameropteris calophyllum differs from K. resinatus in its pinnule epidermal characteristics and spore morphology, with the latter exhibiting a conspicuously ornamented perine, covered with sparse tubercles and ridges. The new species provides insights into potential herbivory interactions and the relationship between mid-Cretaceous polypod ferns and the smallest mite ever recorded. These findings suggest that Dennstaedtiaceae exhibited species-level diversity by the mid-Cretaceous, indicating an earlier origin of the family, potentially as early as the Early Jurassic, consistent with recent DNA-based time divergence estimates.

AB  - Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACACB) is a functional candidate gene that impacts fat deposition. In the present study, we sequenced exon 37-intron 37, exon 46-intron 46, and intron 47 of yak ACACB using hybrid pool sequencing to search for variants and genotyped the gene in 593 Gannan yaks via Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain (KASP) reaction to determine the effect of ACACB variants on carcass and meat quality traits. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in three regions. Eight effective haplotypes and ten diplotypes were constructed. Among them, a missense variation g.50421 A > G was identified in exon 37 of ACACB, resulting in an amino acid shift from serine to glycine. Correlation analysis revealed that this variation was associated with the cooking loss rate and yak carcass weight (p = 0.024 and 0.012, respectively). The presence of haplotypes H5 and H6 decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force (p = 0.049 and 0.006, respectively), whereas that of haplotypes H3 and H4 increased cooking loss rate and eye muscle area (p = 0.004 and 0.034, respectively). Moreover, the presence of haplotype H8 decreased the drip loss rate (p = 0.019). The presence of one and two copies of haplotypes H1 and H8 decreased the drip loss rate (p = 0.028 and 0.004, respectively). However, haplotype H1 did not decrease hot carcass weight (p = 0.011), whereas H3 increased the cooking loss rate (p = 0.007). The presence of one and two copies of haplotype H6 decreased Warner-Bratzler shear force (p = 0.014). The findings of the present study suggest that genetic variations in ACACB can be a preferable biomarker for improving yak meat quality.

AB  - This study aimed to demonstrate the importance of goat manure, sawdust, and green waste (lettuce, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage) as nutrient sources for soil and crops in family farming. Macro and micronutrient concentrations were determined. Two bio-composts were formed, one with a mixture of goat manure, sawdust and agricultural waste and the other without manure only sawdust and agricultural waste. The physicochemical properties of the soil, residues, and bio-compost were measured. Sawdust had high total organic carbon (TOC) and low total nitrogen (TN), P, K, Ca, and Mg levels, whereas goat manure had high TOC, TN, K, Ca, Mg, and P levels. The soil treated with the solid bio-composts (with and without goat manure) had significant effects, with the pH value reaching 7.0, suggesting that the bio-composts were safe for agricultural use. The manure biocompost was rich in TOC, TN, P, Ca, and K macronutrients but poor in Mg. The manure-free bio-compost had high TOC and TN levels. However, both bio-composts had low C:N ratios. Finally, the experiments revealed high Fe and Mn and low Cu and Zn concentrations. These results clearly revealed that growth of maximum plant height (71 cm) were significantly influenced by bio-compost and suggest that the levels of TOC, TN, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Cu, and Zn were reliable and thus do not present restrictions for agricultural use.

AB  - Background and Aims Floral volatiles, visual traits and rewards mediate attraction and defence in plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions, but these floral traits might be altered by global warming through direct effects of temperature or longer-term impacts on plant resources. We examined the effect of warming on floral and leaf volatile emissions, floral morphology, plant height, nectar production, and oviposition by seed predators.
   Methods We used open-top chambers that warmed plants in the field by +2-3 degrees C on average (+6-11 degrees C increase in daily maxima) for 2-4 weeks across 1-3 years at three sites in Colorado, USA. Volatiles were sampled from two closely related species of subalpine Ipomopsis with different pollinators: Ipomopsis aggregata ssp. aggregata, visited mainly by hummingbirds, and Ipomopsis tenuituba ssp. tenuituba, often visited by hawkmoths.
   Key Results Although warming had no detected effects on leaf volatiles, the daytime floral volatiles of both I. aggregata and I. tenuituba responded in subtle ways to warming, with impacts that depended on the species, site and year. In addition to the long-term effect of warming, temperature at the time of sampling independently affected the floral volatile emissions of I. aggregata during the day and I. tenuituba at night. Warming had little effect on floral morphology for either species and it had no effect on nectar concentration, maximum inflorescence height or flower redness in I. aggregata. However, warming increased nectar production in I. aggregata by 41 %, a response that would attract more hummingbird visits, and it reduced oviposition by fly seed predators by >= 72 %.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that floral traits can show different levels of plasticity to temperature changes in subalpine environments, with potential effects on animal behaviours that help or hinder plant reproduction. They also illustrate the need for more long-term field warming studies, as shown by responses of floral volatiles in different ways to weeks of warming vs. temperature at the time of sampling.

AB  - Black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens L. BSFL) bioconversion is a promising biotechnology for food waste treatment. However, the separated residues still do not meet criteria for use as land application biofertilizers. In this work, we investigated a full-scale BSFL bioconversion project to explore features of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and its associated responses of bacterial community succession in residue during secondary composting. Data showed that the concentrations of total nitrogen and ammonium nitrogen decreased by 11.8% and 22.6% during the secondary composting, respectively, while the nitrate nitrogen concentration increased 18.7 times. The DOM concentration decreased by 69.1%, in which protein-like, alcohol-phenol, and biodegradable aliphatic substances were metabolized by bacteria during the thermophilic phase together with the accumulation of humus-like substances, resulting in an increase in the relative concentration of aromatic compounds. The structure of the bacterial community varied at different stages of the bioprocess, in which Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes were the dominant bacterial phyla. Lysinibacillus, Pusillimonas, and Caldicoprobacter were found to be key contributors in the degradation and formation of DOM. The DOM concentration (33.4%) and temperature (17.7%) were the prime environmental factors that promoted succession of the bacterial community. Through bacterial metabolism, the structural stability of DOM components was improved during the composting process, and the degrees of humification and aromaticity were also increased. This study depicted the dynamic features of DOM and the associated bacterial community succession in residue during secondary composting, which is conducive with the reuse of BSFL residue as biofertilizer for agriculture.

AB  - The objective of this study is to discover how wild honey and sugar ratios used in goat milk yogurt formulations affect physical, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) growth and sensory analysis. Four distinct goat milk yogurt formulations were developed: goat milk yogurt with additions of 8% honey (HH), 6% honey and 2% sugar (LS), 4% honey and 4% sugar (MH), and 2% honey and 6% sugar (LH). 8% sugar was added to goat milk yogurt sample to create a control sample (HS). The goat milk yogurt's pH, color, moisture content, acidity, and lactic acid bacteria count were determined. A total of 40 untrained panelists performed a sensory assessment to gauge consumer acceptance of the goat milk yogurt with different honey composition. For all of the formulations, the physical examination of moisture content, pH, and titratable acidity revealed values between 70.61% and 79.90%, 4.36 and 4.53, and 0.60% and 0.95%, respectively. The L*, a*, and b* values for all of the formulations were between 56.24 and 63.40, (-1.62) and (-2.40), and 4.56 and 5.76, respectively, for the color analysis. The lactic acid bacteria count ranged from 3.06 to 5.49 log cfu/ml, with HS recorded the highest number. LH yogurt was found to be most preferred by the panelist than other yogurt compositions. It can be concluded that the incorporation of honey at 2% improved the goat milk yogurt characteristics and has potential to be developed into new goat milk based products.

AB  - The results of the study of plant communities of Mountainous Dagestan with the rare endemic species goat's-wheat (Atraphaxis daghestanica (Lovelius) Lovelius) are given. The taxonomic structure of communities is considered, geo-elements are analyzed, and endemic species of the Caucasus are identified. We have described 79 plant species assigned to 65 genera and 31 families in communities with A. daghestanica. The analysis of the flora shows the domination of the Caucasian xerophilic element of the boreal group of species, which testifies to the great autochthony of the development of communities with the participation of the rare species A. daghestanica in the arid part of the Eastern Caucasus and to the high proportion of endemics: among 18 species, there are 11 (61%) endemics of the Caucasus, two endemics of the Greater Caucasus, and five endemics of the Eastern Caucasus. The results of the study of these communities are presented for the first time and may be used for monitoring rare endemic species growing in arid conditions of the Eastern Caucasus.

AB  - Global increases in habitat loss and fragmentation have resulted in non-habitat landcover, or the matrix, becoming an increasingly prominent feature of landscapes. The matrix can influence the population dynamics of species in fragments by modifying processes operating locally on individual patches (e.g. edge effects on survival) or at landscape scales (e.g. inter-patch dispersal). However, the relative magnitude of patch- vs. landscape-scale matrix effects on the populations found in patches remains unclear. We established 12 experimental landscapes in which we controlled for habitat amount and fragmentation while manipulating the quality of the matrix around (i) individual habitat patches and (ii) across the entire landscape in a factorial design. We then compared the magnitude of local- and landscape-scale matrix effects on a specialist herbivore, Chelinidea vittiger (Hemiptera: Coreidae). Population size in fragments was influenced by both patch- and landscape-scale treatments: Population size increased in patches surrounded by high-quality matrix, but only in landscapes dominated by low-quality matrix, due in part to decreased inter-patch movements in these landscapes. In contrast, the effects on both survival and reproductive output were solely at the patch-scale, with both lower in patches surrounded by low-quality matrix. Our results underscore the outsized importance of matrix habitat immediately adjacent to fragment edges-despite the fact that patch-scale manipulations affected only a fraction (3%) of the area that landscape-scale manipulations did, patch-scale effects were more common. The relationship between dispersal, population size and scale-dependent effects of matrix quality emphasizes the need to explicitly consider the spatial scale at which different processes operate when predicting responses to habitat fragmentation. Our results also suggest the matrix immediately adjacent to habitat remnants is of particular importance when considering alternative strategies for landscape conservation or restoration.

AB  - While both daytime and nighttime temperatures are increasing with climate change, few studies have experimentally investigated their differential effects under field conditions. We conducted a factorial field experiment examining how day- and night-warming impact the growth, survivorship, and behavior of cabbage white caterpillars (Pieris rapae). In this experiment, the night-warming only treatment showed the highest rates of caterpillar growth, but also showed the highest mortality, the shortest maximum caterpillar lengths, the least accumulated herbivory, and reduced pupation. Caterpillars in the treatments that were not warmed during the day showed daytime-shifted growth, and caterpillars in the combined day- and night-warming treatment showed strongly night-shifted herbivory. Both biotic (e.g., predation risk) and abiotic (e.g., thermal) factors could have contributed to these results. Broadly, these results show the importance of temperature-mediated behavioral changes in diel activity for caterpillar development and survival. These results also support the emerging hypotheses that periods of reduced activity may be important for successful development, that warmer nighttime conditions could limit a temporal thermal refuge for caterpillars, and that increasing temperatures could increase the likelihood of metabolic meltdown. This experiment also illustrates the value of field studies to provide insights into how ectotherms might respond to ongoing climate change.

AB  - The phenotypic diversity resulting from artificial or natural selection of sheep has made a significant contribution to human civilization. Hu sheep are a local sheep breed unique to China with high reproductive rates and rapid growth. Genomic selection signatures have been widely used to investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic variation in livestock. Here, we conduct whole-genome sequencing of 207 Hu sheep and compare them with the wild ancestors of domestic sheep (Asiatic mouflon) to investigate the genetic characteristics and selection signatures of Hu sheep. Based on six signatures of selection approaches, we detect genomic regions containing genes related to reproduction (BMPR1B, BMP2, PGFS, CYP19, CAMK4, GGT5, and GNAQ), vision (ALDH1A2, SAG, and PDE6B), nervous system (NAV1), and immune response (GPR35, SH2B2, PIK3R3, and HRAS). Association analysis with a population of 1299 Hu sheep reveals that those missense mutations in the GPR35 (GPR35 g.952651 A>G; GPR35 g.952496 C>T) and NAV1 (NAV1 g.84216190 C>T; NAV1 g.84227412 G>A) genes are significantly associated (P <0.05) with immune and growth traits in Hu sheep, respectively. This research offers unique insights into the selection characteristics of Hu sheep and facilitates further genetic improvement and molecular investigations.

AB  - Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are eliminated from wastewater on wastewater treatment plants, and can enter sludge treatment areas along with sludge that is often composted and subsequently used as fertilizer. The objective of this study was: i) to compare the concentrations of PPCPs before and after composting of sewage sludge (SS) that is important for producers of composts and policy makers, ii) to quantify an effect of composting process on decomposition of PPCPs, iii) to find out relationship between PPCPs, selected chemical properties and microorganisms. The experiment was conducted over a duration of four months with sewage sludge mixed with straw pellets (SPs) in various proportions. The concentrations of PPCPs in the input materials were measured before the composting began, and in the compost at the end of the trial. Of all 12 monitored PPCPs, telmisartan showed the highest concentrations (up to two orders of magnitude). Composting has a positive effect on the breakdown of caffeine, citalopram, diclofenac, mirtazapine, venlafaxine and partially sulfapyridine. Conversely, the decomposition of amitriptyline, carbamazepine, cetirizine, ibuprofen, telmisartan, and triclosan was not influenced by the composting process. All analyzed PPCPs had significant (p < 0.001) positive correlations with pH, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. However, a significant (p < 0.001) negative correlation was seen with PPCPs and total carbon, the carbonto-nitrogen ratio, bacteria, actinobacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and total microbial biomass. Composting technology should be further investigated and optimized for its potential to reduce the concentration of PPCPs in sewage sludge.

AB  - Purpose Theileriosis is an economically important tick-borne pathogen with a serious impact on livestock health and productivity. Despite the fact that bovine theileriosis has been widely investigated, there exists a paucity of information on these infections in small ruminants, especially in India. The present study was carried out to detect and differentiate different Theileria spp. in goats using nested PCR RFLP. Methods Blood samples and ticks were collected from 405 goats in various agro-climatic zones of Haryana state, India. The blood samples were screened by microscopy, nested PCR-RFLP, and sequence analysis. The nested PCR-RFLP was performed with four restriction enzymes viz., Hpa II, Bsh 1285I, Hae II and Rsa I. Six nested PCR amplicons with different RFLP patterns were sequenced and submitted to NCBI (OM666861, MZ220430, OM666628, MZ220437, OM666637, OM721806). Results Microscopy revealed 18.27% (n = 74) infection with Theileria spp., while 33.58% (n = 136) of blood samples were confirmed positive by nested PCR. Out of 136 positive samples, 43.38% (n = 59), 11.02% (n = 15) and 20.58% (n = 28), were positive for T. ovis, T. lestoquardi and T. luwenshuni (Theileria sp. China 1), respectively. Mixed infection was detected in 25% (n = 34) cases. Based upon Hpa II digestion pattern, 13 samples with T. lestoquardi and T. ovis, and 21 samples with T. ovis and T. luwenshuni were detected. Sequence study further confirmed their identity. The majority of ticks collected from goats were identified as Rhipicephalus spp., Hyalomma anatolicum and Hemaphysalis spp. Conclusion This study represents the first confirmed molecular report of goats infected with T. ovis, T. lestoquardi, and T. luwenshuni from northern India.

AB  - Gene-by-environment interactions influence brain development from conception to adulthood. In particular, the prenatal period is a window of vulnerability for the interplay between environmental and genetic factors to influence brain development. Rodent and human research demonstrates that prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) alters hippocampal volumes. Although PNMS affects hippocampal size on average, similar degrees of PNMS lead to different effects in different individuals. This differential susceptibility to the effects of PNMS may be due to genetic variants. Hence, we investigated the role of genetic variants of two SNPs that are candidates to moderate the effects of PNMS on hippocampal volume: COMT (rs4680) and BDNF (rs6265). To investigate this, we assessed 53 children who were in utero during the January 1998 Quebec ice storm. In June 1998 their mothers responded to questionnaires about their objective, cognitive, and subjective levels of stress from the ice storm. When children were 11 1/2 years old, T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained using a 3T scanner and analyzed to determine hippocampal volumes. We collected and genotyped the children's saliva DNA. Moderation analyses were conducted to determine whether either or both of the SNPs moderate the effect of PNMS on hippocampal volumes. We found that objective hardship was associated with right hippocampal volume in girls, and that the BDNF and COMT genotypes were associated with left hippocampal volume in boys and girls. In addition, SNPs located on COMT moderated the effect of maternal objective distress in boys, and subjective distress in girls, on both right hippocampal volume. Thus, we conclude that an individual's genotype alters their susceptibility to the effects of PNMS.

AB  - Whole genome sequencing is instrumental for the study of genome variation in natural populations, delivering important knowledge on genomic modifications and potential targets of natural selection at the population level. Large dormant eggbanks of aquatic invertebrates such as the keystone herbivore Daphnia, a microcrustacean widespread in freshwater ecosystems, provide detailed sedimentary archives to study genomic processes over centuries. To overcome the problem of limited DNA amounts in single Daphnia dormant eggs, we developed an optimized workflow for whole genome amplification (WGA), yielding sufficient amounts of DNA for downstream whole genome sequencing of individual historical eggs, including polyploid lineages. We compare two WGA kits, applied to recently produced Daphnia magna dormant eggs from laboratory cultures, and to historical dormant eggs of Daphnia pulicaria collected from Arctic lake sediment between 10 and 300 years old. Resulting genome coverage breadth in most samples was similar to 70%, including those from >100-year-old isolates. Sequence read distribution was highly correlated among samples amplified with the same kit, but less correlated between kits. Despite this, a high percentage of genomic positions with single nucleotide polymorphisms in one or more samples (maximum of 74% between kits, and 97% within kits) were recovered at a depth required for genotyping. As a by-product of sequencing we obtained 100% coverage of the mitochondrial genomes even from the oldest isolates (similar to 300 years). The mitochondrial DNA provides an additional source for evolutionary studies of these populations. We provide an optimized workflow for WGA followed by whole genome sequencing including steps to minimize exogenous DNA.

AB  - Simple Summary Sheep are bred to provide livestock products for humans. At present, sheep production systems tend to be specialized and refined, and mutton sheep production is an important part of these systems. Compared to Chinese indigenous sheep breeds, Western sheep breeds have rapid growth rate, larger physique, and higher meat yield. Growth rate and body size are critical to mutton sheep production. The population structure and genome-wide selection signatures can be used to identify genetic differences in sheep growth rate and body size. Therefore, in this study, a genome-wide investigation of the growth rate and body size between Chinese indigenous sheep breeds and introduced sheep breeds was performed. Furthermore, we also investigated the tail length trait between long- and short-tailed sheep breeds. The results showed that we identified candidate genes associated with growth rate, body size, and tail type, and elucidated the potential function of these genes.Abstract Compared to Chinese indigenous sheep, Western sheep have rapid growth rate, larger physique, and higher meat yield. These excellent Western sheep were introduced into China for crossbreeding to expedite the enhancement of production performance and mutton quality in local breeds. Here, we investigated population genetic structure and genome-wide selection signatures among the Chinese indigenous sheep and the introduced sheep based on whole-genome resequencing data. The PCA, N-J tree and ADMIXTURE results showed significant genetic difference between Chinese indigenous sheep and introduced sheep. The nucleotide diversity (pi) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay results indicated that the genomic diversity of introduced breeds were lower. Then, Fst & pi ratio, XP-EHH, and de-correlated composite of multiple signals (DCMS) methods were used to detect the selection signals. The results showed that we identified important candidate genes related to growth rate and body size in the introduced breeds. Selected genes with stronger selection signatures are associated with growth rate (CRADD), embryonic development (BVES, LIN28B, and WNT11), body size (HMGA2, MSRB3, and PTCH1), muscle development and fat metabolism (MSTN, PDE3A, LGALS12, GGPS1, and SAR1B), wool color (ASIP), and hair development (KRT71, KRT74, and IRF2BP2). Thus, these genes have the potential to serve as candidate genes for enhancing the growth traits of Chinese indigenous sheep. We also identified tail-length trait-related candidate genes (HOXB13, LIN28A, PAX3, and VEGFA) in Chinese long-tailed breeds. Among these genes, HOXB13 is the main candidate gene for sheep tail length phenotype. LIN28A, PAX3, and VEGFA are related to embryonic development and angiogenesis, so these genes may be candidate genes for sheep tail type traits. This study will serve as a foundation for further genetic improvement of Chinese indigenous sheep and as a reference for studies related to growth and development of sheep.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore how interactions between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) affect oxidative properties, nitrosative properties, and myofibrillar protein degradation during postmortem aging of yak meat. RESULTS: Yak longissimus dorsi was incubated with saline, ROS activator (H2O2)/inhibitor N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and RNS activator S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)/inhibitor L-NAME hydrochloride (L-NAME) combined treatments at 4 degrees C for 12, 24, 72, 120, and 168 h. The results indicated that regardless of whether RNS was activated or inhibited, activated ROS played a dominant role in myofibrillar protein degradation by oxidative modification to increase carbonyl content, disulfide bonds, surface hydrophobicity, and dimerized tyrosine while decreasing sulfhydryl content, thereby degrading nebulin, titin, troponin-t and desmin. Notably, the Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of the H2O2 +L-NAME group was the smallest, whereas that of the NAC + GSNO group was smaller than that of the NAC +L-NAME group. CONCLUSION: These findings provide new insights into meat tenderization patterns through the interaction between ROS and RNS. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Simple Summary Tritrophic interactions have achieved much attention in research on ecology. The tea plant Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze is a major economic crop in Asian countries, especially in China. Tea plants suffer infestations from herbivory attack during their lifetime. The tea green leafhopper (Empoasca onukii Matsuda) is a major pest for tea plants. The parasitic or predatory natural enemies of tea green leafhoppers (TGLs) can feed on their eggs, nymphs, or adults. However, a detailed mathematical model for tea plants-TGLs-natural enemies is still lacking. In the current work, we established a novel model based on laboratory measurements or field observations with temperature-dependent effects on tritrophic interactions for tea ecosystems. As expected, cyclic behaviors are identified. Stochastic simulations further showed two TGL outbreaks, the timing of which is consistent with field observations. Effective accumulated temperature (EAT) is possibly an important predictor of TGL outbreak. Applying slow-releasing semiochemicals as either repellents or attractants may be highly efficacious for pest biocontrol. An optimal treatment time of semiochemicals can also be determined. Our detailed model identifies key features of tritrophic interactions involving tea plants and can be extended to other ecosystems. The tea green leaf hopper, Empoasca onukii Matsuda, is a severe pest of tea plants. Volatile emissions from tea shoots infested by the tea green leafhopper may directly repel insect feeding or attract natural enemies. Many studies have been conducted on various aspects of the tritrophic relationship involving tea plants, tea green leafhoppers and natural enemies. However, mathematic models which could explain the dynamic mechanisms of this tritrophic interaction are still lacking. In the current work, we constructed a realistic and stochastic model with temperature-dependent features to characterize the tritrophic interactions in the tea agroecosystem. Model outputs showed that two leafhopper outbreaks occur in a year, with their features being consistent with field observations. Simulations showed that daily average effective accumulated temperature (EAT) might be an important metric for outbreak prediction. We also showed that application of slow-releasing semiochemicals, as either repellents or attractants, may be highly efficacious for pest biocontrol and can significantly increase tea yields. Furthermore, the start date of applying semiochemicals can be optimized to effectively increase tea yields. The current model qualitatively characterizes key features of the tritrophic interactions and provides critical insight into pest control in tea ecosystems.

AB  - In territorial species, individuals need to regularly patrol their territory to display visual, auditory or olfactory signals or to detect the presence of intruders. Although territorial movements are often conceptualized as animals travelling along the boundaries of their territories ('border-patrolling' behaviour), the distribution of territorial cues could also match the distribution of resources when resources are spatially heterogeneous in their availability and found in stable patches, leading to the emergence of 'multiple central-place territories'. Here, we explored how territoriality may shape the spatial behaviour of African lions, Panthera leo, in a savannah where waterholes are associated with aggregations of large herbivores throughout the year and are therefore well-known prey hotspots and key hunting sites for large carnivores. We hypothesized that male lions would be more likely to patrol a buffer area around the territory core to defend a core area where social interactions with groupmates occur, whereas female lions would more specifically patrol hunting sites, that is, waterhole areas. However, we found that both female and male lions repeatedly moved along straight paths between the waterholes located both in the core and in the periphery of their territories, potentially to defend multiple central-place territories driven by the distribution of waterholes in the landscape. These findings illustrate a case where territorial animals specifically mark feeding sites, increasing the renewal of territorial cues at these key places, potentially using long-distance territorial cues (that is, vocalizations) to mark uncovered areas, and thereby reducing the cost of patrolling large territories.

AB  - Background Our understanding of movement patterns and behaviours of wildlife has advanced greatly through the use of improved tracking technologies, including application of accelerometry (ACC) across a wide range of taxa. However, most ACC studies either use intermittent sampling that hinders continuity or continuous data logging relying on tracker retrieval for data downloading which is not applicable for long term study. To allow long-term, fine-scale behavioural research, we evaluated a range of machine learning methods for their suitability for continuous on-board classification of ACC data into behaviour categories prior to data transmission. Methods We tested six supervised machine learning methods, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to classify behaviour using ACC data from three bird species (white stork Ciconia ciconia, griffon vulture Gyps fulvus and common crane Grus grus) and two mammals (dairy cow Bos taurus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus). Results Using a range of quality criteria, SVM, ANN, RF and XGBoost performed well in determining behaviour from ACC data and their good performance appeared little affected when greatly reducing the number of input features for model training. On-board runtime and storage-requirement tests showed that notably ANN, RF and XGBoost would make suitable on-board classifiers. Conclusions Our identification of using feature reduction in combination with ANN, RF and XGBoost as suitable methods for on-board behavioural classification of continuous ACC data has considerable potential to benefit movement ecology and behavioural research, wildlife conservation and livestock husbandry.

AB  - Predation is a powerful selective pressure and probably a driver of why many animal species live in groups. One key explanation for the evolution of sociality is the 'selfish herd' model, which describes how individuals who stay close to others effectively put neighbours between themselves and a predator to survive incoming attacks. This model is often illustrated with reference to herds of ungulates, schools of fish or flocks of birds. Yet in nature, when a predator strikes, herds are often found fleeing cohesively in the same direction, not jostling for position in the centre of the group. This paper highlights a critical assumption of the original model, namely that prey do not move in response to position of their predator. In this model, I relax this assumption and find that individuals who adopt 'selfish herd' behaviour are often more likely to be captured, because they end up at the back of a fleeing herd. By contrast, individuals that adopt a rule of 'neighbour to neighbour alignment' are able to avoid rearmost positions in a moving herd. Alignment is more successful than selfish herding across much of the parameter space, which may explain why highly aligned fleeing behaviour is commonly observed in nature.

AB  - An energy information flow-based ecological risk assessment framework (EIF-ERA) is developed for identifying ecological risk transmission rules among communities (i.e., vegetation E1, herbivorous animals E2, soil microorganisms E3, and carnivorous animals E4) within the heavy metals contaminated soil system. This framework is integrated with numerous techniques of carcinogenic risk evaluation, ecological risk assessment (ERA), and Monte Carlo simulation. Stepwise quadratic response surface analysis (SQRSA) is employed for reflecting the relation between contaminants' concentration and comprehensive risk. Two scenarios with respect to the environmental quality standards (scenarios 1) and carcinogenic risk reversion (scenarios 2) are merged into the EIF-ERA. A real-world mining area in Xinglong County in Chengde is selected to verify the developed framework's effectiveness. Results reveal that E3 is considered as the most sensitive community when contaminant interference occurs, and its 62.3% and 37.7% of comprehensive risk are contributed by initial and direct risks, respectively. Other communities can receive direct risk through control allocation (CA). Monte Carlo anlysis shows that there are 7.68% and 20.25% increase in the initial risk of Cd and Pb when their quantile statistics increase from 70% to 90%. Determination of an appropriate screening value is vital for contaminated mining soil remediation due to its inefficiency of remediation funds, especially when considering the trict standards of contaminants' concentration within scenarios 1. The surrogates obtained from the SQRSA display the relation of contaminant concentration and comprehensive risks with the adjusted R2 greater than 0.77. These findings can be in support of system design, risk assessment, and site remediation.

AB  - Oilseed by-products (Cynara cardunculus and Camelina sativa) (CCCS) are rich in bioactive compounds. This study aimed to evaluate the health effects of consuming yogurt made from goat milk fed with CCCS industrial residues in adults. In this randomized, crossover clinical trial, 20 healthy adults (14F; 37.7 +/- 14.2 years) consumed either yogurt made from goat milk fed with CCCS or regular goat yogurt (C) daily for 1 month in each phase. Anthropometric parameters and blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of each phase. CCCS yogurt consumption resulted in a significant fat mass reduction (-1.8% and -1.1 kg) and fat-free mass increase (+1.5% and +0.9 kg). Regarding blood parameters, a non-significant decrease in triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol was observed, particularly after the CCCS intervention. Moreover, creatinine levels exhibited an opposite trend (p = 0.023) after CCCS, decreasing in subjects aged <= 30 years (-0.03 mg/dL) and increasing in older subjects (+0.05 mg/dL). Regarding inflammatory parameters, a non-significant trend in increased IL-1ra levels was observed especially after CCCS yogurt consumption compared to the C yogurt (+56.9 vs. +19.1 pg/mL, respectively). The use of unconventional feed derived from oilseed by-products for dairy goat feeding may have potential possible beneficial effects on human health.

AB  - Pig, cow, and sheep manure (PM, CM, and SM) are inevitable byproducts of agricultural economic development. Converting them into high add-on value biochar (PMB, CMB, and SMB) via pyrolysis is an efficient resource utilization measure. Phosphorus (P) speciation analyses help ensure the practical feasibility of the P reclamation of animal manure and their derived biochar and a reduction in environmental risk. This study conducted a modified extraction procedure to separate five inorganic P (IP) (soluble and loosely bound IP, aluminum-bound IP, Fe-bound IP, oxide-occluded IP, and Ca-bound IP) and organic P (OP) speciations, and combined X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the major phosphate compound in the derived biochar after pyrolysis. Results revealed that more than 92% of P is concentrated in the derived biochar during pyrolysis processes carried out at 200-800 & DEG;C. The percentages of soluble and loosely bound IP, aluminum-bound IP, and OP in manure decreased significantly due to their transformation into more stable P fractions such as Ca-bound IP (79.01% in PMB, 800 & DEG;C) after pyrolysis. The Olsen-P percentages had a distinct reduction at 650 & DEG;C, indicating that pyrolysis at 650 & DEG;C was the optimal condition for the reduction in Olsen-P in manure.

AB  - In Mongolia, overuse and degradation of groundwater is a serious issue, mainly in the urban and economic hub in Ulaanbaatar, and the Southern Gobi mining hub. The authors have recently applied a process-based eco-hydrology model, NICE (National Integrated Catchment-based Eco-hydrology) to these two contrasting river basins in order to explicitly quantify spatio-temporal variations in water availability. In this study, they further extended the model to couple with inverse method for sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation of anthropogenic water uses (NICE-INVERSE). The model quantified the spatio-temporal variations of livestock water use in these river basins in comparison with the estimated values by aggregating statistical data, GIS data, observation data, and field surveys in their previous studies. The amount of water use by animals were generally small for each soum (district), and could also be heavily returned back to the ecosystems. The result also showed a temporal decreasing trend of unit water use in some typical livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats), suggesting a substantial increase in water stress due to local regional eco-hydrological degradation by urbanization and mining. These results clarified the substantial increase in water stress of groundwater degradation was mainly caused by urbanization and mining locally in addition to climatic change. Sensitivity analysis and inverse estimation of model parameters helped to improve the accuracy of hydrologic budgets in basins. This methodology is powerful for evaluating spatio-temporal variations of water availability in regions with fewer inventory data on urbanization, mining, and livestock.

AB  - Simple Summary A study was carried out from August 2017 to February 2018 on lactating dairy cows, one-humped dromedary camels, and goats to determine mastitis in the Bule Hora and Dugda Dawa districts of in Southern Ethiopia. Milk samples from 564 udder quarters and udder halves from 171 animals consisting of 60 dairy cows, 51 camels, and 60 goats were tested for mastitis. Sixty-four positive udder milk samples were cultured, and bacterial mastitis pathogens were isolated and identified. The antibiotic resistance of bacterial isolates from milk with mastitis was tested against nine antimicrobials commonly used in the study area. Cow-level prevalence of mastitis in dairy cows, camels, and goats was 33.3%, 26.3%, and 25%, respectively. The quarter-level prevalence of mastitis in cows, camels and goats was 17.6%, 14.5%, and 20%, respectively. In cattle, the prevalence was significantly higher in Dugda Dawa than in Bule Hora. Major bacterial isolates were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (39.1%), S. aureus (17.2%), S. hyicus (14.1%), and S. intermedius and Escherichia coli (9.4% each). In camels, udder abnormality and mastitis were significantly higher in late lactation than in early lactation. Mastitis tends to increase with parity in camels. E. coli isolates were highly resistant to spectinomycin, vancomycin, and doxycycline, whereas most S. aureus isolates were multidrug-resistant. Most of the rural and periurban communities in this area consume raw milk, which indicates a high risk of infection with multidrug-resistant bacteria. We recommend community-focused training programs to improve community awareness of the risk of raw milk consumption and the need to boil milk.

AB  - Fleas (Insecta, Siphonaptera) are small, laterally flattened, wingless, and highly specialized insects. Fleas are one of the major haematophagous, belligerent ectoparasites which cause dermatitis in man and animals. Present study puts on record, severe oriental cat flea infestation on Osmanabadi goat kids at Chhattisgarh state in central India. During farm investigations, twelve ailing kids showed flea infestation, lethargy, pale mucous membrane, weight loss and dehydration. From infested goats, about 1395 fleas were collected in 70% alcohol and identified as Ctenocephalides orientis. Haematology of ailing kids revealed marked leucocytosis with neutrophilia, erythrocytic anisocytosis, microcytic hypochromic anaemia and absence of haemoparasites. Necropsy of two kids which succumbed to flea infestation revealed profound anaemic changes characterised by paleness in vital organs. Infested kids and adult goats were treated with Fipronil spray (0.25% w/v), haematinics and the farm manager was advised to follow hygienic practices in the farm. For the protection of animals from flea infestation, it is necessary to adopt a combined approach which involves judicious use of insecticides along with the adoption of proper managemental practices.

AB  - Severe bushfires in South-Eastern Australia during the summer of 2019/2020 killed tens of thousands of livestock, while many more survived on fire-affected properties. At the time, the literature on bushfire and livestock in Australia primarily described animals with burns. The mid- to long-term health effects, if any, of fire exposure and the effectiveness of recovery activities for surviving animals and farm enterprises were rarely reported. This study aimed to describe the key impacts of bushfire exposure on the health, welfare, and management of surviving cattle and sheep to inform recommendations for future fire-affected farmers and to guide future research. As part of a broad research programme, data on bushfire experiences, consequences for the livestock and the farm enterprise, and lessons learnt were gathered through face-to-face interviews and an online survey, collating information from 58 fire-affected farmers. A variety of health conditions at low frequency were reported in livestock surviving bushfires, including respiratory disease, eye disease, ruminal acidosis, lameness, and plant toxicities. No single disease was observed widely across participating farms, with many conditions likely associated with management changes post-fire rather than direct fire exposure. A variety of management and farm biosecurity challenges were also described by farmers. Key strategies for the prevention and treatment of health conditions in livestock post-bushfire include supporting effective farm management through the challenges of post-fire recovery and early detection for treatment on a case-by-case basis.

AB  - Among the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), chronic wasting disease (CWD) in cervids is now a rising concern in wildlife within Europe, after the detection of the first case in Norway in 2016, in a wild reindeer and until June 2022 a total of 34 cases were described in Norway, Sweden and Finland. The definite diagnosis is post-mortem, performed in target areas of the brain and lymph nodes. Samples are first screened using a rapid test and, if positive, confirmed by immunohistochemistry and Western immunoblotting. The study of the genetics of the prion protein gene, PRNP, has been proved to be a valuable tool for determining the relative susceptibility to TSEs. In the present study, the exon 3 of PRNP gene of 143 samples from red deer (Cervus elaphus) and fallow deer (Dama dama) of Portugal was analysed. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were found in red deer - codon A136A, codon T98A, codon Q226E - and no sequence variation was detected in fallow deer. The low genetic diversity found in our samples is compatible with previous studies in Europe. The comparison with results from North America suggests that the free-ranging deer from our study may present susceptibility to CWD, although lack of experimental data and the necessity of continuous survey are necessary to evaluate these populations.

AB  - Economic value from protected areas informs decisions for biodiversity conservation and visitor benefits. Calculating these benefits assists governments to allocate limited budget resources. This study estimated tourism ecosystem service expenditure values for a regional protected area network in South Australia (57 parks) using direct transactional data, travel costs and economic multipliers. The big dataset came from a comprehensive booking system, which helped overcome common limitations associated with survey data (e.g., key areas rather than full network and high zero-value observations). Protected areas returned AU$373.8 million in the 2018-19 base year to the South Australian economy. The results indicate that combined estimation methods coupled to big data sets provide information on baseline expenditure to engage with critical conservation and tourism sites (e.g., Kangaroo Island). In this case they offer a unique full area network expenditure estimate which is an improvement on typical survey approaches, highlighting the advantage of protected area managers investing in big data. Finally, as South Australian protected areas exceed that in many other contexts the study offers important inputs to funding narratives and protected area expansion in line with global assessment targets.

AB  - This study investigated the differences in meat quality during postmortem aging of yak meat from different altitudes as well as the relationship between the release of hypoxic factor HIF-1 alpha and meat quality. The results showed that the HIF-1 alpha increased with altitude but during aging process, there was an initial increase before a subsequent decrease (p < .05). Moreover, significant increases were showed in glycolytic potential, a* value, pH, HIF-1 alpha mRNA expression, HIF-1 alpha protein expression and shear force with altitude (p < .05). Additionally, the b* value, L* value, water holding power and MFI decreased significantly (p < .05). HIF-1 alpha was shown, by PLS-DA method analysis, to be the main protein marker for differences in the quality during aging time of meat from three altitude groups. HIF-1 alpha protein expression was high correlated with glycolytic potential, pH value, meat color, tenderness and water holding capacity during postmortem aging. The results demonstrated that HIF-1 alpha is a novel marker protein that influences meat quality in yak from different altitudes and that HIF-1 alpha-mediated glycolytic pathway was key to the meat quality during postmortem aging.
   Practical applications
   Yak meat has the advantages of high protein, low fat, good amino acid and fatty acid composition, so the nutritional value of yak meat is in line with the current best-selling beef with less fat in domestic and foreign markets. But consumers often think that the meat tenderness of yak meat is worse than that of beef and improving the quality of yak meat was worthy of attention specifically. This study investigated the differences in meat quality during postmortem aging of yak meat at different altitudes and the relationship between hypoxic factor HIF-1 alpha release and meat quality.

AB  - The study aimed to verify the influence of different milking machine setting parameters on Italian Mediterranean buffalo milking performance. Data on milking machine settings (Milking Dry Tests [MDTs]) and milk Test-day (TD) were collected by the Italian Breeders Association (AIA). Data for each TD consisted of milk yield (MY), fat percentage (FP), protein percentage (PP), lactose percentage (LP) and linear score (LS). Working vacuum level (VL), pulsation ratio (PR), automatic cluster removal system (AC) and effective vacuum reserve (EVR) were recorded from each MDT. A total of 558 MDTs, 217,967 TD, collected from 43,593 buffaloes in 198 buffalo farms were utilised. MDT, TD and Animal data (AD) were analysed through a mixed linear model and a logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between VL and EVR. Analysis of MY and quality revealed that an incorrect setting of the milking was responsible for a higher LS and lower MY and LP, along with higher FP and PP compared to farms with adequate EVR. Except for PP, the height of the milking system significantly influenced all milk parameters. Conversely, VL affected all milking traits. A higher PR (70:30) was responsible for significantly lower LS and higher FP compared to a 60:40 PR. Similarly, the presence of AC showed a significant effect on FP and MY and a slight reduction in LS. Finally, the diameter and length of the pipeline (DL) ratio lower than 2.5 m was associated with a decrease in LS. These results suggest that buffaloes require specific milking parameters.
   Buffalo has a specific requirement for milking parameters. Incorrect milking setting increase somatic cells and reduce lactose content. Vacuum level (VL) affects milk yield (MY) and quality as well as somatic cells and lactose.

AB  - Many animal species 'play dead' or feign death (in some cases called tonic immobility) as a defence strategy against predators, including some ants, although triggers and durations are poorly understood. We repeatedly observed such death-feigning behaviour in Polyrhachis femorata ants that occupied pygmy-possum nest boxes deployed on Kangaroo Island following the 2019-2020 bushfires that burnt half of the island. Most of the 759 bat and pygmy-possum boxes (901 cavities) were on burnt ground. In 3312 box cavity checks on 13 diverse properties during monitoring visits, 28 of 40 P. femorata records (first for South Australia) occurred in unburnt Critically Endangered Narrow-Leaf Mallee Woodland community, seven in adjacent mallee community containing narrow-leaf mallee, three in cup gum unburnt habitat, and two in one box on burnt ground. Fire may have affected the abundance and re-establishment of the species. Polyrhachis femorata engages in a surprising defensive immobility strategy in boxes, since it is not only undertaken by individuals facing a potential predator, but also by entire colonies. The death-feigning behaviours were complemented by plugging box entrances. Nest boxes may be used to study this mysterious behaviour in this poorly known species, although frequent observation could lead to nest abandonment by the ant.

AB  - The larvae of Hermetia illucens L. (Insecta: Diptera: Stratiomyidae), also known as black soldier fly (BSF), has the unique ability to recycle nutrients from organic wastes. The BSF larvae biomass is a cheap and sustainable protein source that can be used in the feeding of fish, chickens, pigs, and pets. The BSF is a non-pest species, but its mass rearing conditions can attract pathogens and parasites due to the high temperature and moisture requirements. The published literature on the BSF cover aspects such as larval production, conversion efficiency during the rearing stage, adult longevity and mating. However, no published data are available on any parasitic or disease outbreaks in BSF colonies. The present paper reports the first case of an ectoparasite in a BSF colony. The poultry red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) is an invasive predator of the larvae and pre- pupae of BSF, quickly deteriorating the production and health of BSF colony.

AB  - Apoptosis and autophagy in granulosa cells (GCs) are highly related to follicular development and atresia. It has also been reported that they are related to LncRNA MEG3, miR-23a and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK-1). However, their relationship to follicular development and the extent to which follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) or luteinizing hormone (LH) can regulate this process remain unknown. Here, we found that ASK1 and JNK were expressed in the GCs of gonadotropin-dependent follicles, and those levels were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in yak Tertiary follicles compared to that of Secondary follicles and Graafian follicles. Then, the effect of LncRNA MEG3 / miR-23a on apoptosis and autophagy via ASK1/JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) in yak GCs was studied. Overexpressing LncRNA MEG3 reduced miR-23a levels and p-967 protein expression, but enhanced ASK1 and JNK mRNA levels as well as t-ASK1, p-845, t-JNK, and p-JNK proteins levels. And Upregulation of LncRNA MEG3 promoted apoptosis while attenuating autophagy. The targeting relationship between miR-23a and the binding sites of LncRNA MEG3 and ASK1 was also confirmed with the dual luciferase reporter assay. And, the relationship between LncRNA MEG3 and miR-23a was observed as a negative feedback regulation, and changes in LncRNA MEG3 and miR-23a levels can alter the expression of ASK1/JNK axis in yaks GCs. In addition, FSH (10 mu g/mL) or LH (100 mu g/mL) ability to reverse the effects of LncRNA MEG3 on miR-23a levels and ASK1/JNK axis-mediated apoptosis and autophagy was verified in yak GCs. This is significantly beneficial for decreasing abnormal follicular atresia for yaks tertiary follicles.

AB  - This study identified four new keratin-associated protein genes (KRTAP19-n) in sheep: sKRTAP19-1, sKRTAP19-2, sKRTAP19-4, and sKRTAP19-6. These genes are closely related to the previously identified sheep genes KRTAP19-3 and KRTAP19-5, as well as to human KRTAP19-n genes. However, no clear orthologous relationships were found, suggesting complex evolutionary dynamics for this gene family. Extensive nucleotide sequence variation was observed across the four genes. sKRTAP19-1 had four variants, defined by four synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a variable number of "GGCTAC" hexanucleotide repeats. sKRTAP19-2 had five variants involving seven SNPs, three of which were non-synonymous. sKRTAP19-4 had five variants with nine SNPs (three being non-synonymous) and a three-nucleotide deletion. sKRTAP19-6 had eight variants, defined by 13 SNPs and a two-nucleotide consecutive substitution, with four of the SNPs being non-synonymous. One distinct variant each of sKRTAP19-4 and sKRTAP19-6 was found exclusively in Yanchi Tan sheep, with seven unique nucleotide differences compared to other variants. These unique variants were identical to the Romanov sheep genome in the region amplified (excluding the primer binding regions), suggesting a shared ancestral origin. The findings highlight considerable genetic diversity in ovine KRTAP19-n and lay a foundation for future research into their role in regulating wool fibre characteristics.

AB  - Eliminating ultra-poverty has received particular attention of policymakers and scholars. The ultra-poor in mountainous regions often live on subsistence farming and natural resource extraction. One of the sustainable ways to support them is to find alternative livelihood options that reduce natural resource extraction and increase household income. During the last decades, Vietnam has reduced its poverty significantly. However, the ultra-poor still exist especially among ethnic minority groups in the northern mountains, increasing pressures on already degraded forest resources. This paper assessed the contribution of indigenous pig production to the welfare of ultra-poor ethnic minority households using the propensity score matching method and identified the factors affecting indigenous pig production using generalized Poisson, negative binomial and binary logistic regression models. The analysis was based on the data of 495 rural households surveyed in 2019. Results showed that (1) indigenous pig production had significant and positive effects on household income of and multidimensional poverty reduction among ultra-poor ethnic minority households and (2) the factors positively affecting indigenous pig production are access to credits, number of motorbikes, government support under the poverty reduction programs, road type at the villages, and irrigation systems, while the effects of distance from home to the nearest agricultural input shops and access to the national electricity are negative. We suggest the government to continue improving irrigation systems, road conditions and access to national electricity grids in this mountainous region.

AB  - (1) In mammals, the mineral nutrient and trace elemental composition of the body - the ionome - differs among individuals. It has been hypothesized that these differences may be related to age and sex, both for ecotoxic and essential elements. (2) We investigated whether and how intraspecific ionomic variation is related to age and sex in Fallow deer (Dama dama). We tested the predictions that concentrations of ecotoxic elements increase with age, that ionomic variation is lower among young individuals than among older individuals, and that reproductive females (does) have the lowest concentrations of essential elements. (3) Culled animals of different sex and age were obtained from a single protected area. The animals were dissected to collect 13 tissues, and concentrations of 22 different elements were measured in a sample of each tissue. (4) We described substantial ionomic variation between individuals. Some of this variation was related to age and sex, as predicted. Based on the limited existing knowledge on chemical element allocation and metabolism in the body, sex-related differences were more difficult to interpret than age-related differences. Since reference values are absent, we could not judge about the consequences of the elemental values that we found. (5) More extensive ionomic surveys, based on a wide range of elements and tissues, are needed to enlarge the understanding of within-species ionomic variation and potential biological, ecological, and metabolic consequences.

AB  - Interspecies interactions present diverse forms and functions, contributing significantly to ecological and social dynamics. This study focuses on the mounting behaviours of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) towards Sika deer (Cervus nippon), a rare and still unexplained phenomenon, with minimal emphasis on the behaviour of the deer. Using video data from two distinct sites, Yakushima and Minoh, Japan, we documented 45 sequences of macaque-deer interactions and analysed macaques' behaviours and deer behaviours using focal and behavioural sampling techniques. We identified four primary activities performed by macaques during mountings-sexual, play, grooming, and resting-with resting being predominant. The study evaluates six hypotheses regarding the functions of these mounting behaviours: (1) interactions are sex-specific, (2) macaques use deer for transportation, (3) mutual warming through physical contact occurs, (4) deer provide support for resting, (5) macaques engage in grooming to consume parasites or play to strengthen interspecies bonds, and (6) aggressive signals relate to resource disputes or rejection of mounting behaviour. Statistical analyses using the Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn's post-hoc test revealed significant differences between resting and other active behaviours, but no significant differences in behaviour duration between lying and sitting positions. Adults engaged in mounting for longer periods than juveniles, suggesting potential age-related differences in social and reproductive roles. These findings enhance our understanding of interspecies interactions by focusing on macaque behaviours and emphasise the need for longitudinal studies to clarify the ecological and social implications of these interactions.

AB  - Background
   Hybridization is an evolutionary event present in the natural world. Several studies suggest that natural hybridization is an important process in plant evolution, creating new genetic combinations which can play a vital role in speciation (Soltis and Soltis 2009, Soltis 2013, Neri et al. 2017, Taylor and Larson 2019). Therefore, it is important to understand and protect naturally occurring hybrids, conserving their ecological novelties and new traits, such as the ability to explore new niches, different from those of the parental species (Soltis 2013, Supple and Shapiro 2018).
   The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a UK Overseas Territory situated in the Caribbean biodiversity hotspot (Myers et al. 2000). To date, three natural hybrids are known to occur within this territory: Tillandsia x lineatispica Mez, Anthurium x selloanum K.Koch and Coccoloba krugii x C. uvifera R.A.Howard (Howard 1957, Acevedo-Rodriguez and Strong 2005, Acevedo-Rodriguez and Strong 2012).
   Tillandsia x lineatispica is endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, occurring in Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands (USVI) and the British Virgin Islands with an extent of occurrence estimated to be 3,390 km and a limited number of locations. The suitable habitat for this hybrid is declining mainly due to the negative impacts of feral ungulates, development for tourism and residential infrastructure and the impact of human-induced wildfires. In addition, it is suspected that the global population does not exceed 10,000 individuals with the largest subpopulation on Beef Island in the BVI thought to have no more than 1,000 mature individuals. This hybrid is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable, based on IUCN Red List Criteria, B1a(iii)+2b(iii) + C2a(i).
   Anthurium x selloanum is an endemic hybrid to BVI and USVI with a very restricted extent of occurrence which was estimated to range between 103 km and 207 km(2) and an area of occupancy which was estimated to range between 56 km and 188 km(2) and a limited number of locations. The suitable habitat of this species is declining mainly due to the negative impacts of feral ungulates, development for tourism and residential infrastructure and the negative impact of recreation activities in protected areas. This species is therefore evaluated as Endangered, based on IUCN Red List Criteria B1a+ b(iii) + B2a+b(iii).
   Coccoloba krugii x C. uvifera is native to the BVI, USVI, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, Haiti and Anguilla. It is estimated to have an extent of occurrence of 89,412 km. This value exceeds the threshold for any threatened category. Despite an observed continuing decline of suitable habitat for this species, which is being degraded mainly through ongoing development pressures, this species occurs in more than 10 locations. It is therefore assessed as Least Concern (LC).
   New information
   In this paper, we discuss the conservation status of all the known, naturally occurring, native hybrids in the the British Virgin Islands and we provide distribution data, including new records, from across these hybrid species ranges. Although conservation assessments of hybrids are out of the scope of the published IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee 2019), we use the IUCN Red List Criteria and Categories (version 3.1) to establish an equivalent conservation status of these hybrids and discuss conservation action due to the potential evolutionary importance of these naturally occurring hybrids. These assessments provide the necessary baseline information for prioritising species conservation and making informed management decisions, such as establishing the BVI's Tropical Important Plant Areas (TIPAS) network (Sanchez et al. 2019).

AB  - Objective: To investigate the effect of Moringa oleifera leaf extract on semen quality parameters in Teressa goat buck. Methods: A total of 25 semen samples from six bucks were selected for the study. Spermatozoa of 150x 10(6) were incubated in 0, 300, 500 and 700 mu g of leaf extract as group I, II, III and IV, respectively. Liquid stored semen samples were analysed for motility, viability, total sperm abnormalities, plasma membrane, acrosomal and nuclear integrities, seminal plasma intracellular enzymes [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)] and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and spermatozoa malondialdehyde (MDA) and cholesterol efflux in comparison with the control group (group I) for up to 72 h. Results: Moringa oleifera leaf extract (500 mu g/150x 10(6) spermatozoa)-treated semen had significantly higher motility, viability, plasma membrane, acrosomal and nuclear integrities, and TAC (P<0.05), and had significantly lower total sperm abnormalities, AST, ALT, LDH, MDA production and cholesterol efflux compared to those in other Moringa oleifera leaf extract treated (300 or 700 mu g/150x10(6) spermatozoa) and control groups at different hours of liquid storage (P<0.05). Semen quality parameters and TAC showed an increasing trend and total sperm abnormalities, MDA production, leakage of intra-cellular enzymes and cholesterol efflux showed a decreasing trend from group I to group III and then an opposite trend from group II to group IV at different hours of liquid storage. Conclusions: Moringa oleifera leaf extract 500 mu g/150x10(6) spermatozoa can be used for liquid semen preservation in Teressa goat at Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

AB  - To investigate prenatal muscle satellite cell (MuSC) development and the associated epigenetic modifications in yak. Here, we conducted morphological and protein co-localization analyses of fetal longissimus dorsi muscle at various developmental stages using histology and immunofluorescence staining methods. Our study observed that primary muscle fibers began forming at 40 days of gestation, fully developed by 11 weeks, and secondary muscle fibers were predominantly formed by around 105 days. Throughout development, MuSCs were mainly located between the muscle fiber membrane and the basement membrane, acting as a reserve for the stem cell pool. MuSCs appeared within myotubes only during critical phases of primary and secondary muscle fiber formation. The proliferation of MuSCs gradually decreases until birth. MuSCs with 5mC modification show a trend of increasing first and then decreasing. MuSCs with 5hmC modification also present a dynamic change trend. The 41st day and 11th week are the critical periods for the changes of both. From the 11th week to around the 110th day of gestation, the modification effect of histone H3K4me3 is crucial for MuSCs during the development of the fetal longissimus dorsi muscle. Combined, our data identify key time points for yak fetal skeletal muscle growth and development and demonstrate that DNA methylation and histone modifications in MuSCs are closely related to this process, offering a valuable basis for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying yak muscle development.

AB  - Strategies animals use to navigate human-dominated landscapes frequently mimic anti-predator responses employed by prey species. Understanding how large carnivores respond to outdoor recreation is important for conservation, particularly in protected areas with preservation mandates. Visitation to Yellowstone National Park doubled from 1980 to 2015, increasing the need to examine potential changes in behavior of grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) in relation to human recreation sites (trails, backcountry campsites). We developed integrated step-selection functions to explore how recreation sites influenced the movement rate and selection by male and female grizzly bears. Further, we tested whether time of day (diurnal, crepuscular, nocturnal) and restrictions to human access (i.e., restricted, unrestricted) modified bear responses and then compared behaviors based on proximity to recreation sites. Male grizzly bears used trails to travel during crepuscular and nocturnal hours and exhibited more pronounced behavior in restricted areas compared with unrestricted areas, suggesting recreation in unrestricted areas influenced the behavior of male bears. In contrast, female bears varied their movement rate and selection of trails in restricted areas much more than in unrestricted areas, suggesting females may make security tradeoffs between male bears and people. Both sexes used trails, likely as energetically efficient travel corridors; however, our analyses did not indicate that bears spent time near backcountry campsites. The sex-based differences in selection and movement patterns associated with trails and campsites suggest a single management approach for recreation may not equally benefit all bears. Recreation impacts on wildlife are complex to characterize and predict, but simultaneously modeling movement and selection provides a more comprehensive assessment of strategies animals use to navigate perceived risk.

AB  - MicroRNA (miRNA)-130b, as a regulator of lipid metabolism in adipose and mammary gland tissues, is actively involved in lipogenesis, but its endogenous role in fatty acid synthesis remains unclear. Here, we aimed to explore the function and underlying mechanism of miR-130b in fatty acid synthesis using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in primary goat mammary epithelial cells (GMEC). A single clone with deletion of 43 nucleotides showed a significant decrease in miR-130b-5p and miR-130b-3p abundances and an increase of target genes PGCla and PPARG. In addition, knockout of miR-130b promoted triacylglycerol (TAG) and cholesterol accumulation, and decreased the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) C16:1, C18:1 and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) C18:2, C20:3, C20:4, C20:5, C22:6. Similarly, the abundance of fatty acid synthesis genes ACACA and FASN and transcription regulators SREBP1c and SREBP2 was elevated. Subsequently, interference with PPARG instead of PGC1 alpha in knockout cells restored the effect of miR-130b knockout, suggesting that PPARG is responsible for miR-130b regulating fatty acid synthesis. Moreover, disrupting PPARG inhibits PGC1 alpha transcription and translation. These results reveal that miR-130b directly targets the PPARG-PGC1 alpha axis, to inhibit fatty acid synthesis in GMEC. In conclusion, miR-130b could be a potential molecular regulator for improving the beneficial fatty acids content in goat milk.

AB  - Exposure to light at night (LAN) can disrupt the circadian system, thereby altering neuroimmune reactivity and related behavior. Increased exposure to LAN affects people of all ages ? and could have particularly detrimental effects during early-life and adolescence. Despite this, most research on the behavioral and physiological effects of LAN has been conducted in adult animals. Here we evaluated the effects of dim LAN during critical developmental windows on adulthood neuroimmune function and affective/sickness behaviors. Male and female C57BL/6 J mice were exposed to dim LAN [12:12 light (150 lx)/dim (15 lx) cycle] during early life (PND10-24) or adolescence (PND30-44) [control: 12:12 light (150 lx)/dark (0 lx) cycle]. Behaviors were assessed during juvenile (PND 42-44) and adult (PND60) periods. Contrary to our hypothesis, juvenile mice that were exposed to dim LAN did not exhibit changes in anxiety- or depressive-like behaviors. By adulthood, adolescent LAN-exposed female mice showed a modest anxiety-like phenotype in one behavioral task but not another. Adolescent LAN exposure also induced depressive-like behavior in a forced swim task in adulthood in both male and female mice. Additionally, developmental LAN exacerbated the hippocampal cytokine response (IL-1?) following peripheral LPS in female, but not male mice. These results suggest female mice may be more susceptible to developmental LAN than male mice: LAN female mice had a modest anxiety-like phenotype in adulthood, and upon LPS challenge, higher hippocampal IL-1? expression. Taken together, developmental LAN exposure in mice promotes a modest increase in susceptibility to anxiety- and depressive-like symptoms.

AB  - Simple Summary For a phytophagous arthropod, plant cues and the presence of conspecifics or heterospecifics on a plant are important sources of information about food availability and predation risk. In eriophyoid mites, which are a group of economically important plant parasites, this issue is still poorly understood. In the previous study, females of the eriophyoid Aculops allotrichus prolonged their stay on unprofitable, old black locust leaves with injured conspecifics, suggesting their specific attraction to pierced individuals. The aim of this study was to shed light on this phenomenon. The series of tests using intact and artificially injured conspecifics, heterospecifics, pollen and sand grains revealed the high specificity of cues associated with mite injury. Only the presence of conspecifics triggered female arrestment on unprofitable old leaves, and this effect was more pronounced on leaf patches with injured than with intact eriophyoids. To our best knowledge, A. allotrichus is the first described herbivore in which injured conspecifics, instead of causing an alarm to be raised, keep the foraging individuals within a risky patch. Our tests using three non-host plants also suggest that A. allotrichus presumably needs more time to identify and evaluate non-host plants than host plants. Aculops allotrichus is a vagrant eriophyoid that lives gregariously on the leaves of the black locust tree. This study demonstrated that conspecifics can have a significant impact on A. allotrichus females on unprofitable, old black locust leaves and can arrest them on those leaves. The effect was more pronounced in females that were exposed to artificially injured individuals than to intact ones. They not only prolonged their sojourn on leaf discs with pierced conspecifics, but also preferred the leaf disc halves with damaged individuals to clean ones. Aculops allotrichus is the first described herbivore in which artificially injured conspecifics, instead of causing alarm, keep the foraging individuals within a risky patch. Other objects, such as artificially injured or intact heterospecifics, pollen or sand, were irrelevant to the eriophyoid females on old leaf patches. In tests with old leaves of maple, magnolia and hard kiwi vine, the females postponed their movement from non-host leaf discs, which suggests that they may need more time to recognise and evaluate unfamiliar plants than familiar ones.

AB  - Dipteran flies are important ectoparasites of cattle that causes economic losses by virtue of their ability to cause annoyance, blood loss, and act as a vector of widespread diseases. The abundance of dipteran flies affecting the dairy population is poorly documented in India and the present study was planned to investigate the diversity and seasonal abundance of dipteran flies in and around Bhubaneswar. Dipteran flies were collected from cattle sheds and habitations for one year (August 2017 to July 2018) covering four seasons. Higher recovery of flies was documented for Musca fly (21.51%) followed by mosquitoes. Amongst different mosquitoes, Culex spp. was the most common (18.11%) followed by Aedes spp. (11.58%), and Anopheles spp. (8.82%). Stomoxys fly, Tabanus fly, Chrysops fly, Sarcophaga fly, Hippobosca fly, and Coproica fly showed a relative abundance of 10.29%, 9.93%, 6.8%, 6.07%, 4.5%, and 2.39% respectively. There was significant variation (p < 0.01) in the seasonal abundance of flies. The highest relative abundance of flies was recorded in June whereas the least relative abundance was from November to January. The correlation analysis of the monthly fly population with climatic factors showed a highly significant correlation (p < 0.01) of the fly population with average temperature ( r = 0.840), average relative humidity ( r = 0.808), and rainfall ( r = 0.796). The present communication reports abundance of different biting and non biting flies around cattle habitations and the insect activity were dependant on climatic parameters.

AB  - This study was planned to detect the adverse pathological consequences of aflatoxin B1 in White Leghorn (WLH) layer breeder males. Eight-week-old male layer cockerels were separated into six experimental categories: A group was kept as negative control, offered with normal feed only; group B was fed with 400 ppb amount of aflatoxin, while groups F and D fed with normal feed and supplemented with vitamin E 100 ppm and 1% Moringa oleifera, respectively, whereas groups E and C were fed with 400 ppb aflatoxin containing feed and ameliorated with vitamin E 100 ppm and 1% Moringa oleifera, respectively. This study was continued for 2 months and immunologic disorders and reproductive parameters were observed during the trial. To find out immunological status lymphoproliferative response to phytohemagglutinin-P (PHA-P), antibody titers against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) and carbon clear assay were performed by collecting samples from five birds from each group. The whole data was measured by ANOVA test, and group means were compared by DMR test by using M-Stat C software. Regarding the reproductive status, spermatogenesis, blood testosterone level, testes weight, testes histology, sperm motility, and morphology were negatively affected by aflatoxins, but these deviations positively ameliorated by vitamin E and Moringa. Vitamin E and Moringa found advantageous in boosting the immune status of affected bird. All the immunological parameters including antibody titers against sheed red blood cells, lymphoproliferative response to avian tuberculin and phagocytic potential of macrophages were suppressed by AFB1 however in control, Moringa and vitamin E groups these immunological responses were significantly higher

AB  - Pregnant ewes mobilize body fat to increase energy supply for fetal growth and development upon undernutrition, which disrupts the metabolic homeostasis of the body. However, the comprehensive metabolic changes in subcutaneous adipose tissue upon undernutrition are poorly understood. In this study, an undernutrition sheep model was established to investigate the effects of undernutrition on metabolic changes, immune response, and inflammation in subcutaneous fat through transcriptome, RT-qPCR, and metabolome analysis. Results showed that undernutrition changed the total transcriptional and metabolic profiles of adipose tissue. Compared to the controls, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in fatty acid synthesis, triglyceride genesis, and lipid transport were downregulated in undernourished ewes, while DEGs related to fatty acid and triglyceride degradation were upregulated. Almost all lipid-related differential metabolites (DMs) were downregulated. DEGs and DMs involved in glucose metabolism and glycogen degradation were downregulated, while glycogen synthesis and carbohydrate transport were upregulated. DEGs linked to amino acid degradation were upregulated and some amino acids and derivatives were downregulated. KEGG pathway analysis showed complement and coagulation cascades were enriched significantly by DEGs, and DEGs related to coagulation, macrophage, and inflammation were upregulated while DEGs associated with the complement system were downregulated. Undernutrition during late gestation disrupted the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids in adipose tissue, which weakened the complement system and immune response and may have ultimately led to inflammation.

AB  - Mazama temama is the smallest red deer in Central America. It was one of the first species described for the genus, and until the end of the last century many authors considered it as a subspecies of Mazama americana due to morphological similarities. Cytogenetic studies of animals in captivity have shown different karyotypes that led to its recognition as a unique species, and phylogenetic studies sustained the monophyly of the species, with some inconsistencies due to its wide geographical distribution. The objectives of the study were to characterize a topotype of Veracruz and three other specimens from a Campeche locality, to complement the description of M. temama and to propose a neotype for the species. We described this species morphologically (cranial measurements, skin color, and body biometry), and obtained karyorypes from wild animals with known origins for cytogenetic analyses (C band, G band, Ag-NOR, and Giemsa staining). We also performed phylogenetic analyses of Cytb, D-loop, COI, and ND5 mitochondrial genes. The morphometric results separated M. temama from M. americana but not from the other small Mazama species. The phylogenetic trees of mitochondrial genes Cytb, COI, and ND5 corroborated the monophyly of the species with 100% of posterior probability. The topotype's karyotype is significantly different from the one previously described for the species, and the other specimens from Campeche have karyotype variants whose chromosomal rearrangements are possibly the beginning of a reproductive isolation mechanism. We discussed the possibility to have more than one species of red brocket deer in Mexico and Central America.

AB  - Despite the isolation of remote natural regions, it has been discovered that they are experiencing the accumulation of anthropogenic microparticles (i.e., microplastics or natural or semisynthetic cellulosic particles). Teide National Park (Canary Islands, Spain) is a high-mountain protected area known for its rich biodiversity. This study aims to assess the occurrence of coloured anthropogenic particles in the faecal matter of wild mammals, specifically rabbits and mouflons, residing in the park. With this purpose, faeces were collected from 68 systematically distributed sampling points. A stereomicroscopy-guided grinding process allowed a chemical-free and quick visual inspection of 616 individual excreta, revealing that 96% were particle-free. However, 37 anthropogenic particles were found, which correspond to 0.79 +/- 0.20 items per gram of dry faecal matter. The archetypical particle was a cellulosic blue microfibre of 2721 +/- 407 mu m, though poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) and polypropylene were also identified via micro Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. Atmospheric deposition and touristic pressure may be the sources of the anthropogenic particles, as they were randomly found in 36% of the sampling points. These findings represent the first evidence of anthropogenic particle ingestion by wild rabbits and mouflons, signifying the introduction of microplastics into terrestrial food chains in a remote high-mountain environment.

AB  - Biological control of weeds involves deliberate introduction of host-specific natural enemies into invaded range to reduce the negative impacts of invasive species. Assessing the specificity is a crucial step, as introduction of generalist natural enemies into a new territory may pose risks to the recipient communities. A mechanistic understanding of host use can provide valuable insights for the selection of specialist natural enemies, bolster confidence in non-target risk assessment and potentially accelerate the host specificity testing process in biological control. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of studies on the genomics of host specialization with a view to examine if genomic signatures can help predict host specificity in insects. Focusing on phytophagous Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera, we compared chemosensory receptors and enzymes between "specialist" (insects with narrow host range) and "generalist" (insects with wide host range) insects. The availability of genomic data for biological control agents (natural enemies of weeds) is limited thus our analyses utilized data from pest insects and model organisms for which genomic data are available. Our findings revealed that specialists generally exhibit a lower number of chemosensory receptors and enzymes compared with their generalist counterparts. This pattern was more prominent in Coleoptera and Diptera relative to Lepidoptera. This information can be used to reject agents with large gene repertoires to potentially accelerate the risk assessment process. Similarly, confirming smaller gene repertoires in specialists could further strengthen the risk evaluation. Despite the distinctive signatures between specialists and generalists, challenges such as finite genomic data for biological control agents, ad hoc comparisons, and fewer comparative studies among congeners limit our ability to use genomic signatures to predict host specificity. A few studies have empirically compared phylogenetically closely related species, enhancing the resolution and the predictive power of genomics signatures thus suggesting the need for more targeted studies comparing congeneric specialists and generalists.

AB  - Artificial light at night has become an emerging environmental pollutant, posing a serious threat to biodiversity. Cave -roosting animals are vulnerable to light pollution due to long-term adaptation to nocturnal niches, and the problem is especially severe in the context of cave tourism and limestone mining. Mitigating the adverse impacts of artificial light on cave -dwelling animals presents a challenge. This study aimed to assess the relative contributions of spectral parameters and light intensity to the emergence behavior of nine cave -roosting bat species: Rhinolophus macrotis, Rhinolophus pearsonii, Rhinolophus rex, Rhinolophus pusillus, Rhinolophus siamensis, Rhinolophus sinicus, Hipposideros armiger, Myotis davidii, and Miniopterus fuliginosus. We manipulated light spectra and intensities through light -emitting diode (LED) lighting and gel filters at the entrance of bat roost. We monitored nightly passes per species to quantify bat emergence under the dark control and ten lighting conditions (blue, green, yellow, red, and white light at high and low intensities) using ultrasonic recording. Our analyses showed that the number of bat passes tended to be reduced in the presence of white, green, and yellow light, independent of light intensity. In contrast, the number of bat passes showed no pronounced differences under the dark control, blue light, and red light. The number of bat passes was primarily affected by LED light's blue component, red component, peak wavelength, and half -width instead of light intensity. These results demonstrate that spectral parameters of LED light can significantly affect emergence behavior of cave -dwelling bats. Our findings highlight the importance of manipulating light colors to reduce the negative impacts of light pollution on cave -roosting bats as a function of their spectral sensitivity. We recommend the use of gel filters to manage existing artificial lighting systems at the entrance of bat -inhabited caves.

AB  - Many theoretical treatments of foraging use energy as currency, with carbohydrates and lipids considered interchangeable as energy sources. However, herbivores must often synthesize lipids from carbohydrates since they are in short supply in plants, theoretically increasing the cost of growth. We tested whether a generalist insect herbivore (Locusta migratoria) can improve its growth efficiency by consuming lipids, and whether these locusts have a preferred caloric intake ratio of carbohydrate to lipid (C : L). Locusts fed pairs of isocaloric, isoprotein diets differing in C and L consistently selected a 2C : 1L target. Locusts reared on isocaloric, isoprotein 3C : 0L diets attained similar final body masses and lipid contents to locusts fed the 2C : 1L diet, but they ate more and had a similar to 12% higher metabolic rate, indicating an energetic cost for lipogenesis. These results demonstrate that some animals can selectively regulate carbohydrate-to-lipid intake and that consumption of dietary lipids can improve growth efficiency.

AB  - Aim: Adaptation to local environments has been considered a driving force of ecological speciation. Previous phylogenetic studies at higher taxonomic levels have strongly suggested that herbivore diversification occurs through local adaptation to host plants. However, whether similar mechanisms contribute to within-species diversification remains poorly understood. We reconstructed species expansion processes using the phylogenetic relationships between two Luehdorfia butterflies and their host plants and tested the local adaptation hypothesis during species diversification.
   Location: Japanese archipelago.
   Taxa: Luehdorfia japonica and L. puziloi.
   Methods: We analysed mitochondrial DNA and single-nucleotide polymorphisms to trace the expansion processes of two species in the Japanese archipelago. We analysed data collected during trans-host plant feeding experiments to test for local host plant adaptation in L. japonica.
   Results: Luehdorfia japonica differentiated 17.0 million years ago (MYA) from a group of four Luehdorfia species in East Asia, and L. puziloi differentiated 13.3 MYA from the remaining three species. We observed several genetic groups in both species, reflecting geographical differences among populations. Some host plants had detrimental effects on the pupation rates of L. japonica, demonstrating the presence of genetic barriers between populations of this species.
   Main Conclusions: Although these two sibling species were influenced by the geological formation of the Japanese archipelago, their present population structures differ greatly: L. japonica expanded its distribution and adapted to local host plants along at least four expansion routes independent of host plant phylogeny, and L. puziloi exhibited a more isolated population structure and was less strongly influenced by gene flow among populations. These results suggest that both isolation by distance and isolation by adaptation have been important drivers resulting in the present-day population structure of L. japonica. Unidirectional gene flow through local adaptation to the host plant may have played a role in initial speciation.

AB  - The yak (Bos grunniens) has exceptional hypoxia resilience, making it an ideal model for studying high-altitude adaptation. Here, we investigated the effects of oxygen concentration on yak cardiac fibroblast proliferation and the underlying molecular regulatory pathways using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and metabolic analyses. Decreased oxygen levels significantly inhibited cardiac fibroblast proliferation and activity. Intriguingly, while the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content remained stable, we observed coordinated upregulation of mtDNA-encoded oxidative phosphorylation components. Live-cell metabolic assessment further demonstrated that hypoxia led to mitochondrial respiratory inhibition and enhanced glycolysis. RNA-seq analysis identified key hypoxia adaptation genes, including glycolysis regulators (e.g., HK2, TPI1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha), with Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses highlighting their involvement in metabolic regulation. The protein-protein interaction network identified three consensus hub genes across five topological algorithms (CCNA2, PLK1, and TP53) that may be involved in hypoxia adaptation. These findings highlight the importance of metabolic reprogramming underlying yak adaptation to hypoxia, providing valuable molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying high-altitude survival.

AB  - Attempts to explain the origin and diversification of vertebrates have commonly invoked the evolution of feeding ecology, contrasting the passive suspension feeding of invertebrate chordates and larval lampreys with active predation in living jawed vertebrates. Of the extinct jawless vertebrates that phylogenetically intercalate these living groups, the feeding apparatus is well-preserved only in the early diverging stem-gnathostome heterostracans. However, its anatomy remains poorly understood. Here, we use X-ray microtomography to characterize the feeding apparatus of the pteraspid heterostracan Rhinopteraspis dunensis (Roemer, 1855). The apparatus is composed of 13 plates arranged approximately bilaterally, most of which articulate from the postoral plate. Our reconstruction shows that the oral plates were capable of rotating around the transverse axis, but likely with limited movement. It also suggests the nasohypophyseal organs opened internally, into the pharynx. The functional morphology of the apparatus in Rhinopteraspis precludes all proposed interpretations of feeding except for suspension/deposit feeding and we interpret the apparatus as having served primarily to moderate the oral gape. This is consistent with evidence that at least some early jawless gnathostomes were suspension feeders and runs contrary to macroecological scenarios that envisage early vertebrate evolution as characterized by a directional trend towards increasingly active food acquisition.

AB  - The transport of air pollutants from areas surrounding the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has recently been studied. However, the major sources of atmospheric total suspended particulate matter (TSP) on the central TP remain unclear due to a lack of in-situ observations on aerosol physico-chemical properties. Therefore, to quantitatively investigate the physico-chemical properties and reveal the major sources of atmospheric aerosols, a comprehensive field campaign was conducted at the site of Nam Co from August 6 to September 11, 2020. Aerosol loading was low during the campaign with average TSP mass concentration, scattering coefficient at 550 nm, and absorption coefficient at 670 nm being 10.11 +/- 5.36 mu g m(-3), 1.71 +/- 1.36 Mm(-1), and 0.26 +/- 0.20 Mm(-1), respectively. Organic matter (63.9%) and mineral dust (27.8%) accounted for most of the TSP mass concentrations. The average scattering angstrom exponent of 0.59 +/- 0.14 reflected the influence of mineral dust, and the elemental fractions and the results of enrichment factor illustrated that crustal materials were the main contributors of mineral dust. The organic to elemental carbon ratio of 15.33 is probably caused by the aging that occurs during the transport of aerosols. The strong correlation between organic carbon and Ca2+ and the results of the electron microscopy analysis of single particles indicated that organic carbon and mineral dust had the same sources; however, the weak relation between mineral dust and wind speed indicated that local wind erosion was not the main contributor to the mineral dust. The potential source contribution function further illustrated that the summertime TSP in the central TP was mainly characterized by background biomass and mineral dust aerosols originating regionally from the ground within the TP.

AB  - In recent years, the increasing cost of protein raw materials has significantly impacted feed expenses and presented challenges to the livestock industry. Ninety-two-month-old male Tibetan sheep (15.40 +/- 0.81 kg) were randomly divided into three groups based on protein levels in their diet: L group (12% protein), M group (14% protein), and H group (16% protein). The feeding experiment was performed for 100 days, including a 10-day adaption period. It was found that the liver cells of the M group exhibited a better uniform in cytoplasm. Additionally, group M sheep had higher levels of GSH-Px and T-AOC (P<0.05), as well as elevated IgM, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and SDH content compared to other groups (P<0.05). There were 577, 698, and 623 differentially expressed genes between groups H and L, groups H and M, and groups M and L, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs regulated the activities of 56 pathways. Six liver-metabolism-related DEGs, SOD2, SOD1, CD19, IGF1, HK2, and PFKFB3, were expressed differently among the three sheep groups. In summary, a 14% protein level in the diet improved the hepatic antioxidant capacity, immune function, and glycolysis in Tibetan sheep through modulating the expression of functional genes.

AB  - The development of secondary hair follicles in cashmere goats directly influences the yield and quality of cashmere, and hair follicle morphogenesis is a complex biological process involving multiple signaling pathways and regulatory factors. In recent years, the regulatory role of long non-coding RNAs in hair follicle development has gradually been uncovered. Based on a previously established transcriptome database of embryonic skin tissue from cashmere goats, this study ultimately identified lncRNA MRPS28, which exhibits significant differential expression during the morphogenesis of secondary hair follicles. Our results indicate that lncRNA MRPS28 is a non-coding RNA transcribed from the intron region of the MRPS28 gene. Additionally, it can inhibit the proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts while promoting their apoptosis. Further mechanistic studies have shown that lncRNA MRPS28 acts as a competing endogenous RNA, sponging chi-miR-145-5p, thereby relieving its inhibitory effect on the target gene NUAK1. This, in turn, inhibits the formation of dermal papilla structures and ultimately affects the morphogenesis of secondary hair follicles during the embryonic period. This study provides a novel perspective on dissecting the regulatory network of hair follicle development in cashmere goats and offers potential theoretical insights for breeding new strains of cashmere goats.

AB  - Tibetan sheep have developed unique adaptations for survival in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau environment. However, the functional genes and molecular mechanisms that regulate hypoxia adaptation have not been fully characterized. In this study, based on the whole-genome resequencing data for Tibetan sheep at different altitudes, the population differentiation index (FST) and nucleotide diversity ratio (theta pi ratio) were evaluated in populations of 20 Oula sheep (3501 m altitude, OL), 20 Zashijia sheep (4369 m altitude, ZSJ), and 20 Awang sheep (4643 m altitude, AW) to reveal candidate loci related to high-altitude hypoxia. We screened 728 and 524 candidate genes in the AW vs. OL and ZSJ vs. OL groups, respectively, of which 134 genes were jointly screened. Candidate genes were mainly enriched in the Ras, melanoma, melanogenesis, VEGF, and PPAR signaling pathways. HIF1AN, PDGFA, PDGFD, ANXA2, SOCS2, NOXA1, WNT7B, MMP14, GNG2, ATF6, PGAM2, PPP3R1, GSTCD, and PPARA may play important roles in the high-altitude adaptation of Tibetan sheep. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the genes and molecular mechanisms that underlie high-altitude hypoxia adaptation in Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Diets containing higher-amylose-content starches were proved to have some beneficial effects on monogastric animals, such as promoting the proliferation of intestinal probiotics. However, current research on the effects of diets with different starch sources on animals at the extraintestinal level is still very limited. We hypothesized that diets with different starch sources may affect lipid-related gene expression and metabolism in the liver of pigs. This study aimed to use adult pig models to evaluate the effects of diets with different starch sources (tapioca starch, TS; pea starch, PS) on the liver gene expressions and metabolism. In total, 48 growing pigs were randomly assigned to the TS and PS diets with 8 replicate pens/group and 3 pigs per pen. On day 44 of the experiment, liver samples were collected for metabolome and transcriptome analysis. Metabolome data suggested that different starch sources affected (p < 0.05) the metabolic patterns of liver. Compared with the TS diet, the PS diet increased (p < 0.05) some unsaturated fatty acids and several amino acids or peptide levels in the liver of pigs. Moreover, transcriptome data indicated the PS diets elevated (p < 0.05) fatty acid beta-oxidation-related gene expression in the liver of pigs, and reduced (p < 0.05) unsaturated fatty acid metabolism-related gene expression. The results of quantitative real-time PCR confirmed that the PS diet upregulated (p < 0.05) the expression of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long chain (ACADVL), carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) 1A, and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MLYCD), and downregulated (p < 0.05) the expression level of cytochrome P450 2U1 (CYP2U1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1B1 (ALDH1B1) in the liver. In addition, the results of a Mantel test indicated the muscle fatty acids were significantly closely correlated (p < 0.05) with liver gene expressions and metabolites. In summary, these findings suggest that diets containing higher amylose starches improved the lipid degradation and the unsaturated fatty acid levels in pig livers, and thus can generate some potential beneficial effects (such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant) on pig health.

AB  - Ganxi goat is a local breed of goat unique to Jiangxi Province, China, named for its primary distribution in the Ganxi region. Ganxi goats are primarily raised through grazing, showing good adaptation to the local humid and hot climate, strong disease resistance, and occupying an important position in the local livestock industry. The skin, as the main barrier of the body, plays an indispensable role in resisting the invasion of external pathogenic factors and has received increasing attention in the medical and scientific fields. In this study, Ganxi goat skin was used as the research subject. Full-length transcriptome sequencing of Ganxi goat skin was performed using PacBio third-generation sequencing technology to supplement and improve the annotation information of the Ganxi goat genome. A combined analysis of second- and third-generation transcriptome sequencing was used to analyze the splicing variant events of hub genes (CDC20, MMP2, TIMP1, and EDN1) and the expression changes in each splicing variant in skin samples on day 0 and day 5 after surgical wounding. The regulatory role of related hub gene splicing variants in wound healing was analyzed. A total of 926,667 full-length non-chimeric sequences were obtained, optimizing the annotation information of 3794 genomic gene loci and identifying 2834 new genes, 256 new LncRNAs, 12,283 alternative splicing events, 549 genes with polyadenylation, and 112 fusion genes. Three splicing variant forms were identified in both the CDC20 and EDN1 genes, seven in MMP2, and two in TIMP1. The expression levels of most splicing variants showed significant changes in the skin samples on days 0 and 5 after wounding, potentially participating in the regulation of wound healing. This study provides fundamental data for the annotation of the goat genome and offers a reference for studying the regulatory mechanisms of wound healing.

AB  - Simple Summary Early pregnancy regulation is an extremely complex process that is influenced by various factors. We previously mined the differentially expressed genes affected by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) in early pregnancy in goats via transcriptome sequencing. We found that NAC increased the number of lambs by affecting the immune pathway in ewes and enhancing antioxidation. Based on this, we here explored the effect of NAC on early pregnancy in goats at the protein level. The results showed a difference in the expression of uterine keratin and increases in the levels of antioxidant indices and hormones in doe serum. Dietary supplementation with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) may support early pregnancy regulation and fertility in female animals. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of supplementation with 0.07% NAC on the expression of the uterine keratin gene and protein in Qianbei-pockmarked goats during early pregnancy using tandem mass spectrometry (TMT) relative quantitative proteomics. The results showed that there were significant differences in uterine keratin expression between the experimental group (NAC group) and the control group on day 35 of gestation. A total of 6271 proteins were identified, 6258 of which were quantified by mass spectrometry. There were 125 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), including 47 upregulated and 78 downregulated proteins, in the NAC group. Bioinformatic analysis showed that these DEPs were mainly involved in the transport and biosynthesis of organic matter and were related to the binding of transition metal ions, DNA and proteins and the catalytic activity of enzymes. They were enriched in the Jak-STAT signalling pathway, RNA monitoring pathway, amino acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis and other pathways that may affect the early pregnancy status of does through different pathways and thus influence early embryonic development. Immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to verify the expression and localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and pelota mRNA surveillance and ribosomal rescue factor (PELO) in uterine horn tissue. The results showed that both PELO and GFAP were localized to endometrial and stromal cells, consistent with the mass spectrometry data at the transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, NAC supplementation increased the levels of the reproductive hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), oestradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutamate peroxidase (GSH-Px) and nitric oxide (NO) in the serum of does. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which NAC regulates early pregnancy and embryonic development in goats.

AB  - One assumed function of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) is to attract natural enemies of the inducing herbivores. Field evidence for this is scarce. In addition, the assumption that elicitors in oral secretions that trigger the volatile emissions are essential for the attraction of natural enemies has not yet been demonstrated under field conditions. After observing predatory social wasps removing caterpillars from maize plants, we hypothesized that these wasps use HIPVs to locate their prey. To test this, we conducted an experiment that simultaneously explored the importance of caterpillar oral secretions in the interaction. Spodoptera caterpillars pinned onto mechanically damaged plants treated with oral secretion were more likely to be attacked by wasps compared with caterpillars on plants that were only mechanically wounded. Both of the latter treatments were considerably more attractive than plants only treated with oral secretion or left untreated. Subsequent analyses of headspace volatiles confirmed differences in emitted volatiles that likely account for the differential predation across treatments. These findings highlight the importance of HIPVs in prey localization by social wasps, hitherto underappreciated potential biocontrol agents and provide evidence for the role that elicitors play in inducing attractive odour blends.

AB  - Kelp forests are essential marine ecosystems increasingly compromised by human activities. Effective reforestation strategies are urgently needed, and the "green gravel" method is a viable tool already used in some European regions. This study aimed to assess the success of this method using the native Kelp species Laminaria ochroleuca on the Portuguese coastline. Cultures of green gravel were reared until the specimens reached a size of approximately 3 cm. The gravel was then deployed at selected sites in Peniche, Berlengas, and Cascais. Over an eight-month period, scientific scuba divers monitored the integration of Kelp, along with associated fish, invertebrate, and algae communities. Nutrient availability, temperature, water movement, substrate type, and Rugosity Index (RI) were also measured. The highest success rate was 12% in Consola & ccedil;& atilde;o, with Elefante and Galos (Berlengas) reaching 7% and 4%, respectively. By the end of the monitoring period, Cascais had no remaining Kelp on green gravel. Present data suggest that higher success is dependent on less rugged and higher RI topography. Higher grazing pressure, rougher terrain, and unexpected sedimentation appear to be the main obstacles to deployment success. Solid knowledge (biologic and topographic) on the restoration site, starting restoration actions near already established Kelp forests, and significantly scaling up restoration efforts could substantially improve the success of the green gravel method in future reforestation campaigns.

AB  - Many landscapes across the world are dominated by exotic (non-native) plant species. These plants can directly impact native species, including insect herbivores. There are many reported cases of native butterfly species using exotic host plants, and these new interactions have had diverse effects on butterfly populations. In this mini-review, I highlight recent developments in the study of the effects of exotic host plants on butterflies, focusing on two areas that have seen major advances: the genetic basis of host use and the influence of other trophic levels on butterfly-plant interactions. Understanding how these multiple factors interact is a key outstanding question for better predicting if an exotic plant might be a trap or a life raft for a herbivorous insect.

AB  - In this paper, deer oil was used as a raw material to prepare deer oil powder by microencapsulation technology to study the potential protective activity of deer oil powder on ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal injury in rats. The results show that the best process for preparing deer oil powder is: the solids account for 25% of the system content, the wall material Whey Milk Protein Isolate-Maltodextrin ratio is 1:5, the Sodium Stearyl Lactate-Glycerides of Monostearate and Distearate compound emulsifier content is 0.8%, the ratio is 1:1, and the deer oil accounts for 30% of the solid content, and the spray drying inlet temperature is 180 degrees C. Deer oil powder can reduce total stomach injury, gastric mucosal congestion area, and injury score index. Without affecting the blood lipid level, it can reduce the content of Myeloperoxidase, enhance the activity of Superoxide Dismutase and Glutathione Peroxidase, and has good antioxidant activity. Enhance the expression of defense factors Estradiol, Epidermal Growth Factor, and Somatostatin. At the same time, it reduces the levels of Interleukin-1 beta and Interleukin-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines in gastric tissue and enhances the expression of anti-inflammatory factors Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10. These results indicate that the gastric protection mechanism of deer oil powder may be related to the enhancement of mucosal defense factors, inhibition of inflammation, and oxidative stress. Practical applications This study screened the optimal formula for preparing microencapsulated deer oil powder and proved for the first time that deer oil powder has a strong gastroprotective effect on ethanol-induced acute gastric injury in rats. The gastric protective mechanism of deer oil powder is mainly to reduce oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine accumulation and to increase the content of defense factors. Therefore, deer oil powder can be used as a new source of gastric treatment drugs.

AB  - Simple Summary The Sox18 gene is important for the growth and function of dermal papilla cells, but its effect on the induction ability of dermal papilla cells in Hu sheep is not clear. Through experiments, we analyzed the effect of Sox18 on the induction ability of dermal papilla cells in Hu sheep. The results showed that Sox18 could enhance the induction ability of dermal papilla cells, and regulate the induction ability of dermal papilla cells through the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway. We believe that Sox18 is an important gene that affects the induction ability of Hu sheep's dermal papilla cells, and these findings may provide new avenues for studying the growth and development mechanism of hair. Sox18 is a developmental gene that encodes transcription factors. It has been indicated as be a key gene affecting the growth and development of hair follicles, in which dermal papilla cells (DPCs) have been demonstrated to play an important role through their ability to induce the formation of hair follicles. Pre-laboratory studies have found that Sox18 is differentially expressed in the dermal papilla cells of different pattern types of Hu sheep. We speculated that Sox18 plays an important role in the dermal papilla cells of Hu sheep. In our study, we analyzed the effect of Sox18 on the induction ability of DPCs in order to elucidate the function and molecular mechanism of Sox18 in the DPCs of Hu sheep. We first identified the expression of Sox18 in the DPCs of Hu sheep by immunofluorescence staining. We then used alkaline phosphatase staining, cell morphology observations and RT-PCR to detect the effect of Sox18 on the induction of DPCs after overexpression of or interference with Sox18. We also used RT-PCR, WB and immunofluorescence staining to detect the effect of Sox18 on the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway in DPCs. We found that Sox18 was specifically expressed in the DPCs of Hu sheep, and that Sox18 could enhance the alkaline phosphatase activity in the DPCs of Hu sheep and accelerate cell agglutination. The results of RT-PCR revealed that Sox18 promoted the mRNA expression of Versican, HHIP and FGFRI, and inhibited the mRNA expression of BMP4 and WIF1. Further studies showed that Sox18 promoted the expression of beta-catenin and activated the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway in DPCs. When the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway of DPCs was activated, the induction ability of DPCs was enhanced. Overall, we believe that Sox18 could enhance the induction ability of DPCs in Hu sheep and regulate the induction ability of DPCs through the Wnt/beta-catenin signal pathway.

AB  - Simple Summary As a native breed to the Inner Mongolian Plateau (Inner Mongolia, China), Mongolian sheep are tolerant to cold. However, their cold-adaptive processes, such as the physiological feedback adjustments that occur during the cold season in the plateau environment, remain unexplored. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the adaptations of grazing Mongolian sheep in the plateau environment by investigating the changes in physiological mechanisms and serum biochemistry of sheep reared in the warm and cold seasons. We observed that many of the biochemical functions were stimulated to meet the requirements of organismal metabolic regulation in order to enable grazing Mongolian sheep to physiologically adapt to cold climatic conditions. However, the function of resisting oxidation of the grazing Mongolian sheep was impaired during the cold season. The findings from this study provide helpful information for understanding the physiological requirements for grazing Mongolian sheep to adapt to extremely cold environments. The manuscript also provides information for optimizing the management of these animals during the cold season, increasing farm profits and designing genetic selection strategies. Mongolian sheep are characteristically cold-tolerant. However, their cold adaptive processes, such as the physiological feedback adjustments that occur during the cold season, remain unexplored. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the physiological adaptations of Mongolian sheep in cold plateau environments. A comparative analysis of the serum biochemical parameters, immune response, antioxidant capacity, and glucose and lipid metabolism of grazing Mongolian sheep in the cold and warm seasons was conducted. The results showed that in the cold season, the glucose and lipid metabolism and thermogenesis of the grazing Mongolian sheep were notably enhanced. Moreover, the immune responses were stimulated by increased levels of cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-1 beta, and IL-6, during the cold season. However, the antioxidant defense system was damaged; this damage was mainly characterized by decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes and an increased level of MDA during the cold season. Overall, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, and immune responses were stimulated to meet the requirements of organismal metabolic regulation to enable grazing Mongolian sheep to physiologically adapt to cold climatic conditions.

AB  - Illegal wildlife trade is a major threat to global biodiversity. Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are highly valued by various cultures as religious symbols and tourist attractions, which has led to a high demand for captive elephants. Owing to the unviability of captive breeding programs, several captive elephant populations are maintained by illegally obtaining wild Asian elephants. Morbidity and mortality rates among captive populations are high, whereas reproduction is low. In this study, we examined the genetic diversity among elephants using microsatellite genotyping and mitochondrial D-loop sequences of three captive elephant populations. The study results showed very low nucleotide diversity D-loop sequences and high variations in microsatellite genotyping, with an extensive variation of the gene pool estimates from different populations. This suggests that the optimal male selection during breeding could aid in maintaining the genetic diversity among captive populations. Forward genetic simulation revealed a decreasing genetic diversity in the fixed state within 50 generations. However, largely different gene pools can be effectively used to infer original elephant sources; this would facilitate the development of an identification certificate integration with machine learning and image processing to prevent illegal legislation owing to registration fraud between wild and domestic elephants. Implementing the proposed approaches and recommendations would aid in the mitigation of the illegal capture and domestic trade of wild elephants in Thailand and contribute to the success of future conservation plans in the blueprint of sustainable development goals.

AB  - Zooplankton plays a notable role in ocean biogeochemical cycles. However, it is often simulated as one generic group and top closure term in ocean biogeochemical models. This study presents the description of three zooplankton functional types (zPFTs, micro-, meso- and macrozooplankton) in the ocean biogeochemical model FESOM-REcoM. In the presented model, microzooplankton is a fast-growing herbivore group, mesozooplankton is another major consumer of phytoplankton, and macrozooplankton is a slow-growing group with a low temperature optimum. Meso- and macrozooplankton produce fast-sinking fecal pellets. With three zPFTs, the annual mean zooplankton biomass increases threefold to 210 Tg C. The new food web structure leads to a 25% increase in net primary production and a 10% decrease in export production globally. Consequently, the export ratio decreases from 17% to 12% in the model. The description of three zPFTs reduces model mismatches with observed dissolved inorganic nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations in the South Pacific and the Arctic Ocean, respectively. Representation of three zPFTs also strongly affects phytoplankton phenology: Fast nutrient recycling by zooplankton sustains higher chlorophyll concentrations in summer and autumn. Additional zooplankton grazing delays the start of the phytoplankton bloom by 3 weeks and controls the magnitude of the bloom peak in the Southern Ocean. As a result, the system switches from a light-controlled Sverdrup system to a dilution-controlled Behrenfeld system. Overall, the results suggest that representation of multiple zPFTs is important to capture underlying processes that may shape the response of ecosystems and ecosystem services to on-going and future environmental change in model projections.

AB  - Animal manure may be a valuable resource for the development of agricultural sustainability. We proposed to verify the feasibility of applications of three types of animal manures to improve soil attributes and to sustain crop yields under intensive cropping and no-tillage systems. The field experiment was established in 2004 on Typic Hapludalf soil with pig slurry (PS), cattle slurry (CS), pig deep-litter (PL), mineral fertilizer (MF) and a non-fertilized treatment. From 2004 to 2015, were grown black oat, maize, forage turnip, black beans, and wheat. Soil samples were taken after winter 2014 and summer 2015, and submitted to chemical, physical, microbiological and biochemical analyses. Animal manures increased soil pH, but MF caused acidification of soil. The PL and CS applications reduced soil density, and increased total pore volume and hydraulic conductivity. Animal manures increased soil P fractions, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, stimulated soil respiration, and had higher activities of glucosidase and acid phosphatase. Wheat had its biggest dry matter and grain yields with MF, but maize grain yields with CS were higher than MF. All indicators pointed that application of animal manure converges to an interesting strategy to recycle nutrients at farmyard level and to contribute to global sustainability.

AB  - Introduction Stress-related brain disorders can be associated with glucocorticoid disturbance and hippocampal alteration. However, it remains largely unknown how cortisol affects the structure and function of hippocampus. Cushing's disease (CD) provides a unique "hyperexpression model" to explore the effects of excessive cortisol on hippocampus as well as the relation between these effects and neuropsychological deficits. Methods We acquired high-resolution T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 47 CD patients and 53 healthy controls. We obtained the volume and functional connectivity of the hippocampal rostral and caudal subregions in both groups. Relationships between hippocampal alterations, neuroendocrine, and neuropsychological assessments were identified. Results Relative to control subjects, the CD patients had smaller volumes of all four hippocampal subregions. Furthermore, whole brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses with these four different hippocampal regions as seeds revealed altered hippocampal functional connectivity with high-order networks, involving the DMN, frontoparietal, and limbic networks in CD patients. The intrinsic hippocampal functional connectivity was associated with the quality of life of the CD patients. Conclusions Our findings elucidate the cumulative effect of excess cortisol on the morphology and function of hippocampus and reinforce the need for effective interventions in stress-related brain disease to halt potential hippocampal damage.

AB  - Trichomes are a key feature of bromeliads. These structures absorb water and minerals, potentially constituting an important element in plant-environment interactions. Recent studies have shown a glandular function asso-ciated with mucilage-secreting scales in inflorescences of bromeliads. During a prospective study of secretions in bromeliad inflorescences, we observed the presence of an oily exudate in three species of Vriesea sect. Xiphion. To verify whether scales in bromeliads can produce lipophilic secretions, we investigated the secretory activity in these species to identify the source and chemical nature of the secretions which spread over the inflorescences. We used standard methods of histochemistry, light, and electron microscopy applied to samples of floral bracts in two distinct phases of development. The secretions comprised hydrophilic and lipophilic substances secreted by trichomes on the adaxial side of bracts. The exudate was heterogeneous in V. aff. bituminosa and V. fenestralis, with a lipophilic phase composed of terpenoids and lipids. Vriesea aff. bituminosa also presented alkaloids. In V. platynema var. rosea, the lipophilic content was lipids. The secretory activity was restricted to the early stages of organ development and might be characterized by a temporal disjunction between the secretion of hydrophilic and lipophilic contents. The functions of the exudate seem to include protection against herbivores but might also relate to protection against pathogens, water loss and high irradiance. The secretion of lipophilic substances by the typical peltate trichome of bromeliads was reported here for the first time.

AB  - Rice paddy soil is a hotspot of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) due to the application of organic fertilizers. However, the temporal dynamics of ARGs in rice paddy soil and its flooded water during the growing season remain underexplored. In this study, a microcosm experiment was conducted to explore the ARG profiles in a long term (130 days) flooded two-phase manure-amended soil-water system. By using high-throughput quantitative PCR array, a total of 23-98 and 34-85 ARGs were detected in the soil and overlying water, respectively. Regression analysis exhibited significant negative correlations between ARG profile similarities and flooding duration, indicating that flooding significantly altered the resistome (P < 0.001). This finding was validated by the increased ARG abundance in the soil and the overlying water, for example, after 130 days flooding, the abundance of ARGs in CK soil was increased from 0.03 to 1.20 copies per 16S rRNA. The PCoA analysis further suggested pig manure application resulted in distinct ARG profiles in the soil-water continuum compared with those of the non-amended control (Adonis, P < 0.05). The Venn diagram showed that all ARGs detected in the pig manure were present in the treated soil. Twelve ARGs (e.g., sul1) were shared among the pig manure, manure amended soil, and overlying water, indicating that certain manure-or soil-borne ARGs were readily dispersed from the soil to the overlying water. Moreover, the enhanced relationships between the ARGs and mobile genetic elements in pig manure applied soil-water continuum indicate that the application of organic matter could accelerate the emergence and dissemination of ARGs. These findings suggested that flooding represents a crucial pathway for dispersal of ARGs from the soil to the overlying water. Identification of highly mobile ARGs in the soil-water continuum is essential for assessing their potential risk to human health and promoting the development of sustainable agricultural practices to mitigate their spread.

AB  - Featured Application Livestock significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, with methane production from animals like cows, sheep, and goats being a major concern. Reducing this methane output is crucial for environmental sustainability. There is also a growing interest in enhancing the nutritional quality of meat and milk from these animals. This study investigated the potential of natural additives-sage (SAG), pine (PIN), and clove (CLO) essential oils-to manipulate ruminal fermentation as well as biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The research focused on ruminal gas production, methane emissions, and fatty acid changes using in vitro methods. The essential oils led to lower gas and methane production. Additionally, they affected rumen pH, ammonia levels, and fatty acid profiles. These findings suggest that SAG, PIN, and CLO might reduce methane emissions and improve product quality in livestock. More research is needed to apply these findings practically.Abstract The livestock industry significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, with ruminant animals, including cows, sheep, and goats, being responsible for a substantial share of these emissions due to methane production. Reducing methane emissions from ruminants is crucial for mitigating the environmental impact of livestock production. Additionally, there has been a growing interest in improving the nutritional quality of ruminant products through modifying their profile of fatty acids. The current study aimed to investigate the potential of sage (SAG), pine (PIN), and clove (CLO) essential oils as natural additives for modulating in vitro ruminal fermentation characteristics and biohydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Within the current experiment, three dose levels (300, 600, and 900 mg/L) of essential oils were evaluated using rumen inoculum from three mature Dalagh ewes (58 +/- 2.84 kg body weight). The results revealed that the essential oils had a significant impact on gas production, methane and carbon dioxide production, ruminal fermentation parameters, and ruminal biohydrogenation of dietary PUFAs. The essential oil treatments resulted in reduced gas production compared with the control group. Methane production was significantly reduced by all doses of the essential oils, with the highest dose of CLO resulting in the lowest methane production. In addition, the essential oils affected ruminal fermentation parameters, including pH, ammonia concentration, and production of total volatile fatty acids. Promising modifications in ruminal biohydrogenation of PUFAs and the profile of fatty acids were also observed in the current study. These findings suggest that SAG, Pin, and CLO hold promise in mitigating methane emissions and improve the nutritional value of ruminant products. Further investigation is required to evaluate their effectiveness in practical feeding strategies for livestock.

AB  - The horse chestnut complex disease is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. aesculi. . As a consequence, rapid wood decomposition is observed due to the oyster mushroom ( Pleurotus ostreatus) ) and the velvet toadstool ( Flammulina velutipes). ). In order to investigate the risk potential of the following organisms for the tree, the oyster mushroom (P. P. ostreatus) ) and the velvet foot fungus (F. F. velutipes), ), two series of in vitro tests were carried out with mono, dual and multiplex cultures. In the first series of experiments, the influence of the basidiomycetes on each other and the influence of the bacterium on the basidiomycetes was analysed by measuring radial mycelial growth. The second series of experiments were used to investigate the wood decomposition behaviour of the fungi in mono and dual culture. The test results show that F. velutipes poses a greater potential risk than P. ostreatus when the bacterium P. syringae pv. aesculi is involved. The hazard potential of F. velutipes is apparently increased by the synergistic effect of the neobiont Pseudomonas syringae pv. aesculi on mycelial growth, so that the fungus only becomes a problem for trees of the genus Aesculus and in the assessment of traffic safety due to the presence of the bacterium.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormonal condition with reproductive, metabolic, and psychological sequelae that affects 8 to 13% of reproductive-aged women and 3 to 11% of adolescent girls. Sleep is often compromised in women with PCOS due to increased rates of sleep problems, with the most established problem being obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is highly prevalent in reproductive-aged adult women with PCOS, but not so in adolescence. The international evidence-based PCOS guideline to improve health outcomes in women with PCOS indicated routine screening to identify and alleviate symptoms of OSA. The guidelines, however, did not weigh other multidimensional constructs of sleep health such as sleep disturbances (e.g., sleep quality and quantity), beyond OSA. This is perhaps due to the lack of research and existing mixed findings in the area of PCOS and sleep health. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge about OSA and expands further to include the limited knowledge about other sleep problems in PCOS among reproductive-aged women and adolescent girls. We broadly cover the prevalence, risk factors, and mechanisms of sleep problems in PCOS and their relationship with cardiometabolic and psychological health. A brief summary on treatment and intervention strategies for sleep problems in PCOS and future recommendations will be deliberated.

AB  - BACKGROUND Heat stress (HS) has a negative impact on the intestinal barrier and immune function of pigs. Selenium (Se) may improve intestinal health through affecting selenoproteins. Thus we investigate the protective effect of new organic Se (2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutanoic acid, HMSeBA) on jejunal damage in growing pigs upon HS and integrate potential roles of corresponding selenoproteins. RESULTS HS decreased the villus height and increased (P < 0.05) the protein abundance of HSP70, and downregulated (P < 0.05) protein levels of tight junction-related proteins (CLDN-1 and OCLD). HS-induced jejunal damage was associated with the upregulation of four inflammation-related genes and ten selenoprotein-encoding genes, downregulation (P < 0.05) of four selenoprotein-encoding genes and decreased (P < 0.05) the protein abundance of GPX4 and SELENOS. Compared with the HS group, HMSeBA supplementation not only elevated the villus height and the ratio of V/C (P < 0:05), but also reduced (P < 0.05) the protein abundance of HSP70 and MDA content, and increased (P < 0.05) the protein abundance of OCLD. HMSeBA supplementation downregulated the expression of seven inflammation-related genes, changed the expression of 12 selenoprotein-encoding genes in jejunum mucosa affected by HS, and increased the protein abundance of GPX4, TXNRD1 and SELENOS. CONCLUSION Organic Se supplementation beyond nutritional requirement alleviates the negative effect of HS on the jejunum of growing pigs, and its protective effect is related to the response of corresponding selenoproteins.

AB  - The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) is distributed throughout the Himalayan foothills in Pakistan and occurs in moist temperate and dry coniferous forests. However, the cat species is categorized as "Data Deficient" in Pakistan. In the current study we aimed to investigate the leopard cat distribution and dietary niche in the Margalla Hills National Park, the lowest part of the Himalayan foothills in Pakistan. We recorded direct (field observations, camera trapping) and indirect signs (scats) of the species on 23 trails / tracks in the study area. The leopard cat was recorded at 13 different sampling sites in the park, with an altitudinal range between 664-1441 m asl. The diet composition of the species was investigated through scat analysis, with the species identity of the scats confirmed through the mitochondrial cytB region. The species' diet comprised both animal and plant matter. The animal-based diet (in terms of frequency of occurrence) contained wild (51.75%) as well as domestic prey (7.69%), and plant species (31.47%). Wild prey included small mammals (rodents, two mongoose species, Asian palm squirrel, and Cape hare), birds, insects and snails. The domestic prey were poultry birds, sheep, goats and dogs. Consumption of wild prey was higher in summer (n = 31 scat), whereas intake of domestic prey was higher in winter (n = 37 scats). The dietary niche breadth was wider 14.84 in summer than winter 10.67. A chi-square test showed a significant difference in seasonal dietary intake of the leopard cat. The study concludes that the leopard cat feeds mainly on wild animal prey and plant species; however, in winter consumption of domestic prey increases.

AB  - Extinct megafaunal mammals in the Americas are often linked to seed-dispersal mutualisms with large-fruiting tree species, but large-fruiting species in Europe and Asia have received far less attention. Several species of arboreal Maloideae (apples and pears) and Prunoideae (plums and peaches) evolved large fruits starting around nine million years ago, primarily in Eurasia. As evolutionary adaptations for seed dispersal by animals, the size, high sugar content, and bright colorful visual displays of ripeness suggest that mutualism with megafaunal mammals facilitated the evolutionary change. There has been little discussion as to which animals were likely candidate(s) on the late Miocene landscape of Eurasia. We argue that several possible dispersers could have consumed the large fruits, with endozoochoric dispersal usually relying on guilds of species. During the Pleistocene and Holocene, the dispersal guild likely included ursids, equids, and elephantids. During the late Miocene, large primates were likely also among the members of this guild, and the potential of a long-held mutualism between the ape and apple clades merits further discussion. If primates were a driving factor in the evolution of this large-fruit seed-dispersal system, it would represent an example of seed-dispersal-based mutualism with hominids millions of years prior to crop domestication or the development of cultural practices, such as farming.

AB  - Ibuprofen (IBU), a common pharmaceutical and personal care product (PPCP), is a pervasive water pollutant with adverse ecological and human health effects after transformation and accumulation. In this study, we synthesized Fe, N-doped carbon quantum dots (Fe, N-CQDs) using pig blood and FeCl3 as a precursor via a one-step hydrothermal method. TEM, XRD, XPS, and UV-Vis were used to characterize the physical and chemical properties of Fe, N-CQDs. We investigated the feasibility of Fe, N-CQDs in activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for IBU degradation under visible light. The experimental results revealed that Fe in Fe, N-CQDs predominantly formed a stable complex through Fe-N and Fe-OH, with a high degree of graphitization and a sp2-hybridized graphitic phase conjugate structure. The Fe, N-CQDs/Light/PMS system exhibited strong activity, degrading over 87% of IBU, maintaining a wide pH range (3-10) adaptability. Notably, Fe, N-CQDs acted as visible-light catalysts, promoting Fe3+/Fe2+ cycling and PMS activation, generating both free radicals (SO4 center dot-, <middle dot>OH) and non-radicals (1O2, h+) to effectively degrade IBU. This study presents an innovative approach for the sustainable utilization of pig blood as a biomass precursor to synthesize Fe- and N-doped carbon materials. This study provides a new approach for the sustainable and value-added utilization of natural wastes and biomass precursors of Fe- and N-doped carbon materials, which can be used to treat pollutants in water while treating discarded pig blood.

AB  - The fat tail of sheep is an important organ that has evolved to adapt to extreme environments. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying the fat tail phenotype remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize transcriptome and lipidome profiles and morphological changes in 250 adipose tissues from two thin-tailed and three fat-tailed sheep populations in summer and winter. We implement whole-genome selective sweep tests to identify genetic variants related to fat-tails. We identify a set of functional genes that show differential expression in the tail fat of fat-tailed and thin-tailed sheep in summer and winter. These genes are significantly enriched in pathways, such as lipid metabolism, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, molecular transport, and inflammatory response. In contrast to thin-tailed sheep, tail fat from fat-tailed sheep show slighter changes in adipocyte size, ECM remodeling, and lipid metabolism, and had less inflammation in response to seasonal changes, indicating improved homeostasis. Whole-genome selective sweep tests identify genes involved in preadipocyte commitment (e.g., BMP2, PDGFD) and terminal adipogenic differentiation (e.g., VEGFA), which could contribute to enhanced adipocyte hyperplasia. Altogether, we establish a model of regulatory networks regulating adipose homeostasis in sheep tails. These findings improve our understanding of how adipose homeostasis is maintained, in response to extreme environments in animals.
   Survival in extreme environments and adaptations during seasonal shifts require specialized metabolic programing. A multi-omic analysis of how regulatory networks impact adipose homeostasis in sheep tails provides insight for how these animals survive extreme environments.

AB  - Background Macular degeneration of the eye is a common cause of blindness and affects 8% of the worldwide human population. In adult cats with bilateral lesions of the central retina, we explored the possibility that motion perception training can limit the associated degradation of the visual system. We evaluated how visual training affects behavioral performance and white matter structure. Recently, we proposed (Kozak et al. in Transl Vis Sci Technol 10:9, 2021) a new motion-acuity test for low vision patients, enabling full visual field functional assessment through simultaneous perception of shape and motion. Here, we integrated this test as the last step of a 10-week motion-perception training.Results Cats were divided into three groups: retinal-lesioned only and two trained groups, retinal-lesioned trained and control trained. The behavioral data revealed that trained cats with retinal lesions were superior in motion tasks, even when the difficulty relied only on acuity. 7 T-MRI scanning was done before and after lesioning at 5 different timepoints, followed by Fixel-Based and Fractional Anisotropy Analysis. In cats with retinal lesions, training resulted in a more localized and reduced percentage decrease in Fixel-Based Analysis metrics in the dLGN, caudate nucleus and hippocampus compared to untrained cats. In motion-sensitive area V5/PMLS, the significant decreases in fiber density were equally strong in retinal-lesioned untrained and trained cats, up to 40% in both groups. The only cortical area with Fractional Anisotropy values not affected by central retinal loss was area V5/PMLS. In other visual ROIs, the Fractional Anisotropy values increased over time in the untrained retinal lesioned group, whereas they decreased in the retinal lesioned trained group and remained at a similar level as in trained controls.Conclusions Overall, our MRI results showed a stabilizing effect of motion training applied soon after central retinal loss induction on white matter structure. We propose that introducing early motion-acuity training for low vision patients, aimed at the intact and active retinal peripheries, may facilitate brain plasticity processes toward better vision.

AB  - Simple Summary: There are very few reports regarding Assisted Reproductive Technologies in South American camelids, including llamas (Lama glama). The sperm quality and in vitro fertilization rates from fresh and cryopreserved sperm collected from vas deferens using different preservation extenders were investigated in llama males as a model for its application in other South American camelids. The obtained results from our research showed that the preservation extender was a determining factor in significantly improving the in vitro fertilization rates when using fresh and cryopreserved sperm samples obtained from the vas deferens in llamas (Lama glama).
   The advances in Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) applied in South American camelid species are still scarce. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of three semen extenders, before and after the cryopreservation of spermatozoa obtained from the vas deferens, on sperm quality parameters and in vitro fertilization rates of llama (Lama glama) oocytes. Mature fertile llama males (Lama glama; n = 6; age: 48-60 mo.; BCS: similar to 2.7) were included in the study. Sperm samples were collected from each male using the surgical technique of the vas deferens deviation. Then, the sperm samples were pooled and diluted with the Tris-EY, Andromed (R), or BioxCell (R) extender in order to subsequently carry out the sperm cryopreservation process. The sperm quality assessment related to each extender was performed before and after cryopreservation with regard to sperm morphological abnormalities, acrosome integrity, sperm viability, membrane permeability, and sperm motility traits. Moreover, in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures were carried out to evaluate the in vitro fertility of the cryopreserved sperm samples using each extender. Overall, significant differences were observed before and after cryopreservation regarding acrosome integrity, sperm viability, membrane permeability, and sperm motility traits among the extenders used, where Tris-EY and Andromed (R) were better than BioxCell (R) (p < 0.05); however, no differences were observed regarding the sperm morphological abnormalities among extenders (p > 0.05). Moreover, multiple differences were observed with regard to the velocity and linearity kinematic parameters obtained by computerized analysis before and after the cryopreservation process, irrespective of the extender used (p < 0.05). Finally, differences were observed regarding the in vitro fertilization rates among the different extender-derived samples (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the sperm quality using Tris-EY and Andromed (R) was better before and after cryopreservation compared to that using BioxCell (R). Although the number of fertilized oocytes obtained after the IVF process between Tris-EY and Andromed (R) was similar, Andromed (R)-derived samples showed the best sperm quality results before and after cryopreservation. This indicates that the cryopreservation extender is a determining factor in significantly improving in vitro fertilization rates when using sperm samples obtained from vas deferens in llama (Lama glama) males.

AB  - PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), a mitochondrial kinase that phosphorylates Parkin and other proteins, plays a crucial role in mitophagy and protection against neurodegeneration. Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin can lead to loss of function and early onset Parkinson's disease. However, there is a lack of strong in vivo evidence in rodent models to support the theory that loss of PINK1 affects mitophagy and induces neurodegeneration. Additionally, PINK1 knockout pigs (Sus scrofa) do not appear to exhibit neurodegeneration. In our recent work involving non -human primates, we found that PINK1 is selectively expressed in primate brains, while absent in rodent brains. To extend this to other species, we used multiple antibodies to examine the expression of PINK1 in pig tissues. In contrast to tissues from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), our data did not convincingly demonstrate detectable PINK1 expression in pig tissues. Knockdown of PINK1 in cultured pig cells did not result in altered Parkin and BAD phosphorylation, as observed in cultured monkey cells. A comparison of monkey and pig striatum revealed more PINK1-phosphorylated substrates in the monkey brain. Consistently, PINK1 knockout in pigs did not lead to obvious changes in the phosphorylation of Parkin and BAD. These findings provide new evidence that PINK1 expression is specific to primates, underscoring the importance of non -human primates in investigating PINK1 function and pathology related to PINK1 deficiency.

AB  - Carrion is a valuable food source for predators, but its role for specialist predators has received little attention. We recorded the unnoticed scavenging behavior of the endangered Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) on wild ungulate carcasses in a reintroduced lynx population of central Spain. Seven of the 13 carcasses experimentally placed (54 %) were visited and scavenged by Iberian lynxes. Five carcasses (38 %) were scavenged by more than one lynx (one to seven individuals) and sometimes by several individuals at the same time (two adults and one young). Large proportion of the lynxes in the study area (12 of 17; 71 %) ate carrion. Our observations are surprising and suggest that this behavior is probably more common in this species than previously assumed. In addition, this behavior has implications for the conservation of this threatened species, since it confirms the potential risks associated with the consumption of carrion from animals killed by disease, or by human activities such as livestock rearing or hunting. The potential conservation problems that may arise from carrion consumption by lynxes, such as exposure to disease-causing pathogens, toxins, poisoning due to the lead ammunition or even intentional poisoning, should be evaluated in-depth. Likewise, the use of ungulate carrion could be an important resource for lynxes in areas with low rabbit abundance, and probably as a management tool in conservation programs.

AB  - Pigs are the most important source of meat and valuable biomedical models. However, the porcine immune system, especially the heterogeneity of CD8 T cell subtypes, has not been fully characterized. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified 14 major cell types from peripheral blood circulating cells of pigs and observed remarkable heterogeneity among CD8 T cell types. Upon re-clustering of CD8(+) T cells, we defined four CD8 T cell subtypes and revealed their potential differentiation trajectories and transcriptomic differences among them. Additionally, we identified transcription factors with potential regulatory roles in maintaining CD8 T cell differentiation. The cell-cell communication analysis inferred an extensive interaction between CD8 T cells and other immune cells. Finally, cross-species analysis further identified species-specific and conserved cell types across different species. Overall, our study provides the first insight into the extensive functional heterogeneity and state transitions among porcine CD8 T cell subtypes in pig peripheral blood, complements the knowledge of porcine immunity, and enhances its potential as a biomedical model.

AB  - Humans' and elephants' conflict is considered a common phenomenon in Bangladesh due to extreme anthropogenic interferences on elephant habitats. Concurrently, the landless people were encouraged to encroach on forest land due to their financial hardship and poor and weak forest management systems. We conducted our research work through frequent field visits, site-oriented positioned research correspondents, and an adopted semistructured questionnaire. We recorded a total of 903 conflict-related cases between humans and elephants, including crop raids (N = 337), house raids (N = 200), homestead garden raids (N = 263), and accidental attacks (N = 103), across sites, during August 2018 to July 2019, in Teknaf Wildlife Sanctuary (TWS). Elephant attack rates varied significantly between traditional forest dwellers (N = 179), illegal settlers (N = 370), villagers nearest forest (N = 212), Rohingya refugees (N = 53), and traditional forest different tribes (N = 89). It also varied along a space gradient, including inside forests (N = 423), buffer zones (N = 297), and outside forest villages (N = 183). The number of conflicts possessed by elephants varied discriminately and was unparalleled among different professions such as cattle ranchers (N = 104), gardeners (N = 112), paddy cultivators (N = 236), vegetable growers (N = 158), betel-leaf growers (N = 163), and forest resources collectors (N = 130). Most conflicts between humans and elephants occurred significantly during the night (N = 592), many during the morning (N = 154), evening (N = 138), and much less during midday (N = 19). The conflict intensity was also higher on the east coast (N = 552) than on the west coast (N = 351). The seasonal variation, including summer (N = 367), monsoon (N = 274), and winter (N = 262), was also significant. The elephant herd size was also an important factor triggering the conflict in TWS. We conclude that conflict intensity between humans and elephants is driven by settlers' location, forest gradient, the profession of forest-dependent people, their household size and income level, attack time, and season.

AB  - Simple Summary Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging pathogen, causing an increasing number of autochthonous cases in industrialized countries. In Europe, infections are associated with the zoonotic HEV-3 and HEV-4 genotypes and pigs and wild boars are the main reservoirs. A major concern of infections is linked to its foodborne transmission, due to consumption of raw or undercooked pork products infected by HEV-3 or HEV-4. HEV-3 is widespread in farmed pigs, mainly aged 3-4 months. Besides a decline with age, infected pigs have been observed at slaughterhouses, representing a risk for both the consumers and the workers of the pig industry. HEV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and shed in feces in large amounts. The risk of viral spreading in farm and presence of infected pigs at slaughtering was evaluated by assessing the quantity and the duration of HEV-3 shedding in feces of infected pigs. Feces of 23 HEV-3 positive pigs were assayed during their fattening, shortly before their slaughtering. Results confirmed a long period of viral shedding in feces with a large amount of the virus released in the environment (mean 10(5) GC/g). Prevalence and quantity of the virus declines with the age of animals. The study provides information on the dynamic of the infection in pigs, important to prevent HEV occurrence and circulation in farms. Genotype 3 of hepatitis E virus (HEV-3) is the most common in Europe in both humans and pigs. HEV-3 strains are zoonotic, and foodborne cases associated with consumption of raw and undercooked pork products, mainly liver sausages, have been described. HEV-3 circulates largely in European pig farms, maybe due to its long persistence in the environment. Animals get infected around 3-4 months of age; shortly after, the infection starts to decline up to the age of slaughtering (8-9 months of age in Italy). With the purpose to understand the duration in farmed pigs of the shedding of the virus and its quantity, HEV-RNA detection was performed by Real-time RT-PCR from feces collected individually from two groups of 23 pigs. Sampling was conducted for 4 months shortly before slaughtering age. At 4-months-old, all animals were shedding HEV-3 to high load around 10(5) genome copies per gram (GC/g). Prevalence was higher in growers than in fatteners, with most of the pigs still positive around 166 days of age. Beyond some difference among individual pigs, the amount of HEV in feces decreased with the age of animals. The longest fattening period should ensure a lower risk of HEV shedder animals at slaughter, reducing the risk of food contamination.

AB  - The introduction of exotic plants into different habitats can have varied consequences for local herbivorous insects, such as altered the nutrient profiles that induce the host plant shifting or reduced food availability by competition with native plants. Acraea terpsicore (Linnaeus, 1758), a common butterfly in Southeast Asia that uses Passiflora as a host plant, has been studied to compare larval performance and adult phenotypes on one local wild Passiflora plant, P. foetida and 3 exotic congeneric plants, P. edulis, a fruit crop plant, and P. x alata-caerulea and P. x coccinea-caerulea, both hybrid ornamental plants. Laboratory caterpillars that fed on P. edulis and P. x alata-caerulea died within 1-10 days, while caterpillars fed on P. foetida and P. x coccinea-caerulea completed their life cycle in 30.42 +/- 0.25 days. Although the caterpillars differed in several food utilization indices, the relative growth rate and consumption index were not affected. Adult butterflies that hatched from caterpillars fed on these experimental plants had different phenotypes, especially wing colors. Therefore, although some congeneric exotic plants may have a negative impact on the butterfly population, some exotic plants can serve as alternative larval host plants and expand the ecological niche of butterflies. Difference in the composition and concentration of nutrients and defensive chemicals in each host plant may exert an impact on the phenotypic traits of butterflies, such as their body size, coloration, and wing shape. Whether butterflies may separate into different subpopulations in the future due to phenotypic variation should be further examined.

AB  - Soilless cultivation of vegetables is widely used in production. It is also well accepted that digested slurry is frequently applied as a fertilizer in agricultural production. However, the effect of digested pig slurry on yield and quality of tomato soilless cultivation, as well as the yield and quality influenced by plant carbohydrate metabolism, remain unexplored. Here, the dual inputs of fertilizers (digested pig slurry (D) and mineral fertilizer (M)) and soilless substrates (peat substrate (P) and cinder substrate(C)) consisted of four treatments. The dry biomass and fruit yields, photosynthetic parameters, carbohydrate contents and metabolism enzymes in leaves and fruits were recorded during the experimental period. The highest fruit yields were obtained in DP and MP treatments. Although DP treatment significantly increased the fresh weight of single fruits by 18.0% compared to MP treatment, it reduced the number of ripe fruits. The photosynthetic efficiency and carbohydrate contents (sucrose, glucose and fructose) in leaves were generally higher in DP treatment compared to other treatments, as well as the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase and AGPase in leaves. The soluble sugar contents of fruits in DP and DC treatments were enhanced by 12.3% and 37.0%, respectively, compared to MP and MC treatments. Moreover, the current results showed that DP treatment significantly increased the activity of acid invertase in fruit by 36.3%, 31.3%, and 42.2%, respectively, compared to MP, DC, and MC treatments, and decreased the activity of AGPase by 24.2%, 16.0%, and 36.4%, respectively. The current results have demonstrated that DP treatment had better yield and quality, owing to digested pig slurry increasing the photosynthetic efficiency and source strength, and regulated the activities of carbohydrate metabolism enzymes.

AB  - Food production systems can contribute to the degradation of the environment; thereby endangering the very resource, they depend on. However, while overall large, the environmental impacts of individual agricultural products are disparate. Therefore, in order to gain a better understanding of the impact different food production systems have on the environment, we should start at the produce level. In this study, we combine life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology and data envelopment analysis to calculate environmental efficiency scores (i.e., agricultural output divided by environmental impacts) for eight product groups (Milk, Cattle, Pig fattening, Cereals, Beets, Potatoes, Vegetables, Fruits) in Switzerland. First, LCA is used to calculate "cradle to farm-gate" environmental impacts. These impacts are then used as inputs in a data envelopment analysis, with the amount of produced agricultural products as outputs. The resulting environmental efficiency scores reflect the relative efficiency (i.e., related to the best-observed performance) of the observed product groups. We find large differences in environmental impacts and environmental efficiency score distribution between the product groups. While we find some variability of environmental efficiency between farming systems (Organic and Proof of Ecological Performance) within a product group (difference in coefficient of variation between farming systems: Fruits = 48%, Vegetables = 13%, Cereals, Potatoes = 8%), we did not find any significant differences in environmental efficiency between organic and integrated farming systems for any of the considered product groups. Furthermore, we did not find a negative effect of multifunctionality of Swiss farms (i.e., multiple simultaneously produced product groups), but found a small positive effect for Milk in the presence of other product groups. However, the high within product group variance of environmental efficiency suggests the potential for improvements (notably >40% for Fruits and >30% for Cattle and Potatoes).

AB  - Over the last decades, the coexistence between humans and large carnivores has become a major issue for conservation science. To date however, most studies focus on a dual relationship between humans and nonhumans of one other species only and fail to consider the multispecies assemblage in which they interact. In this study, building on more-than-human geography, which considers non-humans as co-constitutive of places, we analyse the coexistence between brown bears Ursus arctos and pastoralists in the Pyrenees with a multispecies lens. By combining camera trap survey with participant observation and semi-structured interviews within three summer pastures in France between 2021 and 2023, we show how the return of bears in a human-dominated landscape has transformed wildlife agency, i.e. the capacity of non-humans to shape the world through the relational networks in which they are involved. Our results show that, although non-human species such as ungulates, birds or medium-sized carnivores and pastoralists interact in various ways, pastures are primarily human-dominated landscapes in which wildlife remains partially segregated. In contrast, bears exhibit strong agency through their opportunistic use of space and predatory behaviour, constraining pastoralists to adapt and transforming some of their relationships with other species. Pastures are not anymore human spaces only but shared landscapes. This result suggests that coexistence with large carnivores cannot be achieved by taking as a state of reference apparently peaceful yet unbalanced relationship of humans with other species. Rather it necessitates a change in perspective, acknowledging the full legitimacy of non-humans in shaping landscapes of coexistence.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of five forage cactus genotypes ("Gigante," "Miuda," "IPA Sertania," "Orelha de Elefante Mexicana" [OCP], and "Orelha de Elefante Africana" [ACP]) in sheep. The goal was also to show the importance of energy content compared with other forages produced in dryland conditions. Five male sheep cannulated were randomized in a 5 x 5 Latin square design. The experimental diets contained a genotype of spineless forage cactus (440 g/kg of dry matter [DM]), alfalfa hay (585 g/kg DM), and a mineral mixture (15 g/kg DM). The "Gigante" diet promoted lower ruminal pH than the diet containing ACP. There was a lower ruminal ammonia nitrogen concentration observed in the "Gigante" and "Miuda" diets. The highest concentration was found in the "IPA Sertania" diet. The highest levels of microbial protein synthesis and efficiency were observed for the "IPA Sertania" diet. Except for the ACP cactus, the spineless forage cactus genotypes featured metabolizable energy content (2.29-2.39 Mcal/kg DM) that was higher than that of alfalfa hay. The spineless forage cactus is suggested to be the primary forage to adopt in semiarid areas due to its high nutritional value and its incomparable production of energy and water per area.

AB  - Simple Summary Chato Murciano pigs are a protected breed of great interest from a health point of view since their meat has a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). However, this could lead to technological problems that could negatively affect the quality and shelf life of this meat. Therefore, the dietary supplementation with Rosmarinus officinalis L. extract could have an impact on the antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of the Chato Murciano pork and thus control its deterioration. In the present study, rosemary extract was not effective in improving the pork quality packaged under modified atmosphere over storage time, but it delayed microbial growth without affecting the sensory profile. Thus, rosemary extract could be used to enhance the shelf-life of meat by controlling microbial spoilage. (1) Background: The effect of Rosmarinus officinalis L. dietary supplementation on the pork meat quality of the Chato Murciano breed of pigs was evaluated during 21 days of storage. (2) Methods: Twenty-one castrated male pigs were divided into two groups. One group was fed a control diet (group C), and the other group consumed the same diet plus a 1000 ppm supplement of deodorized rosemary extract (group R). (3) Results: While the inclusion of rosemary extract in the pig diet did not produce notable changes in the technological parameters analysed in the meat, the lower microbiological count obtained in meat pointed to the antimicrobial effect of the extract. The storage time had a significant effect on all the parameters studied in both groups (C and R). Thus, lipid oxidation increased and the colour of the meat deteriorated, at the same time as the microbial counts and the deterioration of the sensory attributes increased. (4) Conclusions: Therefore, a certain antimicrobial effect of rosemary was observed in the meat of Chato Murciano.

AB  - Introduction Monitoring overnight behavior is important in assessing the overall wellbeing of ex-situ elephant populations, with recumbent rest and stereotypy as key indicators of welfare. However, there have been few studies that address the overnight behavior of singly housed male elephants with a history of stereotypy. We conducted an opportunistic case study of the overnight behavior (i.e., rest and stereotypy) of a singly housed geriatric male Asian elephant at the Oklahoma City Zoo to identify his overnight behavioral rhythms in response to physiological (musth) and environmental changes (habitat access, automatic timed feeders) and guide management strategies.Methods Infrared cameras were utilized to conduct continuous focal-animal sampling of the elephant's behavior between 20:00 and 08:00 in indoor and outdoor habitats. Sampling occurred from January 2023 to October 2023, with a total of 179 overnight observations.Results The elephant exhibited recumbent rest for 175.66 +/- 6.80 (mean +/- SE) minutes per night and was engaged in stereotypy for 175.88 +/- 9.68 minutes per night. While there was no significant relationship between stereotypy and the sexual state of musth, musth was associated with reduced durations of recumbent rest. Access to both indoor and outdoor habitats was significantly related to decreased stereotypy compared to indoor-only treatments. Recumbent rest occurred most frequently between 02:00 and 05:00, and stereotypic behavior was most common between 06:00 and 08:00. Contrary to our expectations, automatic feeders did not significantly reduce stereotypy.Discussion The results of this study provide insight into the behavioral patterns of a geriatric male Asian elephant, demonstrating the importance of implementing an animal-centered approach to enhance animal wellbeing. As the zoo-housed Asian elephant population grows and continues to age, this case study emphasizes the importance of developing comprehensive welfare strategies for the elephants in our care.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic provides a rare opportunity to reveal the impact of reduced human activity on wildlife. I compared traffic volume and wildlife roadkill data along 18 km of highway before, during and after a 3-month period of COVID-19 restrictions with baseline data from the previous four years. Three marsupial herbivores comprised 89% of the 1820 roadkills recorded during the 4.5-year survey period: rufous-bellied pademelon Thylogale billardierii (31.5% of total), common brushtail possum Trichosurus vulpecula (29.8%) and red-necked wallaby Notamacropus rufogriseus (27.9%). During April 2020, when human activity was most restricted in the study area, traffic volume decreased by 36% (i.e. by an average 13,520 vehicle movements per day) and wildlife roadkill decreased by 48% (i.e. from 44 to 23 roadkills). However, when restrictions eased, traffic volume and wildlife roadkill returned to baseline levels indicating that the respite was brief in terms of animal welfare and of limited conservation value for these widespread and abundant species. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggest that even short periods of traffic reduction or road closures could be used as part of a management strategy for the conservation of endangered wildlife populations and re-wildling programs where roadkill is a risk factor.

AB  - 1. Leaf-cutting ants (LCA) are one of the most important pests in the Neotropics region. To estimate the potential biomass consumption by LCA on Salicaceae plantations in the lower delta of the Paran & aacute; River, we studied the foraging activity and harvesting patterns of Acromyrmex lundii (Guerin-Meneville, 1838) and Acromyrmex ambiguus (Emery, 1888) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in a 14-year-old poplar plantation in Argentina. 2. Foraging activity (workers/time), harvested vegetal biomass (dry weight/time) and climatic conditions (temperature and relative humidity) were monitored daily and seasonally in nests from autumn 2016 to summer 2017. 3. The two sympatric species harvested a similar quantity of dry biomass throughout the year (4.9-6.0 kg/colony). Although both species were active in all seasons, their foraging activity was higher in spring and summer, but they avoided extreme temperatures. The accumulated biomass harvested for both species was higher in summer (28.8 and 25.7 g/colony/day, for Ac. ambiguus and Ac. lundii, respectively). However, Ac. lundii harvested three times more biomass than Ac. ambiguus in spring (30.3 and 13.1 g/colony/day, respectively). 4. Although the highest consumption on the vegetation occurred in summer, control tasks should be started during spring (sprouting phase), the most vulnerable period for Salicaceaes. The consumption of new leaves in spring is critical for tree growth, survival and wood production, especially by Ac. lundii, the most detrimental species during this season.

AB  - Uterine infections reduce ruminant reproductive efficiency. Reproductive dysfunction caused by infusion of Gram-negative bacteria is characterized by the failure of embryo implantation and reduced conception rates. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, is highly abortogenic. In this study, the effects of LPS infusion on the endometrial receptivity of sheep were studied during three critical periods of embryo implantation. The results showed that LPS infusion on d12, d16, and d20 of pregnancy in vivo interfered with the expression of prostaglandins (PGs) and affected the expression of adhesion-related factors (ITGB1/3/5, SPP1), key implantation genes (HOXA10, HOXA11 and LIF), and progestational elongation genes (ISG15, RSAD2 and CXCL10) during embryo implantation. In addition, after LPS infusion on d12, d16, and d20, the phosphorylation level of STAT1 significantly decreased and the protein expression level of IRF9 significantly increased on d12, suggesting that LPS infusion in sheep impairs endometrial receptivity through the JAK2/STAT1 pathway. Sheep endometrial epithelial cells were treated with 17 beta-estrogen, progesterone, and/or interferon-tau in vitro to mimic the receptivity of the endometrium during early pregnancy for validation. LPS and the p-STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine were both added to the model, which resulted in reduced p-STAT1 protein expression, significant inhibition of PGE2/PGF2 alpha, and significant suppression of the expression of key embryo implantation genes. Collectively, these results indicate that LPS infusion in sheep on d12, d16, and d20 impairs endometrial receptivity through the JAK2/STAT1 pathway, which is responsible for LPS-associated pregnancy failure.

AB  - Primate tourism brings many benefits, but also some problems. How to better evaluate primate tourism is of significance for formulating tourism management strategies. In this study, we compared the aggressive behavior of three Sichuan snub-nosed monkey groups that encounter ecotourists and found that male aggressive behavior is a useful indicator for assessing ecotourism of these and, by inference, other groups. In high -risk tourism groups multiple monkeys direct aggression towards tourists, whereas low-risk tourism groups are characterized by low rates of such aggression. We found that tourists touching or attempting to touch the monkeys can trigger aggressive behaviors in all groups, while carrying food and eating have different effects across groups. In well-managed groups, tourist-directed aggressive behaviors are milder than in less well-managed groups. We propose that male monkey aggressive behavior elicited by tourists' behavior is a useful indicator in assessing primate tourism, and can help guide further improvements in tourism management.

AB  - The regulation of host redox homeostasis is critically important in the immune response to pathogens. The "mammalian sterile 20-like" kinase 2 (MST2) has been shown to play a role in apoptosis, cell proliferation, and cancer; however, few studies have examined its ability to modulate redox homeostasis during innate immunity, especially in teleost fish. In this study, we cloned the MST2 gene of Ctenopharyngodon idella (CiMST2) and analyzed its tissue distribution. CiMST2 was present in most of the studied tissues, and it was most highly expressed in brain tissue. Expression patterns analysis revealed that MST2 mRNA and protein were significantly up-regulated under bacterial infection, suggesting that it is involved in the immune response. Bacterial stimulation significantly increased the level of antioxidases. To explore the interplay between CiMST2 and antioxidant regulation, we examined the effects of CiMST2 overexpression and conducted RNA interference assays in vitro. CiMST2 overexpression significantly increased the expression levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and other antioxidases and vice versa, revealing that CiMST2 regulated host redox homeostasis via Nrf2antioxidant responsive element (ARE) signaling. Overall, our findings provide a new perspective on the role of MST2 in innate immunity in teleosts as well as insights that will aid the prevention and control of disease in the grass carp farming industry.

AB  - Plant viruses exist in a broader ecological community that includes non-vector herbivores that can impact vector abundance, behavior, and virus transmission within shared host plants. However, little is known about the effects of non-vector herbivore infestation on virus transmission by vector insects on neighboring plants through inter-plant airborne chemicals. In this study, we investigated how volatiles emitted from tomato plants infested with the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) affect the infection of neighboring plants by tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) transmitted by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). Exposure of neighboring tomato plants to volatiles released from T. urticae-infested tomato plants reduced subsequent herbivory as well as TYLCV transmission and infection, and the jasmonic acid signaling pathway was essential for generation of the inter-plant defense signals. We also demonstrated that (E)-beta-ocimene and methyl salicylic acid were two volatiles induced by T. urticae that synergistically attenuated TYLCV transmission and infection in tomato. Thus, our findings suggest that plant-plant communication via volatiles likely represents a widespread defensive mechanism that substantially contributes to plant fitness. Understanding such phenomena may help us to predict the occurrence and epidemics of multiple herbivores and viruses in agroecosystems, and ultimately to manage pest and virus outbreaks.
   The volatiles (E )-beta-ocimene and methyl salicylic acid emitted from tomato plants infested with the two-spotted spider mite attenuate transmission and infection of whitefly-borne tomato yellow leaf curl virus in neighboring tomato plants.

AB  - Simple Summary: Staphylococcus aureus is both a commensal and opportunistic pathogen that colonizes human and animal skin and mucosal membranes. It is widely acknowledged that livestock can act as a reservoir for human strains and genetic traits, but less is known about the epidemiological significance of wild animals. In the present work, the S. aureus isolated from wild animals, hunters, and hunting auxiliary animals of Eastern Spain are described and characterized. The genomic structure of the population of the sequenced isolates showed a significant degree of diversity, raising the question of these strains' origin and evolution. In addition, genomic characterization revealed the presence of relevant genes in the isolates belonging to wild animals, including resistance genes, as well as superantigens implicated in the pathogenicity of certain human S. aureus infections. These findings highlight the role of wild animals as a reservoir for some clinically relevant S. aureus strains and the importance of wildlife surveillance because the environment-animals-humans interaction impacts the transmission and evolution dynamics of S. aureus.
   Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic multi-host pathogen that threatens both human and animal health. Animals can act as a reservoir of S. aureus for humans, but very little is known about wild animals' epidemiological role. Therefore, in this study, we performed a genomic characterization of S. aureus isolates from wildlife, hunters, and their auxiliary hunting animals of Eastern Spain. Of 20 different species, 242 wild animals were examined, of which 28.1% were S. aureus carriers. The common genet, the Iberian ibex, and the European hedgehog were the species with the highest S. aureus carriage. We identified 30 different sequence types (STs), including lineages associated with wild animals such as ST49 and ST581, multispecies lineages such as ST130, ST398, and ST425, and lineages commonly isolated from humans, including ST1 and ST5. The hunters and the single positive ferret shared ST5, ST398, or ST425 with wild animals. In wildlife isolates, the highest resistance levels were found for penicillin (32.8%). For virulence factors, 26.2% of them carried superantigens, while 14.8% harbored the immune evasion cluster (IEC), which indicates probable human origin. Our findings suggest that wild animals are a reservoir of clinically relevant genes and lineages that could have the potential to be transmitted to humans. These data support the notion that wildlife surveillance is necessary to better understand the epidemiology of S. aureus as a pathogen that circulates among humans, animals, and the environment.

AB  - Ecological engineering is defined as the design of sustainable ecosystems for the benefit of both human society and the environment. In Southeast Asia, researchers have applied ecological engineering by diversifying farms using flower strips to restore regulatory services to rice ecosystems and thereby reduce herbivore-related yield losses and overall pesticide use. We conducted a survey of 302 rice farmers across four regions of the Philippines to assess their farm diversification practices and determine possible associations with pesticide use. Rice was the main product on all farms; however, the farmers also produced fruits and vegetables, either rotated with rice (47% of the farmers) or in small plots in adjacent farmland. In addition, 64% of the farmers produced flowers, herbs, and/or vegetables on rice bunds. Vegetables were cultivated mainly to supplement household food or incomes, but 30% of the farmers also believed that the vegetables reduced pest and weed damage to their rice. We found that 16% of the farmers grew flowers on their bunds to reduce pest damage to rice and vegetables, and many farmers applied botanical extracts, growth stimulants, and insect traps to reduce damage to the vegetables. Some farmers avoided insecticides on rice by using Trichogramma cards. Planting flowers on rice bunds, rearing ducks in the rice fields, and farmers' recognition of beneficial rice arthropods were statistically significantly associated with lower pesticide (particularly, insecticide) applications to rice. Our results indicate that farm diversification to produce supplementary foods for rural households and access to alternative pest management options can reduce pesticide use on rice farms in tropical Asia.

AB  - We confirm the presence of Hipposideros grandis G.M. Allen, 1936 from Baraiyadhala National Park, Bangladesh. The identification was based on morphometric attributes of two captured individuals and sequencing of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The roosting habitat was chiefly degrad- ed mixed evergreen forests characterized by steep and undulating terrain with many waterfalls and hilly streams. Our new record in Bangladesh extends the westernmost known range of H. grandis. The ecology of this bat species should be studied, as very little is known about it.

AB  - Locusts are grasshoppers that migrate en masse and devastate food security, yet little is known about the nutritional needs of marching bands in nature. While it has been hypothesized that protein limitation promotes locust marching behavior, migration is fueled by dietary carbohydrates. We studied South American Locust (Schistocerca cancellata) bands at eight sites across Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay. Bands ate most frequently from dishes containing carbohydrate artificial diets and minimally from balanced, protein, or control (vitamins and salts) dishes-indicating carbohydrate hunger. This hunger for carbohydrates is likely explained by the observation that local vegetation was generally protein-biased relative to locusts' preferred protein to carbohydrate ratio. This study highlights the importance of studying the nutritional ecology of animals in their environment and suggests that carbohydrate limitation may be a common pattern for migrating insect herbivores.

AB  - In plant-herbivore interactions, plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role in anti-herbivore defense. Grasses and Epichloe endophytes often form defensive mutualistic symbioses. Most Epichloe species produce alkaloids to protect hosts from herbivores, but there is no strong evidence that endophytes can affect the insect resistance of their hosts by altering VOC emissions. In this study, a native dominant grass, sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis), and its herbivore, oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), were used as experimental materials. We studied the effect of endophyte-associated VOC emissions on the insect resistance of L. chinensis. The results showed that endophyte infection enhanced insect resistance of the host, and locusts preferred the odor of endophyte-free (EF) leaves to that of endophyte-infected (EI) leaves. We determined the VOC profile of L. chinensis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and found that endophyte infection decreased the pentadecane (an alkane) emission from uneaten plants, and increased the nonanal (an aldehyde) emission from eaten plants. The olfactory response experiment showed that locusts were attracted by high concentration of pentadecane, while repelled by high concentration of nonanal, indicating that Epichloe endophytes may increase locust resistance of L. chinensis by decreasing pentadecane while increasing nonanal emission. Our results suggest that endophytes can induce VOC-mediated defense in hosts in addition to producing alkaloids, contributing to a better understanding the endophyte-plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - For behavioural ecologists who study nocturnal animals, recording behaviour at night is essential but expensive. Added difficulties arise when filming minifauna, as the most popular methods of recording nocturnal behaviour (i.e. trail cameras) function at a minimum focal distance of 3 m or greater. Infrared (IR)-sensitive camcorders can provide excellent footage of smaller animals at a shorter distance but can cost over $1000 USD. In addition, these pricey cameras rarely stand up to the elements in the field and are also limited by short battery life. Here, we provide a field-tested method to record nocturnal behaviour, of both small and large animals, at a fraction of the cost. We have had great success modifying inexpensive, commercially available action cameras (GoPro Hero4 camcorders) to be IR sensitive, powering these units with cellular phone power banks and continuously recording behaviour overnight while using an array of a dozen cameras. In total, all components of a recording kit are available for under $150 USD at the time of this writing (February 2024) and can be easily assembled using the guidelines described in the present paper. This paper provides researchers with an economical strategy to record continuous behaviour in nocturnally active animals, with a kit that outperforms most currently available camera options across various contexts. While the proposed kit may provide the greatest benefits to researchers studying minifauna, the recording set-up can be easily and cheaply adapted to capture nocturnal megafauna behaviour. As such, we hope these methods increase the accessibility of science and expand the experimental toolkits of biologists interested in the fascinating, but much understudied, world of nocturnal animal behaviour.

AB  - It is believed that impaired extinction of fear memories is an underlying cause for the development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are enzymes that modulate extinction by changing the chromatin structure and altering protein synthesis in the brain. Studies show that stress modifies both HDAC activity and cerebral cholinergic neurotransmission. The present work aims to evaluate the effect of sodium butyrate (NaBu), an HDAC inhibitor, on behavioral markers of extinction and biochemical changes in HDAC and acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus. NaBu was administered for 7 days in a group of rats that were exposed to single prolonged stress (SPS), as a model for PTSD. Contextual fear conditioning was performed on the 8th day, and fear extinction was measured in the next 4 consecutive days. Other behavioral tests to measure anxiety, locomotor activity and working memory were performed for further interpretation of the results. Hippocampal acetylcholinesterase and HDAC activity were also measured through biochemical tests. Behavioral results showed that treatment with NaBu can reverse the SPS-induced extinction deficits. Biochemical data indicated that while SPS induced overactivity in hippocampal HDAC, it decreased acetylcholinesterase activity in the region. Both effects were reversed after NaBu treatment. It seems that at least part of extinction deficiency in SPS exposed rats is related to hypoacetylation of acetylcholinesterase in the hippocampus. Preemptive therapy with an HDAC inhibitor reverses this process and is worth further evaluation as a possible therapeutic approach in PTSD.

AB  - The role of seagrasses in providing a complex habitat for marine organisms is globally documented; however, few studies have investigated the trophic incorporation of endemic Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica into marine food webs. Meadows of P. oceanica are declining due to climate change and anthropogenic pressures, emphasising the need to determine its contribution in local trophic dynamics. We investigated whether benthic marine invertebrate (BMI) and fish consumers assimilate carbon directly from P. oceanica seagrass or other sources along the seagrass meadow margins in Malta. We sampled and analysed the delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotope values of P. oceanica, particulate organic matter (POM), macroalgae, 14 invertebrate taxa, and 10 fishes at three locations marginal to P. oceanica seagrass meadows. Stable isotope ratios were significantly different between all taxa (F-26 = 17.37, R-2 = 0.68, p < 0.01) and locations (F-2 = 34.22, R-2 = 0.10, p < 0.01). The source, invertebrate, and fishes were enriched in both C-13 and N-15 at Ba & hstrok;ar i & cdot;-& Cdot;ag & hstrok;aq relative to the other locations, L'A & hstrok;rax and Golden Bay, likely due to the increased effluent. Stable isotope mixing models were somewhat confounded as POM and macroalgae had similar delta C-13 and delta N-15 values at each site, hampering efforts to define the resource use of the sampled taxa. However, Posidonia oceanica made the lowest contribution for both consumer groups at all locations, consistent with the results of other Mediterranean studies, suggesting that P. oceanica does not contribute significantly to the diet of consumers at seagrass meadow margins within Maltese waters.

AB  - Hundreds of elephants died during a severe drought in Gonarezhou National Park (Gonarezhou) in south-east Zimbabwe during 1992. The following year, entire female herds comprising 670 female and juvenile elephants were captured and translocated elsewhere. Sex-specific von Bertalanffy growth functions for shoulder height against age for elephants culled in Gonarezhou a decade earlier allowed 667 elephants captured during 1993 to be aged based on shoulder height. The captured elephants provided a representative sample of the age and sex structure of the population one year after the drought. Immediately after the drought, the age structure was determined by deducting one year from each elephant's age at capture and compared with that of elephant herds culled in Gonarezhou during 1972-1987. Adult females formed a high proportion (45%) of the individuals in female herds immediately after the 1992 drought, implying that there was high mortality of non-adults during the drought. There were relatively few surviving individuals in the 0-4-year age class, suggesting that mortality was greatest amongst the youngest individuals. When non-adults of all ages were considered, there were fewer males than females amongst the drought survivors, suggesting that the males experienced greater mortality than the females. Significant mortality of weaned elephant calves during droughts is uncommon and the high mortality of non-adults in Gonarezhou during 1992 highlights the particular severity of the drought.

AB  - Burial has a special influence on carrion fauna, which may change the rate of decomposition and so affect postmortem estimates. This study aimed to identify species and succession of beetles on buried remains. From 28 January to 31 May 2021, we examined the Coleoptera on buried and exposed rabbit carcasses, on the campus of the University of King Saud in an area measured around 175 m by 250 m. The area is almost entirely devoid of flora, except for a few acacia trees and some common wild herbs. It is about 1 km away from residential neighborhoods. In total, 165 specimens belonging to 4 families were collected. The Tenebrionidae was the most abundant family, where it formed 52% at a depth of 20 cm and 78% at a depth of 40 cm in the buried carcasses, while the family Dermestidae was the most abundant in the surface carcasses, as it formed 53% of the insects sampled. Type Mesostena puncticollis Solier, 1835 (Tenebrionidae) predominated at exposed carcasses as well as at depths of 20, 40 cm and while type Dermestes frischii Kugelann, 1792 (Dermestidae), predominated at depth of 40 cm and exposed carcasses, and type Saprinus chalcites (Illiger, 1807) (Hisiteridae) at depth of 20 only. These findings are possibly useful in forensic investigations involving buried bodies in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - Simple Summary The purpose of the study was to identify SNPs in genes encoding TLR7 and TLR8 in goats of Carpathian breed and analyze their association with the SRLVs provirus concentration. A total of 14 SNPs were detected, 6 SNPs in the TLR7 gene locus and 8 SNPs in the TLR8 gene. These SNPs were located in intron, 3 ' UTR and 5 ' UTR regions and within the coding sequences leading to the synonymous mutations. Our results revealed that 9 out 14 identified polymorphisms were associated with the SRLVs proviral concentration. This finding supports a role for genetic variations of TLR7 and TLR8 in SRLVs infection. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8 are important in single-stranded viral RNA recognition, so genetic variation of these genes may play a role in SRLVs infection and disease progression. Present study aimed to identify SNPs in genes encoding TLR7 and TLR8 in goats of Carpathian breed and analyze their association with the SRLVs provirus concentration as index of disease progression. A total of 14 SNPs were detected, 6 SNPs in the TLR7 gene locus and 8 SNPs in the TLR8 gene. Nine of the 14 identified polymorphisms, 4 in the TLR7 gene and 5 in TLR8 gene, were significantly associated with the SRLVs proviral concentration. These SNPs were located in 3 ' UTR, 5 ' UTR and intron sequences as well as in the coding sequences, but they led to silent changes. Homozygous genotypes of three TLR7 SNPs (synonymous variant 1:50703293, 3 ' UTR variant 1:50701297 and 5 ' UTR variant 1:50718645) were observed in goats with lower provirus copy number as well as in seronegative animals. The results obtained in this study suggest that SNPs of TLR7/TLR8 genes may induce differential innate immune response towards SRLVs affecting proviral concentration and thereby disease pathogenesis and progression. These findings support a role for genetic variations of TLR7 and TLR8 in SRLVs infection and warrants further studies on the effect of TLR7/TLR8 polymorphisms on SRLVs infection in different populations.

AB  - Sturdy is a disease caused by Coenurus cerebralis (C. cerebralis) that typically affects the brain and spinal cord of sheep. So, this study aimed to detect the pathological, hematological and immunological changes caused by C. cerebralis in sheep. On examination, a total of 17 sheep out of 30 sheep (56.7%) from various regions in Egypt were found infected with C. cerebralis from May to August 2019. Each cyst was extracted from the sheep brain; in addition, tissue specimens were taken from the brain tissues for histopathological examination. The hematological profile was analyzed. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay's (ELISA) specificity and sensitivity were evaluated using cystic fluid and protoscolices antigens (Ag). The cell-mediated immunity against the C. cerebralis cyst was also assessed via quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) to show alterations in mRNA expression of the Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma Interferon (IFN-gamma) cytokines qRT-PCR. In histopathological sections, cerebral tissue showed an areolar cyst wall with many protoscolices attached to the tissue. The affected part showed prominent necrosis together with inflammatory cells' aggregation. Hyperplastic proliferation of the ependymal cells was a common finding. The infected sheep exhibited significantly lower total erythrocyte numbers (ER), hemoglobin levels (Hb), packed cell volume (PCV), platelet numbers (PN) and segmented cell numbers compared to apparently healthy sheep. Despite the sensitivity for the indirect ELISA being 100% for both of the Ags (fluid and scolex), the evaluation of ELISA specificity using the two antigen (Ag) preparations showed specificities of 46.2% and 38.5% for fluid and scolex Ag, respectively. Meanwhile accuracy ranged from 76.7% and 73.3% for the fluid and scolex Ags, respectively, that showed the priority was directed to the fluid to be used as an ideal sample type for ELISA. Levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were significantly elevated in infected sheep compared to non-infected control ones. In conclusion, C. cerebralis is a serious disease infecting sheep in Egypt revealing economic losses. Although this investigation supports preliminary information about the prevalence, pathological and serological characterization of C. cerebralis, further sequencing and phylogenetic analysis is needed to understand better the T. multiceps epidemiology in ruminants and canines in Egypt.

AB  - For forty years, there has been growing uncertainty about whether Hill's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hilli) still persists in Nyungwe National Park, Rwanda. Only known from one small area within the National Park, R. hilli is listed as Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), based on its extremely small geographic range and presumed low number of mature individuals. Here, we present and describe bat species occurrence data contributed to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) that we collected as part of a long-term collaborative project to rediscover this lost species. This data paper describes the survey methods and findings resulting from cave roost surveys, capture surveys, and acoustic sampling of bat echolocation activity in Nyungwe National Park and surrounding areas in south-western Rwanda from 2013-2020 and their conservation relevance.

AB  - Cashmere traits were deployed for fiber yield and quality during the domestication of goats. However, the genetic alterations underlying cashmere trait selection are still unclear. We sequenced 120 Chinese native goats, including 2 cashmere goat breeds and 6 ordinary goat breeds. The genome-wide selective sweep of cashmere goat and ordinary goat revealed a novel set of candidate genes as well as pathways, such as nuclear factor-.B and Wnt signaling pathways. Of them, LHX2, regulating hair follicle development, was evident from the strongest selection signal when comparing the Uhumqin cashmere goat and ordinary goat. Interestingly, we identified a 582-bp deletion at 367 kb upstream of LHX2 with higher frequency in cashmere goats and their ancient relatives. Thismutation probably arose along with breeding procedures and is putatively responsible for cashmere production and diameter, as revealed by association studies. Luciferase assay showed that the 582-bp sequence, which acts as an insulator, restrains the expression of LHX2 by interfering with its upstream enhancers. Our findings provide new insights into the genetic formation of cashmere and facilitate subsequent molecular breeding for cashmere goat improvement.

AB  - Males often employ different reproductive tactics to gain access to females based on their condition and the surrounding environment. Predation risk is expected to have a significant influence on the frequencies of alternative reproductive tactics because these tactics typically differ in activity, which may result in differences in predation rate. In theory, such predation effects can explain the evolution as well as the maintenance of alternative reproductive tactics. Yet, there is little experimental work testing how predation risk affects alternative reproductive tactics. To assess such effects of predation, here we report on experiments with the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae. The two-spotted spider mite is a small arthropod herbivore species, in which males exhibit precopulatory mate guarding by mounting preadult moulting (and hence immobile) females. Two reproductive tactics are observed during mate guarding: The fighting tactic involves attacking other males to drive them away, while the sneaking tactic involves mounting the females and remaining motionless, even when contacted by other males. In this study, we exposed pairs of male and female spider mites to a predatory mite (Phytoseiulus persimilis) and observed their survival and male response to a predator when females were guarded by either fighter or sneaker males. We found that predation risk was not significantly different between fighter and sneaker males. However, the immobile females were more often preyed upon when guarded by sneakers than when guarded by fighters. We attribute this indirect effect of predation risk to the sneakers continuing to mount females even when a predator is nearby.

AB  - Meso-predators are often greatly interlinked within their food webs. They are often omnivorous, consuming a broader array of prey items than do larger predators. Meso-carnivores can play the role of apex predator by inhibiting competitors and controlling prey populations especially in systems where large-bodied primary consumers are limited. This note presents the first photographic evidence of yellow-throated marten from Nizampur National Park (NNP), Nowshera district Khyber Pkahtunkhwa (KP) Pakistan. The presence of this species indicated that this ecosystem has rich biodiversity, providing plenty of resources for the survival of yellow-throated marten. However, keeping in view the diet ecology of yellow-throated marten we assume that it may have some negative impacts on the ongoing ungulates captive breeding programs with in the park. Therefore, detailed studies are needed to be carried out to investigate the population trend and habitat ranges of this species in the park and adjacent areas.

AB  - Assessment of habitat suitability is crucial for endangered species conservation and habitat protection. We investigated the distribution of the Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) in mountainous areas of suitable habitats for the Chinese goral. The results showed that Altitude, Max Temperature of Warmest Month, and Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter were the main factors influencing the Chinese goral distribution. The highly suitable habitats for the Chinese goral were mainly located in the junction of Taihang Mountains and Yan Mountains in northern Beijing, and scattered in Yan Mountains in northeastern Beijing and Taihang Mountains in western Beijing. Chinese gorals preferred lower altitude where deciduous broad-leaved forests could provide ample food resources and help them avoid the severe winter. It was also found that Chinese gorals preferred moderate summer temperature and precipitation. We recommend that future conservation should focus on protecting the deciduous broad-leaved forests in low-altitude areas to maintain food abundance, and provide supplementary feeding sites to ensure the availability of the food resources. The current distribution areas and highly suitable areas for the Chinese goral should be given priority in conservation management decisions, and the fragmented suitable habitat patches should be connected by establishing habitat corridors, which will be beneficial for improving biodiversity in mountainous areas of Beijing.

AB  - South American invasive plants in the genus Ludwigia (Onagraceae) degrade many riparian and aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Biological control may aid in the management of these exotic weeds, but data on the host specificity of Ludwigia natural enemies is limited. The biology and host range of Sudauleutes bosqi Hustache (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), an herbivore of Ludwigia spp. in South America, was studied to determine its suitability as a biological control agent for 3 exotic Ludwigia spp. (targets) in the US. Weevils maintained at 25 ? (+/- 1 ?) and a 14:10 h (L:D) photoperiod developed through 7 life stages, with a generation time from egg to adult of 17.6 (+/- 1.2) d when reared on the target weed Ludwigia hexapetala (Hook. & Arn.) Zardini, Gu & P. H. Raven (Onagraceae). There was no difference in mean body length between females (2.6 +/- 0.1 mm) and males (2.5 +/- 0.1 mm). No-choice and multiple-choice host range tests were conducted using 3 exotic Ludwigia spp. and 8 native US plant species. Sudauleutes bosqi larvae completed development on the 3 target weeds and 4 native plant species, and oviposition occurred on all but 1 of the plant species that supported larval development. In multiple-choice tests, S. bosqi oviposited on 9 of 11 plant species tested. Results indicate that host selection and development of S. bosqi is not limited to target weeds but also includes valued non-target species. Therefore, S. bosqi is not sufficiently host-specific for further consideration as a biological control agent of exotic Ludwigia spp. in the US and additional testing is not warranted.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effect of exogenous gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) in libido, scrotal and testicular biometrics, endocrinological and heamatological profiles of Ganjam goat buck during winter and pre-monsoon seasons.
   Methods: Forty eight healty Ganjam goat bucks of 3-4 years old were equally divided into the control and treatment groups. The control group received distilled water as placebo, while the treatment group received GnRH injection (4 mu g Buserelin acetate/mL) once a week for four months. Body weight, scrotal circumference and testicular parameters (testicular volume, testicular weight and testis index), endocrinological profiles [follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and testosterone], sex behavioural profiles (libido score, mating ability score, and sex behavioural score) and heamatological profiles (red blood cells, white blood cells, haemoglobin, and packed cell volume) were estimated.
   Results: The libido, scrotal and testicular biometrics, and endocrinological profiles significantly differed between the control and GnRH-treated bucks within and between the seasons within the two groups (P<0.05). Body weight, scrotal circumference, testicular volume, testicular weight, testis index, FSH, LH, testosterone, libido score, mating ability score, sex behavioural score, red blood cells, haemoglobin and packed cell volume were significantly higher in the GnRH-treated bucks compared to the control bucks in pre-monsoon and winter seasons (P<0.05). Body weight, scrotal circumference, testicular volume, testicular weight, testis index, FSH, LH, testosterone, libido score, mating ability score, sex behavioural score, red blood cell counts (in treatment), and haemoglobin were significantly higher in pre-monsoon compared to winter season in the experimental groups (P<0.05). The white blood cell counts neither differed between seasons nor between the two groups.
   Conclusions: Exogenous GnRH supplementation and pre-monsoon season have higher beneficial effects in improvement of endocrinological profiles with cascading beneficial effects on scrotal circumference, testicular volume, testicular weight, and sex behavioural profiles, which in turn will improve the sperm production and its cryo-survivability and fertility rate in Ganjam goat.

AB  - A large amount of ammonia volatilization in compost causes environmental pollution and reduces the quality of compost. Ammonia recycling composting strategy (ARCS) is new strategy for reducing ammonia volatilization by absorbing with backfilling ammonia into the compost. This study revealed the mechanism of ARCS on ammonia volatilization and nitrogen retention during chicken manure composting. The results showed that the adsorption layer containing wood vinegar had an obvious inhibition effect on ammonia volatilization. Compared to CK, ARCS treatment could reduce ammonia emissions and nitrogen loss by 20.65% and 39.6% with T3 (12d), respectively. Different adsorption time would affect the occurrence of various nitrogen components in the adsorption layer, especially the change of inorganic nitrogen content. Metagenomic analysis showed that ARCS treatment resulted in significant changes in bacterial communities, and different backfilling times had significant effects on nitrogen metabolism pathways in compost. Glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase were the key nitrogen metabolism processes during composting, which played an important role in ammonia volatilization and nitrogen retention. The suitable backfilling time (12d) promoted the acceleration of ammonia nitrogen metabolism in the early stage of composting and enhanced the ammonia assimilation and dissimilatory nitrate reduction function in the maturation stage to achieve nitrogen retention. This study provided valuable insights into the effects of in-situ ammonia absorption and backfilling on nitrogen metabolism pathways during composting.

AB  - Monitoring wildlife trade dynamics is an important initial step for conservation action and demand reduction campaigns to reduce illegal wildlife trade. Studies often rely on one data source to assess a species' trade, such as seizures or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) trade data. Each database provides useful information but is often incomplete. Combining information from multiple sources helps provide a more complete understanding of trade. A recent rapid increase in demand for helmeted hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil) casques (a brightly colored, solid keratinous rostrum) led to its uplisting to critically endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List in 2015. However, there is little current information on what factors influence trade trends and what current levels of demand are. We combined data from CITES, seizure records, and previously underused, yet abundant, art and antique auction data to examine the global trade in helmeted hornbill casque products (HHPs). Three decades of auction data revealed that 1027 individual HHPs had been auctioned since 1992; total auction sales were over US$3 million from 1992 to 2021. The number of HHPs auctioned was greatest from 2011 to 2014, just after the global art boom (2009-2011), followed by a decline in volume and price. The auction data also revealed 2 possible markets for HHPs: true antique and speculative, defined by era, price, and trade patterns. Trends in illegal trade matched those of the auction market, but legal trade remained consistently low. Combining data sources from legal, illegal, and gray markets provided an overview of the dynamics of illegal trade in an endangered species. This approach can be applied to other wildlife markets to provide a more complete understanding of trade and demand at the market level to inform future demand reduction campaigns.

AB  - Lactobacillus fermentation can increase the value of wheat bran, but the benefits of fermented wheat bran for pig pro-duction are poorly understood. We evaluated the phenolic acid content of wheat bran fermented with Lactobacillus. The bacterial and fungal compositions, short-chain fatty acids, and heavy metals concentrations in the feces of growing pigs were determined, and the correlations between the bacterial and fungal compositions and short-chain fatty acid and heavy metals concentrations were also assessed. The concentrations of phenolic acids (caffeic acid, catechinic acid, and gallic acid) were higher in fermented bran than in control wheat bran. The diversity of feces bacterial species was significantly higher, whereas the diversity of fungi was lower in fermented wheat bran treatment than those in the con-trol group, and pigs consuming fermented and control wheat bran with different bacterial and fungal compositions had different growth rates. The abundance of genera in fungi that were less abundant in the fermented group samples than in the control samples (including Wallemia, Trichosporon, Candida, Aspergillus, and unclassified_f__Microascaceae) was positively correlated with heavy metals concentrations in pig feces, and the abundances of these fungi were negatively correlated with caffeic acid, catechinic acid, and gallic acid concentrations. Metagenomic function predictions indi-cated that larger amounts of secondary metabolites were synthesized in the fermented group than in the control group. The results provide new insights into the roles of bacterial-fungal interactions in the growth and decreasing en-vironmental pollution of pigs consuming fermented wheat bran.

AB  - As a general rule, plants defend against herbivores with multiple traits. The defense synergy hypothesis posits that some traits are more effective when co-expressed with others compared to their independent efficacy. However, this hypothesis has rarely been tested outside of phytochemical mixtures, and seldom under field conditions. We tested for synergies between multiple defense traits of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) by assaying the performance of two specialist chewing herbivores on plants in natural populations. We employed regression and a novel application of random forests to identify synergies and antagonisms between defense traits. We found the first direct empirical evidence for two previously hypothesized defense synergies in milkweed (latex by secondary metabolites, latex by trichomes) and identified numerous other potential synergies and antagonisms. Our strongest evidence for a defense synergy was between leaf mass per area and low nitrogen content; given that these "leaf economic " traits typically covary in milkweed, a defense synergy could reinforce their co-expression. We report that each of the plant defense traits showed context-dependent effects on herbivores, and increased trait expression could well be beneficial to herbivores for some ranges of observed expression. The novel methods and findings presented here complement more mechanistic approaches to the study of plant defense diversity and provide some of the best evidence to date that multiple classes of plant defense synergize in their impact on insects. Plant defense synergies against highly specialized herbivores, as shown here, are consistent with ongoing reciprocal evolution between these antagonists.

AB  - To date, several ecological studies have addressed the influences of environmental noise. However, fundamental studies on noise reduction depending on the acoustic characterization of natural materials are still lacking. The present study quantitatively evaluates experimental data on sound absorption and attenuation of untreated plant leaves commonly found in urban areas. The leaves of English Ivy (Hedera helix L.), Horse Chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.), Hortensia (Hydrangea macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser.), Japanese Privet (Ligustrum japonicum Thunb.), Laurel (Laurus nobilis L.), Linden (Tilia tomentosa Moench), Magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora L.), Osmanthus (Osmanthus heterophyllus (G.Don) P.S.Green), Plane Tree (Platanus orientalis L.), and Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.) were collected from branches of healthy plants grown under identical climate and soil conditions. To acoustically characterize plant leaves, impedance tube and pulse-echo techniques were used to experimentally determine the normal incidence sound absorption coefficient (SAC), speed of sound and sound attenuation coefficient (SC) values, respectively. In addition, as more effective numerical outputs, the normalized SAC (SAC ') and normalized NRC (NRC ') values were calculated by empirical modelling. As a statistical approach, multiple regression was also conducted to predict the dependent acoustic variables based on the independent physical parameters of the samples.

AB  - Gradual weaning reduces lambs' distress during definitive maternal separation by progressively decreasing milk intake and maternal contact. However, repeated temporary separation during gradual weaning, followed by definitive separation, remains stressful and negatively impacts lamb behavior, immune function, and overall physiological balance of the animal. The aim of this study was to determine whether housing lambs with familiar adult non-lactating ewes during gradual weaning and after definitive maternal separation would reduce distressrelated behaviors and affect body weight and parasitic infection, assessed using the FAMACHA score. Twentyeight single-born lambs, aged 78-95 days, were assigned with their mothers to two experimental groups: A) one group was housed with three known-adult companion ewes that were not nursing from Day -10 (Day 0: definitive maternal separation) until the end of the experiment (n =14); B) the other group was housed only with their mothers (n = 14). Gradual weaning was conducted for all lambs from Day -5 to Day -1, during which lambs were separated from their mothers daily from 08:00 h to 14:00 h. During ewe-lamb separation, mothers were relocated to a minimum distance of 150 m. Lamb<acute accent>behaviors (vocalizing, pacing, lying down, walking and grazing) and the distance to the closest known-adult companion ewes to the lamb were recorded from Day -8 to Day 3. In both groups, the distance between each lamb and its mother was also recorded from Day -8 until Day -1. Body weight and FAMACHA scores were recorded on Days -11 and 5. The presence of known-adult companion ewes reduced the frequency of vocalization, pacing and grazing, maintained the frequency of lying down stable, and increased the distance between lambs and their mothers during gradual separation. After definitive maternal separation, lambs housed with known-adult companion ewes vocalized and paced less, and grazed and walked more than lambs housed alone. Lambs allocated with known-adult companion ewes also exhibited lower FAMACHA scores after definitive maternal separation. No differences in initial and final body weights were observed between groups. The early introduction of a known-adult companion ewes before gradual weaning reduced distress-related behaviors and improved the health status of lambs following definitive maternal separation.

AB  - Simple Summary In the presented study, increasing phytase activity in the diet of grower-finisher pigs improved the bioavailability of minerals, increased their concentration in the femurs, and reduced their fecal and urinary excretion. The results of the research provide new information on the positive effect of the use of an appropriate level of microbial phytase supplementation, which reduces the anti-nutritional effect of phytates by improving the availability of minerals (mainly P, Ca, but also Mg, Zn, Cu, and Fe) for the animal, which, at the same time, limits the negative impact of unused minerals on the natural environment. The study was conducted to evaluate the effects of added phytase in the diet of pigs on utilization of minerals and to determine the essential levels of this supplement in compound feed. An additional aim of the study was a critical assessment of current recommendations regarding the level of phosphorus in the diet of pigs, taking into account the use of phytase. A total of 432 pigs were allotted to six dietary treatments, with nine replicate pens per treatment according to body weight (BW) and sex. The treatments included a negative control (NC) with reduced content of digestible phosphorus; the NC diet supplemented with 6-phytase produced by a genetically modified strain of Aspergillus oryzae in the amount of 250 (NC + 250), 500 (NC + 500), 1000 (NC + 1000), or 1500 (NC + 1500) FTU/kg of feed; and a positive control (PC) diet formulated to meet NCR nutrient requirements for pigs. The results showed that, the higher the phytase activity in the diet (NC+), the lower the concentration of P, Ca, and Mg in the chyme (p < 0.05). Pigs fed the PC and NC+ diets had higher plasma levels of P and Ca than group NC in both fattening periods (p < 0.05). The content of phosphorus in the femur of pigs increased with the level of phytase added to the diet (p < 0.05). The content of Cu and Zn in the femur of pigs in the growing period was higher in groups NC + 500 and NC + 1000 than in the remaining experimental groups (p < 0.001). The content of P and Ca in the feces was higher in pigs fed the PC diet in comparison to the remaining experimental groups in both fattening periods (p < 0.001). There was a decrease in the content of P, Ca, and Mg in the excreta of pigs fed NC+ diets in both fattening periods (p < 0.05). A linear decrease in excretion of zinc in the feces was noted in the case of high levels of phytase, i.e., 1000 and 1500 FTU (p < 0.001). Increasing the level of phytase decreased the Cu (p < 0.001) content in the urine of growing-finishing pigs. In conclusion, the analysis of the effects of the use of phytase in a range of 0-1500 FTU/kg in low-phosphorus diets for fattening pigs indicates that 1000 FTU is the most effective level of phytase for increasing utilization of minerals and reducing excretion of elements into the environment.

AB  - Comprehensive studies on the effects of cold stress on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the intestines and feces remain scarce. In this study, pigs were selected as the animal model and divided into a normal temperature group and a 48-h short-term cold stress group. The ARG profiles in fecal, cecal content and cecal mucosa samples were analyzed. The results showed that the normalized abundance of ARGs in the cecal mucosa samples in the cold stress group was significantly higher than that in the normal temperature group, while the normalized ARG abundances in the fecal and cecal content samples were significantly lower than those in the normal temperature group (P < 0.05). The bacterial community composition (especially Firmicutes) was the major driver impacting the ARG profile and accounted for 32.2% of the variation in the ARG profile, followed by metabolites (especially creatinine and oxypurinol) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) (especially plasmids and insertion elements). And it was found that creatinine and oxypurinol can reduce the abundance of ARGs and Firmicutes in the in vitro experiment. The results indicate that short-term cold stress can reduce the abundance of ARGs in the cecum and feces of pigs, providing reference data for environmental safety.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus) antler extract has been traditionally used in many Asian countries to prevent and treat various diseases. Deer antler extract is generally considered to be safe because humans have been exposed to it for a long time and it has been used as a tonic medicine originating from naturally occurring product. However, the comprehensive toxicological potential of deer antler extract during the juvenile period has not been investigated and its safety for juveniles remains unclear.Aim of the study: The aim of the present study was to comprehensively investigate the potential toxicological effects of deer antler extract during the juvenile period.Materials and methods: As part of a safety assessment of the juvenile period, two separate studies, a juvenile toxicity study and a uterotrophic bioassay, were conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practice reg-ulations and test guidelines. In the juvenile toxicity study, deer antler extract was administered daily by oral gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0, 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg during the juvenile period to inves-tigate potential toxicities on general systemic, developmental, and reproductive functions. For the uterotrophic bioassay, deer antler extract was administered daily by oral gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats at doses of 0, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg on postnatal days 19-21 to investigate the estrogen-mimicking effects.Results: The results showed that deer antler extract was non-toxic and no observable adverse effects on general systemic function, developmental and reproductive function, and estrogen-mimetic effects were observed with dosing up to 2000 mg/kg during the juvenile period.Conclusion: The safety of deer antler extracts was demonstrated in these studies and the results of this study can be used to evaluate human risk or determine the maximum recommended starting dose of deer antler extract for further clinical trials.

AB  - Methane (CH4) emissions from animal manure stored in outdoor tanks are difficult to predict because of several influencing factors. In this study, the tracer gas dispersion method (TDM) was used to quantify CH4 emissions from ten manure storage tanks, along with the collection of supporting information, in order to identify its emission drivers. The dataset included two tanks storing dairy cattle manure, six holding pig manure, and two with digestate from manure-based biogas plants. CH4 emissions from the tanks were measured six to 14 times over a year. Emissions varied from 0.02 to 14.30 kg h- 1 , or when normalised by the volume of manure stored, emission factors (EFs) varied from 0.05 to 11 g m- 3 h- 1 . Annual average CH4 EFs varied greatly between the tanks, ranging from 0.20 to 2.75 g m- 3 h- 1 . Normalised EFs are similar to literature values for cattle and digested manure, but at the high end of the interval for pig manure. The averaged manure temperature for all tanks varied from 10.6 to 16.4 degrees C, which was higher than reported in a previous Danish study. Volatile solids (VS) concentration was in average higher for cattle manure (ranging from 3.1 and 4.4 %) than pig manure (ranging from 1.0 to 3.6 %). CH4 emission rates were positively correlated with manure temperature, whereas this was not the case for VS concentration. Annual average EFs were higher for pig than for cattle manure (a factor of 2.5), which was greater than digested manure emissions (a factor of 1.2). For the pig manure storage tanks, CH4 emissions were higher for covered tanks than for uncovered tanks (by a factor of 2.3). In this study, manure storage tanks showed a large disparity in emission rates, driven not only by physical factors, but also by farm management practices.

AB  - This review explores the roles of plants in rearing systems for arthropod biological control agents, addressing benefits and drawbacks. The utilization of plant materials in mass rearing processes for predators and parasitoids serves various purposes. Natural rearing systems require plants for cultivating hosts or prey. Whereas these rearing systems can be economically viable, they also have important practical limitations. Alternative rearing strategies make use of plant components as sources of moisture or nutrients, and as living or oviposition substrates. Plant-derived foods, such as honey and pollen, can be used as stand-alone foods for the rearing of several omnivorous parasitoids and predators. Certain omnivorous predators show enhanced life table parameters when suboptimal food is supplemented with plant materials. However, the integration of plants into rearing systems introduces complexities that challenge their efficiency, as plant defenses and contaminants can impact natural enemy fitness. Therefore, alternatives to plant foods or substrates in the rearing environment are discussed.

AB  - Although insect herbivory is thought to be higher in agroecosystems compared to natural ecosystems, direct evidence on how agriculture itself has impacted herbivory remains scarce. To understand the effects of agriculture, or the cultivation of domesticated crops, over higher trophic levels, it is necessary to compare cultivated crops and their wild counterparts in centers of origin. In such regions, insect herbivores have a shared history of interacting with wild host plants prior to crop domestication and cultivation. However, most studies evaluating the impacts of agriculture on herbivory have been conducted in geographic regions where crops have been introduced. Here, we studied how insect herbivory is related to agriculture in Mexico, which is part of the Mesoamerican center of origin. We focused on patterns of leaf herbivory across four Mexican crops (squash, beans, maize, and husk tomatoes). We tested if total leaf herbivory, as well as the composition and dominance of different types of damage caused by leaf-feeding insects, differed between domesticated crops and their wild counterparts. Overall, we found that the relationship between agriculture and leaf herbivory depends on the observed crop. Compared to their wild ancestors (or wild relatives), leaf herbivory was higher in squash and maize, lower in husk tomatoes, and similar in beans. We also found that, due to differences in damaged area and/or shifts in dominance, damage compositions varied in squash, maize, and husk tomatoes. Therefore, our findings reinforce the idea that crop resistance against herbivory varies depending on the plant species and herbivore under study.
   Aunque se cree que la herbivoria causada por insectos es mayor en los agroecosistemas en comparacion con los ecosistemas naturales, la evidencia directa sobre como la agricultura per se ha impactado la herbivoria sigue siendo escasa. Para entender los efectos de la agricultura, o el cultivo de plantas domesticadas, sobre niveles troficos superiores, es importante comparar cultivos domesticados y sus contrapartes silvestres creciendo en centros de origen. En estas regiones, los insectos herbivoros comparten una historia evolutiva con las plantas silvestres desde antes de la domesticacion y la cultivacion. Sin embargo, la mayoria de los estudios que evaluan los impactos de la agricultura sobre la herbivoria se han realizado en regiones geograficas donde los cultivos han sido introducidos. Aqui, estudiamos como la herbivoria de hojas causada por insectos se relaciona con la agricultura en Mexico; parte del centro de origen mesoamericano. Nos enfocamos en los patrones de herbivoria de hojas de cuatro cultivos mexicanos (calabazas, frijoles, maiz y tomates de cascara). Evaluamos si la herbivoria total en las hojas, asi como las composiciones y dominancias de diferentes tipos de danos causados por insectos devoradores de hojas, difieren entre cultivos y sus contrapartes silvestres. En general, encontramos que la relacion entre laagricultura y la herbivoria de hojas depende del cultivo observado. En comparacion con sus ancestros silvestres (o parientes silvestres), la herbivoria de hojas fue mayor en calabazas y maiz, menor en tomates de cascara, y similar en frijoles. Tambien encontramos que, debido a diferencias en areas danadasy/o cambios en dominancia, la composicion de danos vario en calabazas, maiz y tomates de cascara. Por ende, nuestros hallazgos refuerzan la idea de que la resistencia de los cultivos a la herbivoria varia dependiendo de la especie de planta y herbivoro bajo estudio.

AB  - Techniques of 3D modeling have earned increasing popularity in scientific studies as they offered unprecedented traits in representing objects. As with all mathematical models, the 3D model will be useful once its accuracy has been validated with direct measurements and the robustness of its predictive capability tested. Although measures of body mass and volume are essential to comprehend the life history of animals, such morphometrics, especially total volume, are challenging to obtain from marine mammals due to their elusive nature, aquatic lifestyle, and large size. In this study, accurate measurements of body volume were directly detected from fresh carcasses of eleven finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis sunameri) and used to validate 3D models recreated from the same animals using Blender 3D graphics. Published models using truncated cones or elliptical shapes, based on 3, 5, 8, or 19 measurements of girths or heights & widths along the body, were also applied to porpoises to verify their accuracy. The Blender-generated 3D model produced the most accurate estimates of body volume compared to conventional truncated models, with a mean error of only 2.5% to the direct volume measurements. When photogrammetric images are available, the model can predict the body volumes based on total length alone. Similar accuracy was possible with the elliptical model using 19 height & width measurements (5% increments in total length). However, significant (p < 0.001) inaccuracy resulted from truncated models with 3, 5, or 8 girth measurements and elliptical models with 3 or 5 height & width measurements, and the accuracy of these models also decreased significantly as the number of measurement sites was reduced. Moreover, Blender 3D models can be extrapolated to animals with images absent, and such predicted volumes were tested to be trustworthy (overall skill = 0.998, r = 0.998, p < 0.01). Therefore, we recommend that researchers use either digital 3D models or elliptical models with 5% increments sectioning the torso to obtain accurate estimates of the body volumes of free-ranging marine mammals.

AB  - Manure management is a significant source of methane (CH4) and ammonia (NH3), and there is an urgent need for strategies to reduce these emissions. More frequent export of manure for outside storage can lower gaseous emissions from housing facilities, but the longer residence time may then increase emissions during outside storage. This study examined CH4 and NH3 emissions from liquid pig manure (pig slurry) removed from the inhouse slurry collection pits at three different frequencies, i.e., three times per week (T2.3), once per week (T7), or once after 40 days (T40, reference). The slurry from treatments T2.3 and T7 was transferred for outside storage weekly over four weeks, and slurry from treatment T40 once after 40 days, in connection with summer and winter production cycles with growing-finishing pigs. The slurry was stored in pilot-scale storage tanks with solid cover and continuous ventilation. Compared to T40, the treatments T2.3 and T7 increased CH4 emissions during outside storage, but in-house emissions were reduced even more, and the net effects on total CH4 emissions from manure management (housing unit and outside storage) were reductions of 18-41% in summer and 53-83% in winter. The frequent slurry export for outside storage led to more NH3 emissions, except for the treatment T2.3, which has slurry funnel inserts beneath the slatted floor. Measurements of in-vitro CH4 production rates suggested that shorter residence time for slurry in pig houses delayed the development of active methanogenic populations, and that this contributed to the reduction of CH4 emissions.

AB  - We investigate how luminescence signals imprinted on fluvial sediments vary depending on the depositional environment and vary through time in the same river. We collected sediment samples from four geomorphically distinct locations on the modern floodplain and modern point bar on the Buffalo River in northwest Arkansas, USA, in order to determine if different depositional environments are associated with distinct bleaching characteristics in the sediments. Our analysis revealed that all samples from different depositional environments yielded ages consistent with modern deposition. The samples collected from the floodplain and bar head contained a higher proportion of grains with residual doses, indicative of incomplete bleaching during transport, while samples from the mid-bar and bar tail appeared well bleached. Our results are particularly intriguing for two significant reasons. First, they highlight distinct equivalent dose distributions in different depositional environments. Second, they shed light on an intriguing relationship: despite generally well-bleached modern floodplain samples, ancient sediments from corresponding terraces displayed equivalent dose (De) distributions that suggest partial bleaching in some cases. This research contributes to the growing body of work that seeks to establish a relationship between luminescence properties and sediment transport processes and offers valuable insight into how luminescence signals vary locally in modern fluvial deposits, which can help guide the interpretation of older fluvial deposits.

AB  - Compared with wet anaerobic digestion, solid-state fermentation possesses many merits such as low water consumption, high biogas yield and low processing cost. In this work, co-producing biogas and humic acid (HA) by two-step solid-state fermentation was innovatively investigated using rice straw and pig manure as materials. The result indicates that C/N ratio, straw particle size, and total solid content (TS%) caused significant effects on the solid-state fermentation process. At the first step for anaerobic biogas fermentation, the optimal fermentation conditions included C/N ratio of 27.5, straw particle size of 0.85 mm and TS% of 25%. The maximal biogas productivity and methane content were up to 0.43 m(3)/(m(3).d) and 64.88%, respectively. This means that biogas production was significantly improved by adjusting C/N ratio during the co-fermentation of rice straw and pig manure. Following, the digested residue was aerobically composted for HA biosynthesis to improve the fertilizer efficiency of the fermented substrate. The optimal aeration rate of 0.75 L/min was obtained, and the volatile solid (VS) degradation rate, HA content, and the germination index (GI) value were up to 19.16%, 100.89 mg/g, and 103.07%, respectively, which indicates that HA biosynthesis and compost maturity were significantly enhanced. Therefore, the co-production of biogas and HA using rice straw and pig manure as fermentation materials was achieved by adopting the two-step solid-state fermentation, and the bioconversion efficiencies of livestock manure and straw were significantly improved.

AB  - Temporal partitioning between ecologically similar species facilitates co-occurrence and can influence the structure of mammalian assemblages. We studied diel activity patterns of two sympatric forest-dwelling wallabies, the red-legged pademelon (Thylogale stigmatica) and red-necked pademelon (Thylogale thetis) in eastern Australia to better understand spatiotemporal partitioning between these closely related macropods. Temporally, both species displayed strongly crepuscular activity patterns typical of many macropod species; however, compared with T. thetis, T. stigmatica was less active during evening twilight and more active in the period prior to dawn. Spatially, T. stigmatica used dense forest cover exclusively throughout the 24-hour cycle, while T. thetis divided its habitat spatiotemporally, spending the diurnal period under forest cover and the nocturnal period on pasture beyond the forest edge. In practical terms, this meant that T. stigmatica and T. thetis were fully spatially segregated at night, during the period they would be likely to do most of their foraging. We propose that the spatiotemporal partitioning observed is niche partitioning, and provides a mechanism for the co-occurrence of these closely related species.

AB  - Resource selection functions are commonly used to evaluate animals' habitat selection, for example, the disproportionate use of habitats relative to their availability. While environmental conditions or animal motivations may vary over time, sometimes in an unknown manner, studying changes in habitat selection usually requires an a priori segmentation of time in distinct periods. This limits our ability to precisely answer the question "When is an animal's habitat selection changing?" Here, we present a straightforward and flexible alternative approach based on fitting dynamic logistic models to used/available data. First, using simulated datasets, we demonstrate that dynamic logistic models perform well in recovering temporal variations in habitat selection. We then show real-world applications for studying diel, seasonal, and post-release changes in the habitat selection of the blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Dynamic logistic models allow the study of temporal changes in habitat selection in a framework consistent with resource selection functions but without the need to segment time in distinct periods, which can be a difficult task when little is known about the process studied or may obscure interindividual variability in timing of change. These models should undoubtedly find their place in the movement ecology toolbox. We provide R scripts to facilitate their adoption. We also encourage future research to focus on how to account for temporal autocorrelation in location data, as this would allow statistical inference from location data collected at a high frequency, an increasingly common situation.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - There is increasing evidence of compromised welfare for captive African savannah elephants managed in confined spaces. With the trend for zoos and captive facilities to close due to public pressure, reflecting ethical concerns, and their limited capacity to manage 'difficult' behaviours, elephants will continue to require rehabilitation into free-ranging areas or living in the wild. During reintegration from captivity into a free-roaming system, management methods need to be carefully considered to ensure the individual's welfare. Elephants have a sophisticated social life and exhibit complex body language, employing a multitude of behavioural signals and gestures to demonstrate their needs or feelings. These detailed signals could be valuable when assessing the welfare status of elephants as any large deviation in behaviour could indicate changes in elephant wellbeing. In this study, a group of African elephants ( Loxodonta africana) were monitored as they transitioned from captivity to afree-roaming system. To track the impact of reintegration on elephant welfare, we recorded frequencies of behaviours categorized as Ambivalent, Assessing, Frustrated, and Social, and of specific behaviours within each category, across four phases of reintegration into the wild (Stables, Boma, Release and Free). Significant differences in rates between reintegration phases were observed for several categories of behaviour and specific behaviours. Decreased frequencies of Frustrated behaviours and an increase in social behaviours when the elephants were Free were potentially indicative of improved welfare in wild settings. We conclude that monitoring of behaviours is important when assessing elephant welfare and to establish the success of reintegration operations.

AB  - There is an increasing number of studies showing that occlusal dysfunction impairs learning and memory. We previously demonstrated that the brain has a mechanism to calibrate between the activities of spindle afferents and periodontal-mechanoreceptor afferents for controlling the chewing movement, and the accurate calibration can be done only at the proper vertical dimension of occlusion (VDO). Then, the chewing at an inappropriate VDO may induce a severe mental stress due to a mal-calibration. However, it is not clear how the impairment of learning/memory progresses over the period of stress induced by occlusal dysfunction. We investigated by passive avoidance test how the behavior and learning/memory are altered in guinea pigs in which the VDO was raised by 2-3 mm over the period up to 8 weeks. We found that the guinea pigs reared under the raised occlusalcondition (ROC) for 1 week showed a very high sensitivity to electrical stimulation whereas this did not cause the memory consolidation in the 1st-day retention trial, suggesting that such hypersensitivity rather hampered the fear learning. In the guinea pigs reared under the ROC for 2 and 8 weeks, the learning ability was not largely affected and memory consolidation occurred similarly whereas the memory retention deteriorated more severely in the latter guinea pigs than in the former ones. In the guinea pigs reared under the ROC for 3 and 4 weeks, learning was severely impaired, and memory consolidation did not occur. These results suggest that the occlusal dysfunction for varying periods differentially impairs learning and memory.

AB  - Simple Summary At birth, wild boars and their hybrid offspring usually have camouflage coat colors with juvenile stripes (the black/dark longitudinal stripes separated by yellow/light ones) on their back and two side flanks, and the juvenile stripes disappear at 4-5 months old. To study the mechanism of juvenile stripe maintenance, piglets with juvenile stripes were produced by crossing a wild boar with three Duroc sows. Through picture recording and pigment extraction, we observed that the stripe tended to disappear within approximately 70 days. Furthermore, whole-transcriptome comparison between two adjacent stripes (dark and light) on the back revealed that ZIC4, ssc-miR-532-3p and ENSSSCG00000056225 might play a role in the formation of stripes. The present study laid the foundation for future research on the molecular mechanisms underlying juvenile stripes.Abstract Coloration is a crucial trait that allows species to adapt and survive in different environments. Wild boars exhibit alternating black (dark) and yellow (light) longitudinal stripes on their back during their infancy (juvenile stripes), and as adults, they transform into uniform wild-type coat color. Aiming to record the procedure of juvenile stripes disappearing, piglets (WD) with juvenile stripes were produced by crossing a wild boar with Duroc sows, and photos of their coat color were taken from 20 d to 220 d. The pigments in the hairs from the black and yellow stripes were determined. Furthermore, the differentially expressed genes between the black and yellow stripes were investigated in 5 WD with the age of 30 d using whole-transcriptome sequencing to explore the genetic mechanism of the juvenile stripes. The juvenile stripes started to disappear at about 70 d, and stripes were not distinguished with the naked eye at about 160 d; that is, the juvenile stripe completely disappeared. A hotspot of a differentially expressing (DE) region was found on chromosome 13, containing/covering 2 of 13 DE genes and 8 of 10 DE lncRNAs in this region. A network among ZIC4, ssc-miR-532-3p, and ENSSSCG00000056225 might regulate the formation of juvenile stripes. Altogether, this study provides new insights into spatiotemporal coat color pattern.

AB  - The recovery of threatened species after conservation measures can lead to human-wildlife conflicts. One example of such is the recent population growth of the Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis, a large herbivorous bird. During migration, geese stage in large numbers on agricultural fields in range countries and cause substantial damage to farms. A combination of repelling fields, where geese were chased off by humans, and accommodation fields, which provide refuge sites for foraging geese, has been suggested as an effective management tool to mitigate conflicts. Using high-resolution satellite tracking data, we investigated habitat selection of 41 barnacle geese staging in Northern Karelia, Finland, during spring 2021. We estimated relative habitat use by these geese and conducted a fine-scale analysis of their use of different fields by employing Hidden Markov Models and integrated step-selection analysis. Fields included normal crop (no goose management), project and other (private and Nature 2000 area) accommodation fields and repelling fields. Project accommodation and repelling fields were established on areas known to have a long history of high grazing pressure by barnacle geese. We found that behavioural data of geese can be categorized into three different states (static, slow and fast movement). Static and slow states were used for local field selection, fast state for field selection in the regional area, and all states for field selection after leaving a repelling field. Overall, relative habitat use indicated that geese utilize accommodation fields more than expected by their availability. Integrated step-selection analyses revealed that geese avoided normal and repelling versus project accommodation fields at the regional scale. At the local scale, they preferred project accommodation fields over all other fields. After leaving a repelling field, geese did not show preference for any accommodation over repelling fields. Synthesis and application. Geese show individual selection for accommodation fields compared to normal or repelling fields across several scales. Our results suggest that the accommodation field concept-consisting of refuge areas and no-go areas where geese are repelled from-can help to mitigate the human-wildlife conflict using local stakeholders' knowledge.

AB  - The identification and implementation of conflict reduction measures are necessary to reduce predator attacks on people and livestock and to minimize human encroachment into predator habitats. We identified potential human-tiger conflict reduction measures and prioritized these measures for Chitwan National Park, Nepal. We identified these measures through a literature review, key informant interviews and a local stakeholder workshop. We prioritized the identified measures using a questionnaire survey of victims of tiger attacks (farmers, forest users and fishers), beneficiaries of tiger conservation (tourist guides, Jeep and elephant safari operators, tour and hotel operators and business operators) and National Park managers. We identified 22 measures (12 preventative, five reactive and five mitigative) as having potential for reducing negative interactions between people and tigers. Amongst these, we identified compensation payments, tiger-proof fences and habitat and prey management as high-priority measures. Conflict reduction priorities also varied amongst stakeholder groups. The victims assigned the highest priority to the construction of tiger-proof fences, whereas beneficiaries identified the management of habitat and prey as their highest priority. Compensation payments were the first preference of National Park managers and were amongst the top two priorities of all stakeholder groups. We recommend the adoption of the identified stakeholder priorities for reducing human-tiger conflict around Chitwan National Park and encourage consideration of the variations in priorities between stakeholder groups during policy development and decision-making.

AB  - At the present stage, heavy metal pollution, led by environmental exposure to cadmium (Cd), has caused incalculable losses in animal husbandry. The potential value of caprylic acid as a medium- and long-chain fatty acid with a unique role in regulating lipid metabolism has attracted much attention. Our previous study found that octanoic acid levels were significantly reduced under Cd-exposed conditions in Hu Sheep, on the basis of which we investigated the protective effect of sodium octanoate, a derivative of octanoic acid, against Cd exposure in Hu Sheep in the present study. In this study, an animal model of Cd exposure in Hu Sheep was established. Comprehensive assessment of Cd-induced intestinal injury using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, immunostaining and carried out in-depth analyses combined with lipid metabolomics and transcriptomics. The results showed that Cd exposure triggered intestinal inflammation, barrier function damage and oxidative stress imbalance. Lipid metabolomics analysis showed that Cd exposure severely disrupted lipid metabolic processes, especially the glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway, suggesting that lipid metabolic disorders are closely related to intestinal injury. Notably, sodium octanoate could partially reverse the lipid metabolism abnormality by regulating the Adenosine 5 '-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, effectively alleviating the Cd toxicity, which provides a brand-new prevention and control strategy for Cd-induced intestinal injury in the livestock industry pollution-mediated disease.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is crucial for follicle development through the regulation of granulosa cell (GC) function in some mammals, but its mechanism is unclear in yak (Bos grunniens). Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the effects of VEGF on the viability, apoptosis and steroidogenesis of yak GCs. First, we investigated the localization of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR2) in yak ovaries by immunohistochemistry analysis and evaluated the effect of culture medium containing different VEGF concentrations and culture times on the viability of yak GCs by Cell Counting Kit-8. Then, optimal treatment with 20 ng/mL VEGF for 24 h was selected to analyze the effects of this compound on intracellular reactive oxygen species levels by DCFH-DA kit, cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry, steroidogenesis by ELISA kit and the expression of the related genes by RT-qPCR. The results showed that VEGF and VEGFR2 were highly coexpressed in GCs and theca cells. GCs cultured in medium containing 20 ng/mL VEGF for 24 h significantly improved cell viability, decreased ROS production, promoted the transition from G1 phase to S phase (P < 0.05), increased the expression of the CCND1 (P < 0.05), CCNE1, CDK2, CDK4, and PCNA genes (P < 0.01) and decreased the expression of the P53 gene (P < 0.05). This treatment significantly reduced GC apoptosis (P < 0.05) by promoting the expression of BCL2 and GDF9 (P < 0.01) and inhibiting the expression of BAX and CASPASE3 (P < 0.05). VEGF promoted progesterone secretion (P < 0.05) accompanied by increased expression of HSD3B, StAR and CYP11A1 (P < 0.05). Taken together, our findings highlight the beneficial influence exerted by VEGF in improving GC viability and reducing ROS production and the apoptosis rate through the modulation of related gene expression.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Free-range exhibits are used by zoos to allow visitors to experience or interact with animals in a semi-natural setting; close interactions with animals have been shown to increase empathy and contribute to conservation outcomes, and as such zoos are increasingly implementing free-range style exhibits to facilitate this goal. We aimed to investigate whether this close proximity to zoo visitors impacted upon four species of macropod (red kangaroo Macropus rufus, red-necked wallaby Macropus rufogriseus, swamp wallaby Wallabia bicolor, and quokka Setonix brachyurus) in a free-range exhibit in an Australian zoo. Specifically, we used instantaneous scan sampling to assess animal behavior and examined whether visitor number affected the proportion of individuals that exhibited four target behaviors; visitor-directed vigilance, retreat, resting, and foraging behavior. We found that the proportion of individuals exhibiting visitor-directed vigilance significantly increased as pedestrian visitor number increased for three of the four species, and the proportion of individuals that were resting was significantly negatively related to visitor number for both wallaby species. The proportion of individuals of each species foraging or retreating was unrelated to visitor number. These data suggest that a visitor effect exists in a walk-through exhibit of macropods, and once visitor numbers go beyond a threshold, the behavior of more animals is impacted, likely compromising welfare. Interestingly, quokka do not appear to be affected by zoo visitors; which may be due to visitor pressure being perceived differently due to evolutionary differences, or that housing and husbandry ameliorate the visitor effect for this species but not others. Like many studies before, taking a species-specific approach to understanding zoo visitor-animal interactions has determined how the visitor effect likely impacts macropods differently.

AB  - Herbal teas, including Camellia sinensis (black and green teas), are popular beverages with health benefits for consumers worldwide. These products are prepared from natural materials of different plant parts containing antioxidant properties and vitamins. The aim of this study was to investigate fungal contaminants and their ability to produce ochratoxin A (OTA) in herbal tea samples. Seven herbal teas were obtained from local markets in Chiang Rai, northern Thailand. Samples were incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and the growing mycelia were isolated into a pure culture. The cultures were identified via both morphology and molecular analysis to confirm species identification. The identified species were subjected to OTA analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a fluorescence detector. Ochratoxin A was produced by Aspergillus chevalieri and A. niger, isolated from seven herbal tea samples (black tea, green tea, bael fruit, goji berry, jasmine, lavender, and rose). This finding raises concerns about the safety of herbal tea and should be investigated further for potential health implications.

AB  - The study of zooarchaeological collections from Me<acute accent>rida is still rare, lacking above all information on the Romans diet and animal management. Here we present the description of the fauna found in a dump next to the northern part of the Roman wall, which also includes some contexts of ritual nature, dated to the 1st century AD until the beginning of 5th century AD. The osteological remains of animals have shown that most of them come from food waste and worked bones. We can see that there is a temporal evolution in the use of that space and in the species used, with smaller animals being preferred in the first phase and cattle being more abundant in the 4th century. Some improvement indicators were also identified, as would be expected for a provincial capital, such as Emerita Augusta. Also, ritual burials of numerous dogs as well as a skeleton of the oldest specimen in Iberia of Egyptian mongoose, camel and an edible dormouse, constitute interesting discoveries in this assemblage, demonstrating that this is an exceptional sample.

AB  - External quartz abrasives are one of the driving forces of macrowear in herbivorous animals. We tested to what extent different sizes and concentrations influence their effect on tooth wear. We fed seven pelleted diets varying only in quartz concentration (0%, 4%, and 8%) and size (fine silt: similar to 4 mu m, coarse silt: similar to 50 mu m, fine sand: similar to 130 mu m) to rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus, n = 16) for 2 weeks each in a randomized serial experiment. Measurements to quantify wear and growth of incisors and the mandibular first cheek tooth, as well as heights of all other cheek teeth, were performed using calipers, endoscopic examination, and computed tomography scans before and after each feeding period. Tooth growth showed a compensatory correlation with wear. Absolute tooth height (ATH) and relative tooth height (RTH); relative to the 0% quartz "control" diet) was generally lower on the higher concentration and the larger size of abrasives. The effect was more pronounced on the maxillary teeth, on specific tooth positions and the right jaw side. When offered the choice between different sizes of abrasives, the rabbits favored the silt diets over the control and the fine sand diet; in a second choice experiment with different diets, they selected a pelleted diet with coarse-grained sand, however. This study confirms the dose- and size-dependent wear effects of external abrasives, and that hypselodont teeth show compensatory growth. The avoidance of wear did not seem a priority for animals with hypselodont teeth, since the rabbits did not avoid diets inducing a certain degree of wear.

AB  - Composting is a common waste management strategy for recycling nutrients from organic household or agri-cultural wastes. However, thermophilic (e.g. windrow) composting and vermicomposting (using earthworms) produce different nutrient and enzyme profiles. Vermicompost is purported to have greater fertility benefits, but is also more expensive than thermophilic compost. The objective of this study was to examine a novel approach to designing organic fertility amendments by blending mature vermicompost and thermophilic compost. To examine the effect of blending, vermicompost was admixed to thermophilic compost at 20, 50 and 70 % by mass, with and without the addition of coir (cocopeat). Electric conductivity, water-extractable, immediately available N, P and K were measured. Vermicompost and coir synergistically affected the availability of these nutrients. Synergistic effects were between 15 and 40 % for total inorganic N in blends with coir. Without coir, synergism occurred only at vermicompost additions >= 50 %. Synergism for available P and K was present in all blends and ranged from 10% to 35%. Electrical conductivity measurements suggest that blending affected compost within three days of starting the incubation. The activity of five of seven measured enzymes were linearly and positively related to the fraction of vermicompost in the blend. Blending mature composts with differing properties may be another tool, in addition to adjusting feedstock and process parameters, to affect positively the fertility properties of composts.

AB  - Lisinia Ecological Farm is one of the farms within the scope of the project TaTuTa (agricultural tourism in ecological farms and voluntary knowledge, experience exchange). One aim of the project is to support rural development and ecological farming. In this research, it aims to reveal the relations of the ecological farm with the farmers around it and the number of farmers affected by this farm. A survey was conducted with 128 farmers (in the villages bordering Lisinia Ecological Farm in Burdur province). A small number of younger farmers were positively influenced by the ecological farm. These farmers are in close communication with the farm and were most influenced by the farm's natural farming practices. After Lisinia was established, these farmers adopted the ecological farming model and turned to activities such as dry farming, medicinal-aromatic plant farming and goat breeding.

AB  - The contributions of divergent selection and spatial isolation to population divergence are among the main focuses of evolutionary biology. Here we employed integrated methods to explore genomic divergence, demographic history and calling-song differentiation in the cicada Subpsaltria yangi, and compared the genotype and calling-song phenotype of different populations occurring in distinct habitats. Our results indicate that this species comprises four main lineages with unique sets of haplotypes and calling-song structure, which are distinctly associated with geographic isolation and habitats. The populations occurring on the Loess Plateau underwent substantial expansion at similar to 0.130-0.115 Ma during the Last Interglacial. Geographic distance and host shift between pairs of populations predict genomic divergence, with geographic distance and acoustical signal together explaining > 60% of the divergence among populations. Differences in calling songs could reflect adaptation of populations to novel environments with different host plants, habitats and predators, which may have resulted from neutral divergence at the molecular level followed by natural selection. Geomorphic barriers and climate oscillations associated with Pleistocene glaciation may have been primary factors in shaping the population genetic structure of this species. Ultimately this may couple with a host shift in leading toward allopatric speciation in S. yangi, i.e., isolation by distance. Our findings improve understanding of divergence in allopatry of herbivorous insects, and may inform future studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying the association between genetic/phenotypic changes and adaptation of insects to novel niches and host plants.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize the colostrum quality in three different local goat breeds of Northern Italy (i.e., Frisa Valtellinese, Orobica, and Lariana) and a cosmopolitan one (i.e., Camosciata delle Alpi) (n = 30 per breed), reared under traditional semi-extensive and intensive systems, respectively. Lariana showed the highest percentage of fat (10.18 +/- 3.14%) and total solids (30.73 +/- 4.89%) but the lowest percentage of lactose (1.87 +/- 0.82%; p < 0.05); Orobica had the lowest percentage of fat (7.13 +/- 2.48%), total solids (24.11 +/- 5.48%), and protein (10.77 +/- 4.53%) but the highest percentage of lactose (3.16 +/- 0.73%; p < 0.05). This suggests that breeds which have a more pronounced meat aptitude (i.e., Frisa and Lariana) have a higher concentration of components than breeds with more dairy aptitude (i.e., Orobica and Camosciata). Uni- and multivariate analyses showed that IgG is the parameter that best differentiates local breeds from cosmopolitan ones (p < 0.01). Colostrum from Frisa goats showed the highest IgG concentration (100.90 +/- 8.11 mg/mL), while the lowest concentration was in the Camosciata breed (74.75 +/- 20.16 mg/mL). Finally, the highest lactoferrin concentration was in Frisa (1781.3 +/- 892.6 <mu>g/mL) and the lowest in Camosciata and Lariana (763.1 +/- 357.9 and 1148.0 +/- 858.6 mu g/mL, respectively; p < 0.05). Differences between Camosciata and local breeds could be due to the different farming systems, in addition to the genetic characteristics. The higher quality of colostrum produced by some local goats could be an adaptive characteristic that helps the growth and survival of the kids.

AB  - Simple Summary There is an urgent need for a system that evaluates the welfare of the 5 billion farm animals involved in the textile industry. We aimed to create a risk assessment tool to evaluate the current state of the industry by assessing different textile standards that promise higher levels of animal welfare. Only 1 of 17 assessed standards reached an acceptable level of risk for animal welfare, with the rest falling behind. This shows that further work is needed when it comes to improving animal welfare within the textile industry, beyond depending only on the minimum requirements outlined by certifications.Abstract Nearly 5 billion farm animals, including waterfowl, cattle, sheep, goats, and alpacas, are being affected by the fashion industry. There is an urgent need for a system that evaluates their welfare. The rise in public interest on the topic of animal welfare is leading to the creation of different textile standards or certification schemes, which can give us an overview of the general state of expectations in terms of animal welfare within the textile industry. We therefore created a risk assessment tool and applied it to 17 different textile standards. Our results showed that only one of the standards reached a score in the "Acceptable" animal welfare risk category, and the rest of the standards had even lower scores of risks for animal welfare. In general, industry standards have not demanded sufficient requirements for higher levels of animal welfare. While the current risk assessment gave us a good idea of what is considered acceptable within the industry, it is also not necessarily representative of the risks for the majority of farm animals that are part of the textile industry. Only a small number of animal-derived materials are certified with some form of animal welfare standards, even though these standards can play an important role in improving the standard of care for animals. To evaluate the actual welfare states of the animals in fibre production, further research is needed to apply the proposed tool to actual farms.

AB  - We evaluated the composition of soil involved in antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni) geophagy as a potential source of micronutrient supplementation. We identified evidence of soil digging and ingestion by antelope jackrabbits at sites with the assistance of motion-sensing cameras. Fifteen soil samples from sites with evidence of soil ingestion and 15 control samples from noningested sites were collected and analyzed for water content, iron, potassium, calcium, and sodium. We found more calcium and sodium in areas where soils were ingested, whereas potassium, water, and iron content did not differ. In conclusion, the evidence may suggest that antelope jackrabbits ingested soil to uptake necessary nutrients such as sodium and calcium.

AB  - Rapeseed contains high levels of glucosinolates (GSLs), playing pivotal roles in defense against herbivores and pests. As their presence in rapeseed reduces the value of the meal for animal feeding, intensive efforts to reduce them produced low-seed GSL cultivars. However, there is no such variety suitable for the south part of Japan. Here, we tested the effects of cold oxygen plasma (oxygen CP) on seed germination and GSL and lipid content, in 3 rapeseed cultivars. According to the cultivars, oxygen CP slightly stimulated seed germination and modified the GSL levels, and decreased GSL levels in Kizakinonatane but increased those in Nanashikibu. In contrast, it negligibly affected the lipid content and composition in the 3 cultivars. Thus, oxygen CP modulated seed GSL levels without affecting seed viability and lipid content. Future optimization of this technique may help optimize rapeseed GSL content without plant breeding.

AB  - In this paper, we conduct a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of five alternative management strategies for red deer in Denmark: free harvest, trophy hunting, maximum harvest and two cases for natural demographic population compositions. To capture the outcome under each strategy we use a biological sex- and age-structured population model. The net benefit function includes meat values, recreational values, browsing damage costs and traffic damage costs and these values and costs are assumed to differ for the various sex and age classes of red deer. We show that the maximum harvest strategy leads to a reasonably high positive total net benefit, while the free harvest strategy yields a small positive net benefit. On the other hand, the trophy hunting strategy generates a high negative net benefit, while small negative net benefits are obtained under the two strategies for natural demographic population compositions.

AB  - Tambocerus elongatus (Shen) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is a devastating insect pest species of Camellia sinensis, significantly affecting the yield and quality of tea. Due to growing concerns over the irrational use of insecticides and associated food safety, it is crucial to better understand the innate resistance mechanism of tea trees to T. elongatus. This study aims to explore the responses of tea trees to different levels of T. elongatus infestation. We first focused on the primary metabolism and found that the amino acid levels decreased significantly with increasing T. elongatus infestation, while sugar accumulation showed an opposite trend. Moreover, secondary metabolite analysis showed a significant increase in flavonoid compounds and lignin content after T. elongatus infestation. Metabolomics analysis of the flavonoid compounds revealed a decrease in the proanthocyanidin level and an increase in anthocyanidin glycosides (anthocyanins and their derivatives) after T. elongatus infestation. T. elongatus infestation also caused a decrease in the abundance of non-ester catechins and an increase in the abundance of ester catechins. Furthermore, the gene expression analysis revealed that transcripts of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, such as CsCHI, CsF3H, CsF3 ' H, CsFNS, CsFLS, and CsUFGT, were down-regulated, while genes involved in the lignin pathway were up-regulated by insect infestation, suggesting that lignin probably plays a pivotal role in tea plant response to T. elongatus infestation. Analysis of the expression of related genes indicates that the jasmonate (JA) pathway primarily responds to leafhopper damage. These findings suggest that the lignin pathway and JA play a preferential role in tea plant response to T. elongatus. Furthermore, the production of saccharides and the accumulation of anthocyanin glycosides in the flavonoid metabolic pathway are critical during this stress response. Further exploration of the roles of anthocyanin glycosides and lignin in tea tree resistance could provide a theoretical basis for understanding the defense mechanism of tea trees against T. elongatus damage.

AB  - To meet the ever-growing human demands for food, fuel, and fiber, agricultural activities have dramatically altered the global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. These biogeochemical cycles along with water, phosphorus, and sulfur cycles are fundamental features of life on Earth. Human alteration of the global N cycle has had both positive and negative outcomes. To efficiently feed a growing population, crop-livestock production systems have been developed, however, these systems also contribute significantly to environmental pollution and global climate change. Management of agricultural waste (AW) and the application of N fertilizers are central to the issues of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient runoff that contributes to the eutrophication of water bodies. If managed properly, AW can provide nutrients for plants and contribute to the conservation of soil health. In order to achieve the long-term conservation of agricultural production systems, it is important to promote the proper recycling of AW in agroecosystems and to minimize the reliance on chemical N fertilizers. Composting is one of the sustainable and effective approaches for recycling AW in agriculture. However, the conventional composting process is dilatory and produces compost with low N content compared to chemical N fertilizers. For this reason, comprehensive research is required to improve the composting process and the N content of the soil organic amendments. This work aims to explore the beneficial effects of the integrated application of biochar and specific C and N cycling microorganisms to the composting process and the quality of the composted products. In pursuit of replacing chemical N fertilizers with bio/organic fertilizers, we further discussed the power of the combined application of compost, biochar, and N-fixing bacteria in agricultural production systems. The knowledge of smart integration of AW and microorganisms in agriculture could solve the main agricultural and environmental problems associated with human-induced flows of C and N. Building upon the knowledge disseminated in review to further extensive research will pave the way for better management of agricultural production systems and sustainable C and N cycling in agriculture.

AB  - Understanding how animals respond to stressors is critical for effective conservation. The present study aimed to evaluate the physiological recovery of the Shortnose Guitarfish, Zapteryx brevirostris after being incidentally captured by artisanal fleets and compared it to guitarfish with delayed mortality. Moreover, the study aimed to test the efficiency of a rehabilitation protocol for the species. To this end, individuals landed alive were transported to the rehabilitation facilities and kept in tanks under monitoring for 3 days. Physiological markers indicative of allostatic overload (i.e., lactate and phosphorus) and energy metabolism (i.e., glucose and beta-hydroxybutyrate) were assessed in the serum of the studied guitarfish: right after gillnet capture (i.e., post-capture) and on rehabilitation (i.e., pre-monitoring, post-monitoring, as well as guitarfish that deceased during monitoring - post-mortem). Results showed that the transportation and additional handling employed in the rehabilitation protocol did not increase the stress response, pointing to its potential efficacy in recovering debilitated, incidentally caught guitarfish before release. As for recovery success of monitored guitarfish, lactic acidosis was fully reverted after a 3-day rest period, as was allostatic overload. The same was not observed in recovery failure. Correlation tests revealed key relationships between physiological markers, shedding light on how physiological pathways help guitarfish cope with capture and handling stress. This study highlights the valuable application of conservation physiology principles to fisheries management of this endemic and threatened guitarfish species.

AB  - Background Sickle cell disease (SCD) persists as a major global health problem, disproportionately affecting children in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). Accurate and low-cost point-of-care techniques are urgently needed in LMIC to detect carrier or disease forms with haemoglobin S (HbS) and other variants like (3-thalassemia. Methods An open-label, international, multicentre study was conducted at clinical sites in Nepal and Canada. Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers (HbAA) and participants with known haemoglobinopathies (HbA/ (3-thalassemia, HbAS, HbS/(3-thalassemia, HbSS). The performance of six low-cost tests (Conventional sickling test; HbS solubility test; HemoTypeSC; Sickle SCAN; Gazelle Hb variant test; Automated sickling test using automated microscopy and machine learning) was evaluated against HPLC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05506358). Findings Between September 2022 and March 2023, we enrolled 138 participants (aged 2-74 years; 59% female, 41% male) at clinical sites in Nepal and Canada. Four low-cost tests (HemoTypeSC, Sickle SCAN, Gazelle, and automated sickling), which could identify phenotypes, detected severe SCD (HbSS, HbS/(3-thalassemia) accurately (sensitivity >96%; specificity >99%). In contrast, for carrier forms, HemotypeSC and Sickle SCAN only detected HbAS (sensitivity >97%; specificity 100%) and not HbA/(3-thalassemia (sensitivity 0%; specificity 100%), while Gazelle detected HbAS (sensitivity 100%, specificity 100%) and HbA/(3-thalassemia (sensitivity 91%, specificity 99%), and automated sickling test detected both trait conditions (HbAS and HbA/(3-thalassemia; sensitivity 85%, specificity 85%). Interpretation When HbS co-exists with (3-thalassemia, Gazelle and automated sickling test accurately identify severe SCD and carrier forms. However, HemotypeSC and Sickle SCAN miss (3-thalassemia trait, and need to be complemented with other low-cost tests.

TI  - First Report of Biofluorescence in Arctic Snailfishes and Rare Occurrence of Multiple Fluorescent Colors in a Single Species
T2  - AMERICAN MUSEUM NOVITATES
LA  - English
AB  - Biofluorescence has recently been reported to be phylogenetically widespread and phenotypically variable across bony fishes, and is most common in tropical coral reef lineages. Here we provide the first documentation of prominent biofluorescence in Arctic fishes including two juvenile specimens of Liparis gibbus (variegated snailfish) collected from the coastal waters of Eastern Greenland, as well as an adult L. tunicatus (kelp snailfish) collected in the Bering Strait off of Little Diomede Island, AK. Observations of L. gibbus were made during nighttime dives within kelp forests in iceberg habitats in Southeastern Greenland in August 2019. The juvenile L. gibbus specimens exhibit both green (523-530 nm) and red (674-678 nm) biofluorescence on discrete anatomical areas, which provides a rare example of multiple fluorescent colors emitted from a single individual. Notably, the adult L. tunicatus emitted only red fluorescence in a bilaterally symmetrical pattern of discrete red dots and blotches. Potential weak green biofluorescence was also noted in a flatfish (Hippoglossoides platessoides) collected in Greenland, but in no other Arctic species. As the distribution and function of biofluorescence in marine fishes is further examined, this report adds context to its widespread geographical and environmental distributions, and shows that, although rare, biofluorescence does occur in Arctic fish lineages.

AB  - Comparative studies on the diet of large felids in protected areas (PAs) and surrounding multi-use landscapes are important for their conservation. The Asiatic lion is an endangered felid distributed in Gir PA and the surrounding multi-use land matrix. Based on scat analyses, we assessed the dietary composition of Asiatic lions. The frequency of occurrence (FOO), biomass consumption model, dietary niche breadth and dietary overlap index was used to quantify diet. The Asiatic lion ate more wild prey (74%) than domestic livestock (26%) in the Gir PA. In contrast, lion diets comprised 51% wild prey and 42% domestic livestock in the multi-use land matrix. Sambar contributed most (38%) to the diet in PAs, while blue bull most (29%) in the multi-use land matrix. However, diet diversity and niche breadth were similar between these two areas. The dietary overlap in the lions' diet between these two areas was 0.52. The results suggest that large-size wild ungulates are the main prey species in Gir PA, while in the surrounding multi-use land matrix, both large wild ungulates and domestic livestock are the main prey. The present study may help future lion conservation management decisions.

AB  - We report the first observation of mating in the endangered forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii Flerov, 1929) in the wild. The mating took place on 21 January 2023 at a latrine site within karst habitat in Huu Lien Nature Reserve, northern Vietnam. In total, we obtained around ten minutes of camera-trap video footage showing two different mating events of the same individuals. The event highlights the potential importance of latrine sites for interactions among forest musk deer. Our observation provides new insight into the ecology and behavior of this rare and elusive species.

AB  - The concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb) in water, soil and forages have strikingly increased in the Balikun xijiao ranches, Xinjiang, China for the latest 10 years. The concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd, Hg and Pb in soil in polluted ranches were 6.76, 3.37, 6.77,5.76 and 11.67 times higher than those in healthy ranches. The impact of fertilized Nano-K2MoO4 on toxicity of heavy metal have been studied in polluted the ranches. Our findings showed that the concentrations of Mo,Se and N in forage from fertilized ranches were strikingly higher than those in the control ranches (P<0.01). The harvest and digestibility of forage in fertilized ranches were strikingly higher than those in the control ranches (P<0.01). The CP and EE in forage in fertilized the ranch were also increased strikingly (P<0.01). The concentrations of Mo and Se in blood and liver in the Altai sheep from fertilized ranches were strikingly higher than those in control ranches (P<0.01). The concentrations of Cu and Pb in blood and liver in the Altai sheep from fertilized ranches were strikingly lower than those in control ranches (P<0.01). The levels of Hb, PLT and RBC in animals from fertilized ranches were strikingly higher than those in control ranches (P<0.01). In conclusion, The fertilization of Nano-K2MoO4 not only strikingly increased the contents of Mo and Se in blood, but also markedly reduced the contents of Cu and Pb in blood and liver, and remarkably relieved damage from heavy metal pollution in the Altai sheep.

AB  - The rate of senescence may vary among individuals of a species according to individual life histories and environmental conditions. According to the principle of allocation, changes in mortality driven by environmental conditions influence how organisms allocate resources among costly functions. In several vertebrates, environmental conditions during early life impose trade-offs in allocation between early reproduction and maintenance. The effects of conditions experienced during early life on senescence, however, remain poorly documented in wild populations. We examined how several early-life environmental conditions affected reproductive and survival senescence in wild bighorn sheep. We found long-term effects of high population density at birth, precipitations during the winter before birth, and temperature during the winter following birth that decreased survival after 7 years of age. High temperature during the first summer and autumn of life and high Pacific decadal oscillation decreased reproductive success at old ages. However, harsh early-life environment did not influence the rate of senescence in either survival or reproduction. Contrary to our expectation, we found no trade-off between reproductive allocation prior to senescence and senescence. Our results do show that early-life environmental conditions are important drivers of later survival and reproductive success and contribute to intra-specific variation in late-life fitness, but not aging patterns. These conditions should therefore be considered when studying the mechanisms of senescence and the determinants of variation in both survival and reproductive senescence at older ages.

AB  - Simple Summary When there are multiple natural enemies in the same ecosystem, intraguild predation between natural enemies will affect the population dynamics of target organisms and the effectiveness of biological control. It is necessary to study this relationship in depth to enhance the function of biological control. Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) and parasitoids are two types of dominant natural enemies of the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii Glover in Xinjiang, China. Among them, the ladybeetle preys on common aphids as well as parasitoids. This study measured the feeding choices of H. variegata towards mummies with different densities of A. gossypii. Meanwhile, investigation and sampling in the cotton field were conducted from 2017 to 2019. The predation of H. variegata individuals on aphids and mummies was detected using diagnostic PCR. The results showed that H. variegata had no obvious feeding preference towards live aphids and mummies, and preferred denser prey. The molecular detection results show that A. gossypii was the main prey source and medium of consumption of parasitoids for the ladybeetle. H. variegata had strong trophic links to both parasitoids and aphids. The above information is crucial for evaluating the pest control ability of H. variegata more comprehensively and strengthening the strategies for the biological control of aphids. Intraguild predation among arthropod predators in agricultural ecosystems may have a negative impact on biological control. At present, there are few direct reports on trophic relationships among participants of predation in field groups. In this study, we measured the feeding choices of Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) towards mummies with different densities of Aphis gossypii Glover. The dynamics of the occurrence of mummies in the cotton field were investigated over 2017-2019. Singleplex PCR and multiplex PCR were used to detect the predation of 2090 H. variegata individuals on aphids and mummies in Xinjiang cotton field, which revealed the intraguild predation frequency between H. variegata and various parasitoids. There was no obvious feeding preference of H. variegata towards live aphids or mummies, which mainly depended on the relative density of prey. Among the four species of aphids detected in H. variegata, A. gossypii had a high detection rate and was the main prey source of the ladybeetle in the cotton filed. Mostly, ladybeetles consumed parasitoids through mummies, with 6.39% directly feeding on adult parasitoids. H. variegata had strong trophic links to both parasitoids and aphids. We established a food web of aphids-primary parasitoids-hyperparasitoids-H. variegata, which can be used to evaluate the pest control ability of H. variegata from a new perspective.

AB  - Tea-oil tree (Camellia oleifera Abel.) is an important edible oil woody plant with a planting area over 3,800,000 hectares in southern China. Species of Diaporthe inhabit a wide range of plant hosts as plant pathogens, endophytes and saprobes. At present, relatively little is known about the taxonomy and genetic diversity of Diaporthe on C. oleifera. Here, we conducted an extensive field survey in Hunan Province in China to identify and characterise Diaporthe species associated with tea-oil leaf spots. As a result, eleven isolates of Diaporthe were obtained from symptomatic C. oleifera leaves. These isolates were studied by applying a polyphasic approach including morphological and phylogenetic analyses of partial ITS, cal, his3, tef1 and tub2 gene regions. Two new Diaporthe species (D. camelliae-oleiferae and D. hunanensis) were proposed and described herein, and C. oleifera was revealed to be new host records of D. hubeiensis and D. sojae. This study indicated there is a potential of more undiscovered Diaporthe species from C. oleifera in China.

AB  - As an important evolutionary innovation and unique organ, the rumen has played a crucial role in ruminant adaptation to complex ecological environments. However, the cellular basis of its complex morphology and function remains largely unknown. In this study, we identified eight major cell types from seven representative prenatal and postnatal rumen samples using similar to 56 600 single-cell transcriptomes. We captured the dynamic changes and high heterogeneity in cellular and molecular profiles before, during, and after the appearance of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with neatly arranged papillae and functional maturity. Basal cells, keratinocytes, differentiating keratinocytes, terminally differentiated keratinocytes, and special spinous cells provided the cellular basis for rumen epithelium formation. Notably, we obtained clear evidence of two keratinization processes involved in early papillogenesis and papillae keratinization and identified TBX3 as a potential marker gene. Importantly, enriched stratum spinosum cells played crucial roles in volatile fatty acid (VFA) metabolism and immune response. Our results provide a comprehensive transcriptional landscape of rumen development at single-cell resolution, as well as valuable insight into the interactions between dietary metabolism and the rumen.

AB  - Our understanding of how conifers respond biochemically to multiple simultaneous herbivore attacks is lacking. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis; 'hemlock') is fed on by hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; 'adelgid') and by later-instar gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar; 'gypsy moth') caterpillars. The adelgid is a stylet-feeding insect that causes a salicylic acid (SA)-linked response in hemlock, and gypsy moth larvae are folivores that presumably cause a jasmonic acid (JA)-linked response. This system presents an opportunity to study how invasive herbivore-herbivore interactions mediated through host biochemical responses. We used a factorial field experiment to challenge chronically adelgid-infested hemlocks with gypsy moth caterpillars. We quantified 17 phytohormones, 26 phenolic and terpene metabolites, and proanthocyanidin, cell wall-bound (CW-bound) phenolic, and lignin contents. Foliage infested with adelgid only accumulated gibberellins and SA; foliage challenged by gypsy moth only accumulated JA phytohormones. Gypsy moth folivory on adelgid-infested foliage reduced the accumulation of JA phytohormones and increased the SA levels. Both herbivores increased CW-bound phenolics and gypsy moth increased lignin content when feeding alone but not when feeding on adelgid-infested foliage. Our study illustrates the importance of understanding the biochemical mechanisms and signaling antagonism underlying tree responses to multiple stresses and of disentangling local and systemic stress signaling in trees.

AB  - Isolated elasmobranch and teleost teeth, jaws, otoliths, scales, vertebrae, and fin spines were recovered from the upper Oligocene (Chattian) Catahoula Formation in Wayne County, Mississippi, USA. Atotal of 13 551 specimens were examined and 12 340 of these were identified at least to the ordinal level. These remains represent 49 unequivocal fish taxa, viz. 29 elasmobranchs and 20 teleosts. The 3614 elasmobranch remains indicate that Carcharhiniformes is the most diverse group of Elasmobranchii, with 12 taxa belonging to five families. Orectolobiformes and Lamniformes are represented by far fewer taxa (three and four, respectively). Carcharhinus acuarius (Probst, 1879) constitutes 49% of the total number of shark teeth in our sample. Ten batoids have been identified within Myliobatiformes (seven taxa) and Rhinopristiformes (three taxa). Partial teeth of durophagous myliobatids (three genera) are the most abundant batoid remains, constituting 41% of the total number of ray fossils. However, teeth of Dasyatidae and Rhynchobatus cf. pristinus (Probst, 1877) are abundant and represent 36.5% and 15.4%, respectively, of the specimens identified. Herein, we erect five new elasmobranch taxa, including Galeocerdo platycuspidatum sp. nov., Hemipristis intermedia sp. nov., Hypanus? heterodontus sp. nov., "Sphyrna" gracile sp. nov., and "Sphyrna" robustum sp. nov. The Catahoula Formation sample includes over 9935 teleost fossils, which constitutes 73% of the total fish sample. Nine bony fish taxa are represented solely by teeth, jaw elements, or fin spines. Although otoliths are much less common than the other identifiable remains (409 versus roughly 8430, respectively), they allowed us to identify four taxa not known from other skeletal remains. Albulidae, Sciaenidae, and Sparidae are represented by isolated teeth, jaw elements, and otoliths, but we could not ascertain whether the various teeth and jaw elements are conspecific with the otolith-based species we identified. The remains of Sciaenidae (teeth, jaw elements, otoliths) dominate the Catahoula Formation bony fish assemblage, constituting 70% of the teleost specimens identified at least to the ordinal level. Our sample includes the first Oligocene occurrence of Tetraodontidae in the Western Hemisphere. The vertebrate assemblage within the Catahoula Formation at the study site indicates an estuarine depositional environment, which is consistent with previous interpretations based on lithology. At the study site the Catahoula Formation disconformably overlies the Paynes Hammock Limestone, and we believe the disconformable contact locally represents the Rupelian (early Oligocene)/Chattian (late Oligocene) boundary. The fish fauna described herein is therefore of Chattian age.

AB  - In this study, apical dendritic spine density of neurons in hippocampal, amygdalar and prefrontal cortical areas was compared in rats that were repeatedly winning or losing social conflicts. Territorial male wild-type Groningen (WTG) rats were allowed multiple daily attacks (>20 times) on intruder males in the resident-intruder paradigm. Frequent winning experiences are known to facilitate uncontrolled aggressive behavior reflected in aggressive attacks on anesthetized males which was also observed in the winners in this study. Both winners and losers were socially housed during the experiments; winners with females to stimulate territorial behavior, and losers with two other losing male rats. Twenty-four hours after the last social encounter, brains from experienced residential winners and repeatedly defeated intruder rats were collected and neuronal morphology in selected brain regions was studied via Golgi-Cox staining. Results indicate that spine density in the apical dendrites of the hippocampal CA1 reduced similarly in both winners and losers. In addition, winners showed increased spine densities at the proximal segments (20-30 ?m) of the basolateral amygdala neurons and losers tended to show a decreased spine density at the more proximal segments of the infralimbic region of prefrontal cortex neurons. No effect of winning and losing was observed in the medial amygdala. The atrophic effect of repeated defeats in hippocampal and prefrontal regions was anticipated despite the fact that social housing of the repeatedly losing intruder males may have played a protective role. The reduction of hippocampal spine density in the winners seems surprising but supports previous findings in hierarchical dominant males in rat colonies. The dominants showed even greater shrinkage of the apical dendritic arbors of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons compared to the stressed subordinates.

AB  - Post-partum ovarian cycle arrest is the main factor affecting yak reproductive efficiency. There are few reports regarding the molecular regulatory mechanism of post-partum oestrus at transcriptome and proteome levels in yaks. Our previous studies focussed on the ovaries of yaks with post-partum ovarian cycle arrest and post-partum oestrus yaks. In this study, RNA sequencing transcriptomic study was combined with quantitative proteomic analyses to identify post-partum ovarian cycle-related genes and proteins. Consequently, 1,149 genes and 24 proteins were found to be up- or downregulated during post-partum oestrus. The analysis of differentially regulated genes identified three gene or protein pairs that were synchronously upregulated and no gene or protein pairs that were synchronously downregulated, suggesting that these upregulated genes may regulate the post-partum ovarian cycle. The functional classification of these differentially expressed genes and proteins indicated their connection with the oocyte meiosis, the oestrogen signalling pathway, the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signalling pathway. In this study, a total of six genes and two proteins involved in the oocyte meiosis, the oestrogen signalling pathway, the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation and the GnRH signalling pathway were identified. The CSNK1A1, M91_09723, M91_11326, M91_21439, M91_19073, SHC2, Atf6b, M91_03062, HSPCA and calmodulin could regulate oestrus, respectively, in the post-partum so as to control the anoestrus status.

This pioneering study focuses on human-wildlife conflicts in villages near the less explored Pakhro range of Jim Corbett National Park, situated in the Himalayan foothills of India. Through extensive ground surveys, the study identifies conflict hotspots and assesses their severity, revealing the significant impact on local populations. It is revealed through this study a significant amount of population permanently migrated from the villages like Godi and Amsaur in past few years. Animal attacks and wildlife sightings are common occurrence in the region. In addition to this, the study also identifies conflict with herbivores like Elephants and Deers in the region which results in crop damage. To discover the factors driving these conflicts, a thorough MaxEnt-based analysis was conducted, integrating anthropogenic, topographic, and environmental variables based on literature and expert opinions with 86 location points where wildlife conflicts were reported. The model elucidates the impact of these factors on conflict occurrence in the region. It is clearly indicated from the results that parameters like LULC, proximity from waterbodies, slope, aspect, elevation play a key role in assessment of such conflict zones. The results highlight the significance of adopting a holistic approach, whereby considering multiple predictor variables enhances our ability to comprehensively understand and forecast human-animal conflict dynamics.

AB  - Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann is an exotic and invasive tick species rapidly expanding across the United States. Large infestations of these ticks on cattle can cause anemia, and in eastern regions of the country, they are transmitting Theileria orientalis Ikeda within herds. Methods for managing H. longicornis in the environment are rarely successful and rely on chemicals. To document population effects from producer management decisions, we investigated the change in H. longicornis populations to different tick management practices chosen by producers at 3 different H. longicornis-infested farms. Farm 1 kept a closed herd, chose to cut brush monthly, used on-animal acaricides, and allowed us to drag weekly. Farm 2 kept an open herd, chose to cut brush yearly, did not use on-animal acaricides, and allowed us to drag for ticks weekly/monthly. Farm 3 kept an open herd, chose to cut brush yearly, used on-animal acaracides, and allowed us to drag for ticks monthly. We assessed H. longicornis populations responding to those methods over time using active surveillance methods at each farm. Management decisions on Farms 1 and 3 significantly reduced H. longicornis on farms. Importantly, Farm 1 management decisions reduced the chance of a tick being present by 90%; the number of questing ticks collected fell from 5,000 to 12 H. longicornis in 2 years. Therefore, combined management strategies such as keeping a closed herd, use of on-animal chemical control, mechanical control, and reducing the amount of vegetation on farms were effective ways for producers to manage Haemaphysalis longicornis Neuman (Ixodidae).

AB  - Resveratrol (RES) is one of the best-known bioactive polyphenols that has received much attention in recent years because of its importance to anti -obesity. However, the exact mechanism underlying this effect and whether it can improve lipid metabolism by regulating the long-chain noncoding RNA (lncRNA) remains unclear. In this study, 24 healthy crossbred castrated boars were fed a basal diet (control) and a basal diet supplemented with 20 0 mg, 40 0 mg or 600 mg RES per Kilogram (kg) of feed for 41 d, respectively. We found that 400 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg RES-supplemented diet did not affect growth rate, but reduced significantly subcutaneous adipose thickness, carcass fat rate, greater dramatically the serum concentration of adiponectin and high -density lipoprotein in pigs. Further, we verified that RES could inhibit the formation and accumulation of lipid droplets by AdipoQ-AdipoR1-AMPK alpha and AdipoQ-AdipoR2-PPAR alpha signal pathway in vivo and vitro (3T3-L1 preadipocytes). Transcriptome analyses found that 5 differently expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 77 mRNAs in subcutaneous adipose between control group and 400 mg/kg RES group, which mainly involved in "adipocytokine signaling pathway," "Wnt signaling pathway," "PI3K-Akt signaling pathway" and "MAPK signaling pathway." In conclusion, RES can inhibit the formation and accumulation of lipid droplets through AdipoQ signal pathway and lipid metabolism-related lncRNAs. Our results provide a new insight on the molecular mechanism of RES as a nutritional agents to the prevention and treatment for obesity. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Much like subsistence farmers the world over, Mongolian herders depend directly on their herds for food, materials, and income. Consequently, any loss of livestock through predation from wild carnivores (including wolves, foxes, snow leopards, and birds of prey) is a major challenge. With a lack of non-lethal mitigation methods currently available to them, herders in Mongolia frequently manage conflict with predators with retaliatory hunting, negatively impacting populations of wild predators. Livestock guardian dogs (LGDs) are an increasingly popular non-lethal means worldwide for discouraging livestock predation. However, empirical evaluations of the efficacy of using LGDs in contemporary landscapes are rare throughout Asia. Evaluating these human-wildlife conflict prevention strategies are especially important in areas used to produce globally traded commodities, such as cashmere in the case of Mongolia. We implemented longitudinal structured interview-based surveys to evaluate the use and effectiveness of LGDs as a conflict mitigation strategy for semi-nomadic herders in three locations across Mongolia. Sixteen herders in Nomgon, omnogovi, Undur-Ulaan, Arkhangai, Khustain Nuruu National Park area, and Gorkhi Terelj National Park area were surveyed between 2015 and 2019, throughout the process of receiving and training LGDs. Our analysis suggested herders experienced a significant reduction in the annual losses of livestock to predation after receiving LGDs (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Z = -3.329, p = .001, n = 16), including when accounting for background predation rates. Consequently, we consider LGDs likely to be a viable method for livestock protection alongside the conservation of predators in Mongolia, and potentially elsewhere in Asia. We finish by exploring important considerations should this approach be used more intensively throughout the country and beyond.

AB  - Physiological and blood measurement changes due to high heat load, restricted feed intake, and limited drinking water availability in 135 animals of three hair sheep breeds (Dorper, Katahdin, and St. Croix) were subjected to multivariate analysis techniques. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the ability of these variables to separate individual hair sheep into groups based on adaptation characteristics in response to three physiological stressors and identify variables with greater discriminatory power. There were 16, 8, and 13 physiological and blood variables obtained from high heat load, restricted feed consumption, and water intake studies, respectively, for multivariate analysis. Physiological variables such as respiration rate, rectal and skin temperature, and panting score were measured only in the heat stress study. The results of the cluster and canonical discriminant analyses showed the presence of wide divergence (p < 0.05) between St. Croix and other breeds in their responses to high heat loads and restricted -feed-and-water-intake conditions. Dorper and Katahdin were grouped (p > 0.05) together based on the changes in physiological variables, which were separated (p < 0.05) from those of St. Croix as a resilient group. The stepwise discriminant analysis indicated that skin temperature, panting score, rectal temperature, respiration rate, and blood urea nitrogen and oxygen concentrations were the significant (p < 0.05) discriminating variables in clustering individual sheep into groups based on their responses to the high-heat-stress condition. Under the limited feed intake condition, the significant (p < 0.05) traits responsible for the separation of St. Croix from Dorper and Katahdin were blood triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations, whereas blood hemoglobin, osmolality, protein, and albumin were most important discriminating variables under the limited water intake condition. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the stress responses of Dorper and Katahdin are similar and different from that of St. Croix. This finding can be useful information for future decisions in developing climate-resilient sheep through selective breeding.

AB  - The blastocyst of the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) undergoes a period of decelerated growth and limited metabolism. During this period known as embryonic diapause, it floats freely in the uterus encircled by the histotroph. Prior to implantation, reactivation is marked by rapid embryonic growth and conceptus elongation. We hypothesized that the uterine fluid, which is known to undergo changes in its composition to support early embryonic development, contributes to controlling embryonic growth during diapause and elongation. We therefore characterized the pre-implantation uterine fluid metabolome during diapause and at elongation by mass spectrometry and particularly assessed nonpolar lipids, polar metabolites, acylcarnitines, and polyamines. Our results show that triglycerides and diglycerides levels decreased at elongation, likely serving as a source for membrane synthesis rather than for energy production. A functional analysis identified glycolysis as a key pathway during elongation, which may compensate for the energy requirements during this phase. We also observed an increase of sphingomyelin; prostaglandin precursors; and the amino acids asparagine, glutamine, and methionine upon elongation. The sphingolipid and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways were implicated during elongation. Particularly, spermidine, and to some extent spermine but not putrescine-levels significantly increased in the uterine fluid during elongation, indicating their significance for reactivation and/or proliferation at embryo elongation. We conclude that the roe deer uterine fluid sustained dynamic compositional changes necessary to support the energy- and resource-intensive conceptus elongation. However, it remains to be determined whether these changes are the cause or a consequence of embryo elongation. Studying the metabolic changes and molecular interactions in the roe deer during diapause and elongation not only reveals insights into aspects of its reproductive strategy, but also deepens our knowledge of embryo metabolic demands and developmental velocities across species.
   Sentence The metabolic changes in the uterine fluid of the European roe deer including triglyceride and diglyceride breakdown, elevated glycolysis, and increased spermidine levels, facilitate reactivation from diapause and/or embryo elongation.

AB  - Differences between neighbouring tree species in phenology could isolate populations of host plant generalists that depend on matching the phenology of their host. We studied the relationship between the budburst phenology of two co-occurring tree species with early (hornbeams) and late (oaks) budburst and the egg hatching date of associated winter moths (Operophtera brumata) during two seasons (autumns starting in 2020 and 2021). A previous study in spring 2019 had found no winter moth larvae on the focal oaks, while we found them mainly on oaks with hornbeam neighbours in 2022. Congruently, adult winter moths were rarely encountered during the autumns of 2018 and 2019 and sparsely in 2020 and 2021, and then mainly near hornbeams. The vast majority of winter moths had early hatching eggs when both hornbeams and oaks were present, matching the hornbeams rather than the oaks. Where hornbeam was absent in the neighbourhood, the few winter moths had late hatching eggs. These results suggest that winter moth populations on hornbeam and oak are to some degree isolated from each other despite spatial proximity, so that recolonization of oaks by populations synchronized with budburst of hornbeam is slow. Therefore, trees would benefit from differing from their neighbours in budburst phenology with respect to herbivore damage.
   Winter moth populations appeared to have crashed in sites where oaks are the only host plant, while some survived where hornbeams were also present. Most collected females laid eggs that hatched early, indicating synchronization with hornbeams that have early budburst, rather than with oaks that have late budburst. The winter moth population with egg hatching synchronized with hornbeams only slowly recolonized oaks, indicating isolation by phenology on co-occurring trees. image

AB  - Studies on diet mixing for generalist herbivores have documented improved performance for a range of animals from insects to mammals; however, examination of the benefits of diet mixing for generalist parasitic plants has been limited. We examined whether a generalist holoparasite, Cuscuta gronovii, benefits from using a mixed diet. In three replicate experiments, we created six possible pairings for three species of host plants, one from each of three families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Lamiaceae). Host plants were offered to C. gronovii in either monospecific or heterospecific pairs; in so doing, three single-species pairs and three mixed-species pairs were created. Using a nested ANOVA in each experiment, we tested the effects of diet treatment (single-host vs. mixed) and plant pairs on total seed production of C. gronovii. We also asked an additional, similar question using three species from the genus Symphyotrichum (Asteraceae). No support for a benefit of diet mixing was detected for C. gronovii. In contrast, plant pairs (and host species associated with those host pairs) explained the vast majority of variation in plant parasite performance in every experiment. This outcome suggests that some putative host species are in fact non-hosts, while other species are susceptible hosts, and still other species are resistant to C. gronovii. Thus, our study suggests that the benefit of diet mixing seen for herbivores cannot be generalized to include this parasitic plant. While diet mixing does not increase the fitness of C. gronovii, host plant quality associated with plant defenses appears to mediate parasite success.

We employed multi-omic evaluations to identify microbial evidence associated with differential growth performance and metabolites, thereby offering theoretical support for the implementation of efficient farming practices for Tibetan pigs and establishing a robust foundation for enhancing pig growth and health. In this work, six Duroc x landrace x yorkshi (DLY) pigs and six Tibetan pigs were used for the experiment. Following humane euthanasia, a comprehensive analysis was undertaken to detect the presence of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), microbial populations, and metabolites within the colonic environment. Additionally, metabolites present within the plasma were also assessed. The outcomes of our analysis unveiled the key variables affecting the microbe changes causing the observed differences in production performance between these two distinct pig breeds. Specifically, noteworthy discrepancies were observed in the microbial compositions of DLY pigs, characterized by markedly higher levels of Alloprevotella and Prevotellaceae_UCG-003 (p < 0.05). These disparities, in turn, resulted in significant variations in the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid, and the cumulative SCFAs (p < 0.05). Consequently, the DLY pigs exhibited enhanced growth performance and overall well-being, which could be ascribed to the distinct metabolite profiles they harbored. Conversely, Tibetan pigs exhibited a significantly elevated relative abundance of the NK4A214_group, which consequently led to a pronounced increase in the concentration of L-cysteine. This elevation in L-cysteine content had cascading effects, further manifesting higher levels of taurine within the colon and plasma. It is noteworthy that taurine has the potential to exert multifaceted impacts encompassing microbiota dynamics, protein and lipid metabolism, as well as bile acid metabolism, all of which collectively benefit the pigs. In light of this, Tibetan pigs showcased enhanced capabilities in bile acid metabolism. In summation, our findings suggest that DLY pigs excel in their proficiency in short-chain fatty acid metabolism, whereas Tibetan pigs exhibit a more pronounced competence in the realm of bile acid metabolism. These insights underscore the potential for future studies to leverage these breed-specific differences, thereby contributing to the amelioration of production performance within these two distinct pig breeds.

AB  - Piggery wastewater contains high amounts of feces, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other contaminants, introducing serious pollution into water, soil, and the atmosphere. Biological treatment technology is widely used in large-scale pig farms because of its high efficiency and economical advantages. In this study, two typical biological treatment systems-a distributed-inflow biological reactor (DBR) and a two-stage anoxic/aerobic (A/O/A/O)-were adopted to treat piggery wastewater to compare the treatment performance, the dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition, and the microbial distribution characteristics. The results show that the A/O/A/O system had better removal performance in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) compared to the DBR system, and similarly effective at removing and ammonia nitrogen (NH4+-N) and total nitrogen (TN). Using parallel factor analysis of the fluorescence excitation-emission matrix, four DOM components-namely fulvic acid-like/humic-like substances (C1), tyrosine-like substances (C2), humic-like substances (C3), and tryptophan-like substances (C4)-were tracked in piggery wastewater. Protein-like substances were significantly degraded, while humic-like substances were difficult for microorganisms to utilize. The endogenous input and humus characteristics of effluents were enhanced. Bacteroidetes (43.9% and 37.5% ) and Proteobacteria (43.1% and 56.7%) are the dominant bacteria in DBR and A/O/A/O systems. The microbial metabolites in DBR and A/O/A/O systems are mainly composed of amino acids, sugars, alcohols, and other small molecules, while those in the municipal sewage treatment plant system is mainly composed of ketones, amines, acids, lipids, and other small molecules. The results of microbial communities and metabolites can help to trace the process of biological systems treating piggery wastewater.

AB  - Herbivory is a dominant feeding strategy among animals, yet herbivores are often protein limited. The gut microbiome is hypothesized to help maintain host protein balance by provisioning essential macromolecules, but this has never been tested in wild consumers. Using amino acid carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotope analysis, we estimated the proportional contributions of essential amino acids (AA(ESS)) synthesized by gut microbes to five co-occurring desert rodents representing herbivorous, omnivorous and insectivorous functional groups. We found that herbivorous rodents occupying lower trophic positions (Dipodomys spp.) routed a substantial proportion (similar to 40%-50%) of their AA(ESS) from gut microbes, while higher trophic level omnivores (Peromyscus spp.) and insectivores (Onychomys arenicola) obtained most of their AA(ESS) (similar to 58%) from plant-based energy channels but still received similar to 20% of their AA(ESS) from gut microbes. These findings empirically demonstrate that gut microbes play a key functional role in host protein metabolism in wild animals.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens) is an important veterinary pathogen and a noteworthy threat to human and animal health. Recently, there has been a significant rise in the number of moose fatalities caused by this rare, endemic species in China. Currently, there is an increasing trend in conducting whole-genome analysis of C. perfringens strains originating from pigs and chickens, whereas fewer studies have been undertaken on Elaphurus davidianus-originating strains at the whole-genome level. Our laboratory has identified and isolated five C. perfringens type A from affected Elaphurus davidianus. The current study identified the most potent strain of C. perfringens, which originated from Elaphurus davidianus, and sequenced its genome to reveal virulence genes and pathogenicity. Our findings show that strain CX1-4 exhibits the highest levels of phospholipase activity, hemolytic activity, and mouse toxicity compared to the other four isolated C. perfringens type A strains. The chromosome sequence length of the CX1-4 strain was found to be 3,355,389 bp by complete genome sequencing. The current study unveils the genomic characteristics of C. perfringens type A originating from Elaphurus davidianus. It provides a core foundation for further investigation regarding the prevention and treatment of such infectious diseases in Elaphurus davidianus.

AB  - Globally rising atmosphere CO2 has been predicted to affect the emission of plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and the interaction with insect herbivores. CO2-mediated plant VOCs change might contribute to develop effective management strategies for insect pests by using VOCs related biological control methods. In this study, we analysed the effect of elevated CO2 on the host-selection behaviour of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) and studied how they were affected by the release of VOCs from kidney bean plants (Phaseolus vulgaris). A four-chamber olfactometer was used to quantify the host-selection of F. occidentalis for P. vulgaris. Elevated CO2 increased F. occidentalis' selection for P. vulgaris wounded by mechanical damage (MD) and thrips infestation (TI) that might via regulating the gene expression of CSP1, CSP1-q, OBP1 and OBP1-q in F. occidentalis. Besides, we cultivated kidney beans at ambient CO2 (400 ppm) and elevated CO2 (800 ppm), and quantified the emission of plant VOCs by using GC-MS. Thirty VOCs belonging to ten chemical groups were identified from P. vulgaris, including aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, alkanes, cycloalkanes, alcohols, alkenes, aromatic derivatives, phenols, ketones and esters. Furthermore, six VOCs from P. vulgaris were significantly affected by CO2 level, wounding way and the interaction between them, including ethyl benzene, 1,3-dimethyl benzene, 1,3-dimethyl-4-ethyl benzene, (E,E,E,E)-squalene, 2,6-ditert-butyl-4-methyl phenol and dioctyl phthalate. Our study indicates that elevated CO2 might increase the host-selection of F. occidentalis for wounded P. vulgaris due to the changed plant VOCs.

AB  - Megaponera analis is an obligate termitophagous species endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. The species forages by sending out scouts to search for termites. Once termites are located, the scouts return to the nest and recruit nest mates. Scouts face unpredictable environmental conditions, including sudden flooding, temperature changes, high winds and predation by natural enemies. We observed 519 scouting trips from 18 different colonies over three years to determine how long it takes for the colony to replace a scout that has likely died while on scouting duty or is lost due to environmental perturbations. Study areas were at Maremani, Musina, Masebe and D'nyala Nature Reserves in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. We introduced definitions of scouting turnover, scouting trip, and scouting session. Scouting turnover is the time it takes a successive scout to leave the nest for a trip, whereas a scouting trip is the journey a scout takes from the nest in search of food. Since M. analis shows bimodal foraging behavior, the morning observations were recorded as the first scouting session, while the subsequent session, which starts in the afternoon, was recorded as the second scouting session. The mean scouting turnover for all 519 trips was 9.36 +/- 0.64 (SD) minutes. When turnover was divided into sessions, the first scouting session lasted a mean of 7.77 +/- 12.17 (SD) minutes, while the second had 10.34 +/- 18.32 (SD) minutes. The minimum turnover was zero minutes, and the maximum was 124 minutes.

AB  - Diversified landscape functions have deep connection with habitat preference of elephant in several elephant habitats including Mayurjharna Elephant Reserve (MER). The main objective of the present study was to find out the elephant habitat suitability zone or areas considering geo-spatial components of landscape. For that reason, the study taken landuse factors, i.e. forest cover, forest core, forest fragmentation, forest edge, built-up area, agricultural land and road pattern, to fulfil the objective of the study. The selected landuse factors were separated from a classified landuse landcover (LULC) map of 2018 and intersected in a grid framework. From these grids, information factor density maps were prepared in ArcGIS 10.3 version software. Each factor has specific and different significance on habitat preference. After that, factors of significant level or percentage-wise ranks were calculated using analytical hierarchy process (AHP) on the basis of their ecological function. Chosen factors were categorized and placed according to their significant percentage in Weighted Overlay tool in ArcGIS 10.3 software for getting the final outcome. After the analysis, it was found that 87.18 sq.km areas out of total area in MER are very suitable for elephant habitat. Reasonably suitable areas are 306.74 sq.km and 228.27 sq.km areas, which are very less suitable for elephants in this reserve. 147.66 sq.km areas in MER are not suitable for elephant where basic habitat requirements are very insufficient. The well suitable areas are mostly covered with the high-density forest and large forest core areas in this reserve.

AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a cornerstone of global conservation strategies. PAs, however, are not equally effective for all threatened taxa, and it is important to understand taxa-specific effectiveness of PAs networks. In this study, we evaluate the role of the PAs network on the protection of Asian elephants Elephas maximus and their habitats in Southeast Asia's Sundaic region. Since Asian elephants tend to prefer secondary forests or forest gaps, we predicted that PAs would not represent the species preferred habitats. We conducted the most comprehensive analysis of Asian elephant space and habitat use to date through home range estimations and step selection function analyses using over 600,000 Global Positioning System locations from 102 different elephants from Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. Our results revealed important similarities in the habitat use of elephants in both regions, with both females and males in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah preferring secondary forest, forest gaps and areas of regrowth and new plantations. Our results supported our prediction that PAs do not represent Asian elephants' preferred habitats, since for most of the elephants, more than half of their ranges were outside PAs and the probability of selection values for both sexes in both geographical areas were lower inside than outside the PAs. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis suggests that conservation strategies need to acknowledge that the long-term survival of Asian elephants in the Sundaic region relies on our capacity to promote human-elephant coexistence at the boundaries of PAs. We advocate that Asian elephant conservation strategies should be based on the following three key points: (1) large PAs with core areas where elephants can find safety and potentially survive in the long term; (2) promoting connectivity among PAs using a system of wildlife corridors; and (3) effective human-elephant conflict management outside PAs.

AB  - The agricultural industry deeply impacts in the environment due to methane, an important greenhouse gas (GHG), and ammonia emissions that causes acidification and eutrophication. Recognising the urgency of addressing the environmental impact, this study analyses different manure management strategies coupled with diverse energy sources. The principal analytical tool employed was Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), with a focus on evaluating environmental impacts and discerning the most sustainable approach within this context. In addition, Monte Carlo Analysis (MCA) was applied to explore how emissions may fluctuate in response to variations of manure composition. This research contributes to ongoing efforts to align agricultural practices with sustainability goals and reduce the environmental impact. Five scenarios proposed on the swine manure management, based on biogas and solar energy, demonstrate a substantial positive impact on the climate change category when an anaerobic digestion stage is incorporated into the process. Conversely, the impacts related with ammonia emissions were not significantly reduced with the introduction of renewable technologies in the farming. The MCA revealed a high dependence on the chemical composition of the manure for the impacts climate change and acidification in case of the simplest scenarios studied, without biogas production. The application of a solar energy system improves the energy balance and consequently reduce the overall environmental impact. In this sense, hybrid panels that simultaneously generate thermal and electric energy presented the highest energy recovery but significantly higher impacts on eutrophication, toxicity and resource use, due to the higher complexity of materials of these systems.

AB  - The results of studying the space use and seasonal movements of the Topozero territorial group of wild forest reindeer females in the Republic of Karelia are presented. Telemetry (GPS-collars) was used to assess the movements of the wild forest reindeer. Individual variations were noted in seasonal movements: two individuals were relatively sedentary, whereas the third moved over long distances during the year, with the distance between the extreme locations amounting to more than 70 km. The timing of the start of seasonal migrations varied between years. The use of the same summer habitats in different years was revealed, but the territories of the rut and winter pastures were different for the same animals. Movements of animals over fairly long distances have been noted, which is probably associated with the disturbance factor on the part of predators and/or humans.

AB  - Border fences have severely impeded the transboundary migration of a number of large mammals worldwide, with central Asia being one of the most impacted. The Marco Polo sheep (Ovis ammon polii), an iconic species of Pamir, is threatened in its transboundary movement by increasing border fencing among their five distributed countries, including Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. In this study, by building ensemble species distribution models, we found that eastern Tajikistan had the largest suitable Macro Polo sheep habitat (about 42 % of the total suitable habitat), followed by China (about 32 %). We used least-cost paths to identify 51 ecological corridors including 5 transboundary ecological corridors, which may be important to maintain con-nectivity in both domestic and transboundary regions. To assess the potential barrier effect of border fences, we assessed four scenarios (30, 40, 50 and 60 degrees) corresponding to the upper limit of the slope for the construction of fences. In areas too steep for fencing, these could be used by wild sheep to cross barriers or borders and may represent migration or movement routes, defined as natural passages. In the most pessimistic Scenario 60, only 25 migratory passages along the border fences were identified, compared to 997 in the most optimistic scenario (Scenario 30), indicating a strong negative effect of intensive border fencing on the transboundary movement of Marco Polo sheep. The establishment of transnational conservation parks, and ensuring permeability is main-tained in key areas, could have a positive impact on the connectivity and persistence of Marco Polo sheep populations, and provide important lessons for other large migratory mammals in transboundary regions.

AB  - Intestinal disorders are common in metabolic syndrome. However, their pathogenesis is still not fully understood. Pig and human intestines are highly similar in terms of associated metabolic processes. Here, we successfully constructed a metabolic disease-susceptible transgenic (TG) Bama pig model by knocking in three humanized disease risk genes with the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to assess its potential as a model for human intestinal diseases and explore the possible pathological mechanisms involved. We found that jejunal barrier integrity was disrupted and that the infiltration of inflammatory cells increased in TG pigs after high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) treatment. We revealed significant differences in the transcriptome, associated microbiome profiles and microbial metabolite short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content of the jejunum of TG pigs. Notably, we found that SLC26A3 was significantly downregulated in TG pigs. Knockdown or overexpression of the SLC26A3 gene in IPEC-J2 cells significantly affected the expression of MUC2, MUC13 and occludin. Furthermore, in vitro experiments further verified that CDX2 directly regulated the expression of SLC26A3. Mechanistically, CDX2 mediated intestinal barrier function by enhancing the expression of SLC26A3 by binding to its promoter region between -1120 and - 1070 bp. TG pigs represent a promising model that provides new insights into preclinical research on human intestinal metabolic diseases associated with metabolic disorders and revealed that SLC26A3 may be a potential therapeutic target for intestinal metabolic diseases.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was assessed in Michigan surface waters impacted by dairies, swine farms and human wastewater, as well as in an unimpacted (UI) comparison site. Escherichia coli (EC) was quantified in the presence and absence of cefotaxime, as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing EC (ESBL-EC) has been deemed a proxy for AMR. Purified isolates of EC selected without antibiotics were characterised by disk diffusion; antibiotics tested included ampicillin, tetracycline, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, streptomycin, nalidixic acid, kanamycin, ciprofloxacin and erythromycin. Ampicillin and tetracycline resistance ranged up to 67% and 62% of the EC isolates, respectively, at livestock-impacted sites, but were low at UI. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was not observed at all at UI but was observed in up to 76% and 67% of isolates from dairy and swine/dairy, respectively. AMP-TE-E was the most common resistance pattern observed, with all isolates originating from one of the dairy sites. Notably, resistance to cefotaxime did not correlate with MDR, indicating that preselection for ESBL-EC before further AMR testing will not successfully characterise AMR or MDR from culturable EC. Interestingly, the percent of isolates resistant to AMP correlated quite well with MDR. This work highlights the importance of MDR characterisation at livestock-impacted surface water sites.

AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites, but intraspecific variation in space and time can alter the ecological interactions these compounds mediate. The aim of this work was to document the spatial and temporal chemical biogeography of Monarda fistulosa. I collected leaves from 1587 M. fistulosa individuals from 86 populations from Colorado to Manitoba, extracted and analyzed their terpenes with gas chromatography, mapped monoterpene chemotypes, and analyzed chemical variation with principal component analysis. I also measured the amounts of terpenes in different plant tissues to examine intraplant variation and monitored leaf terpene chemistry over a single growing season to examine temporal patterns. Finally, I extracted terpenes from herbarium samples up to 125 years old and compared the chemotypes with recent samples from the same sites. M. fistulosa populations consisted mostly of thymol (T) and carvacrol (C) chemotypes, but geraniol (G) and (R)-(-)-linalool (L), a chemotype new to this species, were also present. A principal component analysis showed that most of the chemical variation across populations was due to the amounts of the dominant terpene in plants. Intraplant tissue chemistry revealed that leaves mostly had the greatest amounts of terpenes, followed by floral structures, stems, and roots. Short-term temporal variation in leaf chemistry of T and C plants over a growing season showed that plants produced the highest levels of biosynthetic precursors early in the season and their dominant monoterpenes peaked in mid-summer. Plant chemotype was discernable in the oldest herbarium samples, and 15 of 18 historic samples matched the majority chemotype currently at the site, indicating that population chemotype ratios may remain stable over longer time scales. Overall, the results show that plant species' secondary chemistry can vary both spatially and temporally, which may alter the biological interactions that these compounds mediate over space and time.

AB  - We describe new material of Hipparion (Hippotherium) chiai from Fugu, northern Shaanxi, China. This collection represents the greatest number of skulls and mandibles of H. chiai that have been reported from a given locality. The late Miocene (7.8 Ma) occurrence of this species is an important chronological and palaeoecological reference for the Lamagou fauna. However, its slender limb bones and prototypical "spring foot" are derived traits that are more suited to rapid running and are a standard sign of adaptation to an open habitat. This also means that H. chiai was a grassland dweller that was well adapted to a cursorial lifestyle. Based on the ontogenetic sequence, we establish a new peer comparison framework for fossils of the same ontogenetic age. Using this peer comparison framework, we find that, compared with holotype specimens, H. chiai of the Lamagou fauna has a wider anterostyle, shorter protocone, weaker plications, rounder metastylid, and a deeper ectoflexid. These intraspecific variations reveal the evolutionary transition between the late Miocene and Pliocene Hipparion in the Old World, and these fossils can be seen as the final phase of H. chiai. These findings and the new peer comparison framework have broad applications to the systematic paleontology of hipparionine horses. This study supports the assertion that H. chiai is the most stable time indicator of the late Miocene Bahean age in northern China and has important stratigraphic significance.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common environmental contaminant that causes food refusal and growth retardation in animals. DON targets the intestine and is hazardous to animal, however, it is not clear whether its effect on animals is consistent. Chickens and pigs are the two main animals affected by DON exposure with different susceptibilities. In this study, we found that DON inhibited animal growth and caused damage to the intestine, liver and kidney. DON caused intestinal flora disorders in both chickens and pigs, such as changes of flora di-versity and the relative abundance of dominant phyla. Functional analysis showed that changes in the intestinal flora induced by DON were mainly related to metabolic and digestive functions, indicated that the intestinal flora may be associated with the DON-induced intestinal dysfunction. Comparative analysis of differentially altered bacteria suggested that Prevotella may play an important role in maintaining intestinal health, and the presence of differentially altered bacteria in the two animals suggested that DON may have different toxicity modes in animals. In summary, we confirmed the multi-organ toxicity of DON in two major livestock and poultry animals, and speculated that the intestinal flora may be related to the toxic damage caused by DON through species comparison analysis.

AB  - It is wondered whether vermicompost can be an alternative to peat in seedling production. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of different vermicompost rates on the growth, quality characteristics and macro and micro mineral concentrations of pepper and cauliflower seedlings. There were 4 treatments consisting of different mixtures in the study. T1: 70% peat + 27% perlite + 3% vermiculite; T2: 70% vermicompost + 27% perlite + 3% vermiculite; T3: 35% peat + 35% vermicompost + 27% perlite + 3% vermiculite; T4: 100% vermicompost. 'Sivrillo' F1 (Capsicum annuum var. longum) pepper and 'Casper' F1 (Brassica oleraceae var. botrytis) cauliflower varieties were used as the plant material. Vermicompost mixtures had a significant impact on pepper and cauliflower seedlings. The emergence and growth characteristics of pepper seedlings were similar in T1, T2 and T3 treatments. However, the T3 mixture provided the highest emergence rate and seedling height in cauliflower seedlings. T3 also increased the leaf area both pepper and cauliflower seedlings more than the other treatments. Although T2 medium showed the highest N, K, and Mg contents in pepper seedlings, vermicompost mixtures had the highest P, K, Ca, and Mg concentrations in cauliflower. Vermicompost mixtures had higher microelement contents in cauliflower, whereas similar results were obtained from T2 and T1 treatments in pepper seedlings. In conclusion, it was determined that the 35% peat and 35% vermicompost mixture was appropriate for pepper and cauliflower seedlings in terms of many criteria. Additionally, noteworthy results were obtained when 70% peat was substituted with vermicompost.

AB  - The FOXO3 gene, a prominent member of the FOXO family, has been identified as a potential quantitative trait locus for muscle atrophy and lipid metabolism in livestock. It is also considered a promising candidate gene for meat quality traits such as Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and water holding capacity (WHC). The aim of this study was to identify sequence mutations in the FOXO3 gene of yaks and to analyze the association of genotypes and haplotypes with meat traits such as WBSF and WHC. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to determine the expression levels of FOXO3 in yak tissues, with the results revealing a high expression in the yak longissimus dorsi muscle. Exons of the FOXO3 gene were then sequenced in 572 yaks using hybrid pool sequencing. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Additionally, four effective haplotypes and four combined haplotypes were constructed. Two mutations of the FOXO3 gene, namely C>G at exon g.636 and A>G at exon g.1296, were associated with cooked meat percentage (CMP) (p < 0.05) and WBSF (p < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, the WBSF of the H2H3 haplotype combination was significantly lower than that of other combinations (p < 0.05). The findings of this study suggest that genetic variations in FOXO3 could be a promising biomarker for improving yak meat traits.

AB  - Objectives: To slow down the chemical fixation of phosphate fertilizer, reduce the risk of active phosphorus leaching, stimulate the inherent phosphorus resource activity of soil, and improve phosphorus supply capacity. Methods: This study utilized a combination of field experiments and indoor chemical analysis. Six types of exogenous organic matter (fulvic acid, biochar, compound microbial fertilizer, high-energy microbial inoculum, pig manure-vermicompost, cow manure-vermicompost) were added based on conventional fertilization. The experiment was conducted under the wheat-maize rotation system in the Huang-Huai-Hai region. Results: Compared with control (CK) without exogenous organic matter (EOM), all the other treatments with EOM had an enhancing effect on the available phosphorus of the cultivated soil. During the maize harvest, the combined application of biochar, pig manure-vermicompost and cow manure-vermicompost treatment significantly increased the content of available phosphorus in 0-20 cm soil by 45.87-56.59% compared with CK. The combined application of fulvic acid, biochar, pig manure-vermicompost and cow manure-vermicompost treatment significantly increased the content of Ca2-P in 0-20 cm soil by 34.04-65.14%. The content of Ca10-P in each treatment with EOM exhibited a lower level compared to CK. EOM could slow down the fixation of phosphorus to some degree. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between Ca2-P, Ca8-P, Al-P, Fe-P, neutral phosphatase activity, acid phosphatase activity, and the available phosphorus content in the soil. The combined application of fulvic acid, biochar, and cow manure-vermicompost could enhance the activity of neutral and acid phosphatase in topsoil to a certain extent, thereby facilitating the conversion of phosphorus into highly available Ca2-P. EOM could enhance the soil phosphorus availability and decelerate the conversion of soil phosphorus into O-P and Ca10-P forms with low availability. Among all treatments, biochar exhibited the most pronounced efficiency in mitigating phosphorus leaching downward. Conclusions: All the EOMs had the potential to enhance the conversion of phosphorus into soluble phosphorus (Ca2-P), thereby mitigating the chemical fixation of soil phosphorus and ameliorating non-point source pollution caused by phosphorus. EOM enhanced the activity of neutral and acid phosphatase, which was beneficial to the conversion of organic phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus and increasing the content of available phosphorus. All EOMs had good effects on the retention of soil effective phosphorus, among which biochar had the best effect on retaining effective phosphorus in the tillage layer and blocking phosphorus leaching downward.

AB  - This study evaluated the effect of mixed meal replacement of soybean meal on growth conditions, carcass traits, and meat quality of finishing pigs by partially and entirely replacing soybean meal with equal proportions of rapeseed, cotton, and sunflower meal. A total of fifty-four pigs with an average initial weight of 97.60 +/- 0.30 kg were selected and randomly divided into three groups according to their initial weight, with six pens in each group and three pigs in each pen. The experimental groups were as follows: control group (CON), fed corn-soybean meal type basal diet; corn-soybean mixed meal group (CSM), using equal proportions of rapeseed meal, cotton meal, and sunflower meal (3.52% each) to replace 9.06% of soybean meal in the basal diet; and corn mixed meal group (CMM), using equal proportions of rapeseed meal, cotton meal, and sunflower meal (6.46% each) to replace soybean meal in the basal diet completely. According to the results, the use of mixed meal as a replacement for soybean meal did not have a significant impact (p > 0.05) on the average daily weight gain, average daily feed intake, feed-to-weight ratio, body size, carcass traits, and meat quality of finishing pigs. The entire replacement of soybean meal with a mixed meal resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.05) in leaf fat weight. The use of mixed meal as a substitute for soybean meal had no significant effect (p > 0.05) on the antioxidant capacity and fatty acid composition of the longissimus thoracis in finishing pigs. However, longissimus thoracis muscle fiber diameter was reduced in the mixed meal partially replaced soybean meal group compared to the mixed meal completely replaced soybean meal group (p < 0.05). In addition, mixed meal replacing soybean meal did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) the expression of the longissimus thoracis muscle fiber type genes MYHC1 and MYHC2. Mixed meal replacement of soybean meal did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) the expression of ACACA, FASN, and PPARG genes in the longissimus thoracis. This study showed that mixed meal as an alternative to soybean meal in diets did not have significant negative effects on the growth performance and meat quality of finishing pigs. These results can help develop further mixed meals as a functional alternative feed ingredient for soybean meals in pig diets.

AB  - Simple Summary Post-weaning diarrhea is common in piglets, causing huge economic losses worldwide. The Heigai pig is an indigenous pig breed of China, and has lower rate of piglet diarrhea incidences than the Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) crossbred pig, which is the most widely used commercial pig crossbreed worldwide. In the current study, using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an agent to mimic the bacterial inflammatory response in weaned pigs, a comparative analysis of the effects of LPS challenge on jejunal mucosal morphology, jejunal microbial composition, and serum indexes in two pig breeds (DLY and Heigai) was performed. The results showed that LPS successfully induced bacterial inflammatory response in the experimental pigs, changed the microbial composition, and triggered functional changes in energy metabolism and activities related to the stress response in the jejunal bacterial community. This study also revealed that Heigai pigs had a weaker immune response to LPS challenge than DLY pigs, and identified several genera related to the breed-specific phenotypes of Heigai pigs. These findings provide a basis for investigating the mechanism of the intestinal inflammatory response in piglet diarrhea and suggest potential microbial candidates to resist diarrhea.Abstract Post-weaning diarrhea is common in piglets, causing huge economic losses worldwide. Associations between LPS challenge, intestinal inflammation, and microbiota have been reported in Duroc x Landrace x Yorkshire (DLY) crossbred pigs. However, the effects of LPS challenge in other breeds remain unclear. In the current study, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of the effects of LPS challenge on jejunal mucosal morphology, jejunal microbial composition, and serum indexes in two pig breeds: DLY and Heigai, an indigenous Chinese breed. The results showed that LPS caused considerable damage to the mucosal morphology, enhanced serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and the intestinal permeability index, and lowered the antioxidant capacity index. LPS challenge also changed the microbial composition and structure of the jejunum, significantly increased the abundances of Escherichia-Shigella in DLY pigs, and decreased those of Gemella and Saccharimonadales in Heigai pigs. Furthermore, LPS challenge triggered functional changes in energy metabolism and activities related to the stress response in the jejunal bacterial community, alleviating the inflammatory response in Heigai pigs. This study also revealed that Heigai pigs had a weaker immune response to LPS challenge than DLY pigs, and identified several genera related to the breed-specific phenotypes of Heigai pigs, including Gemella, Saccharimonadales, Clostridia_UCG_014, Terrisporobacter, and Dielma. Our collective findings uncovered differences between Heigai and DLY pigs in intestinal inflammation and microbiota dysbiosis induced by LPS challenge, providing a theoretical basis for unraveling the mechanism of intestinal inflammation in swine and proposing microbial candidates involved in the resistance to diarrhea in piglets.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are abundantly shed in feces. Thus, it is crucial to identify their host sources so that ARG pollution can be effectively mitigated and aquatic ecosystems can be properly conserved. Here, spatiotemporal variations and sources of ARGs in the Longjiang watershed of South China were investigated by linking them with microbial source tracker (MST) indicators. The most frequently detected ARGs (> 90%) were sulI, sulII, blaTEM, tetW, ermF, and the mobile element intI1. Spatial distribution analyses showed that tributaries contributed significantly more sulI, sulII, and ermF contamination to the Longjiang watershed than the main channel. MST indicator analysis revealed that the Longjiang watershed was contaminated mainly by human fecal pollution. Livestock-and poultry-associated fecal pollution significantly declined after the swine fever outbreak. The occurrence of most ARGs is largely explained by human fecal pollution. In contrast, pig fecal pollution might account for the prevalence of tetO. Moreover, combined human-pig fecal pollution contributed to the observed blaNDM-1 distribution in the Longjiang watershed. Subsequent analysis of the characteristics of MST markers disclosed that the relatively lower specificities of BacHum and Rum-2-Bac may lead to inaccurate results of tracking ARG pollution source. The present study determined spatiotemporal variations and ARG origins in the Longjiang watershed by combining MST markers. It also underscored the necessity of using multiple MST markers simultaneously to identify and characterize ARG pollution sources accurately.

AB  - This paper considered a multi-stage sheep brucellosis model with incomplete immunity. First, we established a deterministic model, calculated the basic reproduction number Script capital R-0, set out the conditions for the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium. Second, considering the influence of environmental white noise on brucellosis infection, we further established the stochastic version of the model. By constructing a suitable Lyapunov function, we proved the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution. Further, we got the sufficient conditions for disease extinction and the existence of ergodic stationary distribution. Finally, we carried out some numerical simulations to verify the theoretical results.

AB  - Strategies and mechanisms are needed to enhance encroaching shrub species use by ruminants. Seriphium plumosum crude proteins, neutral detergent fibers, total phenolics, and condensed tannins were determined from combined fine leaves and stems collected during the dry and wet seasons, from burned and unburned areas. S. plumosum crude protein was higher during the wet season on postburned areas. Neutral detergent fiber was higher during the dry season and similar in both postburned and unburned areas. The mean total phenolics and condensed tannins were higher during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. These results have shown that S. plumosum forage quality in the wet season is sufficient to meet ruminants nutrient requirements, but the opposite is true for the dry season; hence, the need to include it in livestock feed with other protein and energy supplements to improve its forage quality beyond ruminant maintenance requirement.

AB  - It has recently been recognized that African forest and savanna elephants represent separate species. We analyzed 2445 known-origin elephant samples from across Africa for presence of the two species and hybrids between them, and augmented this with hybrid detection in 4883 samples from ivory seized as contraband. Hybrids were rare overall (6.6 % of reference samples, 1.5 % of contraband samples), occurring only in areas in or near forest-savanna ecotones. Of our known-location hybrids, 117/167 (70 %) were in the Albertine Rift major hybrid zone in eastern DRC and southwestern Uganda, confirming previous reports; in some Albertine sites hybrids outnumbered pure species. Hybrids inferred to be F1 (the product of a forest/savanna mating) were particularly rare, with only 4 found in reference samples and 5 in contraband, suggesting that most hybridization occurred two or more generations ago. We discuss the distribution of the two African elephant species and their hybrids, forces driving hybridization, implications for conservation and management, and areas that need additional sampling effort.

AB  - Coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros; CRB) was discovered in 2015 in a small outbreak in Honiara, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands. This was the first record of CRB from Solomon Islands and a response plan was prepared. An awareness programme was launched and where CRB sightings were confirmed, delimitation surveys were carried out. Following the launch of the awareness programme, later in 2015, CRB was also reported from the Shortland Islands in the Western Province. Other islands were surveyed from 2015 to 2020. If CRB presence was confirmed, beetles were collected and analysed for haplotype and presence of the classical biological control agent, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). A distribution map and timeline of invasion were developed. The initial populations belonged to two distinct haplotypes: CRB-G (clade I-A) in Honiara and CRB-S (clade II) in Shortland Islands. Despite control measures, by 2020 CRB-G had spread to islands in eight provinces and CRB-S had spread to islands in seven provinces. CRB-S and CRB-G co-occur in Guadalcanal and Malaita provinces. In 2019, OrNV was detected from field collected CRB from Guadalcanal and has since spread to Malaita Island. In both cases the virus was detected where CRB-G and CRB-S co-occur. Other outbreak areas in Solomon Islands remain OrNV-free. The two haplotypes appear to have spread following patterns of air and sea movement between the point of origin (CRB-G from Honiara and CRB-S from the Shortland Islands) to other islands/provinces.

AB  - We describe tooth implantation, replacement, and attachment in a specimen of the procolophonid Scoloparia glyphanodon. Though an earlier description of the specimen made mention of the dentary, splcnial, and coronoid, we identify a small sliver of the angular that is also present. We observe two modes of tooth implantation (protothecodonty and acrodonty) and no tooth replacement, though it is likely teeth were added posteriorly over time. Previous interpretations of tooth implantation in procolophonids were conflated with replacement patterns and mode of implantation. Additionally, the combination of dental characters of the specimen suggests Scoloparia glyphanodon had an herbivorous diet.

AB  - Eastern Box Turtles (Terrapene carolina) are diet generalists and as such are predicted to have diverse diets in which familiar, low-quality foods are eaten consistently at low levels, and high-quality foods are rare but eaten whenever available. Previous work showed that they feed opportunistically on seasonally available plants (shoots, leaves, flowers, and fruit), invertebrates, mushrooms, and occasionally carrion. We used fecal samples to test optimal foraging predictions relevant to diet generalists and also whether the Eastern Box Turtle diets varied seasonally in a northeastern U.S. pine-oak habitat. We found that in-depth prey species consumption patterns of six different individuals were similar to those of the sampled population overall. Leaf and stem material was consumed by 100% of the turtles in all months despite being lower-quality than other prey available. Invertebrates were consumed by at least 80% of turtles in every study period; Coleopterans were found more commonly than other invertebrates. Snails were not eaten by more than 20% of the turtles in any study period, and mushroom consumption varied from 31-75% of samples in different study periods. Monthly diet overlap was measured using both Pianka's Index of Overlap (PIO) and the Morisita-Horn Index (MH). The PIO method indicated that the prey consumption patterns were broadly similar from June-October, while the M-H method showed that only the July vs. August comparison was highly similar. The turtle diets changed only slightly between seasons, and they conform to predictions of diet generalist models usually applied to mammals.

AB  - Copepod diel vertical migration (DVM) is a significant phenomenon with implications for the biological pump and pelagic food webs; nevertheless, its drivers and ecological significance are not fully understood. This study analyzed the daytime and nighttime vertical density of females, males, and developmental stages of copepods to investigate the role of functional traits, such as spawning strategy, body size, trophic group, and feeding mode, in DVM at the Patagonian shelf-break (44 degrees S-47 degrees S and 60 degrees W-61 degrees W). Only females and late copepodites exhibited a normal DVM at oceanic stations, showing their weighted mean depth (WMD) near the surface during the nighttime and at greater depths during the daytime. Fourteen dominant species (the most densely and frequently) were identified based on a relative importance index (RII). Females that are sac-spawners, detritivores, carnivores, omnivores, and/or cruise-feeders exhibited normal DVM, such as Clausocalanus brevipes, Oithona atlantica, Ctenocalanus vanus, Clausocalanus laticeps, Scolecithricella minor, Aetideus armatus, Haloptilus oxycephalus, Metridia lucens, and Candacia longimana, presenting their WMD near the surface and at the fluorescence maxima at nighttime, and below the thermocline at daytime. Conversely, females that are broadcasters, large-sized, herbivores, and/or current-feeders did not exhibit consistent DVM patterns, such as Calanus simillimus, Rhincalanus gigas, and Subeucalanus longiceps, presenting their WMD above the thermocline and at the fluorescence maxima during both daytime and nighttime. Copepod depth selection appears to be influenced by a combination of morphological, physiological, behavioral, and life history traits, that, in each case, would optimize predator avoidance, foraging, and reproduction opportunities.

AB  - Understanding the underlying causes behind human-elephant conflict (HEC)-driven mortality of humans and elephants will help improve both parties' wellbeing. The objective of this study was to examine the temporal and spatial mortality patterns of humans and elephants and the influence of local attitudes, conflict factors and habitat factors on elephant poaching. We used the Myanmar Forest Department data from 2001 to 2020 for humans and 2011 to 2020 for elephants together with explanatory data on human attitudes, habitat, and conflict factors. Approximately seven persons were killed annually in elephant attacks, with a bias towards men. The annual mortality of elephants during the study period was on average 16 individuals, and most elephants were killed by humans. There was a significant relationship between the number of killed humans and human-killed elephants around HEC villages. Villages with more property damage exhibited a higher rate of human mortality, which also correlated with negative feelings of local people towards elephants. Elephant poaching was higher in villages with less suitable habitat available for elephant use. Human encroachment is an important cause of HEC, leading to human loss and forming the main threat to the survival of wild elephants. We suggest local involvement to ensure good governance in conflict resolution and mitigation strategies and to strengthen law enforcement.

AB  - Enterotoxaemia (ET) is a severe disease that affects domestic ruminants, including sheep and goats, and is caused by Clostridium perfringens type B and D strains. The disease is characterized by the production of Epsilon toxin (ETX), which has a significant impact on the farming industry due to its high lethality. The binding of ETX to the host cell receptor is crucial, but still poorly understood. Therefore, the structural features of goat Myelin and lymphocytic (MAL) protein were investigated and defined in this study. We induced the mutations in aromatic amino acid residues of ETX and substituted them with aliphatic residues at domains I and II. Subsequently, protein-protein interactions (PPI) were performed between ETX (wild)-MAL and ETX (mutated)-MAL protein predicting the domain sites of ETX structure. Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were performed for both complexes to investigate the dynamic behavior of the proteins. The binding efficiency between 'ETX (wild)-MAL protein' and 'ETX (mutated)-MAL protein complex' interactions were compared and showed that the former had stronger interactions and binding efficiency due to the higher stability of the complex. The MD analysis showed destabilization and higher fluctuations in the PPI of the mutated heterodimeric ETX-MAL complex which is otherwise essential for its functional conformation. Such kind of interactions with mutated functional domains of ligands provided much-needed clarity in understanding the pre-pore complex formation of epsilon toxin with the MAL protein receptor of goats.

AB  - Viral infections of the reproductive tract and testis in male yaks, often resulting from natural mating under grazing conditions, can lead to infertility due to Leydig cell (LC) apoptosis, immune activation, oxidative stress, and reduced testosterone production. Spermidine (SPD), a potential therapeutic agent with antioxidant and anti-aging properties, might alleviate oxidant stress, immune response, and virus infection caused by apoptosis. In this study, firstly testicular Leydig cells of yak were induced with Poly(I:C), the pathogen-associated molecular pattern of the dsRNA virus, as a pathogenic model at the cellular level. Secondly, immune response, apoptosis, oxidative stress, and testosterone synthesis were measured in LC with or without SPD culture medium. Finally, transcriptomic sequencing was utilized to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SPD. These results suggested Poly(I:C) damaged the function of Leydig cells, significantly decreased the concentration of testosterone, and induced immune response, oxidative stress, and cell apoptosis, while SPD significantly alleviated the immune response and oxidative stress, and then significantly inhibited cell apoptosis and restores testosterone production in LCs. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that SPD significantly alleviates inflammation and apoptosis induced by Poly(I:C), reducing immune response and cellular damage through the regulation of several key gene expressions. These findings suggest SPD has the potential ability to mitigate Poly(I:C)-induced immune response, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and then restore testosterone production in Leydig cells, offering a promising strategy to protect and enhance male yak fertility after infection with dsRNA virus.

AB  - BACKGROUNDA variety of environmental factors can disrupt biotic interactions between plants, insects and soil microorganisms with consequences for agricultural management and production. Many of these belowground interactions are mediated by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can be used for communication under appropriate environmental conditions. Behavioral responses to these compounds may likewise be dependent on varying soil conditions which are influenced by a changing climate. To determine how changing environmental conditions may affect VOC-mediated biotic interactions, we used a belowground system where entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) - tiny roundworm parasitoids of soil-borne insects - respond to VOCs by moving through the soil pore matrix. Specifically, we used two genera of EPNs - Heterorhabditis and Steinernema - that are known to respond to four specific terpenes - alpha-pinene, linalool, d-limonene and pregeijerene - released by the roots of plants in the presence of herbivores. We assessed the response of these nematodes to these terpenes under three moisture regimes to determine whether drier conditions or inundated conditions may influence the response behavior of these nematodes.RESULTSOur results illustrate that the recovery rate of EPNs is positively associated with soil moisture concentration. As soil moisture concentration increases from 6% to 18%, substantially more nematodes are recovered from bioassays. In addition, we find that soil moisture influences EPN preference for VOCs, as illustrated in the variable response rates. Certain compounds shifted from acting as a repellent to acting as an attractant and vice versa depending on the soil moisture concentration.CONCLUSIONOn a broad scale, we demonstrate that soil moisture has a significant effect on EPN host-seeking behavior. EPN efficacy as biological control agents could be affected by climate change projections that predict varying soil moisture concentrations. We recommend that maintaining nematodes as biological control agents is essential for sustainable agriculture development, as they significantly contribute not only to soil health but also to efficient pest management.

AB  - Pre-release studies indicate that the defoliating moth, Hypena opulenta, can be effective at reducing biomass, survival, and seed production of invasive swallow-wort vines. However, laboratory studies to date report higher defoliation rates and larval densities than are present in the field five years post-release in Canada. To understand the consequences of H. opulenta feeding on black swallow-wort, Vincetoxicum nigrum, at more realistic densities, we conducted experimental cage releases in Michigan. We also evaluated the phenology of the moth. We released 1, 2, or 5 pairs of H. opulenta on caged swallow-wort and measured resulting larval densities, defoliation levels, plant fecundity and survival for two years. To determine which release date may result in two generations of H. opulenta in Michigan, we released adults in June or July at one sunny and one shaded location and followed their phenology. Larval densities and damage increased with release size, but plant survival and fecundity were not affected. Hypena opulenta produced two generations when released in June at >15 h day length. Survival of H. opulenta and defoliation rates were higher in the shaded environment. These results support previous findings regarding better performance of H. opulenta at shaded sites, however, larval densities achieved in the field both in this experiment and at Canadian release sites are still too low to negatively affect swallow-wort fitness. Moreover, we were unable to confirm overwintering success and thus establishment of H. opulenta in Michigan is not yet known.

AB  - There are widespread public efforts to conserve wildlife in urbanized landscapes via the installation of nursery-grown plants that support Lepidoptera taxa. Insecticides are commonly used during nursery production to suppress key plant pests, and many products have extended periods of toxicity and affect a wide range of herbivore taxa. While there are plentiful toxicological data on bee species, predominantly the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera L.), little is known about how insecticides affect nonpest lepidopterans. Lepidoptera has different modes of exposure (e.g., leaf-feeding) and differences in susceptibility to insecticide target sites compared to bees. Consequently, many products compatible with bee conservation pose an uncertain risk to nonpest lepidopterans and thus may represent an under-recognized conflict with conservation efforts. Using the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus, L.), tropical milkweed (Asclepias curassavica, L.), and oleander aphid (Aphis nerii, Fonscolombe, 1841) system, we conducted leaf and whole-plant feeding assays to evaluate effects of acute and chronic monarch exposure to industry standard and alternative reduced-risk insecticides used during nursery production. We also evaluated the efficacy of these insecticides against their target pest, the oleander aphid. Our results indicate that insecticides used to control pests on ornamental milkweed can cause monarch larval mortality up to 4 wk after treatment application. Furthermore, the duration of aphid suppression is often shorter than the duration of adverse effects on monarchs. This study demonstrates a conflict between insect pest management and Lepidoptera conservation during ornamental plant production and has implications for the conservation value of ornamentals after retail sale.

AB  - While floral signaling plays a central role in the reproductive success of all animal-pollinated plants, it may also attract herbivores eager to feed on flowers. False nectaries with glossy surfaces reflecting incident light may produce signals that attract floral visitors guiding their movements to and within the flower. Whether false nectaries also attract herbivores that lower the reproductive success of natural populations requires attention. In this study, we focus on Parnassia wightiana, a subalpine species with a whorl of staminodes that act as false nectaries attracting bees, flies, and herbivorous beetles. We tested the functions of staminodes using controlled manipulative experiments under field and lab conditions. We found a significant decrease in pollinator visits, and subsequent seed set, in flowers in which we removed staminodes or staminode apices confirming the function of these organs. In our natural populations, we found that a beetle, Nonarthra variabilis (Alticinae; Chrysomelidae), chews first on staminode apices, then it eats the entire staminodes and other flower parts, but rarely feeds on ovaries. Additional experiments suggested these beetles preferred staminodes to ovaries. Our results suggest this is a case of selective florivory, in which staminodes play a dual role, attracting pollinators and herbivores at the same time causing the attractive dilemma. Although selective florivory by beetles did not directly damage fruits, it influenced plant-pollinator interactions, decreasing reproductive success in plant populations. Our study highlights the importance of plant-pollinator-herbivore interactions in selecting floral traits.

AB  - The assembly of genomes from pooled samples of genetically heterogenous samples of conspecifics remains challenging. In this study, we show that high-quality genome assemblies can be produced from samples of multiple wild-caught individuals. We sequenced DNA extracted from a pooled sample of conspecific herbivorous insects (Hemiptera: Miridae: Tupiocoris notatus) acquired from a greenhouse infestation in Tucson, Arizona (in the range of 30-100 individuals; 0.5 mL tissue by volume) using PacBio highly accurate long reads (HiFi). The initial assembly contained multiple haplotigs (>85% BUSCOs duplicated), but duplicate contigs could be easily purged to reveal a highly complete assembly (95.6% BUSCO, 4.4% duplicated) that is highly contiguous by short-read assembly standards (N-50 = 675 kb; Largest contig = 4.3 Mb). We then used our assembly as the basis for a genome-guided differential expression study of host plant-specific transcriptional responses. We found thousands of genes (N = 4982) to be differentially expressed between our new data from individuals feeding on Datura wrightii (Solanaceae) and existing RNA-seq data from Nicotiana attenuata (Solanaceae)-fed individuals. We identified many of these genes as previously documented detoxification genes such as glutathione-S-transferases, cytochrome P450s, and UDP-glucosyltransferases. Together our results show that long-read sequencing of pooled samples can provide a cost-effective genome assembly option for small insects and can provide insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying interactions between plants and herbivorous pests.

AB  - Elephants ingest a large quantity of plant material across the landscape and concentrate it at specific locations through dung and urine excretion, greatly enhancing local nutrient availability for various organisms. During our two-year study in India's Western Ghats, we documented 26 butterfly species from five families puddling on elephant dung. This observation suggests that elephant dung may offer mineral supplementation, which could contribute to the fitness and reproductive physiology of butterflies in elephant habitats.

AB  - Root exudates are composed of primary and secondary metabolites known to modulate the rhizosphere microbiota. Glucosinolates are defense compounds present in the Brassicaceae family capable of deterring pathogens, herbivores and biotic stressors in the phyllosphere. In addition, traces of glucosinolates and their hydrolyzed byproducts have been found in the soil, suggesting that these secondary metabolites could play a role in the modulation and establishment of the rhizosphere microbial community associated with this family. We used Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines, including the cyp79B2cyp79B3 double mutant line with a disruption in the indole glucosinolate pathway and atr1D, which overexpresses ATR1 and increases glucosinolate production. These lines were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to evaluate how genetic modifications to the indole glucosinolate pathway affects the root exudate profile of Arabidopsis thaliana, and, in turn, impacts the rhizosphere microbial community. Metabolic analysis of root exudates from the wild-type Columbia (Col-0), along with the mutant lines, confirmed that alterations to the indole glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway result in shifts in the root exudate profile of the plant. We observed changes in the relative abundance of exuded metabolites. Moreover, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing results provided evidence that the rhizobacterial communities associated with the plant lines used were directly impacted in diversity and community composition. This work provides further information on the involvement of secondary metabolites and their role in modulating the rhizobacterial community. Root metabolites dictate the presence of different bacterial species, including plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Our results suggest that genetic alterations in the indole glucosinolate pathway cause disruptions beyond the endogenous levels of the plant, significantly changing the abundance and presence of different metabolites in the root exudates of the plants as well as the microbial rhizosphere community.

AB  - The vast majority of sensorineural hearing loss is caused by impairment of the inner ear cells. Proteomic analysis of perilymph may therefore improve our understanding of inner ear diseases and hearing loss. However, the investigation of the human perilymph proteome was limited due to technical difficulties in perilymph sampling. The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is frequently used as an experimental model in preclinical hearing research. In this study, we analyzed samples of perilymph collected from 12 guinea pigs to overcome limited experimental information regarding its proteome. We identified a total of 1413 proteins, establishing a greatly expanded proteome of the previously inferred guinea pig perilymph. This provides a comprehensive proteomic resource for the research community, which will facilitate future molecular-phenotypic studies using the guinea pig as an experimental model of relevance to human inner ear biology.

AB  - The goat's hind limbs play an important role in dampening vibrations caused by ground impact during movement. Inspired by the unique structure of their hind limbs, a novel bionic limb vibration isolator has been developed to suppress low-frequency vibrations. It consists of the base, the carrying platform, four bionic legs and so on. The bionic legs are made up of rods of varying lengths and springs in different directions to imitate the various shapes of bones such as the femur and patella of the hind limbs of goats and developed muscles such as the biceps and quadriceps. The bionic device was found to have excellent nonlinear stiffness through statics analysis, and could be flexibly adjusted to the work range and load capacity. The bionic vibration isolator offers lower natural frequencies (2.3 Hz), better vibration isolation effect and a wider vibration isolation band than conventional linear vibration isolator. The bionic device can effectively suppress vibrations above 3.2 Hz and reduce the amplitude of random vibrations to more than 90%. In addition, compared to similar bionic vibration isolation devices, the bionic isolator achieves excellent load-bearing capacity in a smaller size, which facilitates its application in practical production.

AB  - The Annamites ecoregion harbors exceptional levels of species richness and endemism, but intensive snaring has decimated populations of terrestrial mammals. Ungulates, such as muntjacs, are susceptible to snaring, and in need of effective conservation action. At least three muntjacs occur sympatrically in the region: the Annamite dark muntjac species complex Muntiacus rooseveltorum/truongsonensis, the northern red muntjac Muntiacus vaginalis, and the large-antlered muntjac Muntiacus vuquangensis. We conducted a landscape-scale systematic camera-trapping survey in Nakai-Nam Theun National Park to gather information on the ecology and distribution of these muntjacs. We analyzed camera-trap records within an occupancy framework to evaluate responses to environmental and anthropogenic variables, and to predict distributions across the protected area. We found varying responses to the covariates, indicating complex drivers of occurrence, though all three muntjac had higher occupancies in more inaccessible areas. Mean (95%) PAO in the protected area was higher for large-antlered muntjac (0.33 [0.22-0.49]), followed by Annamite dark muntjac (0.28 [0.18-0.39]), and then northern red muntjac (0.27 [0.15-0.42]). Large-antlered muntjac and northern red muntjac were widespread, while dark muntjac was restricted to a single high elevation area. Overall, our results provide new insights into muntjac ecology, distribution, and population status, and we discuss how this information can be used to inform conservation efforts. Given the high occupancies that we found for the Critically Endangered large-antlered muntjac, we argue that Nakai-Nam Theun National Park may be vital for the long-term survival of the species.

AB  - After a long-standing debate, African elephants are now considered by the IUCN as two distinct species: savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana), listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis), critically endangered. Both are severely threatened by forest loss, fragmentation and degradation due to agriculture expansion, as well as by illegal ivory trade. Although the two species have different habitat preferences, their range overlaps in some ecotones; despite an ancient separation between these two species, hybrids have been reported in five locations. The main hybrid hotspot is located on the Democratic Republic of Congo-Uganda border and still remains understudied. Using 15 microsatellites, we investigated this hybridization zone by determining the species and hybrid status of 177 fecal samples collected in the area of Sebitoli, at the extreme North of Kibale National Park. Surprisingly for a forest area, no pure forest elephants were detected. Out of the 91 individuals sampled, a very large proportion (81.3%) were hybrid individuals mainly from a second generation or more. Only 18.7% of pure savannah elephants were detected, all originating from the DRC-Uganda border. Further analyses are necessary to assess the age of this hybridization zone. Our results emphasize that hybrids and savannah elephants can successfully range in forested area. They also show that forest elephants are rare even in their native habitat. In the current context of high threat faced by African elephant species, it is crucial to strengthen conservation efforts for these species before it is too late.

AB  - Eighty-four wild seahorses, including three of China's dominant species, were collected from seven coastal provinces to evaluate their common contaminant contents. Heavy metals (including Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, and Hg), Benzo(a)pyrene (B[a]P), and microplastics were detected in the collected seahorses. The results indicate that considerable contamination variations are present in seahorses from different regions and species. Elevated concentrations of Cu and Cr, compared to other heavy metals, were observed in most sampled locations. In addition, B[a]P concentrations were far greater in Hippocampus mohnikei and H.trimaculatus compared with H.kelloggi (P < 0.05). Substantial changes in microplastic concentrations were also observed in seahorses from different locations, and significant differences were observed between sampled species (P < 0.05). Further, a correlation analysis obtained strong correlations among four heavy metals (Cu, Pb, Cd, and Cr), except Hg. A significant correlation was identified between B[a]P and microplastics (P < 0.01), suggesting potential synergistic effects between these two contaminants. In brief, this study indicates that wild seahorse populations are experiencing environmental pollution.

AB  - Lemna perpusilla and Lemna minor are free-floating plants that often live in the same habitat. However, little is known about how they differ in response to herbivore attacks. In this study, we examined the species-specific resistance of two Lemna species to the duckweed weevil, Tanysphyrus lemnae. The female adults of T. lemnae preferred to lay eggs on L. perpusilla over L. minor. In addition, the larvae of T. lemnae performed better when fed on L. perpusilla than on L. minor. To understand the physiological basis of species-specific resistance in the two Lemna species, we measured the amounts of jasmonic acid (JA), phytosterols, and flavonoids. Attacks by duckweed weevils increased the levels of JA in the two Lemna species, but these levels did not differ significantly between the two species. Interestingly, the levels of flavones (isoorientin, vitexin, and isovitexin) in L. minor species were higher than those in L. perpusilla. The in vitro bioassay showed that three flavones significantly decreased the survival rate of duckweed weevil larvae. Although L. perpusilla was less resistant to duckweed weevil attack compared to L. minor, L. perpusilla grew faster than L. minor regardless of the duckweed weevil attack. These results suggest that these two Lemna species have different defense strategies against the duckweed weevil.

AB  - A field experiment ensued during the winter crop season 2018-2019 at the District Baqubah, Diyala Governorate, Iraq, to study the effects of three plant spacing (20, 40, and 60 cm) and foliar application of humic acid with four concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 40 L ha-1) on seed yield-related traits and active ingredients of goat pea (Securigera securidaca L.). The recorded data underwent statistical analysis using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement. The results showed that the plant spacing of 60 cm was superior in the percentage of oil and the total content of glycosides in the seeds, amounting to 3.84% and 27.86 mg g-1, respectively, and the plant distance of 40 cm was superior in the seeds' total phenol content (1.23 mg g-1). As for 20 cm, it was excellent in the oil yield (15.56 kg ha-1). The spraying with humic acid at the rate of 20 L ha-1 provided the highest percentage and harvest of oil and total phenol content, reaching 3.69%, 9.30 kg ha-1, and 1.21 mg g-1, respectively. The interaction between the plant distance (60 cm) and foliar application of humic acid (10 L ha-1) showed a significant increase in the percentage of oil, amounting to 3.92%. The interaction between the plant distance (40 cm) and foliar application of humic acid (20 L ha-1) provided a substantial increase in the total phenol content of seeds (1.25 mg g-1).

AB  - Although significant advancement has been made in the study of adipogenesis, knowledge about how chromatin accessibility regulates yak adipogenesis is lacking. We here described genome-wide dynamic chromatin accessibility in preadipocytes and adipocytes by using the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq), and thus revealed the unique characteristics of open chromatin during yak adipocyte differentiation. The chromatin accessibility of preadipocytes and adipocytes exhibited a similar genomic distribution, displaying a preferential location within the intergenic region, intron, and promoter. The pathway enrichment analysis identified that genes with differential chromatin accessibility were involved in adipogenic metabolism regulation pathways, such as the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPAR) signaling pathway, wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling pathway, and extracellular matrix-receptor (ECM-receptor) interaction. Integration of ATAC-seq and mRNA-seq revealed that genes with a high expression were associated with high levels of chromatin accessibility, especially within 1 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start site. In addition, we identified a series of transcription factors (TFs) related to adipogenesis and created the TF regulatory network, providing the possible interactions between TFs during yak adipogenesis. This study is crucial for advancing the understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of adipogenesis and provides valuable information for understanding the adaptation of plateau species to high-altitude environments by maintaining whole body homeostasis through fat metabolism.

AB  - Simple Summary Recent findings of the nematode Eucoleus garfiai in wild boars across different countries, and more lately in southern Italy, have brought up the need for collecting epidemiological data on this parasite. In the present study, the prevalence of E. garfiai was analyzed in relation to altitude in different provinces of the Campania and Latium regions located, respectively, in southern and central Italy. Results showed that the parasite is more often found at altitudes higher than 900 m above sea level. Some species of earthworms are intermediate hosts of E. garfiai and it is well known that earthworms are more present in high quality soils, which are more likely found at high altitudes where anthropogenic interventions are less frequent. Therefore, we can suggest that the higher prevalence of E. garfiai above 900 m above sea level is probably linked to a higher presence of earthworms in the soil, due to its higher quality in these areas. Recent reports of Eucoleus garfiai in wild boars in southern Italy have highlighted the need for collecting epidemiological data on the presence of this parasite and understanding the role of possible interactions between wild boars, E. garfiai, and the environment. This study analyses, using histopathological and biomolecular techniques, the presence of E. garfiai in tongue samples of wild boars hunted in four provinces of the Campania and Latium regions (Italy), in areas located above and below 900 m above sea level (asl). Histopathological examinations revealed the presence of adults and eggs of nematodes, which were subsequently identified as E. garfiai by biomolecular analysis, in the tongue epithelium. The detection of the parasite was more frequent in samples collected from hunting areas located above 900 m asl than in those collected from areas located below 900 m asl (66.67% vs. 38.09%; p < 0.01). Some species of earthworms are intermediate hosts of E. garfiai and it is well known that earthworms are more present in high quality soils. Therefore, we can suggest that the higher prevalence of E. garfiai at higher altitudes is probably linked to a greater presence of earthworms in the soil, due to its higher quality in these areas.

AB  - Suckling behavior is essential for the growth, health, and welfare of the lamb. The factors that influence the suckling-related behavior varied across breeds, and they remain unclear in Small-tailed Han lamb. This study aims to investigate the effects of ewe parity, lamb sex, and birth order on the suckling-related behaviors of Small-tailed Han lamb. The neonatal behaviors of 36 lambs were observed during the first week after birth using focal-animal sampling methods, and the levels of cholecystokinin (CCK), endogenous opioid peptides and growth hormone (GH) were measured with ELISA methods before weaning. Results showed that male lambs began standing and suckling behaviors earlier than female lambs, and the duration of each suckling bout was longer in male lambs ( P < 0.05). Lambs born to multiparous ewes more frequently suckled and attempted to stand earlier than lambs from primiparous ewes ( P < 0.05). The weaning weights of male lambs and lambs from multiparous ewes were heavier, and the serum levels of CCK, opioid peptides, and GH were sometimes higher in these lambs before weaning ( P < 0.05). Meanwhile, lamb birth order has no significant effect on the suckling-related behaviors of lambs ( P > 0.05). In addition, the suckling-related behaviors of male lamb and lambs born to multiparous ewes were found to strongly correlate with each other. In conclusion, lamb sex and ewe parity could affect the sucklingrelated behaviors and weaning weights of Small-tailed Han lambs. Moreover, male lambs and lambs born to multiparous ewes seemed to have better suckling-related behaviors. Many of these behaviors were highly connected with one another. These phenomena may be related to the higher serum levels of CCK, opioid peptides, and GH. The effects of lamb sex on suckling-related behaviors were different from those of other breeds in previous research. The male lambs were observed to initiate sucking-related behaviors earlier in this study. Our findings will also help in extensively understanding the variability in the effects of these factors on suckling-related behavior across sheep breeds.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Plants and herbivores have been engaged in a co-evolutionary arms race for millions of years, during which plants evolved various defenses and other traits to cope with herbivores, whereas herbivores evolved traits to overcome the plants' resistance strategies. Herbivores may also avoid certain plants merely because these lack suitable nutrients for their development. Interestingly, the number of herbivores that attack individual early land plants like mosses and ferns is quite low. Among others, poor nutrient quality has been hypothesized to explain the apparent low herbivory pressure on such plants but still waits for scientific evidences. Here, the nutritive suitability of representative mosses and liverworts (bryophytes) and ferns (pteridophytes) for herbivores was investigated using feeding assays combined with quantifications of nutrients (proteins, amino acids, and sugars). Growth and survival of two polyphagous herbivores, a caterpillar and a snail, were monitored when fed on 15 species of bryophytes and pteridophytes, as well as on maize (Zea mays, angiosperm) used as an external indicative nutritional resource. Overall, our results show that the poor performance of the herbivores on the studied early land plants is not correlated with nutritional quality. The growth and performance of snails and caterpillars fed with these plants were highly variable and independent of nutrient content. These findings arguably dismiss the poor nutrient quality hypothesis as the cause of herbivory deficit in bryophytes and pteridophytes. They suggest the possible presence of early resistance traits that have persisted all through the long evolutionary history of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - The lower recovery of competent oocytes in buffalo species limits the commercialization of in vitro embryo production technology in field conditions. The present study aimed to improve the cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation of in vitro matured oocytes of Nili Ravi buffalo in the presence of hormones. The denuded oocytes (DOs) obtained by repeated pipetting were collected from 2-8mm follicles. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of oestradiol (2 & mu;g/ml), recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (0.05 IU/ml), human chorionic gonadotrophin (2 IU/ml) and insulin (0.12 IU/ml) alone or together in different combinations at intervals of 8, 16 and 24 h of incubation period during in vitro maturation on buffalo oocyte. The supplementation of TCM-199 with E2+rhFSH showed a highly significant increase in the diameter and maturation of oocytes (P<0.0001), as a greater number of the oocytes progressed to the metaphase II stage, and a lower proportion of the oocytes became degenerated (P<0.0001) after 24 h of incubation. The supplementation of medium with E2+rhFSH+hCG or E2+rhFSH+hCG+insulin also showed a significant increase in the meiotic maturation rate after 24 h (P<0.01 and P=0.04 respectively) and a significant decrease in the degeneration of the oocytes (P=0.001). The addition of insulin was not found to be effective for in vitro maturation. It is concluded that the addition of E2+rhFSH in culture media was found to be the best combination of hormones for in vitro maturation of denuded buffalo oocytes.

AB  - Stable isotope analysis is an approach that allows inferring feeding ecology and trophic structure of populations, especially for species that are difficult to observe in natural habitats, such as marine turtles. This study investigated the niche breadth of adult and juvenile green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) through delta N-15 and delta C-13 values in carapace scutes. During 2017 and 2018, tissues were collected from juveniles in a feeding area in southeastern Brazil (n = 60) and from adults in a nesting area in northeastern Brazil, at Fernando de Noronha (n = 21). Our results revealed no temporal variations in the isotopic values of adult green turtles and the mean delta N-15 values are compatible with the isotopic values of primarily herbivorous animals. In southeastern Brazil, the delta C-13 values and isotopic niche breadth differences observed in juvenile green turtles suggest that variations in habitat (i.e., channel between the municipalities of Ilhabela and Sao Sebastiao - "SSC" and region comprising the other two municipalities of Ubatuba and Caraguatatuba - "CAU", as defined in this study based on oceanographic current dynamics) can influence their isotopic niche. The isotopic values observed in juvenile green turtles demonstrated a high degree of feeding behavior plasticity and individual variability, which were possibly influenced by the dynamic of oceanographic currents and seasonal nutrient inputs. These findings help to elucidate the feeding behavior of green turtles at different life stages and the potential influence of oceanographic current dynamics in key feeding sites for juvenile green turtles.

AB  - Giant clams are conspicuous bivalves that inhabit in coral reefs. Among the giant clams, eight species of subfamily Tridacninae are the most common in the Asia-Pacific. However, very little is known about their evolutionary history. Here, we determined the complete mitochondria genome of Hippopus porcellanus, which was 29,434 bp in size and contained 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 23 tRNAs. The A+T composition of protein-coding regions was 57.99%, and the AT composition of the 3(rd) codon position was 59.33%, of which in agreement with the invertebrate bias favoring codons ending in A or T. Analysis of phylogenetic relationships according to the concatenated nucleotide data set containing 18S rRNA gene and 13 protein-coding genes, the phylogenetic relationship was analyzed by Maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The results showed that T. maxima was placed with the clade comprising T. noae, T. squamosa, and T. crocea, in which T. squamosa was highly similar to T. crocea and is consistent with the results of the previous studies using15 mitochondrial markers and nuclear 18S rRNA. Moreover, the inferred divergence time of Tridacnidae species is generally consistent with the fossil record of Tridacnidae. The divergence time of H. porcellanus and H. hippopus was about 10.64 Mya, this result is in agreement with the speculation that H. porcellanus also originated in Miocene. The availability of molecular phylogeny and divergence time estimation provides information genetic relationship of Tridacninae, which could be helpful to the ecological research and conservation of giant clams.

AB  - An animal's capacity for innovation or solving novel problems likely has important implications for how quickly they can adapt to environmental change. Asian elephants, Elephas maximus, living in zoos have previously demonstrated a capacity to innovate, but problem solving has never been studied experimentally in a wild elephant population. We installed puzzle boxes with multiple possible solutions inside a protected area in western Thailand to determine individual variation in innovation, as well as other behavioural traits associated with elephants' problem solving, including persistence, exploratory diversity and neophilia. We recorded 77 elephants approaching the puzzle box, with 44 interacting with the box in their first exposure. Individuals varied widely in their success opening the doors of the puzzle box. Such success was influenced by persistence and exploratory diversity in both the first interaction as well as across multiple interactions. However, when considering each individual's overall innovation scores, which represented how many different doors elephants were able to open across all of their interactions with the puzzle box, only greater persistence and interaction number were associated with reaching a higher innovation score. We observed that elephants who interacted with the box multiple times learned to open a door of any type more quickly as their interactions increased, but we did not see evidence of learning to open specific door types over time. Overall, this study about how innovation and its associated behaviours vary in wild elephants not only informs our understanding of how a capacity for problem solving is expressed, but also how well elephants may be able to adapt to, overcome or avoid increasingly frequent interactions with humans within their natural habitat.

AB  - Environmental education (EE) applications can support wildlife conservation practices by improving school children's understanding of environmental issues, including endangered species conservation, such as the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana). This study aimed to identify and assess school children's perceptions of elephant conservation in three schools: South Africa, Kenya, and England. Questionnaires were completed by students at one school per location, with the age range of 10-16 (n = 364). The responses were then analysed independently and collectively using descriptive statistics (n = 364). School children feared elephants where elephants were native. The importance of elephants was not acknowledged by students in South Africa and England and included a lack of awareness of how elephants benefit other species. There was an unclear understanding of the threats to elephants. Collectively, a wildlife guide as a career choice was not highly valued. The results of this study have reflected key narratives of elephant conservation from selected countries; Kenya leading in anti-poaching and anti-trade campaigns, anti-poaching campaigns by various NGOs in the U.K., and elephant management around expanding populations in South Africa, which have given significant insights into areas of improvement for environmental education practices to support wildlife conservation globally. Furthermore, this new research has identified and compared school children's awareness of elephant conservation on a greater spatial scale than what is currently understood, compounding the importance of understanding effective wildlife conservation in education.

AB  - Although scientific climate forecast (SF) distribution by national climate services has improved over time, farmers seem not to make good use of climate forecasts, a likely contributing factor to vulnerability to climate change. This study investigated factors associated with farmers' use of SFs and indigenous forecasts (IFs) for agricultural use in the Rwenzori region, western Uganda. Household survey gathered data on demographic characteristics, climate information use and livelihood choices from 580 farmers. Data was analysed using the probit model. Results showed that significant factors associated with using both IFs and SFs were farm size, education, age, reception of scientific forecasts in local languages, agricultural extension access, short-mature crop access, farmer-to-farmer network and accessing forecasts through radio. This study shows that IFs were used complementarily with SFs. On the other hand, significant factors associated with using IFs only were livelihood choices such as tuber and goat production, access to government interventions on climate change adaptations, agro-ecological zone and social capital. Climate risks and climate risk perceptions negatively influenced the use of scientific forecasts. Co-production of climate information, capacity-building and active engagement of stakeholders in dissemination mechanisms can improve climate forecast use. Investments in more weather stations in various districts will therefore be a key factor in obtaining more accurate scientific forecasts and could lead to increased use of scientific climate forecasts. Governments in developing countries, the private sector, global and regional development partners should support investments in weather stations and capacity building of national meteorological systems.

AB  - A partial mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene haplotype variant of the coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) Oryctes rhinoceros, classed as 'CRB-G (clade I)', has been the focus of much research since 2007, with reports of invasions into new Pacific Island locations (e.g., Guam, Hawaii, Solomons Islands). For numerous invasive species, inference of invasion biology via whole genome is superior to assessments via the partial mtCOI gene. Here, we explore CRB draft mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) from historical and recent collections, with assessment focused on individuals associated within the CRB-G (clade I) classification. We found that all Guam CRB individuals possessed the same mitogenome across all 13 protein-coding genes and differed from individuals collected elsewhere, including 'non-Guam' individuals designated as CRB-G (clade I) by partial mtCOI assessment. Two alternative ATP6 and COIII partial gene primer sets were developed to enable distinction between CRB individuals from Guam that classed within the CRB-G (clade I) haplotype grouping and CRB-G (Clade I) individuals collected elsewhere. Phylogenetic analyses based on concatenated ATP6-COIII genes showed that only Guam CRB-G (clade I) individuals clustered together, and therefore Guam was not the source of the CRB that invaded the other locations in the Pacific assessed in this study. The use of the mtCOI and/or mtCOIII genes for initial molecular diagnosis of CRB remained crucial, and assessment of more native CRB populations will further advance our ability to identify the provenance of CRB invasions being reported within the Pacific and elsewhere.

AB  - Subterranean termites rely on chemical and vibroacoustic communication as they live enclosed in tunnels in the soil or wood. While social context is known to influence colony-level behaviors in many social insects, its influence on alarm communication remains unstudied. We tested the influence of the soldier caste on worker behavioral plasticity for subterranean termites: two species of Reticulitermes and Coptotermes formosanus. We altered the group composition according to soldier proportion or their replacement by chemical signals (hexane extracts). The responses of termites to stimuli known to provoke alarm responses, such as human breath simulating a breech in the nest or crushed soldier head (CSH) containing the chemical alarm cues, comprised increased movement and increased vibroacoustic alarm signaling. Species differed in the intensity of their responses, which were generally stronger in Reticulitermes. Groups of Reticulitermes with soldiers responded more strongly to CSH, while groups of R. virginicus only responded to human breath in the presence of soldier extracts. The responses of Coptotermes formosanus showed no effect of group composition on responses to stimuli, suggesting that soldier presence does not affect vibroacoustic behavior in this species. Our results highlight how alarm behavior changes quickly in closely related species as part of finely tuned behavioral mechanisms optimizing a species' response in each environment including in the presence of natural predators and competitors.

AB  - Sediments in algal turfs can modify a wide variety of key ecological processes on coral reefs. While some larger reef fishes can remove these turf-bound sediments, the role of small, yet abundant, cryptobenthic fishes is currently unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we explored the extent to which the blenny, Ecsenius stictus, can shape sediment dynamics on coral reefs by quantifying their sediment ingestion and space use. Per unit body mass, E. stictus process sediments at comparable rates to key parrotfish and surgeonfish species. However, in absolute terms, E. stictus has a negligible influence on net sediment dynamics, despite their abundance. Behavioural observations and 3D photogrammetry reveal that E. stictus preferentially feed and rest on elevated surfaces; potentially because of low sediment loads on these surfaces. Overall, E. stictus may be responding to sediment loads rather than manipulating them; it is a passenger rather than a driver in reef processes.

AB  - As herbivores forage, they move across a wide range of topographical features. Yet, they tend to avoid terrain such as steep slopes where energetic costs of movement are high and there is a greater risk of falls and tumbles. Recent studies suggest that African elephants (Loxodonta africana) avoid steep slopes (e.g., > 15 degrees). However, in reserves with undulating topography, elephants may have to use steep slopes to obtain food, especially when availability is limited in more gradual areas. To explore this, we investigated slope use by elephants in the Ithala Game Reserve, South Africa, where the topography varies greatly and ranges between 400 to 1400 masl. Using 8.5 years of positional data, we examined how slope use varied between herd types (14 breeding herds and 13 males), habitat type and season (wet vs. dry). Elephants were found primarily on slopes < 30 degrees (i.e., 95% of the locations), while 67% of the locations were on slopes < 15 degrees, and 52% on slopes < 10 degrees. Breeding herds used steeper slopes (mean = 12.6 degrees +/- 0.08 SE) than bulls (mean = 12.0 degrees +/- 0.8 SE). In addition, habitat influenced slope use, with the steepest slopes used in woodlands and the most gradual used in built-up areas and grasslands. However, these slope use differences were very small (i.e., 0.6 degrees to 9.7 degrees) and thus unlikely to be biologically meaningful. Rather, the ability to detect these slight differences was likely an artefact of our large sample size (N = 23,837 locations). Moreover, slope use did not vary between the wet and dry seasons. Nevertheless, 5% of all the elephant locations occurred on very steep slopes (i.e., > 30 degrees) and 33% were on slopes > 15 degrees, indicating that although they may prefer flat terrain, when required, elephants will mountaineer.

AB  - Although vocalizations are essential to mammalian sociosexual behaviours, little is known about female preferences for male vocal displays in non-model mammalian species. Here, we characterized female preferences for the advertisement songs of male Alston's singing mice (Scotinomys teguina). We developed procedures for inducing oestrus, using vaginal perforation as a morphological indicator of oestrus. We then broadcasted 'high-effort' and 'low-effort' songs recorded from wild-caught males to virgin laboratory-reared females, using a two-choice experiment. Our results indicate that females spent more time investigating speakers playing high-effort songs; surprisingly, this phonotactic response is independent of oestrus status. In wild singing mice, acoustic characteristics of high-effort male songs positively correlate with body condition. Our data suggest that females could use acoustic cues to select mates in good condition, thus providing preliminary support for adaptive mate choice hypotheses. More generally, our results support the hypothesis that elaborate Scotinomys song may be shaped by female choice.

AB  - This article presents a new model to manage the provision of healthy food despite incomplete information about exposure of natural resources to a persistent pollutant (chlordecone). This toxic molecule has contaminated both terrestrial and aquatic resources for several decades in the French West Indies. As a consequence, the threat of exposing humans to contaminated food jeopardises local agricultural and livestock activities. We address the problem that breeders face: producing healthy food with incomplete information on the animals' contamination. We examine the compatibility of respecting health-production constraints with the timing of animal management. We consider the dual set of constraints that breeders face: (i) they must achieve a target contamination rate that complies with the regulation on the maximum residue limits (MRL), and (ii) they must comply with a production calendar that tells them at what age the animals are to be sold. We also discuss the economic and biotechnical consequences that changes in the MRL impose on meat production. We compute the time required to decontaminate the animals and analyse the cost for farmers to adapt to (i) the regulation in place and to (ii) the more stringent health-related targets that are expected in the future. Our results are sensitive to the choice of species (cattle, goats, sheep and pigs), the rearing practices, the information setting and the initial contamination rate. This paper opens strategic windows for breeders to guarantee their economic sustainability and their ability to produce healthy meat despite the incomplete information on pollution at their disposal.

AB  - Concentrations of Cd, Ni, and Pb were measured in the liver and muscle tissues of benthic omnivorous (Barbus grypus) and pelagic herbivorous (Tenualosa ilisha) fish collected from two sampling sites along the Karoon River, Khuzestan Province, southwest of Iran. Potential human health risks were evaluated by measuring the estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), hazard index (HI), and target cancer risk (TR). The results highlight the important role of habitat and feeding habits in the uptake of HMs by the two species. The EDI for all HMs exceeded the oral reference doses (RfDo) provided by the USEPA, indicating the two fish species are not entirely safe for human consumption. The THQ values were within the permissible limit (< 1), while HI values (> 1) showed there was non-carcinogenic risk for consumers. The TR values for Pb were within the acceptable range (1.00E-06-1.00E-04) for both species.

AB  - Sex-specific trait expression represents a striking dimension of morphological variation within and across species. The mechanisms instructing sex-specific organ development have been well studied in a small number of insect model systems, suggesting striking conservation in some parts of the somatic sex determination pathway while hinting at possible evolutionary lability in others. However, further resolution of this phenomenon necessitates additional taxon sampling, particularly in groups in which sexual dimorphisms have undergone significant elaboration and diversification. Here, we functionally investigate the somatic sex determination pathway in the gazelle dung beetle Digitonthophagus gazella, an emerging model system in the study of the development and evolution of sexual dimorphisms. We find that RNA interference (RNAi) targeting transformer (tra) caused chromosomal females to develop morphological traits largely indistinguishable from those normally only observed in males, and that traRNAi is sufficient to induce splicing of the normally male-specific isoform of doublesex in chromosomal females, while leaving males unaffected. Further, intersexRNAi was found to phenocopy previously described RNAi phenotypes of doublesex in female but not male beetles. These findings match predictions derived from models of the sex determination cascade as developed largely through studies in Drosophila melanogaster. In contrast, efforts to target transformer2 via RNAi resulted in high juvenile mortality but did not appear to affect doublesex splicing, whereas RNAi targeting Sex-lethal and two putative orthologs of hermaphrodite yielded no obvious phenotypic modifications in either males or females, raising the possibility that the function of a subset of sex determination genes may be derived in select Diptera and thus nonrepresentative of their roles in other holometabolous orders. Our results help illuminate how the differential evolutionary lability of the somatic sex determination pathway has contributed to the extraordinary morphological diversification of sex-specific trait expression found in nature.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine concentrations of cadmium, copper, chromium, manganese and iron in fishes in the Sa similar to o Marcos (SMB), Sa similar to o Jose (SJB) and Arraial (AB) Bays. Metal concentrations were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Mean Cd and Cr levels were above the permissible limits set by different international or national guidelines in all three bays, whereas copper levels were well below the maximum acceptable limit. High concentrations of iron were found in all species analyzed, whereas high concentrations of manganese were found, especially in specimens caught in SJB. Spatial analysis indicated significant differences among the elements investigated. Copper was correlated more with SMB and AB as well as the species Macrodon ancylodon (carnivore) and Sciades herzbergii (omnivore). Cadmium and iron were strongly associated with AB and SJB, while manganese was only associated with SJB, mainly in carnivorous and herbivorous species.

AB  - Simple Summary This study concludes that supplementation with Moringa oleifera leaves in concentrated mixtures improves nutrient digestibility, growth performance, immunity status, and antioxidant activity in goat kids under different feeding regimens. Supplementation of Moringa leaves-which are rich in protein, minerals, and beneficial biomolecules-can be used up to the level of 10-20% in concentrated mixtures for better performance in goats. These also meet the essential necessities of small ruminants and overcome the problem of enteric methane emissions. Hence, they may be recommended for goats as a protein source supplement and to mitigate the methane emissions from ruminants. The development of different innovative feed resources for livestock is important to provide the essential nutrients and diminish the emission of greenhouse gases. The purpose of the present experiment was to study the response of replacing concentrate with Moringa oleifera leaves in terms of the nutrient intake, digestibility, enteric methane emissions, and performance of goat kids with a berseem-fodder-based diet under different roughage (R)-to-concentrate (C) ratios. Twenty-four goat kids (3 months of age) were distributed into four groups of six animals each, using a randomized block design (RBD). Kids of Group I (control) were fed a basal diet with 70R:30C without any tree leaf supplementation. Group II kids were fed with 60R:40C, where 10% of the concentrate mix was replaced with Moringa leaf (ML powder). In Group III, kids were fed with 70R:30C with 20% ML replacement. In Group IV, kids were fed with 80R:20C with 20% ML replacement. A metabolic trial was conducted after 180 days of feeding to assess the impact of ML on blood metabolites, antioxidant status, immunity parameters, and enteric methane emissions. The results revealed that dry matter digestibility, organic matter, and NDF were better (p < 0.05) in ML-treated kids (GII and GIII) compared to GI. Feed conversion and average daily gain were also enhanced (p < 0.05) in the treated groups as compared to controls. Total blood protein and albumin were increased in GII and GIII kids compared to GI. Plasma cholesterol levels were decreased (p < 0.001) in GII, GIII, and GIV as compared to GI. Glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase enzyme activities were also enhanced in GII, GIII, and GIV compared to controls. ML supplementation improved cell-mediated immunity and humoral immunity responses in goat kids. Enteric methane emissions decreased in the treated groups as compared to the controls. Moringa oleifera leaf may be used up to the level of 10-20% in concentrate mixes to improve digestibility, blood biochemical parameters, immunity status, and antioxidant activity in goat kids. Supplementation of ML not only enhanced the digestion and health of goat kids, but also decreased their methane emissions.

AB  - In dairy sheep, optimum nutrition is required to maintain a positive energy and nitrogen balance, and therefore, achieve adequate performance levels. In this sense, supplemental rumen-protected methionine (RPMet) has been a nutritional strategy used to improve the availability of amino acids in sheep for milk production. The aim of the current study is to assess the effect of RPMet supplementation on the milk yield and milk composition of crossbred dairy sheep. Twenty F1 sheep (50% Pelibuey x 50% East Friesian) were randomly assigned to one of the following three treatments: C (control: 0 g/d), 3 g (3.0 g/d), or 6 g (6 g/d) of RPMet added to the basal diet from day 2 to 120 after lambing. Milk yield was significantly higher in sheep supplemented with 6 g of RPMet (p = 0.04) with a linear effect (p < 0.001). In relation to protein yield, the 6 g treatment showed the highest values (55.5 g/day) in comparison with the control (35.2 g/day) and 3 g (42.3 g/day) treatments. Also, lactose (p = 0.02) and non-fat solid yield (p = 0.03) were positively affected by the methionine supplementation. Our results suggest that methionine supplementation is an option to increase milk production, likely associated with the better availability of nutrients of dairy sheep farms using crossbred sheep in regions with an incipient dairy sheep industry.

The use of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) in these systems is gaining increased attention, and EPF as crop endophytes hold the potential for combining insect pest control and yield enhancement of crops, but the effects of increased CO2 concentration on this interaction are poorly understood. Here, the introduction of endophytic EPF was explored as an alternative sustainable management strategy benefiting crops under elevated CO2, using maize (Zea mays), Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis), and EPF (Beauveria bassiana) to test changes in damage to maize plants from O. furnacalis, and the nutritional status (content of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), biomass, and yield of maize. RESULTS: The results showed that endophytic B. bassiana could alleviate the damage caused by O. furnacalis larvae for maize plants under ambient CO2 concentration, and this effect was enhanced under higher CO(2 )concentration. Inoculation with B. bassiana effectively counteracted the adverse impact of elevated CO2 on maize plants by preserving the nitrogen content at its baseline level (comparable with ambient CO2 conditions without B. bassiana). Both simultaneous effects could explain the improvement of biomass and yield of maize under B. bassiana inoculation and elevated CO2. CONCLUSION This finding provides key information about the multifaceted benefits of B. bassiana as a maize endophyte. Our results highlight the promising potential of incorporating EPF as endophytes into integrated pest management strategies, particularly under elevated CO2 concentrations. (c) 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Comparative studies suggest remarkable similarities among food webs across habitats, including systematic changes in their structure with diversity and complexity (scale-dependence). However, historic aboveground terrestrial food webs (ATFWs) have coarsely grouped plants and insects such that these webs are generally small, and herbivory is disproportionately under-represented compared to vertebrate predator-prey interactions. Furthermore, terrestrial herbivory is thought to be structured by unique processes compared to size-structured feeding in other systems. Here, we present the richest ATFW to date, including approximately 580 000 feeding links among approximately 3800 taxonomic species, sourced from approximately 27 000 expert-vetted interaction records annotated as feeding upon one of six different resource types: leaves, flowers, seeds, wood, prey and carrion. By comparison to historical ATFWs and null ecological hypotheses, we show that our temperate forest web displays a potentially unique structure characterized by two properties: (i) a large fraction of carnivory interactions dominated by a small number of hyper-generalist, opportunistic bird and bat predators; and (ii) a smaller fraction of herbivory interactions dominated by a hyper-rich community of insects with variably sized but highly specific diets. We attribute our findings to the large-scale, even resolution of vertebrate, insect and plant guilds in our food web.This article is part of the theme issue 'Connected interactions: enriching food web research by spatial and social interactions'.

AB  - Camellia chrysantha is a precious and rare plant with numerous cultivars. To clarify the differences in quality traits among cultivars and provide a basis for future classification and superior germplasm selection, this study evaluated 20 cultivars of C. chrysantha using ecological, UVspectrophotometry, and statistical methods. The results showed significant differences in phenotypic traits among the 20 cultivars, indicating rich genetic diversity. The cultivars with the highest leaf yield were C. chrysantha var. conspicua, while the lowest was C. chrysantha var. wumingensis. The chemical component content showed significant differences among the cultivars. C. chrysantha var. flava had the highest total flavonoid content, C. chrysantha var. longzhouensis had the highest total polyphenol content, and C. chrysantha var. dongxingensis had the highest polysaccharide content. Principal component and cluster analyses identified high-quality cultivars, including C. chrysantha var. longrui, nonggangensis, longzhouensis, flava, tenuifolia, pilosa, conspicua, concava, and enchengensis, mainly distributed in Fangcheng, Ningming, Longzhou, and Daxin areas. These regions have subtropical and South Asian monsoon climates, with ideal environmental conditions for the growth of C. chrysantha, including temperature, rainfall, sunlight, and humidity. The study concluded that there are significant differences in quality traits among the 20 cultivars of C. chrysantha, providing an important basis for the classification and selection of superior germplasm.

AB  - Formic acid was investigated as a potential repellant for African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) as a semiochemical option for managing elephant movements and interactions with human infrastructure. Formic acid is a naturally occurring compound, used as an alarm pheromone and as a defensive chemical in Formicine ants, and thus a potentially desirable option compared to introducing exogenous deterrents that are foreign to the elephants' natural habitats. Although most elephants observed (85%) did not interact with treatments containing formic acid, of the cohort of individuals (n = 38) that did respond, the majority showed a mild to moderate avoidance response, while a small proportion of elephants were distinctly repelled when experiencing formic acid cues, in some cases causing whole herds to evacuate an area. The potential for using formic acid as an elephant repellant to modulate elephant behavior in field situations is discussed.

AB  - The spatial variability of mesozooplankton (MZ) community characteristics, with an emphasis on the predominant taxa, copepods, were evaluated between two distinct coastal water environments of Mangalore: the Netravati-Gurupura estuarine system (NGES) and the adjacent nearshore waters (<20 m depth) on the southwest coast of India during winter 2018. The nearshore waters were characterised by uniformly distributed hydrographic properties, particularly in terms of water column temperature, salinity and turbidity. This well-mixed water column likely stimulated increased phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentrations [av. (2.9 +/- 2.2) mg/m(3)], which in turn supported higher MZ biomass [av. (0.4 +/- 0.15) mL/m(3)] and abundance [av. (6 889 +/- 3 387) ind./m(3)] in the nearshore waters. In contrast, the NGES exhibited highly variable hydrographic conditions, leading to inconsistent chlorophyll a [av. (3.2 +/- 3.7) mg/m(3)], along with significantly lower MZ biomass [av. (0.1 +/- 0.2) mL/m(3)] and abundance [av. (238 +/- 339) ind./m(3)]. The MZ community was dominated by herbivorous copepods (HCs), particularly Bestiolina similis, in the entire study region; however, the nearshore waters supported a more diverse taxon. The overall dominance of HCs, e.g., B. similis and Pseudodiaptomous aurivillii, in the nearshore waters, indicates the presence of stable hydrographic conditions, especially consistently higher salinity and chlorophyll a level. In contrast, the unstable hydrographic conditions in the NGES, primarily reflected in the uneven salinity distributions, likely contributed to the reduced MZ biomass and abundance. The relative increase in the abundance of B. similis observed exclusively in the euhaline zones of the estuary highlights the significant influence of neritic waters.

AB  - Simple Summary Castration is a common management practice used to improve the meat quality of goats, but the optimal timing to perform castration has yet to be scientifically determined. As a result, goat breeders in Taiwan have discrepant practices regarding the timing of castration. Some producers believe that late castration results in better carcass performance, whereas others claim that earlier castration minimizes the stress associated with the operation. The purpose of this study was to compare the growth performance and economic costs between goats castrated at 3 months (weaning) and 6 months (onset of puberty) of age, respectively. Results from this study provide fundamental information for goat farmers to evaluate the effects of castration timing on various production-related parameters, such as growth performance, carcass quality, and negative impacts caused by late castration. To determine the optimal timing for performing castration on goats, eighteen male Nubian crossbred goats were randomly assigned to two groups and castrated at 3 months and 6 months of age, respectively. Daily dry matter intake, biweekly body weights, and ultrasonic measurements of longissimus dorsi muscle growth were recorded. Results indicated that there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the blood parameter analysis (except testosterone, 0.36 +/- 0.26 vs. 3.61 +/- 0.27 ng/mL at 25 weeks old), economic analysis, and growth performance, including final body weight, total weight gain, average daily gain, total dry-matter intake, and feed conversion ratio (p > 0.05). However, the longissimus dorsi muscle depth of goats castrated at 6 months of age was significantly higher than that of goats castrated at 3 months of age. In conclusion, castration timing does not have a significant effect on the growth performance of goats; therefore, castrating goats at 3 months of age may be the best practice considering animal welfare and possible risks associated with late castration.

AB  - One of the biggest threats to the world's fish stocks is trawling with indiscriminate capturing of non-target organisms, typically referred to as bycatch. Some species of seahorses are globally threatened and are often targets caught as bycatch. The aim of this work is to describe the magnitude of bycatch of the Patagonian seahorse Hippocampus patagonicus (Sygnathidae) in trawling fisheries in the Southeast and South Brazil. Between 2016 and 2018 we monitored the catch of five trawling vessels off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. A total of 2,041 individuals of H. patagonicus were captured, 1,183 males and 858 females. They were evaluated as for injuries suffered during dragging. The average rate of body damage was 33%. Based on the individuals captured and the analysis of on-board maps, an average CPUE of 3.36 with a standard deviation of 5.95/ind./day/vessel was estimated for the study area, extrapolating an incidental removal of 2,282,515 individuals per year, or 9,427 metric tons of seahorses, along the South and Southeast Brazil, where 3700 trawlers operate, an area recognized as the geographic distribution of H. patagonicus in Brazil

AB  - Echinoid feeding biology is well known but their sluggish responses to chemical stimuli have turned them into inadequately worked in the field of chemoreception. Echinoid responses to chemical stimulation had allowed, so far, only qualitative analyses based on tube-feet activity, directional, or masticatory movements, and artificial agarose foods. Besides stimulation through plumes of dissolved organic compounds and response analysis based on tube-feet activity, we propose another method to chemically stimulate echinoids that allows for fast and unambiguous responses and thus, quantitative analyses. Small squared pieces of absorbent semi-synthetic cleaning cloths, soaked with specific chemical compounds (simulacra), such as water insoluble lipid oils, were deposited singly or concurrently with a blank on the aboral hemisphere of each sea urchin, allowing choice and eventual transport down to the mouth by tube feet and spines of one or both cloths. The responsiveness of Paracentrotus lividus was clearly dependent on its nutritional state. Well-fed sea urchins (maize whole grains) rarely responded, while the ones fed with less caloric rations (Kombu seaweed) responded faster and objectively. Stimulating sea urchin P. lividus with 41 different food-related compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, peptides and amino acids, oils and fatty acids, and purified chemicals related with some human basic tastes, it was possible to evidence a clear ability of this echinoid species to positively discriminate proteins, starches, and a very few oils. Perceived as incitants/stimulants we have only found among proteins gliadin (from wheat gluten) but not casein (from bovine milk), among polysaccharides starch but not laminarin (from kelp) or glycogen (from mussels), and among lipids only the fatty acid linolenic acid. Among tissues, Kombu alga flesh and mussel flesh were readily perceived as both incitant/stimulant but not Kombu and mussel extracts. Therefore, the combined results reported here provide evidence for P. lividus as an omnivorous species rather than a strictly herbivorous marine species. However, the restricted group of food-related compounds perceived by this species as incitants or suppressants and as stimulants or deterrents was shown to be remarkably related to other vertebrates whose kinship was confirmed by the sequencing of the genome of another plant-eater sea urchin.

AB  - Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi invaded Guam in 2003 and caused the widespread mortality of the indigenous Cycas micronesica K.D. Hill population. The regeneration of the surviving tree population continues to be constrained 20 years later, and a look at the changes in megastrobili traits may inform future conservation management decisions concerning regeneration. We quantified megastrobilus reproductive effort and output from 2001 to 2022 to address this need. The reproductive effort of each megastrobilus was immediately reduced by the invasion, as the number of megasporophylls declined by 29%, and the number of ovules declined by 73% in 2006. Reproductive output was also damaged, as the percent seed set declined by 56% and the number of seeds per strobilus declined by 88%. These fecundity metrics have shown few signs of recovery through 2022. Our results reveal that chronic A. yasumatsui infestations, combined with other invasive herbivore threats, have damaged the host C. micronesica population through a sustained reduction in ovule production and the percent seed set for each megastrobilus, thereby impairing regeneration. This plant response to the biotic threats is distinct from the ongoing mortality of mature trees and emerging seedlings. Conservation interventions may be required to foster a return to adequate regeneration during future attempts to aid C. micronesica recovery.

AB  - Mineral development and metal smelting are the main sources of heavy metal pollution, and copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) are the most serious mineral elements in heavy metal pollution. Food chain is the main channel for Cu and Cd to enter human body. Excessive accumulation of Cu and Cd can lead to a variety of diseases and threaten human health. Therefore, it is urgent to repair Cu and Cd-contaminated soil. Previous several studies found that sulfur (S) and molybdenum (Mo) had the effect of alleviating the decrease of antioxidant capacity caused by heavy metal poisoning. To investigate the co-combinations of S and Mo fertilizations on antioxidant capacity of grazing Guizhou semi-fine wool sheep in Cu and Cd-contaminated meadow, and explore the control methods of co-pollutions of Cu and Cd in natural pastures, fertilizing and grazing experiments were carried out in the Wumeng Prairie in the northwest of Guizhou Province, Southwest China. 24 hm2 Cu and Cd-polluted meadows were fenced, and were randomly divided into four groups with 3 replications per group and 2 hm2 per replication. The tested groups included the control group (no fertilizer) and the three treatment groups, applied 40 kg S + 1 kg Mo, 80 kg S + 2 kg Mo, and 120 kg S + 3 kg Mo per hectare for group I, group II, and group III, respectively. 72 healthy Guizhou semi-fine wool sheep (one year old, 33.9 +/- 1.2 kg) were randomly assigned to the tested pastures with 18 sheep per group. The grazing experiment lasted for 60 days. The results showed that the contents of Mn, Zn, Mo, and S in herbage in fertilized pastures were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The content of Cu in herbage in fertilized pastures was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The contents of Mn, Zn, Mo, and S in serum of grazing Guizhou semi-fine wool sheep were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The content of Cu in serum of grazing Guizhou semi-fine wool sheep was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). The levels of blood Hb, RBC, and PCV, and the activities of serum SOD, GSH-Px, T-AOC, CAT, and Cp in group III were higher than that in the control group, group I, and group II (P < 0.05). The MDA content of sheep in group III was lower than that in the other treatment sheep (P < 0.05). In summary, the combinations of S and Mo fertilizers influenced the mineral contents in herbage and serum of grazing Guizhou semi-fine wool sheep. The combinations of 120 kg S + 3 kg Mo fertilizer reduced the toxicity and improved antioxidant capacity of grazing Guizhou semi-fine wool sheep in Cu and Cdpolluted grasslands.

AB  - Simple Summary Response of live weight, body-condition score (BCS) depth of musculus longissimus thoracis et lumborum (MLTL) and back-fat thickness after infections with Eimeria sp. (EIM) and strongylid nematodes (STR) was investigated in a selected flock of dairy goats throughout the lactation period. Regression-correlation analysis demonstrated a significant interrelation of BCS to EIM exposure (BCS = 2.752 - 0.666 x 10(-3) x EIM; r = -0.198). Goat nutritional status was not significantly correlated with STR infection. A linear tendency (p = 0.092), however, was detected for the response of MLTL to STR infection. An increase in infection intensity of 1000 eggs per gramme was accompanied by a 0.3 mm decrease in MLLT. Thirty goats of the breeds Czech Brown Shorthaired and Czech White Shorthaired and their crosses were randomly selected from a flock at a farm in the Czech Republic. All animals were monitored for one year at monthly intervals for their nutritional status (live weight, LW; body-condition score, BCS; depth of musculus longissimus thoracis et lumborum, MLTL; back-fat thickness, BT) and infection intensity with Eimeria sp. (EIM) and strongylid nematodes (STR). Regression-correlation analysis showed a possible interrelation of BCS with EIM infection. Analysis of muscle and fat reserves indicated that BT was better than MLTL in identifying EIM infection. Goat nutritional status was not significantly correlated with STR infection. A linear tendency (p = 0.092), however, was detected for the response of MLTL to STR infection. Results of this study indicated theoretical use of BCS for Eimeria identification and suggested some perspective of BCS for targeting animals infected by strongylid nematode. Validity of our results, however, was limited by number of observed animals managed under specific breeding conditions.

AB  - Eumaeus butterflies are obligate herbivores of Zamia, the most diverse neotropical genus of cycads. Eumaeus-Zamia interactions have been characterized mainly for species distributed in North and Central America. However, larval host plant use by the southern Eumaeus clade remains largely unknown, precluding a comprehensive study of co-evolution between the genera. Here, we combine fieldwork with museum and literature surveys to expand herbivory records for Eumaeus from 21 to 38 Zamia species. We inferred a time-calibrated phylogeny of Eumaeus to test for distinct macroevolutionary scenarios of larval host plant conservatism and co-evolution. We found a remarkable coincidence between Eumaeus and Zamia diversification, with the butterfly stem group diverging at the same time as the most recent radiation of Zamia in the Miocene. Cophylogenetic reconciliation analyses show a strong cophylogenetic signal between cycads and their butterfly herbivores. Bipartite model-based approaches indicate that this is because closely related Zamia species are used by the same Eumaeus species, suggesting larval host plant resource tracking by the butterfly herbivores. Our results highlight a case of tight evolution between Eumaeus butterflies and cycads, pointing to the generality of correlated evolution and phylogenetic tracking in plant-herbivore interactions across seed plants.

AB  - Polyphagous insects often show specialization in feeding on different host plants in terms of survival and growth and, therefore, can be considered minor or major pests of particular hosts. Whether polyphagous insects employ a common transcriptional response to cope with defenses from diverse host plants is under-studied. We focused on patterns of transcriptional plasticity in polyphagous moths (Noctuidae), of which many species are notorious pests, in relation to herbivore performance on different host plants. We compared the transcriptional plasticity of five polyphagous moth species feeding and developing on three different host plant species. Using a comparative phylogenetic framework, we evaluated if successful herbivory, as measured by larval performance, is determined by a shared or lineage-specific transcriptional response. The upregulated transcriptional activity, or gene expression pattern, of larvae feeding on the different host plants and artificial control diet was highly plastic and moth species-specific. Specialization, defined as high herbivore success for specific host plants, was not generally linked to a lower number of induced genes. Moths that were more distantly related and showing high herbivore success for certain host plants showed shared expression of multiple homologous genes, indicating convergence. We further observed specific transcriptional responses within phylogenetic lineages. These expression patterns for specific host plant species are likely caused by shared evolutionary histories, for example, symplesiomorphic patterns, and could therefore not be associated with herbivore success alone. Multiple gene families, with roles in plant digestion and detoxification, were widely expressed in response to host plant feeding but again showed highly moth species-specific. Consequently, high herbivore success for specific host plants is also driven by species-specific transcriptional plasticity. Thus, potential pest moths display a complex and species-specific transcriptional plasticity.

AB  - Commercial fishery harvest can influence the evolution of wild fish populations. Our knowledge of selection on morphology is however limited, with most previous studies focusing on body size, age, and maturation. Within species, variation in morphology can influence locomotor ability, possibly making some individuals more vulnerable to capture by fishing gears. Additionally, selection on morphology has the potential to influence other foraging, behavioral, and life-history related traits. Here we carried out simulated fishing using two types of gears: a trawl (an active gear) and a trap (a passive gear), to assess morphological trait-based selection in relation to capture vulnerability. Using geometric morphometrics, we assessed differences in shape between high and low vulnerability fish, showing that high vulnerability individuals display shallower body shapes regardless of gear type. For trawling, low vulnerability fish displayed morphological characteristics that may be associated with higher burst-swimming, including a larger caudal region and narrower head, similar to evolutionary responses seen in fish populations responding to natural predation. Taken together, these results suggest that divergent selection can lead to phenotypic differences in harvested fish populations.

AB  - Soybean meal is the dominate protein source for swine diets in the world driven largely by economics, nutritive value, and availability; but conditions can change requiting growers to consider more economical and available protein alternatives. A feeding trial was conducted to determine the impact dietary protein source material on manure slurry chemical properties and manure gas emissions. A total of 32 gilts averaging 130 kg BW were fed either a control diet formulated with soybean meal (SB) or an alternative protein source that included corn gluten meal (CG); canola meal (CM); or poultry meal (PM), with all diets containing 176 g protein kg(-1). Diets were fed for 45 d with an average daily feed intake of 2.68 kg/d. Feces and urine were collected twice daily after each feeding and added to animal-specific manure storage containers. At the end of the study, manure slurries were monitored for gas emissions and chemical properties. Dietary protein source had a significant effect (P < 0.05) on manure pH, total solids, total C, protein N, and total S. Pigs fed the diets containing CM had significantly higher levels of sulfide, butanoic acid, and branch chain fatty acids compared to pigs fed SB diets (P < 0.05). Pigs fed CM diets had significantly lower emissions of NH3 compared to pigs fed SB diets (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in C or S emissions or in odorant emission as affected by source of dietary protein. Hydrogen sulfide was the most dominate odorants for all dietary treatments.

AB  - Camouflage through colour change can involve reversible or permanent changes in response to cyclic predator or herbivore pressures. The evolution of background matching in camouflaged phenotypes partly depends on the genetics of the camouflage trait, but this has received little attention in plants. Here we clarify the genetic pathway underlying the grey-leaved morph of fumewort, Corydalis hemidicentra, of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau that by being camouflaged escapes herbivory from caterpillars of host-specialized Parnassius butterflies. Field experiments show that camouflaged grey leaves matching the surrounding scree habitat experience reduced oviposition by female butterflies and herbivory by caterpillars, resulting in higher fruit set than that achieved by green-leaved plants. The defence is entirely visual. Multi-omics data and functional validation reveal that a 254-bp-inserted transposon causes anthocyanin accumulation in leaves, giving them a rock-like grey colour. Demographic analyses of plant and butterfly effective population sizes over the past 500 years indicate that plant populations have been more stable at sites with camouflage than at sites with only green-leaved plants. In the recent past, populations of Parnassius butterflies have declined at sites with camouflaged plants. These findings provide insights into the genetics of a plant camouflage trait and its potential role in the rapidly changing dynamics of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Brassicaceae plants have the glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system, jointly active against herbivory. However, constitutive glucosinolate (GLS) defense is observed to occur at levels that do not deter all insects from feeding. That prompts the question of why Brassicaceae plants have not evolved a higher constitutive defense. The answer may lie in the contrasting relationship between plant defense and host plant preference of specialist and generalist herbivores. GLS content increases a plant's susceptibility to specialist insects. In contrast, generalists are deterred by the plant GLSs. Although GLSs can attract the natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) of these herbivores, enemies can reduce herbivore pressure to some extent only. So, plants can be overrun by specialists if GLS content is too high, whereas generalists can invade the plants if it is too low. Therefore, an optimal constitutive plant defense can minimize the overall herbivore pressure. To explain the optimal defense theoretically, we model the contrasting host selection behavior of insect herbivores and the emergence of their natural enemies by non-autonomous ordinary differential equations, where the independent variable is the plant GLS concentration. From the model, we quantify the optimal amount of GLSs, which minimizes total herbivore (specialists and generalists) pressure. That quite successfully explains the evolution of constitutive defense in plants from the perspective of optimality theory.
   Specialist herbivores are attracted by constitutive plant defense while generalists are deterred by such a defense. Therefore, there is an optimal level of plant defense chemicals. By a mathematical model, we determine that optimum.image

AB  - The high concentration of heavy metal in livestock manures is an increasing concern because it has the potential to pollute farmlands. Excessive mineral additives in feeds are the source of heavy metals in the manures. Recently, China has issued new regulations to restrict the use of high-dose mineral feeds. To reduce pollution and to increase the benefits to the industry, it is critical to understand the characteristics of heavy metals in feeds and to develop alternatives that are more efficient. This study analyzed 175 articles (1751 valid data) published in 2000-2020 in peer-reviewed journals. The analysis covered the characteristics of minerals in pig feeds in China, summarized the effects of different additives and discussed the relationships with feed standards. It was noted that Cu and Zn exceeded existing standards for pig feeds. Organic and new inorganic mineral supplements can effectively replace high-dose inorganic minerals to reduce incidents of diarrhea in piglets, improve growth performance and reduce pollution. With the recommended replacement, Zn and Cu in pig manure can be reduced respectively by 8.21x10(7)and 3.23x10(7) kg per year. It can also improve product quality and efficiency and increase income of breeding enterprises by USD 1.28x10(10)per year.

AB  - Seahorses (Hippocampus spp.; Family Syngnathidae) are mainly targeted by Traditional Chinese Medicine, curio and ornamental trade, as dried or live specimens. Traceability tools may help fill the gaps on supply chains, securing information on geographic origin and identification of traded specimens. Fin-clipping, a non-lethal and well-established method in seahorse research, offers a potential approach to trace the geographic origin and certify the aquaculture of these flagship species. As such, this study aimed to investigate the existence of differences in isotopic profiles of four seahorse species cultured at research centers located in southern Portugal and northern Spain, as well as between cultured Hippocampus guttulatus sourced from two research centers, and between wild and cultured specimens of this species. This research also evaluated the potential of combining isotopic and elemental fingerprints for seahorse species discrimination, through inductively continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IR-MS) and plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Species cultured at the same research centers exhibited similar stable isotope composition (delta 13C and delta 15N), except in the case of temperate H. guttulatus from northern Spain, which differed significantly from tropical species H. kuda and H. reidi. These differences could be due to phylogenetic dissimilarities and differences in seawater temperature. The delta 15N composition allowed to discriminate between cultured H. guttulatus from the two research centers and between cultured and wild specimens. While dorsal fin isotopes alone did not prove to be a reliable tool for the discrimination of different cultured species, combining them with elemental profiles from seahorses' whole-body allowed to successfully discriminate between H. kuda and H. reidi. This preliminary research demonstrates the potential of stable isotope and elemental analyses for tracing seahorses' geographic origin and species identification. However, further research should be performed to validate these findings for wild specimens, particularly those from illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fisheries and trade.

AB  - Lebanese mountain Baladi goats are endemic to Lebanon. However, few available genetic data on Baladi population is available. Information based on morphological and biochemical markers exists but yet remains imprecise. The aim of this study is to characterize the morphological and genetic traits of the Lebanese mountain Baladi population. The experiment was carried out in two different regions: Deir El Ahmar(1450m) and Boksmaya (400m). A total of 47 does, aging between 2-3 years, were studied; 9 quantitative traits and 5 qualitative traits were measured on each doe. The doe's genomic DNA was extracted and amplified by using PCR with a panel of 10 ISSR microsatellite markers along with collecting phenotypic data from each animal. The results revealed the presence of two main clusters both genetically and morphologically: CI and CII where most of CI animals produced a lower quantity of milk compared to CII. The mean value for all quantitative traits, except barrel length, showed a superior significant difference between groups (p <0.05). A positive correlation between the percentage of polymorphism, quantity of milk, ears and head color in both groups was observed. This attempt was to genetically characterize Lebanese Baladi population and to correlate its phenotype with its genotype.

AB  - The physics-based fission gas behaviour model available in the BISON fuel performance code provides satisfactory predictive capabilities for application to light-water reactor conditions. In this work, we present a model extension for application to fast reactor (U,Pu)O-2 fuel. In particular, we detail the introduction of a lower bound to the number density of grain-face bubbles, representing a limit to the coalescence process once extensive bubble interconnection is achieved. This new feature is tested first against an experimental database for UO2-LWR, and secondly is validated against integral irradiation experiments for fast reactor (U,Pu)O-2 fuel rods irradiated in the FFTF (Fast Flux Test Facility) and in the JOYO reactors. The comparisons of BISON results with the experimental data are satisfactory and demonstrate an improvement compared to the standard version of the code. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the global issue of organic waste, driven by expanding agricultural activities, focusing on managing sheep manure through composting. The experimental monitoring took place over seven months near Casablanca, Morocco. A specialized company produced the compost, using windrow composting with sporadic mechanical rotation. Temperature, moisture, pH, conductivity, organic carbon, nitrogen, and nitrates were monitored. During the thermophilic phase, compost windrows reached high temperatures, peaking at 73 degrees C. The resultant compost had a nearly neutral pH (7.02), moderate organic matter (26.19%), elevated nitrogen levels (1.961%), and an optimal carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (13.29). Maturity indicators, such as Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC = 67.03 meq/100 g) and the CEC-to-Organic Carbon ratio (CEC/OC = 1.95), suggested humification and maturity. Additionally, the compost contained essential macro- (calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium) and microelements (iron, copper, zinc, and manganese) that enhance soil quality and crop development. These findings offer significant potential for sustainable agriculture in Morocco, particularly for farmers seeking to enhance soil productivity and livestock rearing. The recommendations include exploring various compost application methods in agriculture and advocating for heap composting, especially in the cattle industry. In essence, this study demonstrates how efficient organic waste management can bolster agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability.

AB  - High relative humidity can increase the risk of heat stress in dairy cows, but its effects in humid continental climates are not well defined. This study evaluated how humidity levels influence dry matter intake, milk yield and composition, physiological response, blood hematology, metabolites, hormones, and heat shock protein gene expression in hair follicles. Sixteen multiparous early-lactating Holstein cows were assigned to four groups in a 2 x 2 factorial design with two temperatures (25 degrees C and 31 degrees C) and two humidity levels (50% (LRH) and 80% (HRH)). All cows were housed in climate-controlled chambers. Compared with LRH, HRH at both temperatures reduced dry matter intake, milk yield, milk fat, energy-corrected milk, and 3.5% fat-corrected milk. HRH also increased rectal temperature, heart rate, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, cortisol, and heat shock protein 90 in hair follicles. These results show that HRH, even at moderate temperature, affects dairy cow performance and alters physiological and metabolic functions. These findings emphasize the importance of precise management strategies to reduce the effects of humid heat stress on dairy performance. A comprehensive understanding of these responses is crucial for developing effective, sustainable solutions to ensure the viability of the dairy industry under increasing temperature and humidity.

AB  - Tunchang pig is one population of Hainan pig in the Hainan Province of China, with the characteristics of delicious meat, strong adaptability, and high resistance to diseases. To explore the genetic diversity and population structure of Tunchang pigs and uncover their germplasm characteristics, 10 unrelated Tunchang pigs were re-sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq 150 bp paired-end platform with an average depth of 10x. Sequencing data from 36 individuals of 7 other pig breeds (including 4 local Chinese pig breeds (5 Jinhua, 5 Meishan, 5 Rongchang, and 6 Wuzhishan), and 3 commonly used commercial pig breeds (5 Duorc, 5 Landrace, and 5 Large White)) were downloaded from the NCBI public database. After analysis of genetic diversity and population structure, it has been found that compared to commercial pigs, Tunchang pigs have higher genetic diversity and are genetically close to native Chinese breeds. Three methods, F-ST, ?p, and XP-EHH, were used to detect selection signals for three breeds of pigs: Tunchang, Duroc, and Landrace. A total of 2117 significantly selected regions and 201 candidate genes were screened. Gene enrichment analysis showed that candidate genes were mainly associated with good adaptability, disease resistance, and lipid metabolism traits. Finally, further screening was conducted to identify potential candidate genes related to phenotypic traits, including meat quality (SELENOV, CBR4, TNNT1, TNNT3, VPS13A, PLD3, SRFBP1, and SSPN), immune regulation (CD48, FBL, PTPRH, GNA14, LOX, SLAMF6, CALCOCO1, IRGC, and ZNF667), growth and development (SYT5, PRX, PPP1R12C, and SMG9), reproduction (LGALS13 and EPG5), vision (SLC9A8 and KCNV2), energy metabolism (ATP5G2), cell migration (EPS8L1), and olfaction (GRK3). In summary, our research results provide a genomic overview of the genetic variation, genetic diversity, and population structure of the Tunchang pig population, which will be valuable for breeding and conservation of Tunchang pigs in the future.

AB  - We report the occurrence of Blastocystis spp., Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Giardia duodenalis infections in Leizhou black goats in Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, China. The total prevalence rates of Blastocystis spp., E. bieneusi, and G. duodenalis were 33.63% (76/226), 17.7% (40/226), and 24.78% (56/226), respectively. Four Blastocystis spp. subtypes (ST5, ST10, ST14, and ST21), four E. bieneusi genotypes (CHG3, CM21, CHG1, and ET-L2) and two assemblages (A and E) of G. duodenalis were identified. The detection of zoonotic pathogen species, genotypes, and assemblages in Leizhou black goats implied their potential involvement in the transmission of zoonotic parasitic diseases.
   Blastocystis spp., Enterocytozoon bieneusi, and Giardia duodenalis are three common zoonotic intestinal parasites that cause severe diarrhea and enteric diseases. Leizhou black goats are characterized by a high reproductive rate, fast growth, and good meat quality, making them one of the pre-eminent goat breeds in China. Goats are reportedly common reservoirs of these three intestinal pathogens, but no information on their prevalence or genotypic distributions in black goats in Guangdong Province, China, is available. A total of 226 fecal samples were collected from goats in Zhanjiang city and genomic DNA was extracted from them. The presence of the three pathogens was detected using nested PCR targeting the sequences encoding SSU rRNA (Blastocystis spp.), the internal transcribed spacer of rRNA (ITS; E. bieneusi), as well as beta-giardin, glutamate dehydrogenase, and triosephosphate isomerase (G. duodenalis). All PCR products were sequenced to determine the species and genotypes of the organisms. The total prevalence rates of Blastocystis spp., E. bieneusi, and G. duodenalis were 33.63% (76/226), 17.70% (40/226), and 24.78% (56/226), respectively. Four subtypes of Blastocystis spp. were detected: ST5 (n = 6), ST10 (n = 50), ST14 (n = 14), and ST21 (n = 6). Among them, ST10 was the dominant genotype, accounting for 65.79% of strains, followed by the genotypes ST14 (18.42%), zoonotic ST5 (7.89%), and ST21 (7.89%). Four genotypes of E. bieneusi were detected: CHG3 (n = 32), CM21 (n = 4), CHG1 (n = 2), and ET-L2 (n = 2). Among these, CHG3 was the dominant genotype. Assemblage E (n = 54) and concurrent assemblages A and E (n = 2) were identified in the G. duodenalis-positive goats using multilocus genotyping. Blastocystis spp., E. bieneusi, and G. duodenalis infections were common in Leizhou black goats, all of which have zoonotic genotypes, indicating the potential risk of zoonotic transmission. Our results provide basic data for the prevention and control of these three intestinal pathogens. Further studies are required to better understand their genetic characteristics and zoonotic potential in Guangdong Province.

AB  - The invasive planthopper, spotted lanternfly (SLF), Lycorma delicatula (White) (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae), feeds on a broad range of plants including species of economic importance such as grape. Although SLF feeds on wild and cultivated grape, the effect of grapevines on the insect's life history traits is unknown. This study examined the effect of cultivated Concord grapevines (Vitis labrusca) and the insect's preferred host tree of heaven (TOH), Ailanthus altissima, on SLF development, survival, reproduction, and body mass. Newly emerged nymphs were allowed to feed on either TOH, Concord grapevines or a mixed diet of Concord grapevines plus TOH through adulthood until death. Development, mortality, and oviposition of paired adults were tracked daily to calculate the SLF rate of development, survival, and reproduction among treatments. When feeding exclusively on Concord grapevines, SLF was able to develop and reproduce but had higher mortality, slower development, and produced fewer eggs. SLF fed on the mixed diet of grapevines plus TOH exhibited faster nymphal development, laid more eggs, and had higher body mass compared with those fed only on grape or TOH. SLF had greater survival when fed on either the mixed diet or on TOH alone. We conclude that Concord grapevines are a poor-quality host for SLF, but when combined with TOH, SLF fitness increases above that of feeding on TOH alone. This study supports the elimination of TOH as a part of SLF vineyard management practices.

AB  - The requirement of carbon emission reduction promotes the continuous implementation and development of low carbon emission mode in typical high-carbon industry aquaculture, especially in the resourceful treatment of terminal waste. However, the previous studies usually focus on a single process or chain, the difference between the long-chain (LC) and automated integration (AI) in the overall environmental impact needs to be quantified and standardised. This paper intends to make a comparative study on two waste treatment biogas projects of aquaculture, a typical industry with high resource consumption and pollution emission in industry and agriculture, and a typical production mode case of aquaculture. The life cycle assessment method is adopted to analyse the environmental impact intensity, identify key link materials, and put forward targeted improvement and optimization schemes. The study found the LC system's comprehensive environmental impact (CEI) is smaller, which is 59.73% less than the AI system. Biogas slurry returning to the field can effectively avoid inorganic fertilizer input. The pretreatment and storage of feces are the key stages. The key substances are NH3 and nitrogen oxides. Suggestions were put forward to optimize the manure management process. In practical pig farms, the process of dry-cleaning manure pre-treatment, automatic fermentation gas production and final biogas slurry filtration drip irrigation should be promoted.

AB  - Excessive use of tetracycline antibiotics in poultry farming results in significant concentrations of these drugs and tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) in chicken manure, impacting both environmental and human health. Our research represents the first investigation into the removal dynamics of chlortetracycline (CTC) and TRGs in different layers of an ex situ fermentation system (EFS) for chicken waste treatment. By pinpointing and analyzing dominant TRGs-harboring bacteria and their interactions with environmental variables, we've closed an existing knowledge gap. Findings revealed that CTC's degradation half-lives spanned 3.3-5.8 days across different EFS layers, and TRG removal efficiency ranged between 86.82% and 99.52%. Network analysis highlighted Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria's essential roles in TRGs elimination, whereas Chloroflexi broadened the potential TRG hosts in the lower layer. Physical and chemical conditions within the EFS influenced microbial community diversity, subsequently impacting TRGs and integrons. Importantly, our study reports that the middle EFS layer exhibited superior performance in eliminating CTC and key TRGs (tetW, tetG, and tetX) as well as intI2. Our work transcends immediate health and environmental remediation by offering insights that encourage sustainable agriculture practices.

AB  - Multifunctional leguminous trees like Gliricidia sepium Jacq. (Steud.) and Leucaena leucocephala Lam. (de Wit) are ideal for sustainable agro-ecological farming systems. They are commonly used in alley cropping to provide a sustainable source of nitrogen to cultivated crops or in silvopastoral systems where the leaves are used as livestock feed. However, these plants produce fruits that are not widely used. This study evaluated the nutritive value of mature fruits from G. sepium and L. leucocephala plants to determine their potential as supplemental feedstuffs for ruminants. Mature fruits were collected from 15 plants of each species and evaluated for crude protein (CP), total digestible nutrients (TDN), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, non-fiber carbohydrates, total digestible nutrients, minerals, phytochemicals, in-vitro ruminal dry matter degradability (IVDMD) and 48-h (h) in-vitro ruminal organic matter digestibility (IVOMD). The concentration of CP (242 g/kg DM) was approximately 28% higher in G. sepium fruits. The TDN (552 g/kg DM), NDF (560.1 g/kg DM) and 48-h IVOMD (590 g/kg) were superior in L. leucocephala fruits. Similarly, L. leucocephala fruits had significantly higher minerals (i.e., calcium, magnesium, potassium, among others). However, G. sepium fruits had lower concentrations of soluble and insoluble condensed tannins and mimosine. The immediately degradable fraction (265.9 g/kg DM), potential degradability (621.6 g/kg DM), and effective degradability (438.9 g/kg DM) values were higher in L. leucocephala fruits. We concluded that mature fruits of G. sepium plant may be a better protein supplement for poor quality grass forages than L. leucocephala because of higher CP and lower phytochemicals contents.

AB  - The Hippoboscoidea are ectoparasitic flies that feed on the blood of birds and mammals with various degrees of host specificity. These flies are often poorly represented in museum collections and are overlooked in surveys of ectoparasites. These flies play a role in the transmission of a wide range of pathogens and endoparasites and are irritating to their hosts. I present records for 10 species of Hippoboscidae, 1 of Nycteribiidae, and 1 of Streblidae from Colorado and Wyoming based on museum records, some of which appear to be novel for these states.

AB  - The weevil Curculio chinensis Chevrolat (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is a major cause of economic losses to growers of Camellia oleifera in China, as females lay their eggs in developing fruits and the hatching larvae feed on their seed, aborting fruit growth. Olfactory cues play a key role in the host location of this weevil. The present study focused on identifying volatiles from different parts of the host plant Ca. oleifera, namely, the leaves, fruit peel, and seeds, and testing the antennal and behavioral responses of adult Cu. chinensis to those same volatiles. Methods relied on gas chromatography, electroantennograms, and Y-tube bioassays. The results included a total of twenty-five volatiles emitted by the three plant parts, among which eight elicited antennal responses in Cu. chinensis adults of both sexes. The behavioral bioassays indicated that 3-hexenal, trans-2-hexen-1-ol, methyl salicylate, geraniol, and phenethyl alcohol were attractive to Cu. chinensis, while trans-2-hexenal and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol were repellent. Tests with different concentrations indicated that the behavioral response could be dose-dependent. Future studies should focus on field tests with blends of the attractant compounds in order to develop novel, improved control methods for field applications.

AB  - The spatio-temporal delimitation of fish reproduction is essential for the appropriate management and conservation strategies in populations. Assessing this feature in Antarctic Ichthyology is particularly difficult because harsh environmental conditions limit sample collection. This study shows how physiology can contribute compelling evidence to understand reproduction in Antarctic fish using the notothenioid Lepidonotothen nudifrons as a model species. Sampling included 121 specimens caught at Potter Cove (PC), South Shetland Islands (SSI), from November to late March of 2016-2018. Gonadal macroscopic and histologic features are reported. Oocyte growth and change in testosterone and estradiol plasma levels throughout the ovarian growth of L. nudifrons adult females is provided. In March, females (n = 17) attained gonado-somatic index of 13-20% (16.73 +/- 4.20), total fecundity of 2196-4652 oocytes/female, the leading clutch oocytes measured 1.7-2.1 mm, and males (n = 5) showed spermatozoids in their testicles. The leading clutch growth was significantly associated with photoperiod, with no diameter variation until the summer solstice, when it began to grow linearly with an estimated rate of 0.01 mm/day. Testosterone and estradiol increased together with the oocyte growing throughout the analysed months, with a higher rate of increase during March. The reproductive effort data, and especially the significant plasma level increase in both sex steroids observed in March, suggest that (1) females were at a late vitellogenesis stage, just prior to the oocyte final maturation, and thus L. nudifrons spawning period might begin in March at SSI; (2) PC is likely a spawning site for L. nudifrons, which indicates that nearshore areas are spawning grounds for some notothenioids.

AB  - Gray blight disease occurs widely in major tea-producing areas and harms the leaves of tea trees, which affects the quality and yield of processed tea. According to an analysis of previous sequencing data, miR319a may be important in the resistance of tea plants to gray blight disease. In this study, based on 5 ' RLM-RACE, qRT-PCR, sODN, CIN and transient transformation experiments in tobacco, CsTCP10 and CsTCP4 were found to be cleaved by miR319a. qRT-PCR and northern blotting also revealed that the expression pattern of CsTCP10 in tea leaves was opposite to that of miR319a, while that of CsTCP4 displayed no similar change. Furthermore, a large amount of reactive oxygen species was found to accumulate in tea leaves in the antisense oligodeoxynucleotide experiment, while the expression of CsTCP10 was inhibited. These results suggest that CsTCP10 is a positive regulator of the resistance of tea plants to gray blight disease. Compared with the wild-type, the expression of AtTCP10 in transgenic Arabidopsis plants was downregulated. After infection with the pathogen, the transgenic plants were more severely damaged. Our results suggest that miR319a facilitates Pestalotiopsis infection by suppressing the expression of CsTCP10 in tea plants.

AB  - Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) have negative environmental impacts as they accumulate in the soil after pig manure is spread. Cu and Zn are essential elements in pig nutrition but due to their low retention rate, more than 90% of ingested Cu and Zn are excreted. A better understanding of the behaviour of these elements throughout the animal-manure-soil continuum according to feed composition and manure management chain is thus required to propose alternative ways to reduce these environmental impacts. The aim of this study was to determine the fate of Cu and Zn throughout this continuum by studying the effect of Cu and Zn contents in animal feed and in the manure management chain based on anaerobic digestion and composting. Faeces were collected from 24 finishing pigs fed with 4 different Cu and Zn dietary levels and sources of supplementation. Samples of faeces were exposed to mesophilic anaerobic digestion or to 5-week composting with straw. Concentrations of Cu and Zn in the faeces were highly dependent on dietary supplies and ranged from 38 to 188 mg Cu/kg DM and from 191 to 728 mg Zn/kg DM. Degradation of a significant fraction of organic matter during treatment led to a significant increase in Cu and Zn concentration relative to the product's dry matter (DM) content, which. Cu and Zn concentrations relative to DM content were twice as high after treatment whatever the content and the form of Cu and Zn dietary supplementation. Otherwise, effluent treatment tended to reduce the possible availability of Cu and Zn in final organic products according to water-extractible contents. This study clearly shows that feed management is the main lever for reducing the amount of Cu and Zn amount in pig effluents and hence in the soil. Appropriate treatment could also facilitate the supply of organic fertilisers to areas with soil deficiency, but feed strategies need to be adapted to the treatment chain to enable the production of good quality organic products that respect EU regulations.

AB  - The importance of fish species in ichthyocenes of the benthic zone (up to a depth of 2000 m) in the Russian part of the Far Eastern seas and adjacent waters of the Northwest Pacific is discussed for the first time. The study is based on the data of bottom trawl surveys conducted by the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO) in 1977-2010. The inverse Simpson's index (or polydominance index) is selected as a measure of dominance; the Sorensen-Czekanowski similarity index is used for comparative analysis of the dominance structure in ichthyocenes of the regions. The analysis of the importance of species in the ichthyocene species structure is carried out for the top 20 species ranked by biomass. These species constitute a substantial portion of the biomass of all demersal fishes in all the regions: an average of 94.9% for the shelf and 95.8% for the continental slope. A conclusion is made that the ichthyocenes of bottom and near-bottom biotopes (0-2000 m) in Russian waters of the Far Eastern Seas are represented by communities with poor evenness in species abundance and a pronounced dominance of two to four species. The importance of species in the ichthyocene structure is as follows: walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) dominates all the regions; the subdominants are Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and Okhotsk atka mackerel (P. azonus), depending on the region. The ubiquitous dominance of walleye pollock is broken on the continental slope of the Bering Sea dominated by the giant grenadier (Albatrossia pectoralis); the group of subdominants on the continental slope of all regions is comprised of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides matsuurae), popeye grenadier (Coryphaenoides cinereus), Pacific herring, Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus), scale-eye plaice (Acanthopsetta nadeshnyi), and blackfin founder (Glyptocephalus stelleri). The graphs of similarity between the study regions (Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Sea of Japan, and Pacific waters off Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands) in species composition and dominant species structure of ichthyocenes are composed separately for the shelf and continental slope using summarized data.

AB  - Simple Summary Faba beans could be a valuable raw material in pigs' diets, but the presence of anti-nutritional factors limits their wide use. The aim of the study was to investigate how the extrusion of faba bean seeds and/or the addition of protease to pigs' diets affected the animals' growth parameters, digestibility of nutrients, selected physiological parameters of the digestive tract, and biochemical blood parameters. Our research showed that extrusion increased the nutritional value of faba bean seeds, especially by reducing antinutritional factors, but in comparison with raw seeds, it did not improve the pigs' growth performance, digestibility of nutrients, intestinal structure, and physiology when the content of faba beans in the diet was below 10%. Thanks to protease supplementation in our study, protein and oil levels in the diet were reduced while maintaining the same pigs' performance, which cut the cost of feeding. The extrusion and enzyme additives did not improve the pigs' growth performance in this experiment, but protease appears to be highly promising in the commercial nutrition of pigs. The aim of the study was to investigate how the extrusion of faba bean seeds (var. Albus) and/or the addition of protease to pigs' diets affected the animals' growth parameters, digestibility of nutrients, selected physiological parameters of the digestive tract, and biochemical blood parameters. A 28-day experiment was conducted on 32 pigs weighing 9 +/- 0.2 kg. The animals were allocated to four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with the main effects of extrusion (raw or extruded) and effects of protease supplementation (0 and 0.05%). Extrusion reduced the levels of neutral detergent fibre, trypsin inhibitor, phytate-P, and resistant starch but did not improve the digestibility of protein and dry matter in faba bean seeds. The pigs' growth performance, ileal digestibility, enzyme activity, and morphometric parameters of the ileum were not significantly affected by extrusion, except for a higher feed intake between the 15th and 28th day of the experiment. The protease supplementation gave comparable results as the diet without protease, except the feed conversion ratio (in the periods of 15-28th day and 0-28th day), which was higher than in the groups without protease. The extrusion and protease increased acetate and acetoacetate contents in the cecal digesta, but propionate, butyrate, and isovalerate concentrations in the digesta of the pigs in this group were lower. Thanks to protease supplementation, protein and oil levels in the diet were reduced, which cut the cost of feed mixtures. The extrusion and protease additive combined together did not improve the pigs' growth performance in this experiment.

AB  - Galaxaura divaricata is a partially calcified macroalga that hampers coral recruitment, growth, and recovery via the excretion of allelopathic secondary metabolites. Herbivorous fishes are not major consumers of Galaxaura spp. and there is a need to understand feeding preferences for Galaxaura divaricata in other macroherbivores, like sea urchins and green sea turtles that could act as potential controlling agents. Under certain environmental conditions, G. divaricata can proliferate and overgrow degraded reefs for several years, as documented for several coral patch reefs in the lagoon of Dongsha Atoll, South China Sea. This study aimed to experimentally test the feeding preferences of five species of sea urchin and two individual green sea turtles, Chelonia mydas, for G. divaricata. Specifically, we quantified and compared the consumption rates of the allelopathic G. divaricata with Gracilaria edulis, a nonallelopathic, fleshy red alga, known to be highly favored by herbivores. Results showed that the five urchin species fed on both G. edulis and G. divaricata. However, urchins consumed 2-8 times less wet weight of G. divaricata (range 0.3-3.1 g urchin(-1) 24 h(-1)) compared to G. edulis (range 0.6-18 g urchin-1 24 h(-1)), suggesting that urchin grazing may exert some control on G. divaricata abundance but is likely ineffective for a large-scale removal of the alga. Further, both green sea turtles avoided G. divaricata and selectively fed on G. edulis. More experiments are needed to test the potential role of herbivores in controlling the overgrowth of coral competitive and allelopathic macroalgae, like Galaxaura on coral reefs.

AB  - To persist in seasonal environments, animals track, exploit, and store energy when food is plentiful. Seasonal changes in plant phenology that are predictable allow animals to track abundant food resources. However, little is known about how animals use and benefit from ephemeral and unpredictable food pulses during times when food is scarce. Climate change is altering the timing, abundance, and spatial distribution of food releases, emphasizing the ongoing need for understanding how unseasonal weather conditions influence access to food. Using 12 years of GPS-location data and annual measures of body mass in 72 adult female Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), we tested whether individuals with greater use of nutritionally beneficial resource pulses in autumn and early winter are heavier going into parturition in spring. Additionally, we evaluated how stochastic weather conditions influence the use of food resources. Reindeer that foraged most in marshes during autumn and early winter gained a positive carryover effect of up to 5 kg heavier body mass in late winter, with previously demonstrated benefits to both survival and reproduction. Marsh use was rare, brief, and intense, which is the expected response to a pulsed resource. The extent to which marshes were used varied greatly among years and was associated with stochastic mild spells that relaxed constraints of snow depth for a few days. Compared with other habitats used, marshes offered superior quantity and quality of belowground plant biomass that may be accessed more easily under milder autumn and winter conditions. Our findings demonstrate the individual benefits of exploiting stochastic food pulses and showcase how resource tracking during periods of food scarcity may be a behavioral trait that could enhance population resilience in a rapidly warming climate.

AB  - B vitamins improve animal performance through promote a wide range of metabolic pathways in animals as cofactors. Therefore, the impact of B-complex vitamin injection on performance, metabolic diseases, hematological parameters, and antioxidant status in pregnant Sannen goats and their newborn kids during the transition period was investigated. The pregnant goats (3 years old) were randomly divided into two groups: control (No B complex vitamins injection) and B complex vitamins (5 ml B complex vitamins injection per animal). B complex vitamins were injected twice intramuscularly into goats, according to the manufacturer's recommendation, during five- and three-weeks prior kidding. To determine the dry matter intake, feed samples were prepared. Also, metabolic diseases in goats and their offspring were recorded during the study. Blood samples of goats and newborn kids were taken seven days after parturition and measured for B vitamins concentrations, as well as hematological and antioxidant parameters. According to the results, the performance (body weight and dry matter intake) of goats and kids improved in B-complex vitamins group compared to the control group (P < 0.05). In addition, metabolic diseases were reduced in the goats and their offspring treated with B complex vitamins compared to the control group during the transition period (P < 0.05). The levels of cobalamin, pyridoxine, thiamine, folic acid, nicotinic, pantothenic, and unconjugated pteridine increased in the plasma of goats and their children by maternal B complex injection than in the control group during the transition period (P < 0.05). Higher (P < 0.05) levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, total antioxidant status, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase in goats' plasma, as well as red blood cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase in kids' plasma treated with B complex vitamins than the control group, were observed (P < 0.05). These results suggest that maternal Bcomplex vitamin injection is required for the improvement of performance, hematological status, and antioxidant status in pregnant goats and their kids.

AB  - Reliable and cost-effective monitoring tools to track population size over time are of key importance for wildlife management and conservation. Deterministic cohort analysis may be used to this aim, especially in hunted populations, but it requires that all mortality events are recorded and that individual age at death is known exactly. In this study, we investigated the reliability of cohort analysis as a relative index to track over-time variation in red deer (Cervus elaphus) abundance, in the absence of exact information about natural mortality and age. Visual tooth inspection was used to age 18,390 individuals found dead or hunted between 1982 and 2020 within the Trentino sector of the Stelvio National Park and the Val di Sole hunting district (Central Italian Alps). Temporal trend of reconstructed population size was checked using spring spotlight counts as a benchmark, through the Buishand range test and a linear model. Our results showed a significant and positive relationship between reconstructed population size and spring spotlight counts between 1982 and 2013, suggesting that cohort analysis could reliably track red deer population trend up to 7 years in the past. With a relative error of + 1.1 (SD = 1.5) years in the estimation of age, and fairly stable hunting pressure, our results support the use of deterministic cohort analysis as a relative index of abundance for monitoring red deer over time, even in the absence of exact information about natural mortality. Under violation of assumptions, however, the performance of deterministic reconstruction should be carefully inspected at the management scale.

AB  - It is well accepted that the complexity of functional systems may mitigate performance trade-offs. However, data supporting this theory are hard to find because they need to be based on a functional system with different complexity levels in closely related species. The Pomacentridae (damselfishes) provide an excellent opportunity to test this hypothesis because most of the species have two mouth-closing systems: the first using the adductor mandibulae, as in all teleost fishes, and the second relying on the ceratomandibular (cmd) ligament, a synapomorphic trait of the family. Interestingly, some pomacentrids have secondarily lost the cmd ligament during evolution and therefore have a less complex mouth-closing system. Using dissection, kinematic analysis, and mathematical modeling, we demonstrated that the possession of two mouth-closing systems enabled grazing damselfishes to have a forceful and extremely fast bite. This combination challenges a major functional trade-off in fish jaw dynamics, as systems better suited for force transmission are usually less suited for speed transmission, and vice versa. The combination of grazing behavior, small and robust lower jaws (conferring high biting force), and an ultrafast bite is unusual within actinopterygians. These attributes and their associated performance seem to be required conditions to colonize the ecological niche of farming, that is, the maintenance of small filamentous algae crops serving as both food and storage.

AB  - The Wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) is a widespread mammalian species that acts as a reservoir host for multiple infections, including zoonotic diseases. Exposure to immunotoxins, like for instance trace metals, may reduce the ability of the host to mount proper responses to pathogens, potentially increasing the transmission and prevalence of infections. Antibody-mediated responses are crucial in preventing and limiting infections, and the quantification of the primary antibody response is considered a sensitive predictor of immunosuppression. The current study aims to investigate effects of cadmium exposure on the antibody-mediated responses of wood mice inhabiting polluted and non-polluted areas in the Netherlands. Wood mice were captured alive at different locations and immunized to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) to induce a primary antibody response. SRBC-specific antibody-producing cells, or plaque forming cells (PFC), were quantified and related to kidney cadmium levels. Differential circulating main leukocyte populations were also characterised. Cadmium concentrations in mice kidneys differed between mice captured at different locations, and increased with individual body mass, likely associated with age-related time of exposure. Effect of cadmium was apparent on the percentages of B cell counts in blood. Because of potential natural immune heterogeneity between wild rodent populations, mice immune responses were analysed and compared grouped by captured locations. Capture location had significant effect on the total counts of white blood cells. Increasing cadmium exposure in wood mice captured from polluted sites was associated with a decrease of splenic PFC counts. This field research shows that wood mice antibody responses can be impaired by cadmium exposure, even at low environmental levels, by affecting B cell functioning mainly. Impaired B cell function can make exposed mice more susceptible to infections, potentially increasing the reservoir function of their populations. It also shows that immunomodulatory effects in the field should be assessed site specifically.

AB  - Heavy metals have the potential to influence the transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). However, the effect on AMR caused by heavy metals has not been clearly revealed. In this study, we used a microcosm experiment and metagenomics to examine whether common levels of Cu and Zn in pig manure influence AMR transmission in manured soil. We found that the abundance of 204 ARGs significantly increased after manure application, even though the manure did not contain antibiotic residuals. However, the combined addition of low Cu and Zn (500 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively) only caused 14 ARGs to significantly increase, and high Cu and Zn (1000 and 3000 mg/kg, respectively) caused 27 ARGs to significantly increase. The disparity of these numbers suggested that factors within the manure were the primary driving reasons for AMR transmission, rather than metal amendments. A similar trend was found for biocide and metal resistance genes (BMRGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). This study offers deeper insights into AMR transmission in relation to the effects of manure application and heavy metals at commonly reported levels. Our findings recommend that more comprehensive measures in controlling AMR in the pig industry are needed apart from restricting heavy metal additions.

AB  - Neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of a circuitry. A striking example of diverse structure and function is presented by the afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Presynaptic active zones at the pillar IHC side activate at lower IHC potentials than those of the modiolar side that have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels. The postsynaptic SGNs differ in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges. While a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity seems likely, experimental evidence linking synaptic and SGN physiology has remained difficult to obtain. Here, we aimed at bridging this gap by ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic those of in vivo SGN characterization. Synapses with high spontaneous rate of release (SR) were found predominantly on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. This study indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

AB  - The elephant ivory trade remains controversial because of concerns about the extinction risk of elephants and the different needs of CITES member states. Thailand's situation is particularly contentious because of the different legal status among types of elephant ivory. Thai law allows the local sale of ivory from domesticated Asian elephants, which creates challenges for Thai enforcement officers in identification of ivory provenance. We investigated the capacity of non-destructive Near Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (600-1700 nm), combined with Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), to discriminate between ivory from African, wild Asian and domesticated Asian elephants. Ivory spectra of 64 elephants were divided randomly into calibration and validation datasets. We were able to determine elephant ivory provenance at both the interspecies (African and Asian elephant ivory), and within species (wild and domesticated Asian elephant ivory) classifications with 100% accuracy. These results showed the potential use of handheld NIR spectrometers for rapid assessments of ivory provenance, as well as a forensic tool for wider enforcement.

AB  - Bait-based remote underwater video (BRUV) systems are effective devices for remotely observing fish and other marine organisms in challenging environments. The development of a long duration (24 h) surface BRUV observation surveys allowed the monitoring of scarce and elusive pelagic sharks and the direct impact on non-targeted species of longline fishing in the Western Mediterranean. Technological limitations, such as the limited storage capacity and a single surface camera, were improved by (i) adding a deep camera equipped with light (below 80 m depth) and (ii) replacing Gopros with a multi-camera video surveillance system (surface and depth) with a storage capacity of several days and access to real-time observation. Based on a deployment effort of 1884 h video data, we identified 11 blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and one bluntnose sixgill shark (Hexanchus griseus), a deep-sea species that scarcely swims at the surface. The real-time observation capability was a powerful tool for reducing logistical costs and for raising environmental awareness in educational and outreach programmes.

AB  - This study was performed to determine the blood reference values of hematological and biochemical parameters in Hair goats at different ages. For this aim, clinically healthy Hair goats (n = 180, ages of six month and 1-3 years male and female) were used to collect blood samples. In whole blood, white blood cell (WBC), red blood cell (RBC), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)and red cell distribution width (RDW) were evaluated. The levels of, albumin, total protein, globulin, glucose, total bilirubin, urea, creatinine, phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), creatine kinase (CK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and iron levels were investigated in sera. Age and sex had no effect on the cell structures of blood. In the either sex (male or female), age had no effect. However, sex had a significant effect on the blood cell structures except for WBC, HGB, and HCT. Albumin, protein, calcium, AST, ALT, ALP and magnesium values were not different among groups. Both the age and sex of the goats had significant effects on blood levels of glucose, phosphorus, urea, cholesterol, creatinine, GGT, CK and total bilirubin. In conclusion, this was the first study reporting the hematologic and biochemical parameters in blood of the Hair goats. The results indicated that these parameters could show variations under physiological conditions due to age and gender. (c) 2022 Urmia University. All rights reserved.

AB  - To assess the ecological risk of microplastics (MPs) in agricultural systems, it is critical to simultaneously focus on MP-mediated single-organism response and different trophic-level organism interaction. Herein, we placed earthworms in soils contaminated with different concentrations (0.02% and 0.2% w/w) of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) MPs to investigate the effect of earthworms on tomato against Helicoverpa armigera (H. armigera) under MPs stress. We found that earthworms alleviated the inhibitory effects of MPs stress on tomato growth and disrupted H. armigera growth. Compared to individual MPs exposure, earthworm incorporation significantly increased the silicon and lignin content in herbivore-damaged tomato leaves by 19.1% and 57.6%, respectively. Metabolites involved in chemical defense (chlorogenic acid) and phytohormones (jasmonic acid) were also activated by earthworm incorporation. Furthermore, earthworms effectively reduced oxidative damage induced by H. armigera via promoting antioxidant metabolism. Overall, our results suggest that utilizing earthworms to regulate above- and below-ground interactions could be a promising strategy for promoting green agriculture.

AB  - Simple Summary The identification of an efficient feeding system for sheep that determines, in the short period of lactation, an increase in the quantity and quality of milk represents a concern at the level of microfarms. The Turcana breed of sheep is a mixed breed, where the milk production is low compared to the specialized breeds for milk production. At the level of Romania, there is an absence of concrete studies regarding the feeding system and analysis of the quality of sheep's milk. The purpose of our study was to monitor the effect of the administration of a fodder complex prepared in a microfarm to determine the increase in milk production and quality. The milk was analyzed on the basis of physical-biological parameters, the content of trace elements and heavy metals, and microbiological parameters. The values of the physicochemical parameters analyzed in the milk from the sheep with additional feed indicated an improvement in the quality of the milk, and the values of the microbiological parameters indicated a good state of health of the sheep. On the basis of the analysis of the content of heavy metals in milk, it was established that there are no sources of pollution in the grazing area.Abstract Milk and dairy products are among the foods preferred by consumers, as they are rich in nutrients, have high biological values, are easily accessible, and present a low risk to health. This study aimed to comparatively analyze the milk from sheep of the Turcana breed that were subjected to different feeding systems. The milk from the sheep was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively; in this sense, the following were determined: daily milk production (DMY), physical parameters (pH, freezing point), chemical composition (lactose (L), fats (F), total proteins (TP), non-fat solids (Snf)), the content of heavy metals and trace elements (Zn, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb), and microbiological parameters (the number of somatic cells (SCC), the total number of aerobic mesophilic germs that develop at 30 & DEG;C (NTG), the number of coliform bacteria (CT), the number of Staphylococcus aureus). Administration of the fodder complex produced, on the farm determined a slight quantitative increase in milk production, as well as in fat, protein and lactose content. The content of trace elements Zn, Fe, and Mn registered increases in milk samples from sheep that were administered the fodder complex. The content of heavy metals did not indicate any source of pollution in the grazing area. Furthermore, the microbiological parameters were within the allowed limits, indicating a good general state of health at the emergency level and the absence of microbiological contamination of the milk samples.

AB  - Past & imath;rma is a traditional dry-cured meat product made from whole pieces of cattle or water buffalo carcasses. Sixteen or more types of past & imath;rma can be produced from different parts of the carcass. This study investigated the effect of low salt processing (3% NaCl) on the lipolytic enzyme activity, volatile profile, color, lipid oxidation, and microbiological properties of commonly produced types of past & imath;rma (ku & scedil;g & ouml;m & uuml;, s & imath;rt, boh & ccedil;a, and & scedil;ekerpare). In the study, 5% NaCl level was used as the control group. For all past & imath;rma types, the pH changed between 5.5 and 6.0. The aw value was less than 0.90 for the past & imath;rma types. The L* value increased when the salt level decreased from 5% to 3% (p < 0.05); however, the salt level did not affect the a* and b* values (p > 0.05). Reducing the salt level increased the neutral lipase activity and decreased the TBARS. As the salt level increased, the acid lipase activity increased in the boh & ccedil;a past & imath;rma, and the phospholipase activity increased in the ku & scedil;g & ouml;m & uuml; and s & imath;rt past & imath;rma (p < 0.05). Furthermore, while Micrococcus/Staphylococcus constituted the dominant microbiota in past & imath;rma types, a 5% salt level led to a decrease in the number of lactic acid bacteria. The volatile compounds were more affected by salt level than by past & imath;rma type. The correlation analysis showed that there are some differences between 3% and 5% salt levels and the use of a 3% salt level increases the abundance of the compounds. The correlation analysis also revealed that there are differences between the past & imath;rma types in terms of the volatile compounds and that ku & scedil;g & ouml;m & uuml; past & imath;rma differs from other past & imath;rma types.

AB  - Scavenging dynamics are influenced by many abiotic and biotic factors, but there is little knowledge of how scavengers respond to extreme weather events. As carrion is a major driver of the organisation and structure of food webs within ecological communities, understanding the response of scavengers to extreme weather events is critical in a world that is increasingly subject to climate change. In this study, vertebrate scavenging and carcass persistence rates were quantified in the Simpson Desert of central Australia; a system that experiences major fluctuations and extremes in weather conditions. Specifically, a total of 80 adult red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) carcasses were placed on the landscape and monitored using remote sensor cameras. This included 40 carcasses monitored before and then 40 carcasses monitored after a major flooding event. The carcasses were monitored equally before and after the flood across different seasons (warm and cool) and in dune and interdune habitats. Overall, a total of 8124 scavenging events for 97,976 visitation minutes were recorded for 11 vertebrate species within 30 days of carcass placement pre- and post-flood. Vertebrate scavenging increased post-flood in the warm season, especially by corvids which quadrupled their scavenging events during this time. There was little difference in carcass persistence between habitats, but carcasses persisted 5.3-fold longer post-flood in warm seasons despite increased vertebrate scavenging. The results demonstrate that a flood event can influence scavenging dynamics and suggest a need to further understand how seasons, habitats and extreme weather events can drive changes in carrion-based food webs.

AB  - There is an increased interest for using insects, such as the black soldier fly, to treat surplus manure and upcycle nutrients into the food system. Understanding the influence that BSFL have on nutrient flows and nutrient losses during manure bioconversion is key for sustainability assessments. Here we quantified and compared nutrient balances, nutrient levels in residual materials and emissions of greenhouse gases and ammonia between manure incubated with black soldier fly larvae (BSFL) and manure without BSFL, during a 9-day experimental period. We obtained high analytical recoveries, ranging between 95 and 103%. We found that of the pig manure supplied, 12.5% of dry matter (DM), 13% of carbon, 25% of nitrogen, 14% of energy, 8.5% of phosphorus and 9% of potassium was stored in BSFL body mass. When BSFL were present, more carbon dioxide (247 vs 148 g/kg of DM manure) and ammonia-nitrogen (7 vs 4.5 g/kg of DM manure) emitted than when larvae were absent. Methane, which was the main contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, was produced at the same levels (1.3 vs 1.1 g/kg of DM manure) in both treatments, indicating the main role that manure microbial methane emissions play. Nitrous oxide was negligible in both treatments. The uptake of nutrients by the larvae and the higher carbon dioxide and ammonia emissions modified the nutrient composition of the residual material substantially relative to the fresh manure. Our study provides a reliable basis to quantify the environmental impact of using BSFL in future life cycle assessments. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tunicamycin induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in mammalian cells. Our study aimed to investigate the effect of tunicamycin on the motility and viability of sperm, reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation in boar sperm. We treated 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, and 10 mu M of tunicamycin in boar semen, and experimental treatments were performed. The viability (55.44%, 53.20, and 40.00%, p < 0.05) and motility (73.28%, 71.48%, and 54.48%, p < 0.05) of sperm at 2.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mu M were decreased by tunicamycin, and the levels of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation in tunicamycin-treated boar semen were increased (p < 0.05). However, the nitric oxide level was not changed by tunicamycin. Based on the results, we indicated that tunicamycin induces cell death by increasing oxidative stress in boar sperm, which may be the cause of decreased sperm viability and motility. Thus, we suggest that tunicamycin may induce cell death due to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation.

AB  - The environmental impacts associated with the intensification of agricultural practices have become an emerging issue, and new techniques are being developed to satisfy public demands. The application of fertilizers is a crucial step for agriculture practices. Building upon previous studies at a Mediterranean basin, the objective of the research presented herein was to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions associated with four different types of fertilization in the production of corn: traditional (NPK 8-15-15 and urea), controlled-release (NPK 8-15-15, and a combination of urea and encapsulated urea), and two types of fertilization with pig slurry (NPK 8-15-15, pig slurry and different amounts of urea). The Life Cycle Assessment methodology was employed, with the Ecoinvent database and the IPCC 2013 GWP 100y impact assessment method. The results revealed that traditional fertilization emitted 3251 kg CO2-eq/ha center dot year, against 2191 kg CO2-eq/ha center dot year for controlled-release fertilization. Pig slurry fertilization emitted 2160 kg CO2-eq/ha center dot year, and its alternative with less urea, only 1030 kg CO2-eq/ha center dot year. The utilization of pig slurry solves the issue of its disposal and entails lower costs (commercial fertilizer prices follow the prices of oil and gas). The results demonstrated the potential of controlled-release fertilization and pig slurry to contribute to climate change mitigation.

AB  - Native to South Africa, fireweed (Senecio madagascariensis Poiret; Asteraceae) is an annual or short-lived perennial herb that is highly invasive in Australia, where it is a target for biological control. Preliminary research indicates that fireweed may be undergoing adaptive changes along its invasion gradient in Australia. Changes, such as a shift in plant chemical defence, may influence fireweed's interaction with specialist insect herbivores, and hence the efficacy of a biocontrol program. As the testing of biocontrol candidates is a rigorous and lengthy process, confirmation of fireweed's susceptibility to insect attack may assist in fast tracking candidate suitability, where changes in plant defensive chemistry are found. In a large experimental field study in fireweed's native range, we compared the susceptibility of Australian and South African populations to insect natural enemy attack (in terms of plant biomass, insect richness and composition). Simultaneously, we assessed the variation in plant pyrrolizidine alkaloid concentrations and composition to rationalise any differences in natural enemy attack between populations. We found no significant differences in plant biomass across fireweed populations, despite significantly higher alkaloid concentrations in Australian populations. The composition of the endophagous (specialist) insect herbivore assemblage was related to alkaloid composition, but there were only minor differences in the assemblage between Australian and South African fireweed populations. Moreover, we found no significant differences in the abundance, richness or Shannon diversity indices of endophagous or ectophagous (generalist) insect herbivores between Australian and South African fireweed populations. Our results suggest that despite variations in chemical defence, Australian fireweed populations displayed neither reduced nor increased susceptibility to specialist insect herbivore attack, supporting the notion that if host-specific biocontrol agents are released, their impact in Australia is unlikely to be influenced by any changes in plant chemical defence.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that the adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) gene is significantly upregulated in the subcutaneous inguinal adipose tissue of cold-resistant Tibetan pigs compared to cold-sensitive Landrace pigs under long-term cold exposure. Adiponectin interacts with its receptors on adipocyte membranes, initiating a signaling cascade that promotes thermogenesis. However, the specific role of AdipoR2 in thermogenesis within Tibetan pig adipocytes remains unclear. This study investigates the effects of AdipoR2 overexpression on glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as thermogenesis, in Tibetan pig adipocytes. Subcutaneous inguinal fat tissue was collected from 2-week-old Tibetan piglets, and preadipocytes were isolated through enzymatic digestion. The pcDNA3.1-AdipoR2 overexpression plasmid was transfected into these cells, and transfection efficiency was assessed using RT-qPCR, along with the expression of genes related to glucose and lipid metabolism. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the CCK8 assay, while Western blot (WB) was employed to detect the phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC. Adipogenic differentiation capacity was assessed via Oil Red O staining, mitochondrial membrane potential was measured using JC-1 staining, and ATP production was quantified using ATP generation reagents. The results demonstrate that AdipoR2 overexpression activates the AMPK-ACC signaling pathway, leading to increased expression of glycolysis and lipolysis genes, concomitant with reduced adipogenic differentiation ability, enhanced mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis, and elevated thermogenesis in Tibetan pig preadipocytes. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for further exploration of the role of AdipoR2 in thermogenesis and its potential applications in improving cold adaptation in Tibetan pigs.

AB  - Artificial and natural selective breeding of goats has resulted in many different goat breeds all around the world. Norduz goat is one of these breeds, and it is a local goat breed of Turkey. The goats are favorable due to pre-weaning viability and reproduction values compared to the regional breeds. Development in sequencing technologies has let to understand huge genomic structures and complex phenotypes. Until now, such a comprehensive study has not been carried out to understand the genomic structure of the Norduz goats, yet. In the study, the next-generation sequencing was carried out to understand the genomic structure of Norduz goat. Real-time PCR was used to evaluate prominent CNVs in the Norduz goat individuals. Whole genome of the goat was constructed with an average of 33.1X coverage level. In the stringent filtering condition, 9,757,980 SNPs, 1,536,715 InDels, and 290 CNVs were detected in the Norduz goat genome. Functional analysis of high-impact SNP variations showed that the classical complement activation biological process was affected significantly in the goat. CNVs in the goat genome were found in genes related to defense against viruses, immune response, and cell membrane transporters. It was shown that GBP2, GBP5, and mammalian ortholog GBP1, which are INF-stimulated GTPases, were found to be high copy numbers in the goats. To conclude, genetic variations mainly in immunological response processes suggest that Norduz goat is an immunologically improved goat breed and natural selection could take an important role in the genetical improvements of the goats.

AB  - In goats, embryo oocyte competence is affected by follicle size regardless the age of the females. In previous studies we have found differences in blastocyst development between oocytes coming of small (<3 mm) and large follicles (>3 mm) in prepubertal (1-2 months-old) goats. Oocyte competence and Follicular Fluid (FF) composition changes throughout follicle growth. The aim of this study was to analyze Fatty Acids (FAs) composition and metabolomic profiles of FF recovered from small and large follicles of prepubertal goats and follicles of adult goats. FAs were analyzed by chromatography and metabolites by 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) Spectrometry. The results showed important differences between adult and prepubertal follicles: (a) the presence of alpha,beta-glucose in adult and no detection in prepubertal; (b) lactate, -N-(CH3)3 groups and inositol were higher in prepubertal (c) the percentage of Linolenic Acid, Total Saturated Fatty Acids and n-3 PUFAs were higher in adults; and (d) the percentage of Linoleic Acid, total MUFAs, PUFAs, n-6 PUFAs and n-6 PUFAs: n-3 PUFAs ratio were higher in prepubertal goats. Not significant differences were found in follicle size of prepubertal goats, despite the differences in oocyte competence for in vitro embryo production.

However, how the biomechanical function of Si, deposited as amorphous silica, differs from cell wall components remains untested. Here, we tested the hypothesis that species with higher leaf Si concentrations have stiffer but more brittle leaf lamina.
   center dot We measured the mechanical properties, including modulus of elasticity (E), tensile strength (sigma(max)), and maximum strain (epsilon(max)), tissue density, and the concentrations of Si and cell wall components for 33 deciduous broad-leaved woody species.
   center dot Multiple regression results showed that tissue density, Si concentration, and cellulose concentration contributed positively to E and negatively to epsilon(max). By contrast, tissue density and cellulose concentration, but not Si concentration, contributed to sigma(max). No significant contribution of lignin concentration to mechanical properties was detected.
   center dot These results suggest that Si might function as a substitute for cellulose to increase stiffness but not the strength of a lamina. Greater Si concentration decreased epsilon(max) without increasing sigma(max), which made the lamina more brittle. The brittleness associated with Si might explain a potential cost or disadvantage of using Si, which would elucidate the trade-offs between species with different leaf Si concentrations.

AB  - Biocontrol agents are critical for pest management in sustainable agriculture. Generalist arthropod predators may hold a great potential as biocontrol agents because they are ubiquitous and consume pests in agroecosystems. However, their diet composition over the entire crop season has rarely been quantified, which hinders our ability to assess their biocontrol potential in real field conditions that foster temporal dynamics of pest and alternative prey populations. To fill this knowledge gap, we surveyed arthropod communities over crop stages in organic and conventional rice farms (n = 7 each) and used stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) to quantify the diet composition of generalist arthropod predators over time. We aimed to (1) examine the resource partitioning (trophic niches) in these predators, (2) quantify these predators' diet composition from potential prey sources (rice herbivores, tourist herbivores, and detritivores), and (3) investigate the effects of farm type (organic/conventional) and crop stage (tillering/flowering/ripening stage) on pest (rice herbivore) consumption by the predators. The results show that generalist predators in both organic and conventional farms shifted trophic niches over the crop season and consumed a higher percentage of rice herbivores at late than at early crop stages (e.g., 90-93% at ripening vs. 34-55% at tillering), suggesting an increasing biocontrol value over time regardless of farm type. Surprisingly, generalist predators consumed higher proportions of rice herbivores in conventional than organic farms at tillering and flowering stages, highlighting their underappreciated potential as biocontrol agents in conventional farms. These results demonstrate that although generalist arthropod predators do consume non-pest alternative prey, they have a high biocontrol potential (per capita pest consumption) in both organic and conventional rice farms. We encourage modern agriculture to develop techniques to support robust populations of these predators and the ecosystem services that they provide.

AB  - The Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM) provides numerical solutions for ice sheet dynamics using finite element and fine mesh adaption. However, considering ISSM is compatible only with central processing units (CPUs), it has limitations in economizing computational time to explore the linkage between climate forcings and ice dynamics. Although several deep learning emulators using graphic processing units (GPUs) have been proposed to accelerate ice sheet modeling, most of them rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for regular grids. Since they are not appropriate for the irregular meshes of ISSM, we use a graph convolutional network (GCN) to replicate the adapted mesh structures of the ISSM. When applied to transient simulations of the Pine Island Glacier (PIG), Antarctica, the GCN successfully reproduces ice thickness and velocity with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0.997, outperforming non-graph models, including fully convolutional network (FCN) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Compared to the fixed-resolution approach of the FCN, the flexible-resolution structure of the GCN accurately captures detailed ice dynamics in fast-ice regions. By leveraging 60-100 times faster computational time of the GPU-based GCN emulator, we efficiently examine the impacts of basal melting rates on the ice sheet dynamics in the PIG.

AB  - Medium -scale pig production systems, which make up 30 % of Mexico 's pig farms, face two key obstacles impacting their economic and financial performance. The first is the absence of a sales plan based on pigs ' weight, which negatively affects both profitability and resource management. The second obstacle is inadequate waste management, which hampers efforts to mitigate environmental impacts generated by pig farms. Based on this criterion, this study aims to determine technical and economic optimum levels of a medium -scale pig farm and evaluate its associated environmental impacts. Based on the last farm sale weight (116.3 kg - base scenario), technical and economic optimum levels were estimated using a production function, resulting in a technical optimum of 155 kg and an economic optimum of 127 kg. An environmental assessment of the pig fattening process was carried out following the principles of the Life Cycle Analysis methodological framework. Using a cradle -to -farm gate perspective, and establishing 1 kg of live -weight pig as the functional unit. The results indicated that production at maximum weight level (155 kg), increased environmental impacts by 60 % to 75 % compared to the base scenario. In contrast, at the maximum economic benefit level (127 kg), environmental impacts increased by 5 % to 10 %. Feed production represented the largest contribution (over 74 %) in six impact categories. The results provide valuable information for medium -scale pig farms to mitigate the environmental burdens associated with the optimal production weight and to direct efforts towards achieving future economic and environmental efficiency.

AB  - The overall goal of this work was to determine the effects of Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) (Trombidiformes: Tarsonemidae) infestation on the physicochemical contents of fresh tea leaves and tea yield under field conditions in Rize province (Black Sea Coast, Turkey). The study was carried out on Muradiye-10, Pazar-20, and Tuglali-10 tea clones. Water extract, dry matter, caffeine, total polyphenol, crude cellulose, and total ash were analyzed as physicochemical parameters in the fresh tea leaves. The findings indicated that the yield of Muradiye-10 was significantly reduced with the increase in infestation of P. latus. Dry matter content in all clones showed a reduction when the shoots were infested by P. latus. Although the water extract values generally remained unchanged, the infested leaves of Pazar-20 had a higher amount of water extract than the uninfested leaves. On the other hand, the polyphenol content was not affected by mite feeding. The total ash, crude cellulose, and caffeine contents showed unsteady changes. Their values either increased, decreased, or remained unchanged considering the years, clones, and mite densities. We conclude that the infestation of P. latus generally deteriorated the physicochemical contents of fresh tea leaves as well as fresh tea yield, although it changes over the years, clones, and mite densities.

AB  - Parental (environmental) effects can modify the growth of offspring, which may play an essential role in their adaptation to environmental variation. While numerous studies have tested parental effects on offspring growth, most have considered offspring growth of only one generation and very few have considered offspring growth of different generations. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with an aquatic clonal plant Pistia stratiotes. We grew a single ramet of P. stratiotes under low or high nutrients, the initial (parent) ramets produced three different generations of offspring ramets, and these offspring ramets were also subjected to the same two nutrient levels. High nutrients currently experienced by the offspring increased biomass accumulation and ramet number of all three offspring generations of P. stratiotes. However, these positive effects on biomass were greater when the offspring ramets originated from the parent ramets grown under low nutrients than when they were produced by the parent ramets grown under high nutrients. These results suggest that parental effects can impact the performance of different offspring generations of clonal plants. However, heavier offspring ramets produced under high nutrients in parental conditions did not increase the subsequent growth of the offspring generations. This finding indicates that parental provisioning in favorable conditions may not always increase offspring growth, partly depending on root allocation but not ramet size such as ramet biomass.

AB  - Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is a versatile and multipurpose crop with a wide range of industrial, commercial, environmental and medicinal applications. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of hemp hay on the oxidative and inflammatory status of grazing goats. The high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids with anti-inflammatory activity makes hemp hay a promising feed that can be used to improve animals' health by means of its metabolic profile, as well as its oxidative and inflammatory status. Studies on hemp hay suggest that its usage could replace alfalfa hay to obtain beneficial effects in terms of the milk yield and health status of goats. Indeed, because of the various biological compounds in hemp hay, the effects of its administration should be accurately explored. A total of 20 multiparous goats were equally divided immediately after calving (February) into two groups (C: control vs. H: hemp) that were homogeneous in terms of live weight (49 +/- 2 kg) and milk yield at the previous lactation (2250 +/- 200 g/head/day). The animals remained in the pasture but received 500 g/head/day of a barley and corn meal mixture. In addition, group H received 250 g/head/day of hemp hay, and group C was fed the same amount of alfalfa hay. Blood samples were taken before the trial and four months later and analyzed for clinical biochemistry, oxidative status, and anti-inflammatory profile. Reactive oxygen metabolites, biological antioxidant potential, Interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 10 (IL-10), and TNF-alpha were determined. In group H, a significant decrease in TNF-alpha level (22.7 vs. 12.7 pg/mL, p = 0.01) and an opposite but not significant trend for IL-10 was detected. In addition, there was a significant decrease (184.6 vs. 111.4 UCARR, p = 0.001) in d-ROM content and an increase in the biological antioxidant potential (BAP) values (3238.1 vs. 3886 mu mol/L). A significant anti-inflammatory effect was only registered for TNF-alpha, whereas IL6 and IL10 were not affected.

AB  - Housing pigs within their thermal comfort zone positively impacts productivity and performance. However, fundamental information on behavioral thermoregulatory responses of individual and group-housed pigs is meager. As a gregarious species, pigs prefer to be near one another, touching and often huddling. As pigs huddle together, they decrease their heat loss to the environment by decreasing exposed surface area and increasing mass. Additionally, pigs gain weight rapidly as they age. As an individual grows, their ability to withstand lower temperatures increases. We hypothesized that group size would alter pig thermal preference and that thermal preference would change based upon body weight. Thirty-six groups of pigs (n = 2 pigs/group) were tested in a factorial design based on group size (1, 2, or 4) and weight category (small: 5.20 +/- 1.15 kg; medium: 8.79 +/- 1.30 kg; and large: 13.95 +/- 1.26 kg) in both sexes. Treatment groups were placed inside a chamber with a controlled thermal gradient (4.6 m x 0.9 m x 0.9 m; L x W x H) that ranged in temperature from 18 to 30 degrees C. Pigs habituated to the gradient for 24 h. The following 24 h testing period was continuously video recorded and each pig's location during inactivity (similar to 70% daily budget) within the thermal apparatus was recorded every 10 min via instantaneous scan sampling. Data were analyzed using a GLM and log10 + 0.001 transformed for normality. Tukey tests and Bonferroni-corrected custom tests were used for post hoc comparisons. Peak temperature preference was determined by the maximum amount of time spent at a specific temperature. Both group size (p = 0.001) and weight category (p < 0.001) influenced the thermal location choice of pigs. Individual pigs preferred 30.31 degrees C, which differed from a group of 2 (20.0 degrees C: p = 0.003) and 4 pigs (20.0 degrees C: p < 0.001). The peak temperature preference of the small pigs (30.2 degrees C) differed from the large pigs (20.0 degrees C: p < 0.001) but did not differ from the medium-sized pigs (28.4 degrees C: p > 0.05). Overall, heavier pigs and larger groups preferred cooler temperatures.

AB  - The significant decline in the abundance of the Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides matsuurae in the Northwest Pacific was one of the impetuses to scrutinize the age determination methods for this species based on different age-recording structures. The present study was carried out in accordance with recommendations of the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). An analysis of age determination data for the Greenland halibut has shown underestimation of age estimated using scales or whole otoliths compared to the technique using otolith sections through the peri-sulcular tuberosity. A resource exploitation strategy based on incorrect age determination can either be the major cause of negative trends in the status of the Greenland halibut stock or have a combined effect with natural factors.

AB  - Extinction is a fundamental form of inhibitory learning that is important for adapting to changing environmental contingencies. While numerous studies have investigated the neural correlates of extinction using Pavlovian fear conditioning and appetitive operant reward-seeking procedures, less is known about the neural circuitry mediating the extinction of appetitive Pavlovian responding. Here, we aimed to generate an extensive brain activation map of extinction learning in a rat model of appetitive Pavlovian conditioning. Male Long-Evans rats were trained to associate a conditioned stimulus (CS; 20 s white noise) with the delivery of a 10% sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US; 0.3 ml/CS) to a fluid port. Control groups also received CS presentations, but sucrose was delivered either during the inter-trial interval or in the home-cage. After conditioning, 1 or 6 extinction sessions were conducted in which the CS was presented but sucrose was withheld. We performed Fos immunohistochemistry and network connectivity analyses on a set of cortical, striatal, thalamic, and amygdalar brain regions. Neural activity in the prelimbic cortex, ventral orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus was greater during recall relative to extinction. Conversely, prolonged extinction following 6 sessions induced increased neural activity in the infralimbic cortex, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and nucleus accumbens shell compared to home-cage controls. All these structures were similarly recruited during recall on the first extinction session. These findings provide novel evidence for the contribution of brain areas and neural networks that are differentially involved in the recall versus extinction of appetitive Pavlovian conditioned responding.

AB  - Habitat restoration is an effective method for improving landscape connectivity, which can reduce habitat fragmentation. Maintaining landscape connectivity could promote connections between habitat, which is extremely essential to preserve gene flow and population viability. This study proposes a methodological framework to analyze landscape connectivity for Asian elephant habitat conservation, aiming to provide practical options for reducing habitat fragmentation and improving habitat connectivity. Our approach involved combining a species distribution model using MaxEnt and landscape functional connectivity models using graph theory to assess the impact on connectivity improvement via farmland/plantation restoration as habitat. The results showed that: (1) there were 119 suitable habitat patches of Asian elephant covering a total area of 1952.41 km(2). (2) The connectivity between habitats improved significantly after vegetation restoration and the gain first decreased and then increased with the increase of dispersal distance. (3) The first few new habitat patches that were identified played an important role in improving connectivity, and the variation rate of connectivity gradually leveled off as the number of new habitats increased. (4) Prioritization of the 25 best new habitat patches increased connectivity from 0.54% to 5.59% as the dispersal distance increased and mainly was located between two Asian elephant distribution regions and two components. Establishment of new habitat patches was effective for improving or restoring connectivity. Our findings can be used as guidance for improving the studied fragmented Asian elephant habitats, and they can also be used as a reference for the habitat restoration of other endangered species heavily affected by habitat fragmentation.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of endogenous GH-IGF-1 axis on lactating goats fed with high -concentrate diets. Ten lactating goats were used and randomly divided into two groups, in a 2x2 Latin square experiment design with different forage to concentrate rations of 40:60 (the control group) and 60:40 (the high -concentrate group), respectively. During the experiment, milk samples were collected to assay the content of milk compositions; plasma samples were collected to measure the content of IGF-1 and GH. The liver and mammary gland samples were collected to observe the expression of IGF-1R and GH. The results showed that compared with the control group, the content of plasma GH and IGF-1 were decreased in the high -concentrate group, and the percentage of lactose and milk yield were also decreased. Meantime, the mRNA expression of IGF-1R in mammary gland was down -regulated in the high -concentrate group. Our results indicated that feeding with high -concentrate diets for 9 weeks would decrease the contents of endogenous GH and IGF-1, and eventually lead to the decreased milk yield.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill), one of the most valuable crops in the world, faces serious challenges due to drought and insect herbivory. Although well studied independently, we lack a comprehensive understanding of interactive effects of drought x herbivory on both soybean and herbivore traits. A holistic examination of soybean morpho-physiology (above and below-ground traits including root morphology) and herbivore performance can help us understand the potential consequences of these two major stressors on soybean yield and fitness. To this end, we imposed simulated-drought and herbivory by soybean looper (SBL) (Chrysodeixis includens Walker) and assessed both host and herbivore performance. Morpho-physiological traits of soybean including shoot height, chlorophyll content, root morphology, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration were measured. Additionally, growth and feeding behavior of SBL were also assessed to analyze the impacts of drought x herbivory on both host and herbivore. Our results show that certain physiological traits were significantly upregulated under drought x herbivory indicating compensation. We also observed that SBL frass weight, and scale of damage was lower on simulated-drought-experienced plants and, in choice assays, SBL preferred well-watered plants. In addition to lower yields observed under simulated-drought and herbivory interaction, soybeans that experienced both drought and herbivory had the highest number of aborted pods. Our study shows that simulated drought and herbivory have synergistic negative impacts on soybean morphophysiology and support plant vigor hypothesis. Simulated drought negatively impacted SBL performance and made them less attracted to the soybeans that experienced water stress. Ultimately, the interactive effects of these stressors have negative consequences on soybean yield and fitness. This study demonstrates the need to integrate biotic and abiotic stressors for a better understanding of interactive effects on host and herbivores to make informed decisions for breeding and pest management strategies.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) emission is a common threat to farm animals. Selenium (Se) is known for its antioxidant property and can resist several stressors affecting farm animals. The aims of this study were (I) to determine how excess NH3 exert nephrotoxic effects in pigs and (II) to investigate whether selenomethionine has an alleviative effect on NH3 toxicity. Two diets supplemented with different doses of Se (0.22 mg/kg or 0.50 mg/kg) and two concentrations of NH3 (< 5 mg/m(3) or 89.8 mg/m(3)) were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design trial for a period of 30 days. The results showed that NH3 exposure caused apoptosis and increased the number of apoptotic cells in pig kidneys. Further, the activities of antioxidant enzymes were decreased, and the transcriptional and translational levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes, Bcl-2 and Caspase family members were increased under NH3 exposure. In addition, Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was suppressed after NH3 treatment. Dietary supplement with selenomethionine appears to offer protection against NH3-induced kidney injury in pigs and the pathologic changes above were alleviated. Our findings provide additional insight into the mechanism of NH3 toxicity in pigs while elucidating the role of Se as a potential antidote against NH3 poisoning.

AB  - Wetland parks have been widely studied for their roles in purifying water and enhancing ecological sustainability. This study proposes a methodology from a natural and social perspective for testing water purification effects through a case study in the Daqitou wetland in Foshan, China. Innovatively, it assessed the wetland's efficiency in removing contaminants such as nitrogen and phosphorus, and in changing pH, using plants and animal experiment, expert evaluation, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (FsQCA). The results demonstrated a significant reduction in pollutants in water through the combination of flora and fauna: Hygrophila salicifolia, Vallisneria natans, Bischofia javanica, Cipangopaludina cathayensis and Macropodus opercularis. The findings highlight the importance of integrating wetland communities into urban planning as a nature-based solution for future environmental management.

AB  - Investigations on the impact of drought stress on the reproductive growth of C. oleifera have been relatively limited compared to the extensive research conducted on its nutritional growth. To study the effects of drought stress on the growth and development of C. oleifera flower buds, we investigated the effects of drought stress on the bud anatomical structure, relative water content, relative electrical conductivity, antioxidant enzyme activity, osmoregulation substance content, and hormone contents of C. oleifera using 4-year-old potted plants ('Huaxin' cultivar) as experimental materials. We observed C. oleifera flower bud shrinkage, faded pollen colour, shortened style length, decreased relative water content, increased relative electrical conductivity, and decreased pollen germination rate under drought stress. As the stress treatment duration increased, the malondialdehyde (MDA), soluble sugar (SS), soluble protein (SP), and proline (Pro) contents, as well as peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activities increased. Moreover, the levels of the plant hormones indole acetic acid (IAA) and cytokinin (CTK) increased, whereas those of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) decreased, and those of abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin a(3) (GA(3)) first increased and then decreased. Compared to the control group, the drought treatment group exhibited stronger antioxidant capacity, water regulation ability, and drought stress protection. These results indicate that C. oleifera is adaptable to drought-prone environments. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the evaluation of drought resistance in C. oleifera, as well as the development of water management strategies for cultivation.

AB  - Trophic rewilding is considered a conservation measure that aims to restore the trophic interactions. In north-central Portugal, the Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus) is endangered mainly due to human persecution, triggered by wolf depredation on livestock. Several initiatives have occurred in this area to increase wolf wild prey availability by reintroducing/reinforcing roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) populations. However, the success of trophic rewilding initiatives relies on up-to-date scientific evidence, considering both ecological and social settings. Favorability models can be used to infer the most suitable habitats for roe deer settlement and expansion by analyzing the environmental variables known to influence species ecology and behavior. In this study, we infer how the prey habitat favorability can contribute to plan prey populations reinforcement processes as a tool for trophic chain restoration. Using 330 camera traps, we monitored the roe deer population over 8,940 km(2) in north-central Portugal. Field data were used to evaluate the environmental determinants of roe deer presence. By using the favorability function, we created a spatially explicit gradient of habitat favorability that allowed us to define key areas for the application of management measures. The selected sites are strategically positioned to promote the natural expansion of established roe deer populations and overlap the current distribution of Iberian wolf. These results are an important step toward the restoration of the trophic chain and to reduce human-wolf conflicts. Our proposal paves the way for future rewilding initiatives, especially where prey species are central to the survival of top predators.

AB  - Red abalone, Haliotis rufescens, are herbivorous marine gastropods that primarily feed on kelp. They are the largest and longest-lived of abalone species with a range distribution in North America from central Oregon, United States, to Baja California, MEX. Recently, red abalone have been in decline as a consequence of overharvesting, disease, and climate change, resulting in the closure of the commercial fishery in the 1990s and the recreational fishery in 2018. Protecting this ecologically and economically important species requires an understanding of their current population dynamics and connectivity. Here, we present a new red abalone reference genome as part of the California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP). Following the CCGP genome strategy, we used Pacific Biosciences HiFi long reads and Dovetail Omni-C data to generate a scaffold-level assembly. The assembly comprises 616 scaffolds for a total size of 1.3 Gb, a scaffold N50 of 45.7 Mb, and a BUSCO complete score of 97.3%. This genome represents a significant improvement over a previous assembly and will serve as a powerful tool for investigating seascape genomic diversity, local adaptation to temperature and ocean acidification, and informing management strategies.

AB  - Water microorganisms contribute to the key components of ecosystems in dryland waters, which are extremely important for wildlife. However, the distribution patterns of water microbes across different basal water sources are still largely unknown. This study was conducted to compare microorganisms in the water bodies of different types of water sources in the Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate Nature Reserve in China. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the undirected microbial co-existence network consisted of 15 main modules referring to different water sources, which indicated specific molecular co-existence relationships. It was found that the most dominant phyla (namely Proteobacteria, Patescibacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Actinobacteriota) of the molecular ecological network shared the same structures as the microbial community, which justified the construction of the network via a random network formation. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis distances revealed that there were still considerable variations among different habitats, showing separate sample clusters. Additionally, the different topological roles of subnetworks trimmed to a uniform size indicated different co-existence patterns in the microbiome. The artificially recharged water from concrete pond substrate (ARC) subnetworks had a relatively discrete co-occurrence, while the natural water sources (NRE) and artificially recharged water from earthen pond substrate (ARE) groups were more compact with giant modules. The NRE and ARE groups were also richer in microbial composition and had a higher number of species with low abundance. Consequently, concrete substrates may contribute to dysfunction in water microbiomes. Moreover, the functional diversity of the NRE and ARE groups is due to more intra-module connections and more inter-module connections, indirectly leading to a stable function resilient to external environmental influences. In conclusion, the microecology of the NRE was more stable than that of the concrete substrate, and artificial transportation had less effect on the microbial community.

AB  - Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subset of unconventional T cells that recognize small molecule metabolites presented by major histocompatibility complex class I related protein 1 (MR1), via an ab T cell receptor (TCR). MAIT TCRs feature an essentially invariant TCR a-chain, which is highly conserved between mammals. Similarly, MR1 is the most highly conserved major histocompatibility complexI-like molecule. This extreme conservation, including the mode of interaction between the MAIT TCR and MR1, has been shown to allow for species-mismatched reactivities unique in T cell biology, thereby allowing the use of selected species-mismatched MR1-antigen (MR1-Ag) tetramers in comparative immunology studies. However, the pattern of cross-reactivity of species-mismatched MR1-Ag tetramers in identifying MAIT cells in diverse species has not been formally assessed. We developed novel cattle and pig MR1-Ag tetramers and utilized these alongside previously developed human, mouse, and pig-tailed macaque MR1-Ag tetramers to characterize cross-species tetramer reactivities. MR1-Ag tetramers from each species identified T cell populations in distantly related species with specificity that was comparable to species- matched MR1-Ag tetramers. However, there were subtle differences in staining characteristics with practical implications for the accurate identification of MAIT cells. Pig MR1 is suffi ciently conserved across species that pig MR1-Ag tetramers identified MAIT cells from the other species. However, MAIT cells in pigs were at the limits of phenotypic detection. In the absence of sheep MR1-Ag tetramers, a MAIT cell population in sheep blood was identified phenotypically, utilizing species- mismatched MR1-Ag tetramers. Collectively, our results validate the use and define the limitations of species- mismatched MR1-Ag tetramers in comparative immunology studies.

AB  - In most female mammals, a common drawback to multiple ovulation embryo transfer programs is the variability in the superovulatory response to the multidose pFSH treatment. The aim of the present study was to identify embryo donor goats based on their response to superovulation before the performance of a high-cost hormonal treatment, as we have previously done in sheep. To this end, we evaluated the number of ovulations obtained in response to the administration of a one-shot eCG treatment and related it with the subsequent ovarian response to a multiple-dose pFSH treatment in 33 goats of the Criolla-Neuquina breed. Goats received a one-shot eCG treatment of 800 IU at the end of a 17-day progestational treatment; 9 days later, started a second 17-day progestational treatment and then received a multiple-dose pFSH treatment on days 15-17 (116 mg pFSH, in six decreasing doses). The number of corpora lutea (CL) per goat was recorded laparoscopically after both hormonal treatments. On day 8 after the second pessary removal, embryos were surgically recovered and classified by quality. Results showed a significant positive correlation between the number of CL obtained in response to the eCG and pFSH treatments (r = 0.41; y = 0.8352x + 6.9906; P < 0.05), although of limited value to select high ovulatory responding goats, due to its low correlation value. Then, goats were grouped into high and low ovulatory responders to the eCG (High >= 9; Low <9 CL) and pFSH treatments (High >= 13; Low <13 CL). After the eCG and pFSH treatments, 60% of the goats maintained their classification as high or low superovulatory responders (expressed as recurrence rate). Significant differences were found in the number of CL (18.2 +/- 1.3 vs 9.9 +/- 1.3), number of embryos thorn oocytes (13.5 +/- 1.7 vs 7.6 +/- 1.7), number of embryos (10.8 +/- 1.4 vs 5.1 +/- 1.4) and number of Grade 1 and Grade 2 embryos (8.8 +/- 1.4 vs 4.3 +/- 1.4) between high and low superovulatory responder goats (P < 0.05), while no differences were observed in the number of oocytes and in the recovery of embryos thorn oocytes, embryos, Grade 1 and Grade 2 embryos and fertilization rates (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the recurrence rate in ovarian response between the one-shot eCG treatment and the multiple-dose pFSH treatment would confirm the existence of an "individual or intrinsic factor" of the donor goat that would respond as a high or low ovulatory responder to superovulatory treatments.

AB  - Premise: Uncarina contains 14 species of woody plants endemic to Madagascar. Its occurrence across dryland biomes on the island make it an interesting system to study the diversification of the flora. Methods: Using samples of all species and 512 nuclear loci, we reconstructed phylogenetic trees to examine species relationships and assess their monophyly. We also studied the historical biogeography of the genus and combined leaf trait data derived from SEM photography of trichomes and geometric morphometric analysis of leaf shape to better understand its diversification across dryland biomes. Results: Uncarina is monophyletic, and major clades showed a clear biogeographical signal. Leaf traits also corroborated relationships among major clades. Although most species are monophyletic, at least one cryptic species exists. Uncarina, like many arid-adapted plant lineages in Madagascar originated in the Miocene or Pleistocene. Geographic movement has been primarily along a south-north axis, with river basins apparently acting as barriers to gene flow. The evolution of leaf traits corroborated movement from the spiny thicket to the dry forest biome. Conclusions: As with Malagasy lemurs and other animals, riverine barriers may have been involved in the diversification of Uncarina and may apply more broadly to epizoochorous angiosperms of Madagascar. Leaf traits suggest either a loss of adaptations to extremely arid, high irradiance environments or a release from herbivores. As is likely needed in other Malagasy lineages, more thorough population-level sampling and specimen collecting is needed to fully understand the taxonomic and morphological diversity in the genus.

AB  - This study used catch/effort (CPUE) and length-frequency (L/F) data to evaluate the status of 26 fish species in the mangroves of the Dongzhaigang National Reserve, Hainan Province, China, sampled in 2009 (16 species), 2014 (18 species) and 2020 (15 species) using CPUE and the length-based Bayesian biomass (LBB) method. The CPUE, both in number and weight, was lower in 2009 than in 2014 and lower again in 2020, with the 2009 low attributed to pollution due to shrimp, pig and duck farming within the reserve. Of the 26 fish species assessed, four experienced a large reduction of length from 2009 to 2020, and nine exhibited a decline in the ratio of current biomass to biomass at carrying capacity (B/B-0), which is expressed as the 'biomass left'. This ratio was, for most species, below 0.5 in 2009, which suggests that overfishing occurred in 2009 and that it has since become worse. Thus, while the CPUE data provided ambiguous results, the L/F data analyzed by the LBB method demonstrated unambiguously that 'miniaturization' through overfishing is occurring among the exploited 26 fish species from the mangroves of the Dongzhaigang National Reserve. For the fisheries in the mangals of Dongzhaigang Bay to remain viable, fishing effort should be reduced by local governments working with the affected communities, just as they reduced pollution a decade ago.

AB  - Pigs, as highly social animals, form stable hierarchies and different relationships to other members of their group. Pigs, mostly of very young ages, have been shown to use social learning to gather information about food locations and even extractive foraging techniques from various types of sources. The present study aims to investigate whether also adult pigs, living in a long-term stable kin-based sounder, use information of their group mates and, more specifically, whether this is based on their mates' rank or their relationship with them. The dominance order of 20 female semi-naturally housed Kune Kune pigs (aged between five to seven years) was established with dyadic hierarchy tests, where two pigs competed against each other over a monopolizable food source. Their affiliative relationships (i.e. friendships) towards each other were assessed based on observations during their daily lives. After finding suitable demonstrator dyads, differing in rank and/or relationship quality to the respective observer, six rounds of two-choice tests were conducted. Prior to each two-choice test, two demonstrators were positioned on each side of the observer and were allowed to feed from a trough with an assigned olfactory cue that provided additional information in the subsequent test. After two minutes, the observer pig was allowed to enter a test room and was given the choice between two food bowls, which were marked with the olfactory cues connected to the respective demonstrators. Results indicate that sows, irrespective of their own rank, preferred to pay attention to the relatively lower-ranking demonstrator during the exposure phase, possibly due to avoidance of the relatively higher-ranking demonstrator. Furthermore, the observers with higher sociability preferred to pay more attention to the demonstrators with whom they had better friendships. In the two-choice test, we found no significant effect of demonstrator rank or friendship. However, a left side bias in more sociable observers may point towards at least some social effects. Overall, the study provided evidence that not only dominance, but also socio-positive relationships between individuals affect the behaviour of domestic pigs.

AB  - This study identifies the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by citrus when infested with California red scale (Aonidiella aurantii) and determines which of these elicit behaviour responses in the predator Rhyzobius lophanthae. Headspace solid-phase micro extractions (HS-SPME) technique combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify compounds and Y-tube olfactometer to determine R. lophanthae behaviour responses. According to the results, 22 VOCs were detected in infested citrus plants and some of them were increased in lemon, orange and tangerine by A. aurantii infestation. R. lophanthae individuals were attracted to infested citrus saplings. According to bioassays with the olfactometer, they were attracted to methyl salicylate and D-limonene at dosages of 1 and 10 mu L/mL by using a Y-tube olfactometer. These results explain how citrus volatiles can affect the response of the predator R. lophanthae.

AB  - Blood analysis plays a pivotal role in assessing the health of laboratory animals, including pigs. This study investigated the hematological profiles of transgenic pigs of the MGH breed for xenotransplantation, focusing on the effect of housing conditions on blood parameters. A cohort of pigs was longitudinally monitored from 6 to 18 months of age in both conventional and specific pathogen-free (SPF) environments. Red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HGB), and white blood cells (WBCs) were analyzed using standardized hematology analyzers. The results revealed that RBC and HGB levels were consistently higher in SPF-housed pigs. Notably, WBC counts were significantly lower in SPF-housed pigs, suggesting that reduced pathogen exposure under SPF conditions effectively diminished immune system activation. These findings raise a novel question as to whether distinct hematological parameters of specific and/or designated PF pigs would be advantages for the success of clinical xenotransplantation trials.

AB  - In South Africa, forbs make up the largest component of herbaceous species in grassland and savanna ecosys-tems, contributing significantly to nutritional food items for herbivores at certain times of the year. However, there are limited reports on the nutraceutical value of native forb species. Here, the proximate composition and the mineral, amino acid and antinutrient content of Evolvulus alsinoides, a commonly browsed forb spe-cies in South Africa, were evaluated for the first time. In addition, Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectros-copy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were applied for chemical analyses of pulverized samples and crude extracts. Proximate analysis revealed the presence of crude protein (11.07 +/- 0.10%), carbohydrate (75.37 +/- 0.12%), moisture (4.26 +/- 0.23%), crude fat (1.8 +/- 0.09%), crude fibre (29.2 +/- 0.72%), ash (8.34 +/- 0.16%), neutral detergent fibre (44.40 +/- 0.15%), acid detergent fibre (44.04 +/- 0.03%), and an energy value of 361.68 +/- 0.10 Kcal/100g. Elemental composition showed that potassium (2.29 +/- 0.04%) and iron (1276.67 +/- 34.84 mg/kg) were predominant amongst the macro and trace minerals, respectively. Additionally, essential amino acids such as valine, phenylalanine, methionine, isoleucine, leu-cine, histidine, lysine, tryptophan, and threonine were present in E. alsinoides. The antinutrients evaluated (oxalate 0.00438 +/- 0.12 mg/g and phytate 1.16 +/- 0.02%) were below toxic levels. The FTIR spectrum of the pulverized plant sample revealed the presence of different functional groups, including OH, C -H, C -H, C -O, and C = C, indicating the presence of different metabolites in the plant. A total of 196 compounds class consisting of several sub-groups of terpenoids, fatty acids, fatty alcohol, fatty esters, steroids, some volatile organic compounds, phenols, alkaloids, saponin, and glycosides were identified from the GC-MS analysis of n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts of E. alsinoides. Overall, we conclude that E. alsinoides has high-quality nutrient resources for livestock and nutraceutical value of beneficial effects on animals' health. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: Chicken manure is known to produce strong odors during aerobic composting, which not only pollutes the surrounding environment but also leads to the loss of valuable nutrients like nitrogen and sulfur, thus reducing the quality of the fertilizer. Methods: In this study, we explored the use of biochar combined with MgO desulfurization waste residue (MDWR) as a novel composting additive. Our approach involved conducting composting tests, characterizing the compost samples, conducting pot experiments, and examining the impact of the additives on nitrogen retention, deodorization, and compost quality. Results: Our findings revealed that the addition of biochar and MDWR significantly reduced ammonia volatilization in chicken manure compost, demonstrating a reduction rate of up to 60.12%. Additionally, the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from chicken manure compost treated with biochar and MDWR decreased by 44.63% compared to the control group. Conclusions: The composting product treated with both biochar and MDWR (CMB) exhibited a 67.7% increase in total nitrogen (TN) compared to the blank control group, surpassing the other treatment groups and showcasing the synergistic effect of these two additives on nitrogen retention. Moreover, the CMB treatment facilitated the formation of struvite crystals. Furthermore, our pot experiment results demonstrated that the CMB treatment enhanced vegetable yield and quality while reducing nitrate content. These findings highlight the significant impact of MDWR on nitrogen retention, deodorization, and compost quality enhancement, thereby indicating its promising application prospects.

AB  - In-situ composting is an efficient method for the dispose of crop residues. However, the high organic carbon content and low water-holding capacity of corn (Zea mays L.) straw can easily result in a slow composting process with high nutrient loss. In this study, compressed corn straw blocks was a control (S), straw mixed with earthworm casts (SE), straw mixed with biochar (SB), straw mixed with earthworm casts and biochar (SEB) were treatments to determine their effects on in-situ composting performance. In general, compared with S, the thermophilic period was extended by 14, 13 and 3 days in SE, SB and SEB, respectively, reduced nutrient loss, the water holding porosity of SE and SEB increased by 28.67% and 24.03%. Besides, the bacterial Shannon and Pielou's indices of SEB increased by 9.42% and 9.33%, respectively, and the relative abundance of Acinetobacter was increased in SB and SEB. Amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism were the most abundant metabolic processes in composts. SEB showed not only the highest cucumber yields, but also the highest OQI. The OQI of the CCSBs was significantly and positively correlated with cucumber yields (P < 0.001). These results indicated that the combination of earthworm casts and biochar was more effective than each single additive during in-situ composting of corn straw blocks, and emphasized that the overall quality of CCSBs played pivotal roles in determining the agronomic performance of CCSBs. In addition, the in-situ composting of corn straw blocks could be used to produce high-quality cultivation substrates.

AB  - Reliable quantitative information regarding sediment sources is essential for target mitigation, particularly in settings with a large number of loose provenances caused by earth disasters. The lakes in the Jiuzhaigou World Natural Heritage Site (WNHS) are facing serious environmental problems of silting and swamping, which threaten the sustainability of the area, especially after the earthquake on 8 August 2017 (the "8.8 earthquake"). Therefore, a field investigation was conducted after the "8.8 earthquake" (June 2020), and the Arrow Bamboo and Rhino Lakes, which were affected by the earthquakes to different degrees, were selected as the research objects. Based on the data of 27 environmental indicators from 31 surface sediment and soil samples in and around the lakes, the spatial distribution characteristics of the lake sediment sources were quantified using composite fingerprint recognition technology. Furthermore, a high protection standard of a WHNS and a process treatment scheme for reducing the siltation of the Jiuzhaigou lakes were proposed. The results showed that the contribution ratio of loose matter sources entering the lake on the road-side of the Arrow Bamboo and Rhino Lakes (16.5% and 21.8%, respectively) was lower than that on the forest-side (83.5% and 78.2%, respectively), indicating that physical barriers such as roads can effectively reduce the sediment input, while the lake forest side contributes a large number of loose matter sources, which has not attracted attention in the past and requires protection. High protection standards for the Jiuzhaigou WHNS are suggested. Accordingly, the entire control scheme of Jiuzhaigou lake sediment reduction including "monitoring-control-interception-buffer-cleaning" is provided. Source erosion monitoring is the first step in blocking the sediment source. Vegetation restoration and surface coverage should be conducted in areas where water and soil losses have occurred. Necessary engineering measures should be implemented to intercept loose material sources at points where geological disasters occur frequently. A buffer zone should be established between the lake and the mountain to intercept the sediment. Sediment caused by geological disasters with low interference must also be cleaned from the lake. The level of nutrients in the lake must be controlled by the regular cleaning of plant debris from the lake and lakeside.
