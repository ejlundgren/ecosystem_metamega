AB  - Feral hogs (Sus scrofa) are invasive, ecosystem engineers and a novel disturbance to rare, fire-dependent, herbaceous wetland ecosystems in Florida, USA. Their feeding activity uproots vegetation, altering plant composition and continuity. Hog rooting can also create linked disturbance by ingesting vegetation critical for fire spread. Herbaceous communities are vulnerable to shrub encroachment when fire return intervals are increased. We examined the impact of hog rooting intensity (% uprooted vegetation) on the resilience of herbaceous, seepage wetland vegetation cover and composition and the effect of hog rooting on fire spread. We hypothesized that (1) vegetation cover and composition would reflect initial intensity of hog rooting and remain altered with and without additional rooting, and (2) reduction of foliar cover by feral hog rooting would reduce fire spread. Total foliar cover, functional group cover, richness, and cover of plant genera were estimated in plots subjected to three intensity levels of hog rooting then appraised inside and outside of exclosures for 7 years. Spatial data was collected to compare areas with and without damage from hogs to areas burned by prescribed fires from 2010-2013. Total foliar cover was reduced for 5 years with high intensity hog rooting compared to no-low intensity rooting. Cover of a keystone, bunchgrass species was reduced with high intensity hog rooting. With repeated rooting, total and graminoid foliar cover were reduced outside exclosures. Fire spread was significantly reduced in areas of hog rooting. These findings have broader implications for conservation of other fire-maintained herbaceous communities impacted by nonindigenous feral hogs.

AB  - The increasing deer population and their expanding distribution have altered the diversity and biomass of the plant community in the northern hemisphere. Furthermore, anthropogenic disturbances such as nitrogen deposition and logging threaten plant diversity in many parts of the forests. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of deer on plant communities under nitrogen deposition and logging conditions to un-derstand and conserve plant diversity in forest ecosystems. We conducted a field experiment that controlled three levels of deer densities (exclosure: 0 deer/km2, low: 10 deer/km2, and high: 20 deer/km2) and four anthropo-genic disturbances (without anthropogenic disturbances [control], nitrogen addition, logging, and nitrogen addition and logging combined) in a cool temperate secondary forest in northern Japan for nine years. We surveyed the effects of deer density and anthropogenic disturbance treatments on species richness and vegetation cover of life forms (forbs, ferns, trees, graminoids, unpalatable species, vines, and shrubs) and all species of understory vascular plants. We estimated the constant effect (without the elapsed year) and the temporary effect (with the elapsed year) of deer density, anthropogenic disturbances, and their interactions on the species rich-ness, vegetation cover, and Simpson's index as separate parameters in full models and selected the best model. The high deer density negatively affected the species richness of some life forms and all species and accelerated these effects over time for all species. The vegetation covers of most of the life forms were negatively affected by high deer density, and the effect was reduced over time. In contrast, the exclosure negatively affected the species richness of some life forms and positively affected the vegetation cover of most of the life forms and all species. The effect on the cover accelerated over time. Nitrogen addition accelerated the negative effect of high deer density on the species richness of shrubs. On the other hand, logging reduced the negative effect of high deer density on the species richness of all species. The cover of unpalatable species in the high deer density site with logging was approximately nine times higher than that in the high deer density site without anthropogenic disturbances in the last surveyed year. The high deer density and logging decreased the Simpson's diversity index score. These results indicate that the effects of deer density, anthropogenic disturbances, and their interactions vary with time. These interactions must be considered to manage deer's effect on forest ecosystems.

AB  - Sustaining oak-dominated forests that support regionally important biodiversity in the Appalachian Mountains is a substantial challenge for land managers due to mesophication - a region-wide phenomenon in which forest composition shifts from oaks to shade tolerant, mesic species such as maples. To inform oak forest management that includes biodiversity preservation as a management objective, we established a two treatment factorial design experiment at two sites to determine the effects of prescribed fire and deer herbivory on tree regeneration and understory plant diversity in dry oak-dominated forests. Data were collected before and after treatments were applied. Prescribed burns altered species composition to favor fire-adapted species and deer exclosure fences protected woody and herbaceous species sensitive to deer browse at both sites, however the initial conditions in the forests profoundly influenced the effects of these treatments. Prescribed fires promoted oak seedlings over maple seedling where oak seedlings were well stocked. Conversely, burning favored maple seedlings to the detriment of oak seedlings in areas where chronic over-browsing resulted in a depauperate understory. Although fire reduced understory plant cover at both sites, overall understory species richness was not affected by burning. This suggests that prescribed fire did not have detrimental effects on forest understory diversity, although herbaceous species diversity was significantly reduced by burning the site with an initially depauperate understory. Fencing resulted in large increases in species richness and cover of understory plants, including more than doubling the cover of tree seedlings and the abundance of tall seedlings in fenced plots, as well as shifts in understory composition towards species sensitive to deer browse. The herbaceous layer in this study contained nearly 6 species for every one species found in the tree canopy, reaffirming the importance of the herbaceous layer in the biodiversity of Appalachian oak-dominated forests. These results provide guidance to managers of protected areas seeking to enhance oak regeneration while maintaining or promoting native plant diversity in the forest understory.

AB  - Questions: Herbivores can exert strong top-down control on vegetation structure and composition, which in turn can affect overall biodiversity and ecosystem processes. However, South American megafauna was largely driven to extinction in recent prehistory, and remaining species have suffered severe range reductions from human actions. The potential role of South American megafauna in shaping vegetation therefore remains unclear. We examined herbivore-driven top-down control of the vegetation, particularly impacts on plant diversity, structure and functional composition. LocationIber & aacute; Wetlands, Corrientes, Argentina. Methods: We set up an herbivore exclosure experiment in a restoration area with 10 wild large-herbivore species. We compared vegetation dynamics in fenced plots with paired control plots to which herbivores had full access. Replicate plot pairs were established in three grassland types: characterized as short, medium-tall and tall grasslands. Grass height, plant biomass, functional types and community composition were measured at the start of the experiment and after 6, 13 and 18 months. Results: We found that in short and medium-tall grasslands, herbaceous biomass and grass height increased significantly in no-grazing plots, while species richness decreased. Similarly, community dissimilarity between paired grazed and ungrazed plots increased over time for short and medium-tall grasslands. Camera trap images revealed that capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) was the dominant grazer on the grazed plots. Conclusion: Our results show a strong impact of native herbivores on the structure and composition of South American savannas akin to African grazing lawns, with higher plant species richness and dominance of grazing-tolerant growth forms. These results imply that South American grassy ecosystems, despite severely reduced herbivore richness and density, have retained plant taxa and functional trait complexes that tolerate intense herbivory. Further, they also show that herbivory can still play an important role in maintaining their plant diversity. The conservation and restoration of South American grassy ecosystems are likely to benefit from restoring functional grazing regimes.

AB  - Ungulates place immense consumptive pressure on forest vegetation globally, leaving legacies of reduced biodiversity and simplified vegetative structure. However, what remains unresolved is whether browse-induced changes occurring early in succession ultimately manifest themselves in the developed forest canopy. Understanding the development and persistence of these legacies is critical as canopy structure is an important determinant of forest ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration and wildlife habitat. We measured how white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus browse during stand initiation affected canopy structure, tree species richness, diversity, stem density, and basal area on Pennsylvania's Allegheny Plateau using a portable canopy LiDAR system. We capitalized on an historic deer enclosure experiment where forests were subjected to four deer densities (4, 8, 15, and 25 deer/km(2)) for 10 years following stand initiation. Deer browsing impacts on the forest canopy are apparent nearly four decades since stand initiation. The highest deer density treatment experienced a significant reduction in tree species diversity, density, and basal area with stands becoming dominated by black cherry Prunus serotina. Reductions in overstorey diversity and tree density resulted in a more open canopy with low leaf area and high horizontal leaf variability. Canopies were tallest at the lowest and highest deer densities. Synthesis and applications. Using a portable canopy LiDAR system and a former deer enclosure experiment, we show that high deer browsing pressure during stand initiation can have a decades-long impact on stand and canopy structure. High deer densities led to stands with lower species diversity and tree density, which resulted in canopies that were taller and less dense. As remote sensing of the canopy becomes more prevalent, considering the legacy of ungulate herbivory on canopy structure may inform both land management and our understanding of ecological function, such as forest carbon sequestration, maintenance of diverse understory communities, and creation of wildlife habitat

AB  - Megafauna (animals >= 45 kg) have probably shaped the Earth's terrestrial ecosystems for millions of years with pronounced impacts on biogeochemistry, vegetation, ecological communities and evolutionary processes. However, a quantitative global synthesis on the generality of megafauna effects on ecosystems is lacking. Here we conducted a meta-analysis of 297 studies and 5,990 individual observations across six continents to determine how wild herbivorous megafauna influence ecosystem structure, ecological processes and spatial heterogeneity, and whether these impacts depend on body size and environmental factors. Despite large variability in megafauna effects, we show that megafauna significantly alter soil nutrient availability, promote open vegetation structure and reduce the abundance of smaller animals. Other responses (14 out of 26), including, for example, soil carbon, were not significantly affected. Further, megafauna significantly increase ecosystem heterogeneity by affecting spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure and the abundance and diversity of smaller animals. Given that spatial heterogeneity is considered an important driver of biodiversity across taxonomic groups and scales, these results support the hypothesis that megafauna may promote biodiversity at large scales. Megafauna declined precipitously in diversity and abundance since the late Pleistocene, and our results indicate that their restoration would substantially influence Earth's terrestrial ecosystems.
   A meta-analysis synthesizes the range of effects of megafauna on ecosystems, finding that megafauna significantly increase ecosystem heterogeneity and impact a wide range of ecosystem properties by altering soil nutrient availability, promoting open vegetation structure and reducing the abundance of smaller animals.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of ecosystem collapse is critical for resource management, particularly for protected areas mandated to preserve biodiversity. In Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, tall willows (Salix spp.) dominated riparian vegetation, and a beaver-willow state was the natural ecosystem type in the Colorado River headwaters. However, willows comprise a portion of elk diets and are a preferred food for recently introduced moose, and the vegetation structure has changed dramatically since the early 2000s. To assess ecosystem changes, we analyzed time-series data on willow height from 1997 to 2021 inside and outside 3 exclosures built to exclude ungulates, area of tall willows in 1999 and 2019, area of open water from 1953 to 2019, vegetation composition in 1998 and 2021, groundwater depth from 1996 to 2021, surface water flow from 1953 to 2023, and climate from 1950 to 2023. Tall willow coverage and open water area declined by >90% from 1999 to 2019. Willow height outside the ungulate exclosures declined by more than 75% since the 1990s; yet, within exclosures that were formerly browsed, willow height increased by up to 500%. Tall willow communities have largely been replaced by grasslands. Browsing by elk and moose likely played a pivotal role in triggering a collapse of the beaver-willow state and the formation of an alternative moose-elk-grassland state that appears stable and may be difficult to reverse without direct human action. Restoration efforts will depend on a reduction in herbivory and reconnection of the river with its floodplain.

AB  - QuestionIn productive grasslands highly dominated by a single plant species, herbivores can promote overall plant diversity. Wild boars (Sus scrofa) often decrease species diversity, alter regeneration and change community composition in their native and invader ranges while digging and uprooting vegetation for feeding. In addition, wild guinea pigs (Cavia aperea), a small vertebrate herbivore native to South America, concentrate their feeding activities in open patches where they also affect plant diversity, biomass and composition. In this context, can wild-boar disturbances promote plant diversity in herbaceous systems characterized by a highly dominant species? Can native wild guinea pigs magnify these impacts?LocationCoastal grasslands and salt marshes of the northeastern part of the temperate Argentine pampas, that are dominated by native or exotic herbaceous species.MethodsWe first analyzed alpha- and beta-diversity of plant assemblies in three natural coastal herbaceous areas, invaded by wild boars, through samplings (comparing disturbed and undisturbed areas) and experiments (using exclosures and control plots). Then, we analyzed whether wild guinea pigs could affect patch recovery (alpha- and beta-diversity) after wild-boar disturbances in one site.ResultsWild boars enhanced alpha-diversity (compared to undisturbed areas) but had no significant effect on beta-diversity. Nevertheless, wild guinea pigs feeding on wild-boar disturbances increased between-patch heterogeneity in species composition (i.e., beta-diversity).ConclusionWild boars remove vegetation in patches that, without subsequent wild-guinea-pig herbivory, dominant species rapidly recover. Wild-guinea-pig herbivory allows different subordinate species to peak at different disturbed patches, contributing to larger species richness at larger scales in areas otherwise occupied by highly dominant plant species. In a wider context, these results imply that the joint action of different-sized exotic and native herbivores can help to maintain plant species diversity in highly plant-dominated grasslands.
   Wild boar is an exotic species that generates bare soil patches that have positive effects for plant diversity in highly plant-dominated systems. These effects are mediated by a native small herbivore. Thus, the joint action of differently sized herbivores, native and exotic, can help to preserve plant diversity in highly dominated systems.image

AB  - Riparian zones are among the most biologically diverse ecosystems in the Intermountain West, USA, and provide valuable ecosystem services, including high rates of biotic productivity, nutrient processing, and carbon storage. Thus, their sustainability is a high priority for land managers. Large ungulates affect composition and structure of riparian/stream ecosystems through herbivory and physical effects, via trailing and trampling. Bison (Bison bison) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) have been characterized as "ecosystem engineers " because of their demonstrated effects on phenology, aboveground productivity of grasses, and woody vegetation structure. Bison have greatly increased in numbers during the last two decades and spend large periods of time in the broad open floodplains of the Northern Range of the Park, where they are hypothesized to have multiple effects on plant species composition and diversity. We sampled indicators of bison use as well as riparian vegetation composition, diversity, and structure along eight headwater streams within YNP's Northern Range. Total fecal density ranged from 333 to 1833 fecal chips and/or piles/ha, stubble heights ranged from 7 to 49 cm, and streambank disturbance ranged from 9% to 62%. High levels of bison use were positively correlated with exotic species dominance and negatively correlated with species richness, native species diversity, willow (Salix spp.) cover, and wetland species dominance. At three sites, the intensity of bison use exceeded recommended utilization thresholds to avoid degradation of streams and riparian zones on public lands. The influences of large herbivores, principally bison, on vegetation composition and structure suggest the cumulative effects of the current densities on the Northern Range are contributing to biotic impoverishment, representing the loss of ecosystem services that are provided by native riparian plant communities. In addition, contemporary levels of bison use may be exacerbating climate change effects as observed through ungulate-related shifts in composition toward plant assemblages adapted to warmer and drier conditions. However, the resilience of native riparian vegetation suggests that sites currently heavily utilized by bison would have the potential for recovery with a reduction in pressure by this herbivore.

AB  - Grazing and browsing by sheep and goats has been an important anthropogenic influence on ecosystems in the Mediterranean region for centuries. This influence has changed significantly in recent decades, with a general shift from range grazing to the penning of animals. The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) proposes that perturbation -including anthropogenic disturbance -is the norm for Mediterranean ecosystems, and that higher species diversity is found under conditions of continuous, moderate disturbance. Here we test the IDH as it re-lates to grazing of scrub and open forest habitats in Cyprus, while also testing for the effects of fire. We carried out surveys of breeding birds and vegetation at 48 study sites in scrub and open woodland across Cyprus. We estimated relative grazing pressure (past and present) and fire history at these sites, and tested for associations between these factors, breeding bird species richness and perennial vegetation diversity. We found moderate current grazing reduces density of lower and middle level scrub, and a higher level of diversity of perennial vegetation at moderately over intensively grazed sites. We found that moderate historical grazing pressure had a positive influence on richness of breeding bird species in lower scrub habitat such as phrygana, but that this effect was weaker the taller and denser the habitat. By contrast, current grazing pressure had a negative effect on species richness in lower scrub, but species richness in grazed habitats was higher in denser, taller scrub habitat such as garrigue and maquis. Our study suggests grazing plays an important role in maintaining habitat het-erogeneity but the impact on avian species richness depends on the density and height of the vegetation.

AB  - As the extent of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) cultivation has expanded at the expense of tropical rainforests, enriching conventional large-scale oil palm plantations with native trees has been proposed as a strategy for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem function. However, how tree enrichment affects insect-mediated ecosystem functions is unknown. We investigated impacts on insect herbivory and pollination in the fourth year of a plantation-scale, long-term oil palm biodiversity enrichment experiment in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia. Within 48 plots systematically varying in size (25-1600 m(2)) and planted tree species richness (one to six species), we collected response data on vegetation structure, understory insect abundances, and pollinator and herbivore activity on chili plants (Capsicum annuum), which served as indicators of insect-mediated ecosystem functions. We examined the independent effects of plot size, tree species richness, and tree identity on these response variables, using the linear model for random partitions design. The experimental treatments were most associated with vegetation structure: tree identity mattered, as the species Peronema canescens strongly decreased (by approximately one standard deviation) both canopy openness and understory vegetation cover; whereas tree richness only decreased understory flower density. Further, the smallest plots had the lowest understory flower density and richness, presumably because of lower light availability and colonization rates, respectively. Enrichment influenced herbivorous insects and natural enemies in the understory to a lesser extent: both groups had higher abundances in plots with two enrichment species planted, possibly because higher associated tree mortality created more habitat, while herbivores decreased with increasing tree species richness, in line with the resource concentration hypothesis. Linking relationships in structural equation models showed that the negative association between P. canescens and understory vegetation cover was mediated through canopy openness. Likewise, canopy openness mediated increases in herbivore and pollinator insect abundances. Higher pollinator visitation increased phytometer yield, while impacts of insect herbivores on yield were not apparent. Our results demonstrate that even at an early stage, different levels of ecological restoration influence insect-mediated ecosystem functions, mainly through canopy openness. These findings suggest that maintaining some canopy gaps while enrichment plots develop may be beneficial for increasing habitat heterogeneity and insect-mediated ecosystem functions.

AB  - Calcareous grasslands are semi-natural biodiverse ecosystems that hold high conservation value, but are threatened throughout Europe. Abandoned calcareous grasslands become afforested unless succession is reset. We tested the idea that wild boar (Sus scrofa) rooting activity could serve as a means to reset succession and thereby maintain characteristic herbaceous plant diversity in calcareous grasslands. We compared vascular plant abundance and environmental parameters between plots rooted by wild boar and undisturbed plots in unmanaged calcareous grasslands in Hainich National Park, Germany. We found that rooted plots had lower grass cover and higher herb cover, and a significantly higher species richness, Shannon diversity index and evenness. Indicator species analysis differentiated 23 species for rooted plots, and 8 for undisturbed plots. Of 17 characteristic species for calcareous grasslands, two were significant indicators in rooted plots, and one in undisturbed plots, while 14 did not differentiate between the treatments. Our findings suggest that wild boar rooting activity in Hainich National Park may maintain characteristic calcareous grassland vegetation, by resetting early grassland succession and enhancing heterogeneity, which in turn helps sustaining biodiversity.

AB  - Reintroducing megafauna to reinstate missing top-down trophic interactions (trophic rewilding) is increasingly being applied as a tool to promote self-regulating, biodiverse ecosystems. Even though the theoretical background is clear, and megafauna effects are documented from prehistorical ecosystems, the effects of reintroduced herbivores in contemporary ecosystems remain understudied. This not only includes how reintroduced megafauna interact with each other and the ecosystem, but also how current management practices affect the processes they provide. In this study, we investigated the effects of proactive health management, that is, winter feeding and anti-parasitic treatments on the ecosystem by examining diets of large herbivores and dung-associated invertebrate communities. We used environmental DNA metabarcoding to yield community compositions of plants and invertebrates in dung from cattle and horses from five comparable nature sites in Denmark, which differed in management and site/population-specific properties such as availability of woody plant species, herbivore densities and provision of winter feeding and anti-parasitic treatments. We found different diet compositions between cattle and horses, highlighting their functional differences. For example, horse samples had higher relative read abundances of graminoid and tree DNA. Supplementary feeding affected diets by decreasing consumption of graminoids and tree species relative to forbs and legumes, probably originating from fodder, and intense feeding seemed to almost eliminate consumption of local vegetation. However, more studies are needed to generalize these findings. Several invertebrate families were associated with either cattle or horse dung, suggesting complementary effects on dung-associated invertebrate biodiversity by these large grazers. The taxa that responded negatively to anti-parasitic treatments were mainly parasitic nematodes (e.g. the families Ancylostomatidae, Cooperidae and Strongylidae), suggesting that the applied treatments work as intended, but these results should be interpreted with caution due to methodological limitations. Synthesis and application. Our findings demonstrate functional differences between cattle and horses, which suggest complementary effects on vegetation development and consequently biodiversity. Also, our results indicate that this functionality is impacted by proactive health management actions. We suggest that potential effects on herbivory and biodiversity are carefully considered before supplementary feeding, or anti-veterinary treatments are provided in year-round grazing systems and avoided if possible.

AB  - Plant communities in rangeland ecosystems vary widely in the degree to which they can compensate for losses to herbivores. Ecosystem-level factors have been proposed to affect this compensatory capacity, including timing and intensity of grazing, and availability of soil moisture and nutrients. Arid ecosystems are particularly challenging to predict because of their high degree of temporal variability in moisture inputs. We used a replicated herbivore exclusion experiment to evaluate herbaceous plant responses to grazing by large ungulates to test current theory and identify constraints on plant compensation in a dryland ecosystem. We measured nitrogen (N) yield and herbaceous production in three plant communities: meadows, willow-associated herbaceous communities, and riparian communities. We implemented grazing exclusion treatments from 2005 to 2008 in areas with elk and bison and areas with only elk. Grazing by large ungulates increased herbaceous production and N yield in herbaceous riparian communities. In willow communities, herbaceous plants displayed equal compensation in response to grazing in total aboveground production and N yield. Our results support the idea that plant compensation in this semiarid system is contingent on soil moisture availability, wherein the most productive sites (that received substantial moisture inputs from subsurface flow) exhibited overcompensation. Although the herbaceous riparian communities we studied are isolated patches of productive grassland in an otherwise shrub-dominated and minimally productive semiarid landscape, grazing by a combination of bison and elk removed only 44%-53% of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) during the growing season, and 25%-38% of production over winter. Consumption by ungulates was a positive linear function of herbaceous production, similar to reported patterns from other temperate and tropical grazing ecosystems. The slope of this relationship was affected by the analytical method used to calculate ANPP and consumption rates, but, regardless of the method, was lower or similar to reported slopes for other intensively grazed systems (Yellowstone, Serengeti, Laikipia) that have sustained high ungulate densities for decades to centuries. Given that the vegetation communities exhibited equal or overcompensation in terms of total herbaceous ANPP in both years, elk and bison population levels during our study period did not appear to occur at densities leading to degradation of herbaceous communities.

AB  - While numerous studies focus on the ecosystem effects of invasive mammals, few explore the causal mechanisms of such effects. Wild boar is one of the most widely introduced invasive mammal species in the world. By overturning extensive areas of vegetation and soil to feed on belowground resources, wild boar alter the soil food web and thus many microbial-mediated soil processes. Here, we take advantage of a long-term, 8-year, wild boar exclosure experiment across three plant community types in Patagonia, Argentina to explore how wild boar impact soil communities and their potential function. Previous work in this experimental system found that wild boar significantly impacted litter decomposition in the field, but it remained unclear if this effect was mediated through changes in abiotic or biotic soil properties. To explore both the abiotic and biotic drivers of decomposition, we measured soil moisture, soil temperature, soil bulk density, and soil respiration as well as soil micro-arthropod richness and abundance, earthworm abundance, and microbial biomass inside and outside of 10 exclosures in each of three plant community types. To assess potential microbial activity, we measured potential decomposition rates, substrate-induced respiration, and soil microbial enzyme activity. Rooting decreased soil moisture by 18% across plant communities, and soil respiration by 30% in Nothofagus and Austrocedrus forests. Additionally, rooting decreased soil microarthropod richness and abundance by similar to 80% in shrublands. However, rooting had no effect on soil potential microbial activity. Together, our results suggest that changes in both abiotic and biotic soil factors likely mediate observed wild boar impact on decomposition rates. Overall, we show that wild boar rooting alters soil functioning, but the pathway of impact varies by plant community, suggesting that wild boar impacts on native ecosystems can be difficult to predict.

AB  - Chronically elevated ungulate browse pressure in temperate forests worldwide often generates ecological legacies characterized by low plant diversity and contributes to the formation of dense, nearly monodominant, and highly recalcitrant layers of understory vegetation. Once established, these recalcitrant layers combined with continued browsing may jointly constrain tree establishment and diversity so completely that understory recovery may be unattainable without mitigating browse pressure, the recalcitrant layer, or both. Here, we investigate the independent and synergistic effects of both white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browsing and hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) competition on tree regeneration in a 10-year experiment. Specifically, we examine how tree seedling establishment, growth, and composition are filtered by fern cover versus fern removal (gaps), browser presence versus absence (exclosures), and their combined effects during 10 years at three hardwood forest sites in Pennsylvania, USA. Fern gaps enhanced establishment for multiple tree species, increasing seedling density and diversity, particularly in the first 3 years post-treatment, and enhancing richness (<= 1 species) over the course of the experiment. Excluding deer for a decade increased the height growth of other regeneration and altered species composition, but had no effect on diversity, richness, and density. Notably, we observed higher Prunus serotina seedling densities outside exclosures, possibly due to greater secondary dispersal. We argue that browsing legacies in second growth forests established at the turn of the last century created two conditions inimical to diverse forest regeneration: an overstory dominated by two species, P. serotina and Acer rubrum (86% of basal area), and a dense recalcitrant understory layer dominated by a native fern. The first condition limits propagule supply, the second strongly filters seedling establishment, and both create impoverished forest understories composed of few individuals and species. In undisturbed forest understories, the inertia toward impoverishment was sustained across the decade even where browsing was eliminated. Consequently, stand replacing disturbances (whether natural or anthropogenic) that disrupt the understory layer and reinitiate succession may be necessary to propel forests out of their current stasis and down a pathway leading to greater diversity.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores exert strong top-down control on plants, which in turn influence most ecological processes. Accordingly, the decline, displacement, or extinction of wild large herbivores in African savannas is expected to alter the physical structure of vegetation, the diversity of plant communities, and downstream ecosystem functions. However, herbivore impacts on vegetation comprise both direct and indirect effects and often depend on herbivore body size and plant type. Understanding how herbivores affect savanna vegetation requires disaggregating the effects of different herbivores and the responses of different plants, as well as accounting for both the structural complexity and composition of plant assemblages. We combined high-resolution Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) with field measurements from size-selective herbivore exclosures in Kenya to determine how herbivores affect the diversity and physical structure of vegetation, how these impacts vary with body size and plant type, and whether there are predictable associations between plant diversity and structural complexity. Herbivores generally reduced the diversity and abundance of both overstory and understory plants, though the magnitude of these impacts varied substantially as a function of body size and plant type: only megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes) affected tree cover, whereas medium- and small-bodied herbivores had stronger effects on herbaceous diversity and abundance. We also found evidence that herbivores altered the strength and direction of interactions between trees and herbaceous plants, with signatures of facilitation in the presence of herbivores and of competition in their absence. While megaherbivores uniquely affected tree structure, medium- and small-bodied species had stronger (and complementary) effects on metrics of herbaceous vegetation structure. Plant structural responses to herbivore exclusion were species-specific: of five dominant tree species, just three exhibited significant individual morphological variation across exclosure treatments, and the size class of herbivores responsible for these effects varied across species. Irrespective of exclosure treatment, more species-rich plant communities were more structurally complex. We conclude that the diversity and architecture of savanna vegetation depend on consumptive and nonconsumptive plant-herbivore interactions; the roles of herbivore diversity, body size, and plant traits in mediating those interactions; and a positive feedback between plant diversity and structural complexity.

AB  - ContextAustralian savannas evolved in the absence of hooved mammals and are therefore prone to disturbance from exotic ungulates. Several ungulate species have established feral populations in Australia's northern savannas. Because most ungulate species have high water requirements, seasonal and interannual changes in water availability are likely to affect their behaviour and the extent of their impacts on native ecosystems. However, few studies have investigated how water scarcity affects feral ungulate use of waterpoints in Australia.AimsThe aim of this study was to determine whether seasonal and interannual water scarcity affected the visitation behaviours of feral pigs, cattle and water buffalo at ephemeral savanna waterholes within Limmen National Park, Northern Territory, Australia.MethodsWe used motion-triggered wildlife cameras to study feral ungulate visitation and behaviour at 20 waterholes. Generalised linear mixed-effects models were used to investigate whether the number of visits, duration of visits and number of individuals visiting waterholes varied with year and dry season progression. We also investigated whether these factors affected the amount of time ungulates spent foraging, drinking and wallowing at waterholes.Key resultsAll three species visited waterholes more often, for longer periods and in larger numbers during a drought year compared with an average rainfall year. Cattle and buffalo spent more time drinking from waterholes during the drought, and pigs and cattle spent longer periods foraging. Buffalo also wallowed more during the drought. Responses to dry season progression varied among species. Cattle visited waterholes more frequently, for longer durations and in larger herd sizes as the dry season progressed, whereas buffalo use did not change. Pigs only increased their visitation to waterholes when water scarcity was most extreme, at the end of the dry season during the drought.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that water scarcity exacerbates feral ungulate use of savanna waterholes. Management and control programs for feral ungulates in Australian savannas may benefit from targeting different species under specific water scarcity conditions.ImplicationsBecause climate change is predicted to reduce surface water availability in northern Australia, feral ungulate use of savanna waterholes may intensify, risking further biodiversity losses and irreversible ecosystem damage.
   Feral ungulate species have high water requirements, yet research about their use of savanna waterholes in northern Australia is lacking. This study demonstrates that feral ungulate species have varied responses to water scarcity, so culling by conservation land managers may be optimised by targeting species under different conditions. Our findings indicate climate change will exacerbate ungulate impacts in water-limited ecosystems. Photograph by Helenna Mihailou.

AB  - Trophic rewilding is increasingly applied in restoration efforts, with the aim of reintroducing the ecological functions provided by large-bodied mammals and thereby promote self-regulating, biodiverse ecosystems. However, empirical evidence for the effects of megafauna introductions on the abundance and richness of other organisms such as plants and invertebrates, and the mechanisms involved still need strengthening. In this study, we use environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding of dung from co-existing feral cattle and horses to assess the seasonal variation in plant diet and dung-associated arthropods and nematodes. We found consistently high diet richness of horses, with low seasonal variability, while the generally lower dietary diversity of cattle increased substantially during summer. Intriguingly, season-specific diets differed, with a greater proportion of trees in the horses' diet during winter, where cattle relied more on shrubs. Graminoids were predominantly found in the diet of horses, but were generally underrepresented compared to previous studies, possibly due to the high prevalence of forbs in the study area. Dung-associated arthropod richness was higher for cattle, largely due to a high richness of flies during summer. Several species of dung-associated arthropods were found primarily in dung from one of the two herbivores, and our data confirmed known patterns of seasonal activity. Nematode richness was constantly higher for horses, and nematode communities were markedly different between the two species. Our results demonstrate complementary effects of cattle and horses through diet differences and dung-associated invertebrate communities, enhancing our understanding of large herbivore effects on vegetation and associated biodiversity. These results are directly applicable for decision-making in rewilding projects, suggesting biodiversity-benefits by inclusion of functionally different herbivores.

AB  - In the pine forests of Mexico, disturbances are primarily due to cattle, horses, goat, and sheep grazing, particularly in communal grazing lands. The most evident disturbances are low tree recruitment, invasive shrubs establishment, species composition changes, and invasion of weeds dispersed mainly by livestock. The Sierra de Zapaliname is a mountain range and natural protected area of northeast Mexico. We conducted the current study in this area in a forest stand of Pinus cembroides excluded from grazing in the last 25 years (1200 ha with pine forest vegetation and mountain chaparral) and another area nearby subjected to livestock grazing. Forest structure (basal area and density), tree species richness, total understory species richness, and understory species composition were analyzed at the control and grazed sites. Our results revealed that grazing has modified the understory species composition and reduced the evenness in the control plots. Therefore, to maintain species diversity and forest structure, we concluded that extensive grazing should be restricted for some areas or the number of animals reduced in zones of high ecological value.

AB  - Climate change has one of the most dramatic impacts on plant species diversity at the global scale. However, compared to global warming, there are few reports of the effects of changes in long-term precipitation patterns on plant community diversity in areas other than moisture-limited areas, for example temperate areas. In temperate forests, understory plant communities constitute a large proportion of plant diversity. It is crucial to investigate effects of change in long-term precipitation patterns and the other important environmental changes on plant species composition of understories in temperate forests for making the conservation strategy. The important changes that may have particularly affected plant composition in recent years include the followings; temperature rise, increase of large herbivores, change of habitat area, and changes in the cover of canopy and understory-abundant species according to the land use change. Vulnerability to the above environmental changes may be higher for species groups that are less adapted to their current habitat and have shrinking population sizes (e.g., grassland species on understories in abandoned secondary forests). The aim of this study was to es-timate the effects of precipitation and the above-mentioned factors on changes in cover of individual species on understories in temperate forests from the 1980s to the 2000s. In the analysis, we took into account the dif-ferences in the functional groups of the species (grassland herbaceous species, forest herbaceous species, and woody species). Grassland herbaceous species responded more sensitively to precipitation, temperature, cover of dwarf bamboo, and deer habitat use than other functional groups. In the 1980s, the cover of grassland herba-ceous species tended to be higher in places with lower precipitation, higher temperatures, and lower cover of dwarf bamboo and canopy, in association with climatic conditions and past land-use history. Over the last 20 years, increased precipitation and deer habitat use had particularly strong effects on the decline of grassland herbaceous species. This study found that precipitation variability is becoming a driving factor for biodiversity change through decline of vulnerable species groups in temperate areas. We should continue to monitor the precipitation effects on the ecosystems.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been overabundant in eastern North America for more than five decades, re-sulting in depauperate understories and ricocheting effects on higher trophic levels. Even after deer populations are reduced, understory plant communities may fail to recover for an unknown length of time due to persistent legacy effects. We surveyed understory plant communities in six deer exclosures and paired reference plots in northwestern Pennsylvania to determine the degree to which 19 years of deer exclusion was sufficient for recovery of species richness, diversity, percent cover, and un-derstory structural complexity. We observed a 2.3-fold increase in tree cover and a 60% reduction in fern cover in the ground layer, as well as a 114-fold increase in foliage density between 80 and 200 cm above ground level, in exclosures compared to reference plots. However, the exclosures did not permanently support higher overall percent cover, species richness, or di-versity in the ground layer, nor did we detect any meaningful divergence in community composition between exclosures and reference plots. We conclude that 19 years of release from chronic over-browsing are sufficient to restore understory structural complexity, but recovery of diversity in the ground layer will require more time or direct intervention.

AB  - Whistling thorn acacia (Acacia (Vachellia) drepanolobium) forms nearly monospecific stands among woody species in black cotton soils in East Africa arid highlands. The tree defends itself against large mammal herbivores with spinescence and symbiotic ants. While these defenses have been extensively studied, little is known about the extent to which A. drepanolobium defense may benefit other plants growing in close association. We examined variation in herbaceous vegetation height, biomass, and composition between areas underneath A. drepanolobium canopies and the adjacent matrix in both fenced herbivore exclosures and unfenced areas. In unfenced areas, there was more tall herbaceous vegetation and biomass underneath tree canopies than away from tree canopies, while these differences were not significant in fenced exclosures. Both height and biomass of understory vegetation were negatively correlated with A. drepanolobium canopy height. Species richness was higher underneath tree canopies in both fenced and unfenced locations. In the unfenced locations, species evenness was lower underneath tree canopies than in the surrounding matrix, but the opposite was true in the fenced herbivore exclosures. The differences in herbaceous vegetation composition (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index) between underneath tree and off tree locations were more pronounced in the unfenced areas than within the fenced herbivore exclosures. Our findings suggest that highly defended trees may moderate herbivore effects on herbaceous vegetation. To the extent that herbaceous vegetation underneath trees experiences protection from herbivory, such refugia microhabitats may serve as recolonization nuclei in attempts to restore chronically overgrazed systems.

AB  - Conventional conservation policies in Europe notably rely on the passive restoration of natural forest dynamics by setting aside forest areas to preserve forest biodiversity. However, since forest reserves cover only a small proportion of the territory, conservation policies also require complementary conservation efforts in managed forests in order to achieve the biodiversity targets set up in the Convention on Biological Diversity. Conservation measures also raise the question of large herbivore management in and around set-asides, particularly regarding their impact on understory vegetation. Although many studies have separately analyzed the effects of forest management, management abandonment, and ungulate pressure on forest biodiversity, their joint effects have rarely been studied in a correlative framework. We studied 212 plots located in 15 strict forest reserves paired with adjacent managed forests in European France. We applied structural equation models to test the effects of management abandonment, stand structure, and ungulate pressure on the abundance, species richness, and diversity of herbaceous vascular plants and terricolous bryophytes. We showed that stand structure indices and plot-level browsing pressure had direct and opposite effects on herbaceous vascular plant species diversity; these effects were linked with the light tolerance of the different species groups. Increasing canopy cover had an overall negative effect on herbaceous vascular plant abundance and species diversity. The effect was two to three times greater in magnitude than the positive effects of browsing pressure on herbaceous plants diversity. On the other hand, a high stand density index had a positive effect on the species richness and diversity of bryophytes, while browsing had no effect. Forest management abandonment had few direct effects on understory plant communities, and mainly indirectly affected herbaceous vascular plant and bryophyte abundance and species richness and diversity through changes in vertical stand structure. Our results show that conservation biologists should rely on foresters and hunters to lead the preservation of understory vegetation communities in managed forests since, respectively, they manipulate stand structure and regulate ungulate pressure. Their management actions should be adapted to the taxa at stake, since bryophytes and vascular plants respond differently to stand and ungulate factors.

AB  - Addressing intertwined crises of climate change and biodiversity loss is a pressing global challenge, with trees playing pivotal roles in promoting carbon sequestration and habitat diversity. However, there is a distinct knowledge gap concerning the global drivers shaping tree cover and its heterogeneity, particularly the roles and relative importance of large herbivores and fire compared to climatic and topo-edaphic conditions. Here, we deploy satellite observations of strictly protected areas worldwide to reveal that in regions where vegetation may be in disequilibrium with climate, high biomass of large herbivores, especially browsers, is inversely related to tree cover but positively associated with its spatial heterogeneity. Conversely, fire reduces both tree cover and heterogeneity. These results suggest that top-down megafauna effects on landscape-scale vegetation openness and heterogeneity manifest worldwide. Our finding supports the need to consider megafauna, particularly large herbivores, in ecosystem effects on climate change mitigation and conservation and restoration efforts through trophic rewilding.

AB  - Aims A key challenge in applied vegetation science is understanding the impact of herbivory on plant communities. Herbivores often reduce dominant species' abundance (biomass, cover), making resources available for new species and increasing plant diversity. This understanding is crucial in systems undergoing ecological restoration through trophic rewilding. In Iber & aacute; National Park, Argentina, jaguars (Panthera onca) are being reintroduced after a 70-year absence, and it is critical to assess the role of herbivores in shaping plant communities for evaluating future potential trophic cascades. Capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), the park's most abundant herbivore and an important prey for jaguars, likely exert significant pressure on vegetation. This study aims to investigate how capybara herbivory affects vegetation height, biomass, diversity, and composition, providing insights into how jaguar reintroduction might indirectly influence plant communities and restore ecosystem functionality through capybaras' demographic or behavioral responses. Location Iber & aacute; National Park, Corrientes, Argentina. Methods We simulated the absence of capybara foraging pressure by establishing 10 3 m x 3 m herbivore exclosures with adjacent unfenced control plots in the capybara's grazing lawns. Vegetation attributes-height, biomass, plant diversity, and species composition-were monitored over 4 years to assess the impact of capybara exclusion on plant communities. Results Excluding capybaras significantly increased vegetation height and biomass, which, in turn, altered plant diversity and species composition. The exclosures' vegetation height and biomass were consistently higher than those in control plots. A decrease in species diversity accompanied this shift, as the abundance of common species declined and the dominance of a few species increased, generating new communities. Conclusions Capybaras significantly influence vegetation dynamics, demonstrating their role in shaping plant communities. Excluding capybaras leads to species composition and structural shifts, highlighting herbivory's importance in maintaining ecosystem heterogeneity. These findings provide critical baseline data for understanding the potential indirect impacts of the jaguar's reintroduction on plant communities and ecosystem processes. This study contributes valuable insights into the ecological mechanisms underlying plant-herbivore interactions, which are essential for guiding restoration practices and rewilding strategies.

AB  - Ecosystem structure and processes of coastal temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest are thought to be strongly influenced by herbivory primarily of Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) and secondarily of Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus). Two large (0.5-ha) exclosures were built in old-growth coniferous rainforest communities in Olympic National Park, Washington, during 1979 to study these effects. Cover of shrubs, ferns, herbs, and graminoids and numbers of tree seedlings were described over 36 yr. Results show a sequence following ungulate exclusion of early release of shrubs, ferns, and herbs followed by eventual dominance of shrubs as other vegetation layers become shaded. Short-term responses of individual species reflected functional traits related to ability to avoid or tolerate herbivory. Over the longer term, effects reflected changing competitive relationships among vegetation layers and other ecosystem dynamics such as the provision of fallen trees in the appropriate decay class to serve as establishment substrate for tree seedlings. In aggregate, vegetation composition shifted after 36 yr from a system dominated by herbaceous cover with a major graminoid component to one dominated by shrubs (5- to 6-fold absolute increase) and ferns (5-7% increase in absolute cover), less absolute herb cover (15-20% loss), and almost no graminoids (<1.5% cover remaining in any plot) after 36 yr. These changes represented a substantial loss in plant community diversity with a loss of 46 of 74 species. Elk abundance outside of the exclosures began to decline in the 1990s leading to parallel changes in plant community trajectories outside of exclosures to those initially seen inside. While this suggests plant community responses inside the exclosures were also driven by elk exclusion, the strength of this response depends on elk abundance.

AB  - Disturbances are drivers of ecosystem function and play important roles in shaping ecological communities. Prescribed fire and grazing disturbances are common management tools in restored and remnant grasslands. The effects of these management actions on plant communities and on vegetation-dwelling invertebrates are generally well studied. However, less is known about their effects on ground-dwelling invertebrates, which can contribute to important ecosystem processes like herbivory, predation, and decomposition. We examined bison grazing and prescribed fire effects on abundance, diversity, and community composition of ground-dwelling invertebrate groups in restored tallgrass prairies using pitfall trap samples. Surprisingly, invertebrate Shannon diversity decreased when bison were present and was unaffected by fire or the fire-bison interaction. Bison, and to a lesser extent fire, also shifted community composition, increasing abundance of ground, rove, and dung beetles, as well as orthopterans and spiders. Prescribed fire generally increased beetles but caused declines in several ecologically diverse invertebrate groups, including harvestmen and true bugs, although these reduced abundances did not lead to differences in overall diversity. Bison presence may amplify the abundances of dominant groups, such as ground and dung beetles and orthopterans, that outcompete other invertebrates and reduce diversity.
   Implications for insect conservation Prescribed fire and grazing by bison change ground-dwelling invertebrate community composition, but bison presence did not reduce the abundance of most taxonomic groups. Fire may have short-term negative impacts on some invertebrate groups that promote desirable invertebrate-driven ecosystem processes, but these effects are likely short-lived, and the resulting environmental mosaic under bison and fire management could support biodiversity over the long-term.

AB  - In grassland ecosystems, grazing by large herbivores is a highly influential process that affects biodiversity by modifying the vegetative environment through selective consumption. Here, we test whether restoration of bison is associated with increased bird diversity and cervid occupancy in networks of riparian habitat within a temperate grassland ecosystem, mixed-grass prairie in northcentral Montana, United States. We used a long time-series of remote sensing imagery to examine changes in riparian vegetation structure in stream networks within bison and cattle pastures. We then assessed how vegetation structure influenced diversity of bird communities and detection rates of mammals in these same riparian networks. We found that percent cover of woody vegetation, and native grasses and forbs increased more rapidly over time in bison pastures, and that these changes in vegetation structure were associated with increased bird diversity and cervid occupancy. In conclusion, bison reintroduction appears to function as a passive riparian restoration strategy with positive diversity outcomes for birds and mammals.

AB  - AimsOvergrazing by excessive deer populations harms native plant communities across most north temperate and boreal regions. In regions where deer impact is particularly severe, fencing is sometimes employed as a conservation measure to safeguard rare and threatened species and ecosystems. Here we examine how forest vascular plant communities have been affected by 21 years of sika deer exclusion by fencing of a 900 ha area.LocationNikko National Park, Tochigi prefecture, Japan.MethodsWe surveyed vascular plant cover in 240 plots and measured forest density on both sides of the fence in stands dominated by larch (Larix kaempferi) and oak (Quercus crispula).ResultsVascular plant species richness was found to be lower in forest areas protected by the fence. At the same time, dwarf bamboo, often the most abundant understory component in Japanese open forests, was taller and denser inside the fence where deer had been excluded. In addition, the lack of natural tree regeneration inside the fence, likely due to strong dwarf bamboo competition, was also notable. This suggests that deer exclusion has benefitted dwarf bamboo while inhibiting the competition of other species, thereby lowering vascular plant richness. Vascular plant communities outside the fence instead seem to be strongly shaped by abundant sika deer; several species found there are known to be unpalatable or grazing tolerant, and there were few tree seedlings.ConclusionThese results show that fencing to protect forest flora against overgrazing may have unintended consequences where there is a risk that competitive species can dominate understory plant communities. Instead of fencing, improved game management to maintain moderate deer populations may be a better strategy for large-scale conservation of forest flora and for promoting natural tree regeneration.

AB  - Forage availability is a key factor regulating large herbivore populations. Global changes in land use and climate may affect the spatiotemporal distribution of forage across the ranges of large herbivores, especially in mountain ecosystems. We test two synergistic hypotheses for how landscape and climate changes from 2001 to 2023 have affected forb and graminoid biomass at the peak of the growing season within and across ecoregions of the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains in Alberta, Canada. The successional change hypothesis posits that the encroachment of woody vegetation into previously herbaceous communities has reduced forage biomass. The disturbance hypothesis proposes that abrupt community shifts caused by fire and timber harvesting have increased forage biomass. Using remote sensing, we quantify temporal changes in land cover and disturbances, NDVI greenness and phenology indices, and spring climate. We then used in situ vegetation data to parameterize generalized linear and gradient boosted regression tree models of forb and graminoid biomass to predict annual peak forb and graminoid biomass. Herbaceous land cover declined while shrub and forest area increased, and the percent of annual biomass within herbaceous areas declined from woody encroachment. Disturbance effects varied, with rising forage biomass in conjunction with increased area of logged forests in the foothills ecoregion, while burned areas declined and had a reduced contribution to the percent of annual biomass. Additionally, spring became warmer across the study area and ended earlier in the alpine, suggesting the effects of long-term climatic shifts may be strongest at higher ecoregions. Disturbance frequency, succession, and climate together shaped forage biomass in space and time. Increased prescribed fire and other ecological restoration actions may be needed to ensure that shifts in forage biomass do not threaten large herbivore persistence in the face of global change.

AB  - Ancient human settlements play an important role in creating heterogeneous African savanna ecosystems through forming nutrient hotspots with increased biodiversity and improved forage quality. However, plant community development and herbivore utilization of these sites after abandonment remain poorly understood. We compared plant and soil parameters in ancient human settlements with off-sites locations. In addition, we set camera traps in ancient settlements and surrounding vegetation to determine their use by herbivores. Grass basal cover, height, biomass and species diversity in ancient settlements had recovered to similar levels with the surrounding landscape. Ancient settlements had small trees (in terms of height and canopy volume), lower tree density and lower species diversity than the surrounding landscape. Soil phosphorus and calcium were higher in ancient settlements than surrounding landscape, while pH, nitrogen, potassium, magnesium and sodium were similar between the two sites. Impala and greater kudu camera sightings were higher in ancient settlements than surrounding vegetation, while warthogs showed no preferential foraging between ancient settlements and surrounding vegetation. We conclude that ancient settlements created functional heterogeneity through altering the structure of savanna vegetation influencing foraging patterns of herbivores such as impala.

AB  - Mammalian herbivores have large-scale impacts on vegetation, altering structure, and species composition, especially in tropical grasslands and savannas. However, there is limited understanding of the potential impacts of mammalian herbivores in tropical wet forests, where they are typically less abundant. We investigated the effects of an introduced mammalian herbivore chital (Axis axis) on vegetation structure, composition and leaf functional traits of tropical evergreen forests of the Andaman Islands, India. Across seven islands, representing a gradient of herbivore densities, increasing chital presence was associated with decreased understory richness, understory density and adult tree richness, but was not related to adult tree density or size class distributions. We also found a significant decrease in community level leaf palatability traits (specific leaf area decreased and leaf thickness increased) with increasing chital habitat use. This community level shift in leaf trait values was better explained by intraspecific variation in leaf traits across islands rather than changes in species composition. In summary, we show persistent long-term impacts of an introduced mammalian herbivore on understory tropical tree communities although there is little impact on adult tree communities. Our results also show that functional traits of species can be altered in response to novel herbivory, even at herbivore densities where there are no detectable impacts on adult forest structure or composition. Such altered functional traits may potentially alter ecosystem functioning in these forests even without changes in vegetation structure. Abstract in Hindi is available with online material.

AB  - Plant species richness is an important property of ecosystems that is altered by grazing. In a semiarid environment, we tested the hypotheses that (1) small-scale herbaceous plant species richness declines linearly with increasing grazing intensity by large ungulates, (2) precipitation and percent sand interact with grazing intensity, and (3) response of herbaceous plant species richness to increasing intensity of ungulate grazing varies with patch productivity. During January-March 2012, we randomly allocated 50, 1.5-m x 1.5-m grazing exclosures within each of six 2500 ha study sites across South Texas, USA. We counted the number of herbaceous plant species and harvested vegetation in 0.25-m(2) plots within exclosures (ungrazed control plots) and in the grazed area outside the exclosures (grazed treatment plots) during October-November 2012-2019. We estimated percent use (grazing intensity) based on the difference in herbaceous plant standing crop between control plots and treatment plots. We selected the negative binomial regression model that best explained the relationship between grazing intensity and herbaceous plant species richness using the Schwarz-Bayesian information criterion. After accounting for the positive effect of precipitation and percent sand on herbaceous plant species richness, species richness/0.25 m(2) increased slightly from 0% to 30% grazing intensity and then declined with increasing grazing intensity. Linear and quadratic responses of herbaceous plant species richness to increasing grazing intensity were greater for the least productive patches (<15.7 g/0.25 m(2)) than for productive patches (>= 15.7 g/0.25 m(2)). Our results followed the pattern predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis model for the effect of grazing intensity on small-scale herbaceous plant species richness.

AB  - Background Shrub-dominated ecosystems in California are widespread and provide invaluable ecosystem services to surrounding human-dominated communities. Yet shrublands, especially those at the wildland-urban interface, are at risk of degradation due to increasing wildfire frequency. Strategically placed fuel breaks are an important fuel management technique for reducing fire risk to neighboring communities and natural landscapes. Fuel breaks in shrub-dominated ecosystems are typically linear features where woody biomass is reduced, thereby providing fire suppression opportunities that limit fire spread. While fuel breaks are important for tactical response to fire, they can also affect the composition and structure of shrubland habitats. To understand the ecological changes resulting from fuel treatments in southern California chaparral, we measured vegetation change associated with fuel management techniques on a recently created fuel break established around the Lake Morena community on the Cleveland National Forest. The area was initially treated with cut and pile burning, then treated with herbicide, and 2 years later was subjected to short-term grazing by 1200 goats. The purpose of this study is to (1) evaluate the compositional and structural differences associated with fuel break creation and (2) quantify compositional shifts in herbaceous and woody vegetation caused by short-duration goat grazing as a method of fuel break maintenance. Results Plots on the fuel break and in untreated adjacent chaparral exhibited significantly different species assemblages. Total herbaceous cover (both native and non-native) was 92 times greater on the fuel break than in adjacent chaparral-dominated wildlands, and native shrub cover was 55.3 times greater in untreated adjacent chaparral than on the fuel break. Goats had a significant impact on reducing native and non-native herbaceous cover (87% reduction in cover, 92% reduction in height), but were ineffective at reducing the cover and height of most woody species such as Adenostoma fasciculatum, Eriogonum fasciculatum, Quercus berberidifolia, and Artemisia tridentata. Conclusion Initial fuel break creation was effective at reducing native woody cover and height, simultaneously giving rise to an abundance and diversity of native and non-native herbaceous species. Targeted goat grazing was successful at reducing herbaceous biomass but was ineffective at reducing woody biomass which is often one of the most important goals for fuel management in chaparral ecosystems. In areas where control of woody biomass is the primary objective, land managers should consider grazing duration and plant species composition when contemplating goats as a tool for fuel break maintenance.

AB  - Forest logging has contributed to the decline of several woodland caribou populations by causing the fragmentation of mature coniferous stands. Such habitat alterations could be worsened by spruce budworm (SBW) outbreaks. Using 6201 vegetation plots from provincial inventories conducted after the last SBW outbreak (1968-1992) in boreal forests of Quebec (Canada), we investigated the influence of SBW-caused tree defoliation and mortality on understory vegetation layers relevant to woodland caribou and its main predators. We found a positive association between severe outbreaks and the cover of most groups of understory plant species, especially in stands that were dominated by balsam fir before the outbreak, where a high canopy openness particularly benefited relatively fast-growing deciduous plants. Such increases in early successional vegetation could provide high-quality forage for moose, which is likely to promote higher wolf densities and increase predation pressure on caribou. SBW outbreaks may thus negatively affect woodland caribou by increasing predation risk, the main factor limiting caribou populations in managed forests. For the near future, we recommend updating the criteria used to define critical caribou habitat to consider the potential impacts of spruce budworm defoliation.

AB  - Understanding and predicting responses of plant community diversity and ecosystem functioning to disturbance is essential to achieving forest conservation and management goals. In recent decades, the abundance and geographic distribution of wild ungulates have expanded in many parts of Europe due to, among other factors, land-use changes, hunting regulations and lack of predators. The study aims to explore the effects of deer browsing and grazing intensity, estimated through a browsing index on woody and semi-woody plants, on understorey vegetation composition, analysing both taxonomic and functional diversity. Specifically, we aim to test the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), which states that plant biodiversity peaks at intermediate levels of browsing intensity regarding plant species richness and functional groups. We also aim to identify species revealing different levels of browsing intensity, accounting for plant functional traits. Our results revealed that intermediate levels of browsing intensity, through species replacement, strongly and positively affected total species richness. This result is consistent with the IDH prediction, but distinct patterns varied across plant functional types. Moreover, increasing browsing intensity favoured disturbance-tolerant species by replacing functional traits. These species were characterised by ruderal traits, including high specific leaf area, low leaf dry matter content, small height and seed mass, annual and short lifespans. However, although browsing intensity increased functional richness and decreased functional redundancy, indicator species analysis revealed that high browsing intensity favoured highly competitive, browsing-tolerant perennial species. These results suggest that annual species may fail to colonise the understorey even if they are favoured by deer browsing, thereby affecting the functioning and the stability of ecosystem, with a potential homogenisation of understorey vegetation. Although confounding effects cannot be ruled out (e.g., local vegetation structure and diversity), our study highlights the need to consider functional diversity when assessing deer effects on vegetation to draw a complete picture of plant-large herbivore interactions.

AB  - 'Pleistocene rewilding' refers to the concept of restoring ecosystems to their state during the Pleistocene epoch, by (re-)introducing species or their close relatives that were present during that time, in an effort to revive ecological processes that existed before human-driven extinctions. This concept is highly controversial for both ethical and ecological reasons. Here I review evidence of recent northward range expansions of various large land mammals in boreal Eurasia, and discuss whether this provides evidence that rewilding projects might be justified and feasible. Around 100 years ago, the native boreal fauna of Eurasia included five species of large land mammals: moose Alces alces, brown bear Ursus arctos, wolf Canis lupus, reindeer Rangifer tarandus, and snow sheep Ovis nivicola, but since then the list has expanded. This is due to the introduction of bison Bison bonasus, Bison bison, muskox Ovibos moschatus, non-native deer, and feral horses, as well as the northward expansion of wild boar Sus scrofa, roe deer Capreolus capreolus, Capreolus pygargus, and red deer Cervus canadensis. In addition, several southern species temporarily occurred in the north, including tiger Panthera tigris, sika deer Cervus nippon, and yak Bos grunniens. This ongoing enrichment of the boreal fauna is reminiscent to Pleistocene rewilding. However, so far, the abundance of expanding large mammals species remains low. Large-scale projects on Pleistocene rewilding are labor-intensive, expensive, and not popular enough to receive support, and therefore their realization is problematic

AB  - QuestionOverbrowsing by abundant deer reshapes the composition of forests from palatable native species to browse-tolerant species, leading to simplified understories with reduced biodiversity. Here, we ask whether geologic refugia (e.g., tall boulders) will provide a haven for vulnerable plant species to escape browsing pressure from high populations of native deer.LocationHuron Mountains, Michigan, USA.MethodsWe compared the percent cover, species richness, and Shannon diversity of all plant species on tall boulders to adjacent fenced exclosures and to forest floor reference plots to quantify the degree to which deer impact one of the largest remaining tracts of old-growth forests in the Eastern United States.ResultsWe found that boulders contained 60% higher richness and diversity than reference plots, as well as a more diverse mix of midstory species, shrubs, and forbs. Seven-year-old exclosure and reference plots were nearly indistinguishable from each other and were dominated by Acer saccharum and other browse-tolerant species.ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that boulders are a highly effective, though rarely used, proxy or bioassay of the degree to which chronic overbrowsing creates impoverished understories composed of browse-tolerant or unpalatable species. Our findings highlight the significance of refugia as a haven from overbrowsing for vulnerable plant species and emphasize the importance of using exclosures alongside refugia.

AB  - Over a quarter of the world's land surface is grazed by cattle and other livestock, which are replacing wild herbivores, potentially impairing ecosystem structure, and functions. Previous research suggests that cattle at moderate stocking rates can functionally replace wild herbivores in shaping understory communities. However, it is uncertain whether this is also true under high stocking rates and the effects of wild herbivore on plant communities are moderate, enhanced, or simply additive to the effects of cattle at high stocking rates. To evaluate the influence of cattle stocking rates on the ability of cattle to functionally replace wild herbivores and test for interactive effects between cattle and wild herbivores in shaping understory vegetation, we assessed herbaceous vegetation in a long-term exclosure experiment in a semi-arid savanna in central Kenya that selectively excludes wild mesoherbivores (50-1000 kg) and megaherbivores (elephant and giraffe). We tested the effects of cattle stocking rate (zero/moderate/high) on herbaceous vegetation (diversity, composition, leafiness). We also tested how those effects depend on the presence of wild mesoherbivores and megaherbivores. We found that herbaceous community composition (primary ordination axis) was better explained by the presence/absence of herbivore types than by total herbivory, suggesting that herbivore identity is a more important determinant of community composition than total herbivory at high cattle stocking rates. The combination of wild mesoherbivores and cattle stocked at high rates led to increased bare ground and annual grass cover, reduced perennial grass cover and understory leafiness, and enhanced understory diversity. These shifts were weaker or absent when cattle were stocked at high stocking rates in the absence of wild mesoherbivores. Megaherbivores tempered the effects of cattle stocked at high rates on herbaceous community composition but amplified the effects of high cattle stocking rate on bare ground and understory diversity. Our results show that cattle at high stocking rates do not functionally replace wild herbivores in shaping savanna herbaceous communities contrary to previous findings at moderate stocking rates. In mixed-use rangelands, interactions between cattle stocking rate and wild herbivore presence can lead to non-additive vegetation responses with important implications for both wildlife conservation and livestock production.

AB  - Overabundant Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) are a threat to forest regeneration due to browse on seedlings of preferred species. We investigated the deer-management program of Cincinnati Parks (Ohio) to determine if controlled hunting reduced deer density enough to facilitate tree regeneration. We surveyed seedlings, saplings, trees, palatable herbs, and invasive shrubs in 5 sites. In all sites, sapling densities were <1000/ha, thus insufficient for forest regeneration. Four sites had seedling densities >2500/ha, considered sufficient for regeneration. However, when taxa that cannot contribute to future canopies (Fraxinus [ash], Asimina triloba [Pawpaw]) were excluded, all sites were below the density necessary for regeneration. Species preferred by White-tailed Deer were common in the canopy of the forests, but sparse in the seedling and sapling layers, suggesting deer will shift tree species composition. Sites also had low cover of herb species preferred by deer. Among sites, reduction of palatable herb cover was significantly associated with both recent deer density and invasive shrub cover, while tree-seedling density showed a negative trend with deer density. Our findings indicate management has not decreased deer populations sufficiently in the Cincinnati Parks to promote vegetation regeneration. Deer exclusion or underplanting of protected tree seedlings are needed to facilitate tree regeneration.

AB  - The effect of wild ungulate density on ecosystems varies according to different factors: climate and physiography conditions, forest type, management history, and herbivore identity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of historically high densities of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) on the soil fungal communities in Mediterranean ecosystems using 30 paired plots, open on the one hand and exclosure plots on the other one. Plots were established at the end of 2020 in a perimeter -fenced hunting estate of 6600 ha in Toledo, Spain. Three months after plots were established, we analysed fungal communities in 60 soil samples using Illumina 250 -bp paired -end sequencing. We estimated changes in total fungal richness and in the richness of trophic groups through Linear Mixed Effects models using fenced/unfenced type and deer habitat use as fixed variables and the location of the plots and the main tree host species as random variables. Fungal composition was analysed using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate ANOVA; edaphic characteristics were incorporated to explain differences. Soil fungal communities were not differentially affected by excluding ungulates for three months. Areas with high deer densities had a richer saprotrophic community and where lowland environments were dominated by the main tree hosts Quercus faginea and Quercus ilex. Arbutus unedo was found in mountain areas where there was less herbivore pressure, a greater richness of ectomycorrhizal and lichenized fungi and soils positively associated to nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and organic matter levels.

AB  - Increasing food production while avoiding negative impacts on biodiversity constitutes one of the main challenges of our time. Traditional silvopastoral systems like Iberian oak savannas ("dehesas") set an example, where free-range livestock has been reared for centuries while preserving a high natural value. Nevertheless, factors decreasing productivity need to be addressed, one being acorn losses provoked by pest insects. An increased and focalized grazing by livestock on infested acorns would kill the larvae inside and decrease pest numbers, but increased livestock densities could have undesired side effects on ground arthropod communities as a whole. We designed an experimental setup including areas under trees with livestock exclosures of different ages (shortterm: 1-year exclusion, long-term: 10-year exclusion), along with controls (continuous grazing), using DNA metabarcoding (mitochondrial markers COI and 16S) to rapidly assess arthropod communities' composition. Livestock removal quickly increased grass cover and arthropod taxonomic richness and diversity, which was already higher in short-term (1-year exclosures) than beneath the canopies of control trees. Interestingly, arthropod diversity was not highest at long-term exclosures (>= 10 years), although their community composition was the most distinct. Also, regardless of treatment, we found that functional diversity strongly correlated with the vegetation structure, being higher at trees beneath which there was higher grass cover and taller herbs. Overall, the taxonomic diversity peak at short term exclosures would support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which relates it with the higher microhabitat heterogeneity at moderately disturbed areas. Thus, we propose a rotatory livestock management in dehesas: plots with increased grazing should co-exist with temporal short-term exclosures. Ideally, a few long-term excluded areas should be also kept for the singularity of their arthropod communities. This strategy would make possible the combination of biological pest control and arthropod conservation in Iberian dehesas.

AB  - When exotic species are introduced to new environments, they often have a competitive advantage over native species. In northern Australia, pigs, cattle, and water buffalo have established widespread, feral populations. As ungulates have high water requirements, they typically congregate near waterpoints. We used a fencing experiment to test whether native macropods preferentially visited savanna waterholes where large ungulates were excluded. We also investigated whether water scarcity affected the visitation behaviour and temporal activity patterns of herbivores at waterholes and whether increasing prey aggregation at waterholes increased dingo presence. We found that macropods did not use fenced waterholes preferentially over unfenced ones. Cattle presence at waterholes increased as water became scarce, while macropod and pig presence peaked in the middle of the dry season. Macropod activity declined rapidly at the end of the dry season when cattle activity was greatest, suggesting that macropods may avoid waterholes in areas utilised by cattle when competition for resources is high. Macropods and all ungulates visited waterholes more during a drought year compared to an average rainfall year. Despite increasing prey activity, dingo presence at waterholes did not increase when water became scarce. However, dingo presence increased significantly on moonless nights. Our results suggest that competition between macropods and ungulates may intensify during periods of water scarcity. Climate change and pastoral intensification are likely to increase competition for resources between ungulates and macropods in Australian savannas, potentially threatening macropod populations across the landscape in the future. Significance statement In northern Australia, feral populations of pigs, cattle, and water buffalo compete with native wildlife for access to water sources. As interspecific competition favours species with a size advantage, we tested whether kangaroos and wallabies (macropods) preferentially use waterholes where large ungulates (cattle and buffalo) were excluded. We found that macropods avoided waterholes when cattle presence was high but did not preferentially use waterholes where livestock were excluded. When water scarcity peaked during a drought, macropods and all three feral ungulate species visited waterholes more. However, increased prey presence at waterholes during the drought did not correspond with increased predator (dingo) presence. Our study advances the understanding of behavioural interactions between invasive and native species at important shared resources, and how this may affect wildlife conservation in an increasingly unpredictable environment.

AB  - Soil disturbances caused by large animals impact soil biodiversity and potentially alter forest ecosystem functioning and productivity. However, most studies have focused on the effects of wild boar infestations on aboveground vegetation and soil physical and chemical properties. Little is known about the influence of wild boar grubbing on the soil faunal community within forested ecosystems. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a long-term (10-year) exclosure experiment to investigate the responses of soil nematode communities to wild boar grubbing and seasonal variations in a broad-leaved Korean pine forest in Changbai Mountain, China. The results indicated that wild boar grubbing did not significantly impact soil nematode abundance, genus richness, diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson index, and evenness index), and ecological indices (enrichment index, channel index, structural index, and basal index). However, we observed that grubbing reduced the relative abundance of plant parasites while increased that of bacterivores and the maturity index (MI), leading to changes in nematode community composition. Notably, the influence of grubbing was more pronounced in the spring than in the autumn. Although season itself did not significantly affect soil nematode genus richness and diversity indices, it did affect soil nematode relative abundance, bacterivores, omnivorespredators, plant parasites, K-strategistis, r-strategistis, MI, enrichment index, and channel index. Long-term wild boar grubbing appeared to mitigate seasonal effects on soil nematode communities, resulting in higher MI and increased stability in nematode community abundance. Our findings suggest that changes in soil parameters, such as soil NH4+, soil pH, and soil NO3-, likely mediate the observed impact of wild boars on the soil nematode community. In summary, our study demonstrated that wild boar grubbing altered the structure of soil nematode communities, albeit with seasonal variations, indicating that the effects of wild boar activity on forest soil ecosystems influence biogeochemical cycles through changes in nematode community composition rather than nematode genera richness.

AB  - 1. Forest harvesting causes habitat loss and alteration and can change predator-prey dynamics. In Canada, forest harvesting has shifted the distribution and abundance of ungulates (deer, elk and moose) that prefer early seral forest, resulting in unsustainable caribou predation by shared predators (bears, cougars and wolves). Long-term solutions for caribou recovery require management to reduce ungulate prey species within caribou ranges. Silviculture practices applied after forest harvesting directly affect the amount of forage available in harvested areas, and therefore influence ungulate distribution, but few studies have completed detailed assessments on how specific treatments of site preparation, planting and stand tending influence ungulate use of harvest blocks.2. We used camera traps, silviculture data, GIS-derived habitat and disturbance data, and detailed vegetation data collected at field sites to investigate ungulate occurrence in harvest blocks in west-central Alberta, Canada. We compared seasonal ungulate occurrence and investigated how site-specific characteristics, the surrounding habitat and disturbance density, and fine-scale silviculture treatments influenced ungulate occurrence in blocks.3. Deer, elk and moose occurrence was higher in summer compared to winter. Elk, moose and white-tailed deer occurrence was higher in blocks with greater availability of specific forage species. Moose occurrence was higher in blocks with a lower road density in the surrounding area, and white-tailed deer occurrence was higher in blocks further from seismic lines and with a lower proportion of harvest blocks in the surrounding area.4. Deer, elk and moose occurrence was higher in younger harvest blocks. Mule deer and white-tailed deer occurrence was lower in blocks with higher planting densities of lodgepole pine, and mule deer occurrence was also lower in blocks that had been stand tended.5. Our study provides detailed information on ungulate response to fine-scale silviculture methods used in Alberta, directly linking wildlife occurrence to forestry practices, and providing practical scientific information to inform sustainable forestry. Translating this research into practical landscape management decisions could benefit boreal biodiversity, including threatened species like caribou, and culturally and economically important species like deer, elk and moose.

AB  - Simple Summary: The wild terrestrial herbivore community (primarily insects and mammals) at a location should be affected by vegetation changes with anthropogenic climate change. Expected warmer and drier conditions should lead to a lower quantity and nutritional quality of plants. For 40 years, we studied the climate, the vegetation, and the assemblage of native herbivores (grasshoppers, microtine rodents, pronghorn, whitetail, mule deer, bighorn sheep, elk, and bison) in a grassland (National Bison Range, Charlo, MT, USA). Contrary to climate change expectations, forage quantity and quality increased, with grass abundance increasing more than broad-leaf plants decreased. This increased herbivory by nearly 20%, with grass-feeding herbivore abundance increasing (some grasshoppers, microtine rodents, bighorn sheep, elk, bison), while broad-leaf-feeding herbivores decreased (some grasshoppers, pronghorn, whitetail, and mule deer). Rather than studying the responses of single herbivore species, the assemblage needs to be studied, as some species may increase in abundance, and others may decrease. Historically, this assemblage of herbivores had grasshoppers consuming nearly 50% more vegetation than the mammals, but with climate change, grasshopper herbivory relative to mammals declined nearly 70%. Therefore, ecosystem dynamics have been altered by climate change over a short period, which has management consequences as desirable (e.g., endangered and harvested species) and undesirable species (e.g., pests) may differentially be affected. Wild herbivore responses to anthropogenic climate change are often projected to be habitat and geographic range shifts as warmer conditions reduce the quantity and nutritional quality of forage plants, which makes species presence/absence a focus. Since 1978, herbivore abundances at the National Bison Range, MT, USA, were measured for grasshoppers (catch-effort), microtine rodents (runway density), and ungulates (drives and round-ups), along with climate and vegetation quantity (biomass) and quality (nitrogen content and chemical solubility related to digestibility). Counter to expectation with warming and drying, forage biomass increased as grass biomass increased more than dicot biomass decreased, and forage quality (solubility) increased. Consequently, herbivores that consume a grass diet (>25% grass: certain grasshoppers, microtines, bighorn sheep, elk, bison) increased in abundance, while herbivores consuming less grass declined (certain grasshoppers, pronghorn, whitetail, and mule deer). The result is an 18% increase in herbivore abundance and herbivory, counter to climate change expectations. Historically, grasshoppers consumed 46% more vegetation than mammals; now, they consume only 14% more, as grasshoppers did not increase as expected with climate change. Therefore, herbivores respond rapidly to climate-induced vegetation changes, and this is not a simple loss/addition of species, but changing trophic dynamics, which requires more knowledge of ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Through their foraging and habitat selection, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) can have profound effects on forest plant communities that produce persistent legacy effects. To examine the duration of persistence of potential legacy effects, we investigated the long-term consequences of deer herbivory in plant communities following canopy gap creation in a hemlock-northern hardwood forest in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Twenty artificial canopy gaps were created during the winter of 2002-03: seven small gaps (50-150 m(2)), seven medium gaps (151-250 m(2)), and six large gaps (251-450 m(2)). Herbaceous layer communities were sampled within arrays of exclosed and nonexclosed sample plots, established within a few years of gap creation, during the summer of 2020 and compared to a previous study conducted in 2007. Eighteen years following canopy gap creation, herbaceous layer communities exhibited both persistent and transient legacies of deer herbivory. Persistent legacies included similarity of small to large gaps compositionally and low abundance of browse-sensitive species outside of exclosures. Transient patterns included initial high graminoid cover and low cover of trees in the ground layer outside of exclosures and differences in diversity between gap size classes. Some emergent patterns were also observed, including declining floristic quality indices over time but sustained high occurrence of a number of species with moderately high coefficients of conservatism on deer access plots, albeit at low abundance. Differential compositional trajectories emerged based on gap-specific tree species colonization patterns. Our results suggest that through differential foraging patch selection and control of woody regeneration, white-tailed deer may alter or reinforce patterns of dominance depending on initial conditions. These interactions may result in context-specific persistent, transient, and emergent dynamics as plant communities recover from canopy disturbance.

AB  - Surveillance of endoparasites at the host community level is rarely reported for ungulates. Yet, changes in the composition and abundance of species in ungulate assemblages, coupled with environmental and climate change, bring into focus the need for baseline data on endoparasite occurrence in host species at the community level. We investigated the prevalence and intensity of eggs of endoparasites in feces of a dynamic boreal ungulate community in Yukon, Canada, that included reintroduced bison (Bison bison), as well as introduced elk (Cervus canadensis), naturally colonizing mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and resident populations of caribou (Rangifer tarandus), moose (Alces americanus), and thinhorn sheep (Ovis dalli). We also examined the change in endoparasite prevalence and intensity in bison fecal samples collected eight years apart. The prevalence of eggs detected in feces differed across species for most endoparasite groups. We also provide new records of several endoparasites in novel hosts or new geographic records. We detected a substantially greater prevalence and intensity of trichostrongyle-type eggs in bison feces between samples collected eight years apart. Our data emphasize the need for targeted pathogen surveillance programs to monitor the movement of various ungulate and associated endoparasites. This is particularly pertinent since our data potentially supports evidence for the continued northward expansion and host switching of protostrongylid species, which may have health implications for animals at a new interface.

AB  - Aim Land use is the foremost cause of global biodiversity decline, but species do not respond equally to land-use practices. Instead, it is suggested that responses vary with species traits, but long-term data on the trait-mediated effects of land use on communities are scarce. Here we study how forest understorey communities have been affected by two land-use practices during 4-5 decades, and whether changes in plant diversity are related to changes in functional composition. Location Finland. Time period 1968-2019. Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Methods We resurveyed 245 vegetation plots in boreal herb-rich forest understories, and used hierarchical Bayesian linear models to relate changes in diversity, species composition, average plant size, and leaf economic traits to reindeer abundance, forest management intensity, and changes in climate, canopy cover and composition. We also studied the relationship between species evenness and plant size across both space and time. Results Intensively managed forests decreased in species richness and had increased turnover, but management did not affect functional composition. Increased reindeer densities corresponded with increased leaf dry matter content, evenness and diversity, and decreased height and specific leaf area. Successional development in the canopy was associated with increased specific leaf area and decreased leaf dry matter content and height in the understorey over the study period. Effects of reindeer abundance and canopy density on diversity were partially mediated by vegetation height, which had a negative relationship with evenness across both space and time. Observed changes in climate had no discernible effect on any variable. Main conclusions Functional traits are useful in connecting vegetation changes to the mechanisms that drive them, and provide unique information compared to turnover and diversity metrics. These trait-dependent selection effects could inform which species benefit and which suffer from land-use changes and explain observed biodiversity changes under global change.

AB  - Vegetation over-foraged by deer shows limited recovery potential for some species, even when exclosures are constructed. Turf and topsoil translocation might aid in restoring this vegetation. We evaluated the effectiveness of turf and topsoil translocation in restoring the overgrazed understory herbaceous vegetation in Saorigahara, covered by coniferous/broadleaf deciduous mixed forest in Shikoku, Japan. The herbaceous vegetation there has been degraded by overgrazing, but it has recovered in an exclosure constructed in 2008 (E2008). In November 2021 and March 2022, turf and topsoil of herbaceous communities within the E2008 were translocated to exclosures constructed in 2021. We monitored the recovery of the herbaceous communities, evaluating the impacts of the light environment, the translocation season, and the presence of water puddles, while also comparing the effectiveness of turf and topsoil translocations. We selected 22 herbaceous species, which have been identified within E2008 during 2008-2018, as the restoration target species. Translocated plots exhibited higher restoration in terms of the number of species, coverage, and maximum plant height of the restoration target species compared to the plots where translocations were not implemented. Nine restoration target species did not recover in any of the plots. The restoration target species showed better recovery in plots translocated in November 2021 and in turf translocated plots. This study indicates that turf translocation is more effective in restoring overgrazed understory herbaceous vegetation than merely constructing exclosures.

AB  - QuestionHow does naturalistic grazing (trophic rewilding with large herbivores), in contrast to mowing and free succession (no grazing), affect plant community composition and species richness in temperate grassland grazed by semi-feral cattle and horses? LocationMols Laboratory, Denmark. MethodsWe investigated grazing exclosures in the rewilding area of the Mols Laboratory, four years after its establishment. We focused on moist to dry grassland vegetation, that is, excluding scrub and woodland. Each experimental block consisted of five 5 x 9 m plots, representing four fenced treatments, that is, summer-only grazing, winter-only grazing, full exclosure with annual autumn mowing and full exclosure with passive succession. The matrix (the fifth treatment) was grazed by large herbivores at close-to-natural densities, that is, regulated bottom-up by the carrying capacity of the area. Hence, even the seasonal grazing treatments were grazed at close-to-natural animal density. Quantitative plant community composition was assessed using the point-intercept method in 25 x 25 cm quadrats, supplemented with biomass calibration models based on additional quadrats, in which above-ground plant biomass was harvested after recording and the material sorted to species and weighed. Uniqueness was assessed as the sum of inverse range sizes for constituent species (unicity). ResultsWe found an appreciably higher plant species richness in grazing treatments than under both annual mowing and full exclosure, but only minor differences between seasonal grazing treatments. Uniqueness was highest in year-round and winter-only grazing and lowest in summer-only grazing. The forb:graminoid ratio tended to be high in the winter-only grazing treatment, whereas annual mowing was associated with dominance of graminoids over forbs. Full-exclosure plots had accumulation of litter and the lowest species richness. Initial heterogeneity between plots within blocks and a systematic difference between blocks in moist and dry grasslands may have diluted treatment effects at this early point after the onset of the experiment. Data analysis using the biomass estimates derived from the calibration models yielded only minor differences in the patterns described above, when compared to the results obtained using the raw number of intercepts. ConclusionsNaturalistic grazing is a goal in itself in ecological restoration, but also proposed as an efficient management tool to promote conservation of grassland plants and communities. We found both plant species richness and the prevalence of regionally rarer species (uni) to be higher with grazing than mowing or abandonment. Similarly, the tendency for forbs to prevail under grazing may translate into enhanced floral resources for anthophilous insects. Summer-only grazing at low density of large herbivores was not significantly different from winter-only and year-round grazing, but this treatment was much closer to natural grazing than intensive summer grazing typical of agri-environmental practices.

AB  - Fire frequency affects vegetation structure and composition in savannah- woodlands, with the potential indirect consequence of affecting the habitat choice and space use of large mammals. Understanding these responses can assist with the development of appropriate fire management policies to conserve co-existing species with different habitat requirements. In a natural experiment in Majete Wildlife Reserve, Malawi, we compared vegetation composition, woody plant structure and large (>5 kg) mammal assemblages on 10 frequently and 10 infrequently burnt 30-ha plots, that had fire return intervals of 6 years, respectively, between 2001 and 2019. Fire frequency had little effect on woody plant composition, but did affect grass species composition. Frequent burning reduced mean tree height from 4 to 3 m, woody plant cover from 59% to 35%, and resulted in the dominance of short-statured, less-palatable grasses. Many mammal species showed clear preferences for either frequently burnt (e.g. buffalo, zebra, kudu, impala and sable) or infrequently burnt (e.g. nyala, bush pig, baboon, common duiker and vervet monkey) areas, while others (e.g. elephants and black rhinoceros) were not selective. We conclude that establishing a mosaic of patches exposed to different fire frequencies would allow for the persistence of all mammal species in the area by creating an optimal range of habitat types.

AB  - Forest harvesting alters habitat, impacts wildlife, and disrupts ecosystem function. Across the boreal forest of Canada, forest harvesting affects ungulate prey species and their predators, with cascading impacts on other species, including threatened woodland caribou. We used camera and vegetation data and occupancy modeling to investigate what characteristics in and around forestry harvest blocks influenced the occupancy and co-occurrence of primary prey (elk, moose, mule deer, white-tailed deer) and predators (black bear, cougar, grizzly bear, wolf) in harvest blocks. Occupancy was linked to forage, the surrounding habitat and anthropogenic disturbance, and silviculture practices. Black and grizzly bear occupancy was influenced by the presence of deer, and bear-deer co-occurrence was influenced by site-specific silviculture practices and surrounding anthropogenic disturbance. In the context of caribou recovery, our results indicate that forestry within caribou ranges could consider site-specific silviculture practices and landscape-level planning to reduce use of harvest blocks by primary prey. Future caribou recovery efforts may also consider the roles of deer and bears in caribou predation risk. Our study provides the first insights into the impacts of forestry and silviculture on boreal forest predator-prey co-occurrence and provides practical management applications to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the boreal forest ecosystem into the future.

AB  - Forests are major carbon (C) sinks, but their ability to sequester C and thus mitigate climate change, varies with the environment, disturbance regime, and biotic interactions. Herbivory by invasive, nonnative ungulates can have profound ecosystem effects, yet its consequences for forest C stocks remain poorly understood. We determined the impact of invasive ungulates on C pools, both above- and belowground (to 30 cm), and on forest structure and diversity using 26 paired long-term (>20 years) ungulate exclosures and adjacent unfenced control plots located in native temperate rainforests across New Zealand, spanning 36-41 degrees S. Total ecosystem C was similar between ungulate exclosure (299.93 +/- 25.94 Mg C ha(-1)) and unfenced control (324.60 +/- 38.39 Mg C ha(-1)) plots. Most (60%) variation in total ecosystem C was explained by the biomass of the largest tree (mean diameter at breast height [dbh]: 88 cm) within each plot. Ungulate exclusion increased the abundance and diversity of saplings and small trees (dbh >= 2.5, <10 cm) compared with unfenced controls, but these accounted for similar to 5% of total ecosystem C, demonstrating that a few, large trees dominate the total forest ecosystem C but are unaffected by invasive ungulates at a timescale of 20-50 years. However, changes in understory C pools, species composition, and functional diversity did occur following long-term ungulate exclusion. Our findings suggest that, although the removal of invasive herbivores may not affect total forest C at the decadal scale, major shifts in the diversity and composition of regenerating species will have longer term consequences for ecosystem processes and forest C.

AB  - Ungulate browsing is a key disturbance process influencing forest structure and composition, with the potential to alter forest resilience following canopy disturbance. We examined the effects of l5 years of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces americana) browsing in regenerating temperate forests of the northeastern U.S. We tested the alternative hypotheses that woody vegetation is (1) resilient to browsing, with structure and composition similar after stems have grown above the browser trap or (2) altered by browsing, resulting in long-term legacy effects. Three browser treatments-ungulate exclusion, deer, and deer + moose-were established in seven clear-cut stands. Basal area and species diversity did not differ significantly among treatments after 15 years, indicating resilience, whereas the abundance of two tree species was altered: pin cherry (Prunus pensylvanica) was lower by 3-fold in deer + moose plots, while white pine (Pinus strobus) was greater by over 5-fold. Forb cover was half as abundant in deer + moose plots compared to ungulate exclusion, while forb richness remained unaffected. Our results suggest that ungulate browsing during stand initiation can alter successional trajectories while still being compatible with long-term forest resilience; however, there are potential trade-offs between woody plant resilience and the vigor of the herbaceous layer when large herbivores are present. With relatively small long-term effects on structure and diversity and by accelerating succession towards longer-lived tree species, deer + moose browsing in northern temperate forests may be less of a management concern than is generally assumed.

AB  - Here, we aimed to define ecological indicators of environmental change for monitoring the effect of a reintroduced species, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), over the vegetation of a natural protected area with contrasting habitats. This species was reintroduced 30 years ago in the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park, Spain, and its population has since grown exponentially, reaching high densities in some areas. We tested the suitability of two complementary indicators: browsing damage on woody species and the percentage of moss cover loss on rocky outcrops. For this purpose, we used a mathematical approach to zone the natural protected area according to the historical presence of the species and established five different Iberian ibex pressure classes (Classes I-V). Our results showed a direct link between Iberian ibex pressure and vegetation status. Model predictions suggested 10% moss loss in the areas with low pressure (Class I) but 64% loss in the areas with high pressure (Class III), mostly due to ungulate trampling on rocks. Similarly, browsing damage increased with increasing pressure classes for different woody species. Low palatable plant species such as Pinus spp. showed little change in browsing damage for increasing ungulate pressure whereas more palatable plants (e.g., Erica arborea) showed significantly greater browsing damage variation across pressure classes (i.e., high sensitive to herbivory pressure). Both, moss cover on rocks and widely distributed palatable woody plants proved useful ecological indicators for monitoring ungulate populations in mountainous areas with a diverse array of habitats (e.g., rocky vs. woody). This methodology may help select the most suitable indicators for each type of ecosystem or dominant habitat in ungulate-dominated ecosystems.

AB  - Temperate savannas are unique, biodiverse ecosystems that have undergone extensive habitat conversion globally. In the midwestern United States, 99% of historic oak savanna area has been lost. Most remaining patches of savanna are degraded due to woody encroachment following the removal of both fire and large herbivore disturbances from the landscape. Restoring degraded savanna remnants is challenging because we lack an understanding of how to best apply contemporary restoration tools to mimic historic disturbance dynamics. To that end, we evaluated the outcomes of ongoing oak savanna restorations that have received a gradient of restoration actions: 1) no management, 2) tree thinning, 3) thinning + burning, and 4) thinning + burning + cattle grazing. We assessed several metrics of restoration success including canopy, shrub, herbaceous, and non-native cover, herbaceous diversity, and plant community composition. We found that layering restoration ap-proaches achieved certain, but not all, structural vegetation goals. Compared to no management, thinning and fire successfully increased canopy openness, herbaceous cover, and herbaceous diversity, but had the unwanted effect of increased shrub cover. The addition of low-intensity cattle grazing did not improve structural outcomes. We also found that each restoration treatment left a unique signature on understory plant community compo-sition. Unmanaged and thin-only treatments were characterized by tree saplings and woodland herbs, while burned and grazed treatments were defined by shrubs and savanna-associate species. We conclude that rein-troducing multiple disturbances does not guarantee the successful restoration of disturbance-dependent eco-systems such as oak savannas. Restoration outcomes are not dictated by how many management approaches are applied, but rather, the nuances of how they are applied such as burn season and livestock density.

AB  - Different species-specific traits of woody plant species, feeding preferences of herbivores together with resulting effects on plant competition are expected to translate into different plant community structures and expressions of biodiversity. We studied the diversity of woody plant species (trees and shrubs) and structural diversity of forest trees, using a 30-year and an 18-year dataset of ungulate exclosure-control plot pairs in a mixed alpine forest community in Austria. We surveyed the tallest individuals per tree species and plot and analyzed the collective of top-height individuals per plot pair. Incidence data for exclosure and control plots were aggregated. Comparing species diversity and diversity of height classes on the plots throughout time, we calculated diversity profiles based on Hill numbers. Diversity of top height individuals and structural diversity, expressed by height classes, were two diversity aspects that differed between exclosures and control plots. Other diversity estimates of woody plant species showed huge variation without significant differences between plots. Height growth was significantly suppressed by ungulate herbivory. Effects of ungulate herbivores in forest ecosystems are highly complex and context-dependent and thus not reducible to simple top-down forces. Long-term surveys provide data that reflect "ultimate" effects of herbivory interacting with other drivers of community dynamics.

AB  - Spiders play a key role in forest food webs, where they regulate decomposer populations and may act as predators of pests and disease vectors. Spider community composition is determined in part by vegetation structure. Therefore, the exclusion of large mammals, such as deer and wild boar, through wildlife fencing may affect the composition of spider communities and their prey in forest ecosystems. Web-building spiders and their prey were hand-collected in plots that had been fenced for three years, as well as adjacent unfenced plots in a mixed temperate forest in north-eastern Germany. Additionally, spiders in the leaf litter were sampled in fenced and unfenced subareas by sieving litter. Wildlife fencing did not significantly affect spider densities or community composition per microhabitat. However, fencing affected the cover of different microhabitats significantly as there was a higher density of larger trees and higher leaflitter cover in fenced plots while there was a higher percentage of bare ground and deadwood in unfenced plots. Spider communities and their prey composition differed significantly between microhabitats (deciduous trees, coniferous trees, dead wood, understory vegetation, leaf litter) independent of fencing. Thysanoptera prey was mainly caught by spiders on coniferous trees and in the understory vegetation. Heteroptera prey were captured most frequently in the understory vegetation while Hymenoptera (excl. Formicidae) prey were mostly caught on deciduous trees. Several spider species showed a preference between deciduous and coniferous trees in the mixed forest. Wildlife fencing alters the vegetation structure of mixed forests and has indirect effects on spider communities and their role in forest food webs due to alteration of microhabitat availability.

AB  - Introduced ungulates can impact forest structure and composition. We tested in rainforests of New Caledonia if exclosure of invasive ungulates (Javan rusa deer Rusa timorensis russa and feral pigs Sus (scrofa) domesticus) increased abundance, species richness and diversity of native plants by comparing 19 plots of 10 m2 in four study areas that were protected from browsing for 7 years with 76 unprotected plots. Abundance, species richness and diversity of native plants of 20-60 cm of height were higher in protected plots compared to unprotected plots. We attribute the measured negative impact mainly to deer as the positive effect of exclosures was highest in the study area with the highest deer abundance and browsing rate. The exclosures were also beneficial in a secondary forest with medium deer abundance whereas in old-growth forest with medium deer abundance we could not detect an effect of the exclosures. We conclude that protecting even small areas from browsing by invasive ungulates can increase biodiversity and that exclosures are most beneficial at high deer abundance and in secondary habitats.

AB  - Large herbivores introduced to novel habitats can cause major ecosystem impacts. While impacts of overabundant deer have been documented around the world, there are few examples from Australia, where deer are non-native and natural predators are absent.Here, we outline the impacts of sambar deer in wet eucalypt forest understoreys of the Yarra Ranges National Park, south-eastern Australia. Using data obtained from a full and partial (permitting native herbivores) exclusion experiment over four years, we (i) demonstrate differences between native herbivore and introduced deer browsing, (ii) identify plant species commonly browsed by deer, and (iii) provide evidence that vegetation condition can recover in the absence of deer.While species richness and composition were unaffected, the exclusion of deer led to substantial recovery of several attributes of forest understorey vegetation. Treatments excluding deer (partial and full exclosures) saw increases in the cover of understorey trees, shrubs, ferns and climbers. Within the 1-2 m height class (the primary deer browse zone), vegetation cover-abundance increased 3-4 fold over time in full and partial exclusion plots compared to non-exclusion controls.Tree ferns (Dicksonia antarctica and Cyathea australis) were particularly impacted by deer, and browsing impacts to tree ferns were dramatically reduced from similar to 50% of fronds browsed to negligible levels with deer exclusion. Deer exclusion also saw substantial reductions in browsing to individual trees, shrubs and ground ferns. The growth of commonly browsed trees, e.g. Pomaderris aspera, were demonstrably higher in partial and full exclosures than unfenced control plots. The low levels of browsing on trees and shrubs that persisted in partial exclosures probably indicates the background levels of browsing pressure attributable to native herbivores in these forests.In the absence of effective deer control, commonly browsed understorey trees, shrubs and tree ferns are likely to decrease substantially in cover over coming decades, potentially leading to increased light availability, drying of the understorey, and increased susceptibility to wildfire. The potential cascading ecological effects of unabated and increasing deer impacts may be substantial and pose major challenges to forest management.Despite management culls and recreational hunting in recent years, deer populations are increasing across Australia. As sambar populations increase, ecological impacts are likely to exacerbate. It is therefore critically important to reduce sambar numbers, before negative and potentially irreversible changes occur to forest structure, composition and function.

AB  - An unusual problem at the extreme edges of Earth involves marginalized people and associated livelihoods when their domestic stock is lost to wild ancestors. Animosity to wildlife results due to economic costs, personal injury, and death. Despite IUCN recognition of biodiversity at a policy front, justice and equity for humans have not been well integrated in these realms. In particular, Tibetans, Uyghurs, Changpas, Nepalis, Bhutanese, and Brokpa, as well as Mongolians in the Gobi Desert deal with these realities when the wild progenitors of their livestock attempt to appropriate genetically-related domestic females to biologically propagate. Among the highly endangered ancestors are the likes of wild camels, wild yaks, banteng, and gaur. Beyond Asia, some similarity of issues still thwart African, and South and North American pastoralists and involve species from caribou and bison to wild sheep and goats, and guanacos. Biologically reality has trumped our evolutionary innovation to benefit ourselves through domestication because of the powerful mutual attraction between descendent domestics and their wild ancestors. Conservation biologists and on-the-ground practitioners must engage more with local pastoralists to tackle these complex and infrequently described conflicts on how best to implement protective policies. Sticks and stones are neither the answer for pastoral safety nor for avoiding introgression among these iconic mammals.

AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is a key driver of the diversity and distribution of species. African savannas are experiencing changes in their vegetation structure causing shifts towards increased woody plant cover, which results in vegetation structure homogenization. Given the impact that increasing woody plant cover has on patterns of animal use, resource managers across Africa are implementing habitat management practices that are intended to reduce woody plant cover. To understand the ecological implications of various habitat management practices on arthropod and bird communities, we leveraged large-scale tree clearing and subsequent mowing in an African savanna to understand how changes in both the herbaceous layer and woody plant cover (i.e., structural heterogeneity) may shape arthropod and bird communities at the local scale. We focused on four replicated treatments: (1) annual summer mow, (2) annual winter mow, (3) > 5 years since last mow (rest), and (4) an adjacent unmanipulated savanna to act as a control. We found that the mowing treatments significantly influenced vegetation structure both with respect to tree density and herbaceous layer. Both arthropod and bird community composition varied across treatments. Grass biomass was the best predictor of arthropod richness and abundance, with arthropods selecting for areas with high biomass. Insectivorous bird richness and abundance was driven by tree density (i.e., perching locations) and not arthropod abundance. Our results suggest that vegetation management practices contribute to habitat heterogeneity at the landscape scale and increase bird species richness through species turnover. However, we caution that if a single vegetation management practice dominates the landscape, it is plausible that it could lead to the simplification of the avian community.

AB  - Climate models predict increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme-weather events. The impacts of these events may be modulated by biotic agents in unpredictable ways, yet few experiments cover sufficient spatiotemporal scales to measure the interactive effects of multiple extreme events. We used 15 years of a 28-year experiment spanning several significant droughts to investigate how rainfall, large herbivores, and soil-engineering termites affect understorey vegetation in a semi-arid savanna. Herbivory was the dominant influence on community structure-decreasing cover, increasing species richness, and favouring occurrence of annuals relative to perennials-but these effects were contingent on rainfall and termitaria in non-additive (hence unpredictable) ways. A separate experiment showed that resource enrichment, mimicking the effects of termitaria, does not straightforwardly compensate for top-down effects of herbivory. Synthesis. Our study highlights the potency of top-down forcing in African savannas. It suggests impressive robustness to drought and underscores the value of multi-decadal experiments for studying interactions among multiple drivers of ecosystem dynamics.

AB  - Savannas cover one-fifth of the Earth's surface, harbour substantial biodiversity, and provide a broad range of ecosystem services to hundreds of millions of people. The community composition of trees in tropical moist forests varies with climate, but whether the same processes structure communities in disturbance-driven savannas remains relatively unknown. We investigate how biodiversity is structured over large environmental and disturbance gradients in woodlands of eastern and southern Africa. We use tree inventory data from the Socio-Ecological Observatory for Studying African Woodlands (SEOSAW) network, covering 755 ha in a total of 6780 plots across nine countries of eastern and southern Africa, to investigate how alpha, beta, and phylogenetic diversity varies across environmental and disturbance gradients. We find strong climate-richness patterns, with precipitation playing a primary role in determining patterns of tree richness and high turnover across these savannas. Savannas with greater rainfall contain more tree species, suggesting that low water availability places distributional limits on species, creating the observed climate-richness patterns. Both fire and herbivory have minimal effects on tree diversity, despite their role in determining savanna distribution and structure. High turnover of tree species, genera, and families is similar to turnover in seasonally dry tropical forests of the Americas, suggesting this is a feature of semiarid tree floras. The greater richness and phylogenetic diversity of wetter plots shows that broad-scale ecological patterns apply to disturbance-driven savanna systems. High taxonomic turnover suggests that savannas from across the regional rainfall gradient should be protected if we are to maximise the conservation of unique tree communities.

AB  - With the recent recovery of large carnivores in Europe, preventive measures to protect livestock are on the rise. Fences that exclude carnivores from grazing areas have been proven as effective, but they can be costly as well as posing a barrier for wildlife. We studied the effect of exclosures of > 10 km(2) to protect sheep Ovis aries on the distribution and density of moose Alces alces using fecal pellet group counts in two study areas in southeastern Norway. During the summer grazing season, the fences were powered. Outside of the grazing season, one exclosure remained fenced while the other fence was demounted. This quasi-experimental setting allowed us to investigate whether fences had a barrier effect for moose, and/or whether moose density was affected by interactions with sheep (competition or facilitation) or large carnivores (refuge hypothesis). During winter, moose pellet group density was about equal inside and outside of the exclosure with demounted wire strands, but less than half inside the permanently fenced exclosure compared to outside, indicating a potential fragmentation effect of the fence. During the grazing season, when wire strands were powered, moose pellet group density was equal or doubled inside as compared to outside both exclosures. Moose may have sought refuge from large carnivores inside the fences. Fecal pellet group densities of moose and sheep inside the fence were neither positively (facilitation) nor negatively (competition) correlated. However, moose used young forest, the most used habitat type by sheep, to a lesser extent inside than outside of the exclosures, maybe due to interference competition. Our study demonstrates that livestock protection fences can have an impact on more than the targeted wildlife species. To understand the mechanisms behind direct and indirect effects of fences, monitoring the movement and survival of individuals by means of GPS and camera traps would be needed.

AB  - 1. Ungulate herbivory is a key natural disturbance in many ecosystems. In forest ecosystems, ungulate herbivory often co-occurs with other disturbances yet there are few studies looking at the cumulative impacts of ungulates and other natural disturbances on forest dynamics.
   2. We report on an 18-year experiment to investigate the combined effects of introduced, non-native moose and native spruce budworm herbivory on balsam fir forest recruitment and regeneration. Specifically, we measured inputs into early life-history components of balsam fir dominant boreal forest ecosystems such as seed density, seedbed quality, seedling and sapling height and density, as well as adult density in eight paired moose exclosure and control sites across a spruce budworm disturbance gradient (i.e. no outbreak, recent outbreak, old outbreak) that resulted in closed, partially open and open canopies.
   3. Piecewise structural equation models (SEMs) revealed a strong negative effect of spruce budworm disturbance on balsam fir adult density and indirect effects of this budworm disturbance on balsam fir seedling and sapling density mediated through adult density. We observed a similar pattern of budworm disturbance effects on balsam fir seed density with the lowest densities in sites with open canopy, then partially open and closed canopies. As expected, the SEM showed a positive effect of bryophyte seedbed cover on balsam fir seedling density. The SEM showed support for a positive effect of moose exclusion on balsam fir sapling height and density. Specifically, saplings were on average taller and denser in exclosure than control plots and these differences are most pronounced at sites with partially open canopies created by spruce budworm disturbance and undisturbed or closed canopy sites. Overall, we show evidence for cumulative and interactive effects of spruce budworm and moose herbivory on all life stages of balsam fir and such effects are negatively affecting regeneration of balsam fir forests.
   4. Human activities are creating conditions that facilitate the expansion and increased impacts of herbivores on boreal ecosystem functioning. A greater understanding of how ungulate herbivory interacts with other disturbances is needed to improve our predictions of forest ecosystem dynamics under global change.

AB  - Herbivore exclusion is implemented globally to recover ecosystems from grazing by introduced and native herbivores, but evidence for large-scale biodiversity benefits is inconsistent in arid ecosystems. We examined the effects of livestock exclusion on dryland plant richness and reproductive capacity. We collected data on plant species richness and seeding (reproductive capacity), rainfall, vegetation productivity and cover, soil strength and herbivore grazing intensity from 68 sites across 6500 km(2) of arid Georgina gidgee (Acacia georginae) woodlands in central Australia between 2018 and 2020. Sites were on an actively grazed cattle station and two destocked conservation reserves. We used structural equation modeling to examine indirect (via soil or vegetation modification) versus direct (herbivory) effects of grazing intensity by two introduced herbivores (cattle, camels) and a native herbivore (red kangaroo), on seasonal plant species richness and seeding of all plants, and the richness and seeding of four plant groups (native grasses, forbs, annual chenopod shrubs, and palatable perennial shrubs). Non-native herbivores had a strong indirect effect on plant richness and seeding by reducing vegetative ground cover, resulting in decreased richness and seeding of native grasses and forbs. Herbivores also had small but negative direct impacts on plant richness and seeding. This direct effect was explained by reductions in annual chenopod and palatable perennial shrub richness under grazing activity. Responses to grazing were herbivore-dependent; introduced herbivore grazing reduced native plant richness and seeding, while native herbivore grazing had no significant effect on richness or seeding of different plant functional groups. Soil strength decreased under grazing by cattle but not camels or kangaroos. Cattle had direct effects on palatable perennial shrub richness and seeding, whereas camels had indirect effects, reducing richness and seeding by reducing the abundance of shrubs. We show that considering indirect pathways improves evaluations of the effects of disturbances on biodiversity, as focusing only on direct effects can mask critical mechanisms of change. Our results indicate substantial biodiversity benefits from excluding livestock and controlling camels in drylands. Reducing introduced herbivore impacts will improve soil and vegetation condition, ensure reproduction and seasonal persistence of species, and protect native plant diversity.

AB  - Semiarid Patagonia represents 25% of the rangeland area in Argentina, and sheep overgrazing has degraded about a third of it in the past. In this century, depleted domestic stocks have mostly stabilized, but Guanaco populations have grown. These native camelids share habitat and diets with sheep, but their effect on vegetation is poorly understood and has long been debated. We set up an exclusion experiment in Monte Le & oacute;n and Ca & ntilde;ad & oacute;n Vaca, a semiarid shrubland grassland in southern Patagonia, currently grazed only by guanacos. Vegetation baselines were studied in 2016 in twelve plots, and half of them were protected from guanaco grazing. Thirty-six plots were cleared to study revegetation. Vegetation was reassessed in 2021, and changes were evaluated using a paired t-test. Within protected plots, vegetation cover increased, bare soil diminished, and vegetated patches grew in size, but the density of the patch-interpatch arrangement did not change. Biodiversity, measured by richness and the Shannon-Wiener (SW) index, grew significantly. Nutrient recycling increased, as did the Stability and Infiltration Land Function indexes, although these last differences were not significant. Vegetation cover under guanaco grazing also increased, mainly due to the growth of dwarf shrubs, a typical tendency in sheep grazing-induced transitions in the region. Vegetated patches under grazing fragmented, resulting in smaller patches and denser patch structures, while diversity and land function indexes remained unchanged. Young plants established in cleared plots without guanacos showed higher cover density and individual size. These effects are similar to those observed in numerous experimental sheep exclosures. Guanaco grazing may thus prevent restoration and contribute to the generalized land degradation processes that overgrazing has been causing in Patagonia for over a century.

AB  - Disturbance regimes, like low-intensity fire, canopy gaps and ungulate browsing, play a critical role in determining ecological composition and structure in temperate forests around the world. Each disturbance (or lack thereof) can lead to unique plant communities, but we do not understand how combined disturbances change plant diversity and the resulting soil seed bank. Changes in the soil seed bank, which depend on the plants that survive post-disturbance, can then influence future biodiversity and succession. We used a long-term experiment in West Virginia, USA, that factorially manipulated low-intensity fire, deer exclusion and canopy gaps. Thirteen years after disturbance initiation, we sampled the seed bank from each disturbance treatment. We found that low-intensity fire led to increased seed bank density, with additional canopy gaps and deer exclusion each creating unique seed bank communities. Combined fire, canopy gaps and deer presence led to high seed bank diversity and the most unique seed communities, while canopy gaps and deer had no effect on seed banks unless the area was previously burned. In contrast, combined fire, canopy gaps and deer exclusion led to the lowest seed bank diversity of all treatments, reflecting the continued legacy of extant plants that grew immediately after disturbance. Seed communities were also distinct from extant understory species over 13 years, regardless of disturbance treatment. Each reintroduced disturbance combination left a unique legacy in the seed bank that will likely influence future forest reorganization following disturbances, adding to our understanding of how multiple disturbances influence forest succession and organization. Synthesis. Forest disturbance regimes have changed around the world and are being restored or manipulated to support biodiversity. Reintroduction of disturbance leads to unique plant communities, but we do not understand how combined disturbances change the soil seed bank. Using an experiment that manipulates low-intensity fire, canopy gaps and deer exclusion, we find that combinations of these experimental treatments leads to substantially different seed communities. These disturbance-altered seed banks will likely influence future biodiversity and successional patterns, highlighting how the restoration of disturbance can strongly and indirectly influence temperate forest community dynamics.

AB  - Fire and herbivores alter vegetation structure and function. Future fire activity is predicted to increase, and quantifying changes in vegetation communities arising from post-fire herbivory is needed to better manage natural environments. We investigated the effects of post-fire herbivory on understory plant communities in a coastal eucalypt forest in southeastern Australia. We quantified herbivore activity, understory plant diversity, and dominant plant morphology following a wildfire in 2017 using two sizes of exclosures. Statistical analysis incorporated the effect of exclusion treatments, time since fire, and the effect of a previous prescribed burn. Exclusion treatments altered herbivore activity, but time since fire did not. Herbivory reduced plant species richness, diversity, and evenness and promoted the dominance of the most abundant plants within the understory. Increasing time since fire reduced community diversity and evenness and influenced morphological changes to the dominant understory plant species, increasing size and dead material while decreasing abundance. We found the legacy effects of a previous prescribed burn had no effect on herbivores or vegetation within our study. Foraging by large herbivores resulted in a depauperate vegetation community. As post-fire herbivory can alter vegetation communities, we postulate that management burning practices may exacerbate herbivore impacts. Future fire management strategies to minimize herbivore-mediated alterations to understory vegetation could include aggregating management burns into larger fire sizes or linking fire management with herbivore management. Restricting herbivore access following fire (planned or otherwise) can encourage a more diverse and species-rich understory plant community. Future research should aim to determine how vegetation change from post-fire herbivory contributes to future fire risk.

AB  - Large herbivores are considered a natural and important determinant for high biodiversity in woodland habitats and have been increasingly reintroduced to nature areas across Europe with the aim of re-establishing natural processes to promote and protect biodiversity. One of the herbivore species playing an increasing role in ecological restoration initiatives is the European bison - the largest extant terrestrial mammal in Europe. However, despite numerous reintroductions of bison for biodiversity purposes, the empirical evidence for their impact is highly limited. Using permanent plots, we investigated the impact of European bison on ground vegetation in forest habitats over a period of eight years. The bison increased the species richness of vascular plants, though mainly to the benefit of graminoids. The effect varied, however, among forest types, with the strongest effect in oak forests with dense and abundant ground vegetation while beech forests characterized by full canopy cover were unaffected. Bison also benefitted bryophytes, which increased in abundance, indicating a generally altered competitive environment with reduced dominance. These results thus provide some of the first empirical evidence, indicating that European bison can promote plant species diversity in forest habitats, by removal of plant biomass, zoochorous seed dispersal, and creation of microhabitat. We thus suggest that introduction of European bison to mixed light woodlands can be a good strategy, benefitting both biodiversity and the conservation of the threatened herbivore species itself.

AB  - The moose Alces alces is the largest herbivore in the boreal forest biome, where it can have dramatic impacts on ecosystem structure and dynamics. Despite the importance of the boreal forest biome in global carbon cycling, the impacts of moose have only been studied in disparate regional exclosure experiments, leading to calls for common analyses across a biome-wide network of moose exclosures.In this study, we use airborne laser scanning (ALS) to analyse forest canopy responses to moose across 100 paired exclosure-control experimental plots distributed across the boreal biome, including sites in the United States (Isle Royale), Canada (Quebec, Newfoundland), Norway, Sweden and Finland.We test the hypotheses that canopy height, vertical complexity and above-ground biomass (AGB) are all reduced by moose and that the impacts vary with moose density, productivity, temperature and pulse disturbances such as logging and insect outbreaks.We find a surprising convergence in forest canopy response to moose. Moose had negative impacts on canopy height, complexity and AGB as expected. The responses of canopy complexity and AGB were consistent across regions and did not vary along environmental gradients. The difference in canopy height between exclosures and open plots was on average 6 cm per year since the start of exclosure treatment (+/- 2.1 SD). This rate increased with temperature, but only when moose density was high.The difference in AGB between moose exclosures and open plots was 0.306 Mg ha(-1) year(-1) (+/- 0.079). In browsed plots, stand AGB was 32% of that in the exclosures, a difference of 2.09 Mg ha(-1). The uniform response allows scaling of the estimate to a biome-wide impact of moose of the loss of 448 (+/- 115) Tg per year, or 224 Tg of carbon.Synthesis: Analysis of ALS data from distributed exclosure experiments identified a largely uniform response of forest canopies to moose across regions, facilitating scaling of moose impacts across the whole biome. This is an important step towards incorporating the effect of the largest boreal herbivore on the carbon cycling of one of the world's largest terrestrial biomes.

AB  - Insects perform many ecosystem functions, yet their responses to disturbance can be unpredictable. Changes in climate may interact with land use disturbances, and given that arthropod species diversity, abundance, and traits within assemblages vary with habitat structure and climatic variables, ecological function may be impaired. Here, we assessed how dung beetle species richness, abundance, functional diversity, mean body size and body size inequality (which can signal assemblage stress responses) varied with climatic, management and habitat variables on livestock farms and protected areas across a rainfall gradient (138-381 mm/year) in arid/semi-arid shrubland (Karoo, South Africa, an area for which entomological biodiversity is relatively poorly known), during a prolonged drought. Species richness was similar between farms and protected areas, but abundance was greater in protected areas. Farms tend to be dominated by sheep in this region, and the type of dung and paucity of dung diversity, along with use of anthelmintics may explain this reduced abundance. Species richness and abundance increased with mammalian herbivore stocking rates and rainfall. Most recent rainfall best predicted species richness, but abundance was best explained by the long-term measure of rainfall (Mean Annual Precipitation). Functional diversity showed no patterns with the environmental or management variables we measured. Mean body length and size variation did not differ between protected areas and farms, but the spread of beetle sizes was more even as vegetation cover increased and soil clay content decreased. Future climate projections indicate extreme declines in rainfall in this area, and our results suggest that this would dramatically impact dung beetle communities. Maintaining vegetation cover may help mitigate effects of climate change.

AB  - Ecological resilience to ungulate overbrowsing is an important issue in forest ecosystems. After chronic herbivory, the recovery rate of understory vegetation and its related functions can be slow even with decreasing grazing intensity; thus, detecting elasticity during alternative successional trajectories is fundamental to understanding state perturbations. In this context, we focused on physical plant-soil feedback (functional interactions between plant growth and soil physical conditions) and evaluated elasticity and recovery processes according to deer density. The effects of 40 years of chronic herbivory by sika deer (average density 14.7 individuals km(-2)) on the recovery of understory plant communities and associated changes in soil physical properties in headwater catchments were assessed. Using 8 years of catchment-wide exclusion (fenced) and reduction (only culled; average 4.3 individuals km(-2)) treatments, plot sampling was conducted in 2010 (before treatment) and 2018 (after treatment). The recovery of vegetation and soil physical properties were evaluated, and functional plant-soil relationships and spatial variability were assessed to detect recovery processes during alternative successional trajectory. Woody species increased only under the exclusion treatment and the average soil bulk density was lower than that under reduction treatments. Soil bulk density was negatively correlated with root biomass in the fenced catchment, and root biomass was positively associated with woody species richness. Reduced soil bulk density (similar to 0.5 g cm(-3)) was observed with greater root biomass and woody species richness on upper hillslopes in the deer-excluded catchment where plant coverage was minimal. Successional failure under the reduction treatment suggested slow recovery with a depressed threshold according to deer density, indicating a clockwise hysteretic response to deer density. Unlike plant coverage during the earlier period of overbrowsing, woody species root development led the recovery of functional physical plant-soil feedback; however, this was probably limited by the higher soil erosion rate in riparian areas and an under-developed herb layer. Our results highlight an alternative recovery trajectory of physical plant-soil feedback driven by an alternative plant element (woody roots) to recovery trajectory with increasing plant cover. However, riparian erosion and herb layer would still suppress recovery. Therefore, recovery might be slower at the landscape scale.

AB  - QuestionsWhich are the effects of inter-annual meteorological fluctuations on plant species richness and vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean temporary ponds, shallow wetlands characterized by alternating phases of drought and flooding? Which are the effects of wild boar disturbance? How do the responses of specialist or non-specialist species of the habitat differ?
   LocationNW Sardinia Island (Italy).
   MethodsWe assessed plant cover during six years within one 60 cm x 60 cm quadrat in each of five areas. To measure the effect of inter-annual meteorological fluctuations on vegetation, we used two indices: the evapotranspiration and the synthetic agrometeorological indicator. To quantify the effect of disturbance by boars, we compared two treatments: disturbed and non-disturbed (located outside and inside 1.5 m x 1.5 m exclosures respectively). As a whole, we monitored 60 plots (6 years x 2 treatments x 5 replications). We analyzed data using ANOVA, PERMANOVA and BIO-ENV.
   ResultsPlant species richness and composition showed significant differences between years and treatments. Species composition was correlated with the evapotranspiration before the vegetative peak during the last period and with the agrometeorological indicator during the whole vegetative period. Specialist species showed much weaker growth, quantified as cover, in the drier years. Starting from the third survey year, plant richness and cover of specialist species were significantly higher in disturbed than in not-disturbed plots. The extent of bare soil generally was not affected by the treatment.
   ConclusionsMeteorological fluctuations affect plant species composition and vegetation dynamics in Mediterranean temporary ponds. The sensitivity of specialist species could make them particularly vulnerable to climate change. Nevertheless, they are resilient to unpredictable disturbances such as burrowing by wild boar. However, our results concerning the positive impact of wild boar disturbance on the vegetation cannot be generalized. Elsewhere, the lack of hunting activity could also be a problem for these habitats.

AB  - Conservation-oriented village relocations are used as tools for wildlife conservation in developing nations like India, despite the potential sociocultural and economic costs associated with displacement. In tiger reserves in central India, abandoned village sites are developed as grasslands to improve tiger prey numbers. However, little is known about how village relocations and their associated management interventions influence ungulate habitat use. The aim of the study was to understand the impact of village relocations on ungulates by assessing how the intensity of habitat use by five ungulate species (sambar, chital, gaur, nilgai, wild pig), quantified using dung accumulation rates, changed with respect to time since relocation and distance from the edge of a site (relocated/active village) in the Satpura Tiger Reserve, central India. The intensity of use of relocated village sites by sambar, chital, gaur, and nilgai increased with time since relocation, while for wild pigs, it decreased. The intensity of habitat use by all five species of ungulates was negatively correlated with distance from the edge of the site. Our results suggest that village relocations coupled with grassland management activities lead to increased intensity of habitat use by some species and, over time, this may lead to increased populations of these large herbivores, aiding the recovery of large mammalian predators. While this study focused on the ecological implications of relocations, there is also a critical need to view relocations as coupled social-ecological systems to better understand their viability as conservation interventions.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (hereafter, 'deer') and invasive plants affect forest understories, but few studies have investigated their interaction. We investigated long-term (11-yr) effects of excluding deer and removing the invasive shrub, Amur honeysuckle [Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder], on plants in southwest Ohio. Deer exclusion enhanced tree seedling richness and density, but reduced annual and bare ground cover. Vine density was reduced by Lonicera, especially where deer were excluded. Seedlings of several tree species, the invasive shrub, burning bush [Euonymus alatus (Thunb.) Siebold], and the invasive vine, winter creeper [Euonymous fortunei (Turcz.) Hand.-Maz.], were indicator species of the deer exclosure by Lonicera removal treatment combination. The effect of deer on cover of native species depended on Lonicera treatment: where shrubs were removed, cover was higher where deer were excluded, but where shrubs were present, cover was higher where deer had access. We attribute these interactions to the reduced growth of, and shading by, Lonicera where deer had access and browsed this invasive shrub. Some of these effects were evident in the first 6 yr, but are now larger. Other effects were not evident in the earlier evaluation. These findings inform management of areas with high densities of deer and invasive shrubs palatable to deer. Control of only invasive shrubs will reduce native cover and not improve tree regeneration. Managing only deer will increase woody plants but reduce native cover. Management of both stressors is needed to promote tree regeneration and restoration of plant communities.

AB  - Poleward shifts in species distributions are expected and frequently observed with a warming climate. In Arctic ecosystems, the strong warming trends are associated with increasing greenness and shrubification. Vertebrate herbivores have the potential to limit greening and shrub advance and expansion on the tundra, posing the question of whether changes in herbivore communities could partly mediate the impacts of climate warming on Arctic tundra. Therefore, future changes in the herbivore community in the Arctic tundra will depend on whether the community tracks the changing climates directly (i.e. occurs in response to temperature) or indirectly, in response to vegetation changes (which can be modified by trophic interactions). In this study, we used biogeographic and remotely sensed data to quantify spatial variation in vertebrate herbivore communities across the boreal forest and Arctic tundra biomes. We then tested whether present-day herbivore community structure is determined primarily by temperature or vegetation. We demonstrate that vertebrate herbivore communities are significantly more diverse in the boreal forest than in the Arctic tundra in terms of species richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity. A clear shift in community structure was observed at the biome boundary, with stronger northward declines in diversity in the Arctic tundra. Interestingly, important functional traits characterizing the role of herbivores in limiting tundra vegetation change, such as body mass and woody plant feeding, did not show threshold changes across the biome boundary. Temperature was a more important determinant of herbivore community structure across these biomes than vegetation productivity or woody plant cover. Thus, our study does not support the premise that herbivore-driven limitation of Arctic tundra shrubification or greening would limit herbivore community change in the tundra. Instead, borealization of tundra herbivore communities is likely to result from the direct effect of climate warming.

AB  - For forests to provide ecosystem services and function optimally, they need to be managed. Forest management measures can cause significant environmental changes, which sometimes appear extreme. The most notable disturbance caused by forest regeneration is the change in canopy cover. Alteration of the canopy cover is followed by the modifications of many microclimatic factors. These changes subsequently affect all the living organisms in the forest. The present study was conducted to determine how the changes caused by modifications of canopy closure by shelterwood regeneration affect the leaf-mining insect community on sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). We identified that the removal of the canopy significantly affects the microclimate, vegetation, and the leaf miner community. The insolation and temperature increased in the more open areas, while relative air humidity decreased. This affects the characteristics of the young oak plants, which grow taller and produce more leaves in the open-canopy areas. All these changes consequentially affect the leaf miner community. While the species richness and abundance per tree increased with the decrease in canopy closure, the species richness and abundance per leaf decreased. The opening of the canopy positively affected the leaf miners in the end by increasing the diversity and evenness of their community.

AB  - Large and small mammalian herbivores are present in most vegetated areas in the Arctic and often have large impacts on plant community composition and ecosystem functioning. The relative importance of different herbivores and especially how their specific impact on the vegetation varies across the Arctic is however poorly understood. Here, we investigate how large and small herbivores influence vegetation density and plant community composition in four arctic vegetation types in Scandinavia and Alaska. We used a unique set of exclosures, excluding only large (reindeer and muskoxen) or all mammalian herbivores (also voles and lemmings) for at least 20 years. We found that mammalian herbivores in general decreased leaf area index, NDVI, and abundance of vascular plants in all four locations, even though the strength of the effect and which herbivore type caused these effects differed across locations. In three locations, herbivore presence caused contrasting plant communities, but not in the location with lowest productivity. Large herbivores had a negative effect on plant height, whereas small mammalian herbivores increased species diversity by decreasing dominance of the initially dominating plant species. Above- or belowground disturbances caused by herbivores were found to play an important role in shaping the vegetation in all locations. Synthesis: Based on these results, we conclude that both small and large mammalian herbivores influence vegetation in Scandinavia and Alaska in a similar way, some of which can mitigate effects of climate change. We also see important differences across locations, but these depend rather on local herbivore and plant community composition than large biogeographical differences among continents.

AB  - Trophic rewilding is increasingly being used to promote megafauna reintroductions to island ecosystems, yet ecosystem response to population restoration once megafauna reintroduction occurs remains understudied. In this study of a population of Galapagos giant tortoises reintroduced to an arid island, tortoise exclosures monitored over an 8-year-long period revealed that, in response to the presence of tortoises, herbaceous plant cover and numbers of regenerating woody plants decreased, whereas extent of grass cover increased. Vegetation mapping over a 15-year-long period across the island indicated a threshold density of 1-2 tortoises per hectare halted incursion of woody plants and triggered a shift in this savannah-type ecosystem toward more grasses. Restoration of this giant tortoise population has shaped plant communities at both local and landscape scales with cascading effects on many components of biodiversity on the island.

AB  - Plants in suburban forests of eastern North America face the dual stressors of high white-tailed deer density and invasion by nonindigenous plants. Chronic deer herbivory combined with strong competition from invasive plants could alter a plant's stress- and defense-related secondary chemistry, especially for long-lived juvenile trees in the understory, but this has not been studied. We measured foliar total antioxidants, phenolics, and flavonoids in juveniles of two native trees, Fraxinus pennsylvanica (green ash) and Fagus grandifolia (American beech), growing in six forests in the suburban landscape of central New Jersey, USA. The trees grew in experimental plots subjected for 2.5 years to factorial treatments of deer access/exclosure x addition/no addition of the nonindigenous invasive grass Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass). As other hypothesized drivers of plant secondary chemistry, we also measured nonstiltgrass herb layer cover, light levels, and water availability. Univariate mixed model analysis of the deer and stiltgrass effects and multivariate structural equation modeling (SEM) of all variables showed that both greater stiltgrass cover and greater deer pressure induced antioxidants, phenolics, and flavonoids, with some variation between species. Deer were generally the stronger factor, and stiltgrass effects were most apparent at high stiltgrass density. SEM also revealed that soil dryness directly increased the chemicals; deer had additional positive, but indirect, effects via influence on the soil; in beech photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) positively affected flavonoids; and herb layer cover had no effect. Juvenile trees' chemical defense/stress responses to deer and invasive plants can be protective, but also could have a physiological cost, with negative consequences for recruitment to the canopy. Ecological implications for species and their communities will depend on costs and benefits of stress/defense chemistry in the specific environmental context, particularly with respect to invasive plant competitiveness, extent of invasion, local deer density, and deer browse preferences.

AB  - Questions: Facilitation by pioneer plants and herbivore exclusion may contribute to plant regeneration and restoration of degraded semiarid ecosystems. In this study we evaluated the main and interactive effects of the exclusion of large and medium-sized mammal herbivores and the presence of the pioneer tree Vachellia caven on natural regeneration of woody species in degraded savannas.
   Location: Two localities of the native sclerophyllous forest of central Chile
   Methods: Twelve 30 x 40 m exclosures and twelve non-exclosure areas located near native forests were established in savannas of V. caven in each locality. Regeneration coming from seeds and resprouts was sampled both under the canopy of V. caven and without canopy in each exclosure and non-excluded area.
   Results: After seven years, species richness and density of older regeneration (0.5-2 m high) were positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven. No significant interaction between herbivore exclusion and V. caven was observed. Younger regeneration (<0.5 m high) was positively affected by herbivore exclusion and the presence of V. caven only in some years with almost no interactive effect.
   Conclusions: The exclusion of large and medium-sized exotic herbivores and facilitation by pioneer trees are complementary for regeneration. The variable but permanent presence of younger and older regeneration within exclosures and under V. caven during the experiment may lead to an increase of density and diversity of adult plants and recovery of the native forest. However, this process may be slow due to other limiting factors, for instance, reduced precipitation associated with climate change.

AB  - The replacement of grasses by shrubs or bare ground (xerification) is a primary form of landscape change in drylands globally with consequences for ecosystem services. The potential for wild herbivores to trigger or reinforce shrubland states may be underappreciated, however, and comparative analyses across herbivore taxa are sparse. We sought to clarify the relative effects of domestic cattle, native rodents, native lagomorphs, and exotic African oryx (Oryx gazella) on a Chihuahuan Desert grassland undergoing shrub encroachment. We then asked whether drought periods, wet season precipitation, or interspecific grass-shrub competition modified herbivore effects to alter plant cover, species diversity, or community composition. We established a long-term experiment with hierarchical herbivore exclosure treatments and surveyed plant foliar cover over 25 years. Cover of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) proliferated, responding primarily to climate, and was unaffected by herbivore treatments. Surprisingly, cattle and African oryx exclusion had only marginal effects on perennial grass cover at their current densities. Native lagomorphs interacted with climate to limit perennial grass cover during wet periods. Native rodents strongly decreased plant diversity, decreased evenness, and altered community composition. Overall, we found no evidence of mammalian herbivores facilitating or inhibiting shrub encroachment, but native small mammals interacting with climate drove dynamics of herbaceous plant communities. Ongoing monitoring will determine whether increased perennial grass cover from exclusion of native lagomorphs and rodents slows the transition to a dense shrubland.

AB  - To elucidate the effects of modification of the understory aboveground plant biomass and soil nutrient and moisture environments on canopy tree growth in deer overabundance sites, we compared the canopy shoot growth of oak trees (Quercus crispula), which are not a target for bark stripping or bark feeding by deer, understory aboveground plant biomass, and components of soil nutrient and moisture between inside (protected) and outside (exposed) a large fenced area. We found that canopy shoot growth in the exposed area was reduced compared with that in the protected area. Net nitrogen (N) mineralization rates did not differ between areas, although understory aboveground plant biomass, total carbon (C) and N, and total soil inorganic N content were significantly lower in the exposed area than in the protected area. Indices of canopy shoot growth correlated significantly with soil water content, but due to the limited scope of our study this result does not confirm an effect of soil moisture on canopy shoot growth. Further study is required to clarify the effects of deer overabundance on canopy tree growth.

AB  - Replacement of diverse wild herbivore assemblages by livestock across expansive regions of African savanna grassland is predicted to modify tree-grass interactions. Yet, despite the ubiquity of this herbivore regime change, consequences of shifting from wildlife to livestock for savanna ecosystems are poorly resolved. We assessed the effects of livestock grazing on the herbaceous community of a nutrient rich, semi-arid savanna. Direct and indirect impacts - moderated via differences in tree cover - of intensive cattle grazing in communal rangelands, on the herbaceous community were contrasted with heavily utilized wild herbivore grazing systems. Communal rangelands showed a more than two-fold increase in woody cover compared to wildlife areas. Herbaceous differences between wildlife and livestock areas were driven primarily by changes in the area beneath trees, and differences in how densely wooded areas are used by wildlife and livestock. In wildlife systems, grazing intensity was much lower below than away from tree canopies, whereas in livestock systems grazing intensity was high irrespective of tree canopy presence. Away from trees, structure and functional traits of herbaceous vegetation were markedly similar between the two herbivory systems. In our study area, communal rangelands used by livestock, predominantly cattle, are not a degraded subset of wildlife areas but support near equivalent diversity, although with different grass and forb species, and warrants consideration when evaluating their contribution to biodiversity conservation in the region. Nonetheless, higher bare ground cover and the lack of tall-grass reserves mean that communally managed rangelands with low grazer diversity might be more sensitive to intra- and interannual climate variability since they are associated with lower forage variability.

AB  - Aim Functional traits mediate the interactions of species among themselves and with their environment, providing a link between diversity and ecosystem function. Crucially, the loss of biodiversity can jeopardize the functionality of ecosystems. Much focus is on predicting the impacts of current and future species loss; however, modern ecosystems have undergone biodiversity decline throughout the Late Quaternary, starting with the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions. Thus, the fossil record offers the opportunity to investigate the long-term legacy of biodiversity erosion and how this is affecting modern ecosystems in a cumulative manner. We aimed to investigate changes in functional diversity and redundancy of a local mammal community at Hall's Cave, a site with a continuous record from 21,000 years ago to the present. Additionally, we included several common introduced species in the modern community to test whether they restore some lost ecological function. Location Central Texas. Time period Late Pleistocene to Present. Major taxa studied Mammals. Methods We used eight functional traits (mass, diet, arboreality, cursoriality, soil disturbance, group size, activity period and migration habit), which, collectively, describe the ecological role of a species and its influence on ecosystem processes, to construct a multidimensional functional space. The functional richness, range and distribution of the Hall's Cave community and the degree of functional redundancy were characterized statistically over time. Results We found that declines in functional diversity were greater than expected given the decrease in species richness, implying that lost taxa contributed higher than average distinct ecological function. Functional distances between the remaining species increased through time, leading to reduced functional redundancy in younger communities. However, recently introduced taxa increased functional diversity to levels similar to those in the Holocene and partly restored the functional space occupied by Late Pleistocene fauna. Main conclusions Our local-scale analysis demonstrates how prolonged biodiversity erosion not only leads to functionally depauperate communities, but, crucially, lowers ecological resilience to future disturbance.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces) is a large herbivore that can mediate boreal forest regeneration after timber harvest through selective browsing of tree species. Despite increasing evidence of moose browsing influence on tree growth in early successional forests, climate effects due to changes in carbon sequestration rates and biophysical factors such as albedo remain largely unexplored. We used 11 years of data from 44 pair-sites of herbivore exclosures within clear-cut forests in Norway to investigate how moose browsing alters aboveground tree biomass and albedo. We find a higher total aboveground tree biomass (mainly deciduous species) in unbrowsed than browsed forest plots, as moose browsing limited the growth of tree biomass. The effect of moose exclosure on relative tree abundances differed between sites, suggesting that moose browsing has stronger effects on forest structure than composition. At the same time, moose increased forest albedo relative to un-browsed forests, driving biophysical cooling. When averaged at regional levels, climate effects due to changes in biomass and albedo are of similar magnitude, but contributions can diverge in specific locations. In a region with intensive forestry operations and high moose density, CO2 emissions from moose browsing in post-harvested sites can be equal to about 40% of the annual emissions of fossil fuels from that region. Cooling effects from increased albedo can offset about two thirds of this impact. Given its influence on tree growth rates and climate impacts, management of moose browsing density should be integrated into forest management plans to optimize climate change mitigation and forest productivity.

AB  - Habitat heterogeneity is expected to change community composition and diversity, with large implications for ecosystem processes and function. Understanding the potential mechanisms of habitat heterogeneity affecting community ecological processes is a central issue in biodiversity conservation. In this study, we use a spatial metrics analysis to quantify the spatial pattern of plateau zokor mounds. We integrated soil physicochemical variables and community characteristic data to understand the disturbance effect of plateau zokor mounds on community diversity at a microhabitat scale (400 m2). Results showed that plant species richness increased significantly with increasing disturbance levels. Increases in forb species were largely the reason for the increased plant diversity in the alpine meadow disturbed by plateau zokor mounds. Disturbance caused by the plateau zokor significantly increased the soil macroinvertebrate richness and abundance, with herbivorous taxa playing a key role. Mantel tests and redundancy analysis showed that the composition of plant and soil macroinvertebrate communities are significantly related to soil moisture and soil temperature, and the SEM model revealing soil moisture and soil temperature positive effects on plant and macroinvertebrate richness after plateau zokor disturbance. Furthermore, soil variables (moisture, temperature, and organic carbon) directly affected plant richness, and indirectly affected soil macroinvertebrate communities. Our results suggest that the spatial pattern of plateau zokor mounds facilitate greater biodiversity through increased habitat complexity and heterogeneity. Therefore, it can be regarded as a "key species" in the alpine grassland and researchers should pay more attention to the ecological effects of alpine rodent disturbance on grassland ecosystems.

AB  - In coevolved native ungulate assemblages, the mechanisms underlying competition remain unclear because, to date, little direct evidence of competition exists. In high-elevation areas in Japan, the number of native Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus) has been decreasing as the number of native sika deer (Cervus nippon) increases. Here, we assessed the effects of deer on vegetation, vigilance and foraging behavior, physiological stress, and relative abundance and ratio of young individuals of serows throughout the warm season across two study sites with different deer densities and similar landscapes in high-elevation areas of Mount Asama, Central Japan. The abundance and diversity of palatable forage for serows (i.e., herbaceous forbs) were significantly lower in areas with abundant deer, suggesting that deer abundance reduced the vegetation quality for serows. Serow vigilance rate was significantly greater in areas with abundant deer, suggesting that the increased probability of encountering deer or of intraspecific aggression increased vigilance. Serow bite rate was significantly lower and their step rate was greater in areas with abundant deer, suggesting that lower availability of herbaceous forbs and higher vigilance reduced serow foraging efficiency. Levels of serow fecal cortisol metabolites were significantly greater in areas with abundant deer, suggesting that deer abundance and decreased foraging efficiency increased physiological stress of serows. The relative abundance and ratio of young individuals of serow populations were significantly lower in areas with abundant deer, suggesting that deer abundance negatively affected the serow population through both exploitative and interference competition. This is a rare case to show direct evidence and mechanisms of interspecific competition in native ungulate assemblages. Human alteration of ecosystem processes, such as the elimination of top predators and decreased human hunting pressure on deer, may determine changes in ecological relationships between serow and deer.

AB  - The cherry plum (Prunus cerasifera Ehrh.) is considered an invasive plant species in numerous areas of the temperate climate zones around the world. Although this exotic tree can naturalize in a wide spectrum of forest ecosystems, its invasion mechanisms remain totally unknown. This study is the first approach aiming to investigate potential drivers shaping the ecological success of P. cerasifera invasion, with an example of the temperate primeval forest as a model recipient ecosystem. Using generalized linear models, we suggest that the distance to the propagule source may shape considerably this exotic species occurrence in primeval forest's understory, expressed by the presumably high role of birds and small mammals in short-, and large ungulates in long-distance seed dispersion. The probability of this invader occurrence decreased with decreasing functional and phylogenetic diversity of understory vegetation. This suggests the importance of habitat filtering generated in small tree-fall gaps in shaping the P. cerasifera success. Thus, interactions between natural disturbances, characteristics of recipient vegetation, as well as traits of various animal dispersers, may be identified as key drivers promoting the occurrence of P. cerasifera in the primeval forest ecosystem. However, further studies on the patterns of P. cerasifera invasion are needed to identify drivers promoting invasion, as well as the effects of this exotic plant on biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems.

AB  - Increasing plant diversity commonly enhances standing biomass and other ecosystem functions (i.e., carbon fluxes, water use efficiency, herbivory). The standing biomass is correlated with vegetation volume, which describes plant biomass allocation within a complex canopy structure. As the canopy structure of plant communities is not static throughout time, it is expected that its changes also control diversity effects on ecosystem functioning. Yet, most studies are based on one or two measures of ecosystem function per year. Here, we examine the temporal effects of diversity of grassland communities on canopy structural components in high temporal (bi-weekly throughout the growing season) and spatial resolutions as a proxy for ecosystem functioning. Using terrestrial laser scanning, we estimate metrics of vertical structure, such as biomass distribution (evenness) and highest biomass allocation (center of gravity) along height strata. For horizontal metrics, we calculated community stand gaps and canopy surface variation. Our findings show that species-rich communities start filling the vertical space (evenness) earlier in the growing season, suggesting a more extended period of resource use (i.e., light-harvesting). Moreover, more diverse communities raised their center of gravity only at the peak of biomass in spring, likely triggered by higher interspecific competition inducing higher biomass allocation at upper layers of the canopy. Furthermore, richer communities were clumpier only after mowing, revealing species-specific differences in regrowth. Lastly, species richness strongly affected canopy variation when the phenology status and height differences were maximal, suggesting differences in plant functional strategies (space to grow, resource use, and flowering phenology). Therefore, the effects of diversity on ecosystem functions depending on those structural components such as biomass production, decomposition, and herbivory, may also change throughout the season due to various mechanisms, such as niche differences, increased complementarity, and temporal and spatial variation in biological activity.

AB  - Forests within urban areas are important for the survival of some native plant and animal communities. Urban forests are negatively affected by human-mediated disturbances, including those that increase nonnative plant invasion. Nonnative plants alter forest structure, and can contribute to dense understory vegetation, more open canopy structure, and less leaf litter volume. This modified vegetation structure alters resources urban forests provide for native forest species. Carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are used globally to understand community-level responses to changes in ecosystem quality. We sampled carabids in 24 urban temperate deciduous and mixed forests in two cities, Raleigh, North Carolina and Newark, Delaware, to understand how carabid communities in different regions change in response to nonnative plant invasion. We predicted forests invaded by nonnative plants would have denser understories and carabid communities with less forest specialist species and more open area specialist species. We focused on forest specialist carabids, species that depend on intact forest canopies, and open area specialist carabids, species that depend on open or no canopies, to determine whether urban forests support species indicative of intact forest ecosystems. We found greater native ground cover was associated with greater forest specialist diversity, greater canopy openness increased open area specialist capture and diversity, and understory vegetation density reduced open area specialist diversity. However, relationships were dependent on regional plant and carabid community composition. This study suggests abundant nonnative plants and associated dense vegetation structure are potential mechanisms explaining differences between rural and urban carabid communities and provides a unique example of how nonnative plants influence a guild of arthropods other than obligate herbivores. Our results indicate urban forests are not negligible ecosystems, but rather a reservoir for native biota. We suggest urban forest managers promote native species by managing nonnative species invasion in the understory of urban forests, to improve ecosystem quality for native forest specialist species.

AB  - Both termites and large mammalian herbivores (LMH) are savanna ecosystem engineers that have profound impacts on ecosystem structure and function. Both of these savanna engineers modulate many common and shared dietary resources such as woody and herbaceous plant biomass, yet few studies have addressed how they impact one another. In particular, it is unclear how herbivores may influence the abundance of long-lived termite mounds via changes in termite dietary resources such as woody and herbaceous biomass. While it has long been assumed that abundance and areal cover of termite mounds in the landscape remain relatively stable, most data are observational, and few experiments have tested how termite mound patterns may respond to biotic factors such as changes in large herbivore communities. Here, we use a broad tree density gradient and two landscape-scale experimental manipulations-the first a multi-guild large herbivore exclosure experiment (20 years after establishment) and the second a tree removal experiment (8 years after establishment)-to demonstrate that patterns in Odontotermes termite mound abundance and cover are unexpectedly dynamic. Termite mound abundance, but areal cover not significantly, is positively associated with experimentally controlled presence of cattle, but not wild mesoherbivores (15-1,000 kg) or megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes). Herbaceous productivity and tree density, termite dietary resources that are significantly affected by different LMH treatments, are both positive predictors of termite mound abundance. Experimental reductions of tree densities are associated with lower abundances of termite mounds. These results reveal a richly interacting web of relationships among multiple savanna ecosystem engineers and suggest that termite mound abundance and areal cover are intimately tied to herbivore-driven resource availability.

AB  - Understanding the influence of non-native herbivores on ecosystems by means of dietary foraging and seed dispersal is important for understanding how non-native species can alter an invaded landscape, yet requires multiple methodologies. In south-eastern Australia, introduced sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) are rapidly expanding in range and placing native ecosystems at risk through browsing and as vectors for seed dispersal. We simultaneously investigated sambar deer dietary composition and seed dispersal using DNA sequencing and germination trials, from faecal pellets collected in alpine and wet forest ecosystems. This allowed us to contrast the dietary impacts of introduced sambar deer in different environments, and to explore the potential for habitat-specific variation in diet. DNA sequencing of the trnL, ITS2 and rbcL gene regions revealed a diverse plant species dietary composition comprising 1003 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sambar deer exhibited intermediate feeder behaviours dominated by forbs in alpine and shrubs in wet forest ecosystems. A large proportion of plant OTUs were considered likely to be native, however, the proportion of exotic species in the diet in both ecosystems was greater than would be expected based on the proportion of exotic species in each of the two landscapes. Seed germination trials indicated that sambar deer can disperse a substantial number of native and exotic species in both alpine and wet forest ecosystems. In alpine ecosystems, an individual sambar deer was estimated to disperse on average 816 (+/- 193) seeds per day during the study period, of which 652 (+/- 176) were exotic. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that native plant species comprise the majority of sambar deer diets in Australian ecosystems and that the introduced species is dispersing both native and exotic plant species via endozoochory. However, exotic species seedling germination numbers were significantly higher in alpine ecosystems, and given the large daily movements of sambar deer, represents a significant vector for the spread of exotic plant species. Management of native plant species and vegetation communities of conservation significance, or at risk to sambar deer browsing is of high priority, through either the removal of sambar deer or implementation of exclusion-based methods.

AB  - Positive biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships (BEFRs) have been widely documented, but it is unclear if BEFRs should be expected in disturbance-driven systems. Disturbance may limit competition and niche differentiation, which are frequently posited to underlie BEFRs. We provide the first exploration of the relationship between tree species diversity and biomass, one measure of ecosystem function, across southern African woodlands and savannas, an ecological system rife with disturbance from fire, herbivores and humans.
   We used > 1000 vegetation plots distributed across 10 southern African countries and structural equation modelling to determine the relationship between tree species diversity and above-ground woody biomass, accounting for interacting effects of resource availability, disturbance by fire, tree stem density and vegetation type.
   We found positive effects of tree species diversity on above-ground biomass, operating via increased structural diversity. The observed BEFR was highly dependent on organismal density, with a minimum threshold of c. 180 mature stems ha(-1). We found that water availability mainly affects biomass indirectly, via increasing species diversity.
   The study underlines the close association between tree diversity, ecosystem structure, environment and function in highly disturbed savannas and woodlands. We suggest that tree diversity is an under-appreciated determinant of wooded ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - Large herbivores are often classed as ecosystem engineers, and when they become scarce or overabundant, this can alter ecosystem states and influence climate forcing potentials. This realization has spurred a call to integrate large herbivores in earth system models. However, we lack a good understanding of their net effects on climate forcing, including carbon and energy exchange. A possible solution to this lies in harmonizing data across the myriad of large herbivore exclosure experiments around the world. This is challenging due to differences in experimental designs and field protocols. We used airborne laser scanning (ALS) to describe the effect of herbivore removal across 43 young boreal forest stands in Norway and found that exclusion caused the canopy height to increase from 1.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.5 +/- 0.2 m (means +/- sE), and also causing a marked increase in vertical complexity and above-ground biomass. We then go on to discuss some of the issues with using ALS; we propose ALS as an approach for studying the effects of multiple large herbivore exclosure experiments simultaneously, and producing area-based estimates on canopy structure and forest biomass in a cheap, efficient, standardized and reproducible way. We suggest that this is a vital next step towards generating biome-wide predictions for the effects of large herbivores on forest ecosystem structure which can both inform both local management goals and earth system models.

Alien plants can reduce richness of native plants, thereby negatively affecting arthropods and their multitrophic interactions. In particular, tall invasive trees may limit native understory plants and associated arthropods more than small invasive shrubs, which may support light-demanding taxa under their more open canopies. In this study, we investigated how two non-native highly invasive species (shrub Sorbaria sorbifolia and tree Amelanchier spicata) and two native species (shrub Rubus idaeus and tree Prunus padus) distributed in monodominant patches along roadsides in SW Finland affect arthropod-feeding guild biomass and food webs. Under trees, regardless of their origin, the diversity and biomass of understory plants and arthropods living in the canopy and on the ground was significantly reduced compared to shrubs, which had higher biodiversity and more significant interactions between feeding guilds and understory plants. The higher biomass of native understory plants increased the abundance of herbivores under the shrubs, and thus indirectly predators. The species richness of understory plants determined the richness of saprophagous organisms in native stands. We conclude that more open roadside shrub canopies support greater plant and arthropod biodiversity and more complex food web structures compared to shady tree stands, and that alien shrubs do not necessarily reduce arthropod biodiversity. The study opens up the possibility of predicting arthropod composition and biomass using functional attributes of understory vegetation and the origin, physiognomy and species identity of overstory dominants.

AB  - Most landscapes today have lost much of their historical biodiversity, particularly the largest animals (mega- fauna). Yet, in some regions declining human pressure and stronger conservation policies allow megafauna to return, and rewilding efforts sometimes seek to amplify these trends through reintroductions. Megafauna, however, return to landscapes still inhabited and used by people, making it crucial to understand how they adapt to such shared landscapes. Here, we studied the space use of a uniquely diverse megafauna community, including recently reintroduced European bison, in a rewilding area in the Romanian Carpathians. We conducted extensive sign surveys (2688 km) to monitor eight large mammals in 2022 and 2023. We then applied Bayesian occupancy models to understand the space use of our target species. Our results show that landscape composition is important for allowing a diverse megafauna community to share space with people. Many species (e.g., red deer, roe deer, grey wolf, brown bear) used different forms of refuge habitat (i.e., topographically complex areas, dense forest) to avoid people. Only one species, the European bison, appeared to be negatively affected by direct human pressure (i.e., active logging). Conversely, land-use legacies such as forest gaps and abandoned pastures were selected by most species (i.e., European bison, red deer, roe deer, wild boar, brown bear). Our study shows that diverse megafauna, including the largest species, can share space with people in mosaic landscapes. These landscapes, especially if human pressure is declining, offer major opportunities to protect megafauna and restore their ecological roles, in Europe and elsewhere.

AB  - Urbanisation has threatened native forests globally with remaining forests often existing as small isolated patches in a harsh landscape matrix. Devoid of large predators, forest patches may continue to support ungulate populations, but their conservation is challenging as unchecked population growth can bring about ecosystem imbalances and threaten other native species. Three ungulate species exist in small rainforest fragments of urbanised Singapore: the locally endangered lesser mouse-deer (Tragulus kanchil), and the re-emergent wild boar (Sus scrofa) and sambar deer (Rusa unicolor). Using an array of camera traps, we estimated the densities of the lesser mouse-deer, wild boar and sambar deer in rainforest patches, and determined the influence of habitat and landscape factors on their occupancies. We also studied the interactions of the wild boar and sambar deer with the lesser mouse-deer spatially and temporally. Estimates of the lesser mouse-deer density showed that the population has recovered since the 1990s. Its density was comparable to the wild boar, but higher than sambar deer. Detections of lesser mouse-deer were significantly higher in primary forests compared to old secondary forests, and increasing distance away from the nearest road or public trail was a strong predictor of its occupancy. There was no evidence that the wild boar and sambar deer competitively excluded the lesser mouse-deer, rather, co-occupancy was observed. We demonstrated that temporal niche partitioning between the lesser mouse-deer and the two other ungulates likely explained their co-existence. Notwithstanding this, there are indications of understorey alteration due to the wild boar occurrences. Thus, continued monitoring of ungulate populations and conservation efforts focused on maintaining the health of the primary and secondary rainforest patches, and reducing disturbance, are critical to sustain future populations of lesser mouse-deer. Our study has shed new light on the habitat use and species interactions of tropical ungulates in urban predator-free ecosystems and highlight the importance in gaining a deeper understanding of their dynamics to more effectively guide conservation and management decisions.

AB  - Ecosystem restoration is a critical component of land management, countering the loss of native biodiversity. Restoration efforts are enhanced by reintroducing naturally occurring ecosystem processes, including disturbances that may impact species characteristics such as niche position or niche size. In grasslands, grazing and fire affect plant diversity and habitat complexity, which potentially influence insect dietary behaviors and thus their contributions to functions like seed and arthropod predation. Using carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes, we characterized variation in the dietary niche of six ground beetle species (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in response to grazing by reintroduced bison and prescribed fire disturbances in twenty tallgrass prairies. Management disturbances did not affect activity density for most beetle species and mean trophic position was mostly unaffected. However, five of six species exhibited increased trophic niche area and breadth with disturbances, indicating a switch to a more generalist diet that incorporated a wider range of food items.The combination of bison and fire impacts may increase vegetation patchiness and heterogeneity, driving these diet changes. Morphological traits and microhabitat preferences might mediate response to disturbances and the resulting heterogeneity. Combining prescribed fire and grazing, which increases plant diversity and vegetation structural diversity, may help beetle communities establish over time and support the ecological functions to which these insects contribute.

AB  - Herbivores shape vegetation by suppressing certain plant species while benefitting others. By thus modifying plant species functional composition, herbivores affect carbon cycling, albedo, vegetation structure and species' interactions. These effects have been suggested to be able to counteract the effects of increasing temperatures on vegetation in alpine environments. Managing the dominant large ungulates in these ecosystems could thus provide a tool to mitigate climate change effects. However, it is possible that legacy effects of past grazing will dampen ungulate impacts on vegetation. We shed a light on this topic by investigating the short- and long-term effects of varying sheep densities on the plant trait composition in the Norwegian alpine tundra with centuries-long of intensive grazing history. In the first part of our study, we quantified the effects of sheep on the plant community functional trait composition at different elevations and under moderate and low productivity in. We combined data from two long-term (14 and 19 yr) sheep fence experiments and showed that differences in sheep densities did not affect plant trait composition, irrespective of productivity. However, in the second part of our study, we showed that the plant trait composition in mainland (that has been grazed for centuries) differed from vegetation on islands which have been herbivore-free. Taken together, these results suggest that sheep have an effect on the alpine plant communities on historical time scales covering centuries, but that the resulting sheep grazing resistant/tolerant communities may not respond to shorter-term (14 and 19 yr) changes in sheep densities, that is, at temporal scales relevant for ecosystem management. Furthermore, we showed that the plant trait composition at the site with low productivity had gone through a temporal trait change independent of sheep treatment, potentially due to increased temperatures and precipitation, suggesting that sheep may not be able to counteract climatic impacts in the areas with centuries-long grazing history.

AB  - The reintroduction of wildlife can have significant ecological impacts by altering the flow of energy in food webs. Recently, plains bison were reintroduced to part of Banff National Park after a 150-year absence. The large herbivore's reintroduction was expected to have far-reaching effects on the ecosystem due to its significant energy requirements and interactions with habitat and other sympatric species. This study explores the impacts of bison reintroduction on the movement and resource use of another large-bodied grazer, the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. Between 2018 and 2021, we collected data from GPS collars fit on 39 bighorn sheep and 11 bison. We analyzed home range patterns, resource selection, and interactions to investigate the potential for interspecific competition, facilitation, and resource complementarity. At the population level, bison and bighorn sheep exhibited low levels of spatial overlap and there was strong evidence of resource separation in all seasons. Interactions between species did not appear to affect sheep movement rates; however, we did see differences in forage selection patterns for sheep with overlapping home ranges with bison. Collectively, results did not support the potential for competition or facilitation between bison and bighorn sheep and instead provided the strongest evidence of complementarity.
   Reintroducing North America's largest land mammal can have significant ecological impacts, particularly on the species they interact with. Using GPS data, we analyzed space and resource use of a recently reintroduced herd of plains bison to Banff National Park, to investigate potential interactions with another co-occurring grazing ungulate, the Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. Comparing the potential for interspecific mechanisms, our study provides further evidence, that where suitable habitat exists, co-existence between lost species assemblages may be achieved meeting social and ecological goals.image

AB  - Most of the tropical rainforests are subject to both anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) cause forest clearings within the tropics. This study was conducted at mid-elevations (1100-1700 m a.s.l.) in Mount Cameroon National Park. We assessed the difference in the structure of bird communities in the forest and areas located nearby affected by elephant activities. We used the point-count method; 22 points were established within each habitat. The vegetation was visually estimated within a 50 m radius surrounding each counting point. In total, 1603 birds from 85 species were recorded. The vegetation cover from 3 to 5 m at points with elephant activity was significantly lower compared to points without elephant activity. Bird species richness was significantly higher around points in pasture compared to points in intact forest. Habitat type and the percentage of vegetation layer from 3 to 5 m significantly impacted the bird community structure. The points in the pasture were especially characterized by the increased abundance of some open habitat species (e.g., Chubb's Cisticola chubbi). Few studies have documented the effects of elephant activity on other species, although the effects are widely stated as important drivers of habitat diversity in tropical forests. In conclusion, disturbance caused by elephants leads to increased bird community diversity due to the increased heterogeneity of the environment, which documents the high importance of elephants as ecosystem engineers.

AB  - Co-occurrence of ungulates in multi-species assemblages has fascinated ecologists because these species seemingly belong to the same guild - feeding on plants. Across large parts of the high mountains of Central Asia, ibex (Capra sibirica) and argali (Ovis ammon), both predominantly grazers, co-occur at local and regional scales. However, little is known about the ecological and anthropogenic factors that influence their spatial distribution, co-occurrence and habitat use. We examined factors affecting the distribution and co-occurrence of these two sympatric species in Tost Tosonbumba Nature Reserve in southern Mongolia using an occupancy modeling approach. Specifically, we used single species occupancy models to examine the influence of road density, livestock density, terrain ruggedness and elevation on occupancy of these two species separately. We then assessed how these two species influence each other's distribution by using multi-species occupancy models. The model-averaged occupancy probabilities for ibex and argali were 0.64 +/- 0.3 se and 0.44 +/- 0.2 se, respectively. Terrain ruggedness positively influenced ibex distribution, while it negatively affected the occupancy of argali. We found limited evidence of relationship with factors associated with human disturbance. The species interaction factor, which indicates the level of co-occurrence, suggested that ibex and argali occurred independent of each other (phi = 0.72 +/- 0.3 se). Together, our results imply that there was limited co-occurrence between the two species and that this was largely driven by terrain ruggedness at the scale of the home range. These results suggest that topography plays an important role in enabling these two species to co-occur at the regional scale.

AB  - There is growing interest in adapting forest management to increase diversity, in both composition and structure, to restore old-growth characteristics and to build resiliency against anthropogenic disturbances. In order to determine appropriate interventions, managers need to evaluate the quality of natural areas but efficient and effective measurements are elusive. Using a suite of herbaceous species and measuring their responses to experimental treatments, we aim to assess (1) the sensitivity of different metrics and (2) the current and likely future effects of gap-generating disturbances and abundant deer on the understory of a northern hardwood forest in Wisconsin, USA. More specifically, we investigated plant cover, density, height, aggregate height and the proportion of individuals producing flowers/fruits under unmanipulated canopies v. three gap sizes, with and without downed woody material (DWM) additions, and inside v. outside of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus vir-ginianus) exclusion fences, approximately seven years after treatment. The effects were taxon-specific with Anemone quinquefolia, Arisaema triphyllum, Laportea canadensis and Trillium grandiflorum being most responsive to canopy structure, Impatiens spp. and T. grandiflorum to deer pressure, and A. triphyllum, Impatiens spp., L. canadensis and Sanguinaria canadensis to canopy structure in combination with DWM. Cover was least responsive to treatments, density and proportion of sexually reproducing individuals sometimes differed, but height was overall the best metric. Mean height and maximum height showed similar results so we suggest that managers focus on measuring maximum height to limit sampling time. We also draw attention to the importance of retaining and/or creating DWM which has long been recognized as an important structural feature promoting diversity in natural forests. In the present study, DWM additions appeared to play a role in mitigating micro-climates and/or deer pressure for multiple herbaceous species.

AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate to what extent wild ungulates (fallow deer) can contribute to the maintenance of semi-natural calcareous grasslands, which are a threatened habitat type (natura 2000 code *6210). In a 10-year exclosure experiment, we tested the effects of ungulate foraging using three treatments: (A) control with combined foraging of herded sheep and wild fallow deer, (B) sheep exclosure with only deer foraging and (C) total exclosure with no foraging. Treatments not grazed by sheep (B, C) were characterized by significantly declining species numbers, litter accumulation and shrub encroachment. Despite high population densities, the effect of fallow deer alone (B) was weak: Succession of woody species was only partly inhibited, while annuals, short-growing and rosette-building plant species were strongly suppressed by litter accumulation. Only the combination of sheep and fallow deer foraging preserved vegetation structure and species richness and led to a promotion of target species. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that we need to continue the traditional land-use forms such as sheep grazing in order to maintain calcareous grasslands. However, we should also raise our awareness for wild animals and analyse more in depth their potential contribution to the conservation management of open habitats.

AB  - Selective browsing by deer on young trees may impede the management goal of increasing forest resilience against climate change and other disturbances. Deer population density is often considered the main driver of browsing impacts on young trees, however, a range of other variables such as food availability also affect this relationship. In this study, we use browsing survey data from 135 research plots to explore patterns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) browsing pressure on woody plants in mountainous forests in central Europe. We fitted species-specific generalised linear mixed models for eight woody taxa, assessing the potential effects of understory characteristics, roe deer abundance and lying deadwood on browsing intensity. Our study reveals conspecific and associational effects for woody taxa that are intermediately browsed by roe deer. Selective browsing pressure was mediated by preferences of plants, in that, browsing of strongly preferred woody taxa as for example mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) and of least preferred woody taxa, for example Norway spruce (Picea abies) was not affected by the surrounding understory vegetation, while browsing pressure on intermediately browsed species like for example silver fir (Abies alba) was affected by understory characteristics. Contrary to our expectations, roe deer abundance was only positively associated with browsing pressure on silver fir and bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), while all other plants were unaffected by deer abundance. Finally, we did not find an influence of lying deadwood volume on the browsing pressure on any woody-plant species. Overall, our results indicate that patterns in browsing preference and intensity are species-specific processes and are partly affected by the surrounding understory vegetation. Current management strategies that aim to reduce browsing pressure through culling may be inefficient as they do not address other drivers of browsing pressure. However, managers also need to consider the characteristics of the local understory vegetation in addition to deer abundance and design species-specific plans to reduce browsing on woody plant taxa.

AB  - Large introduced mammalian herbivores, either as livestock or feral populations, can have important effects on vegetation and animals. Introduced herbivores can be of high conservation concern if they impact threatened native species in protected areas. We evaluated temporal and spatial trends in the relative abundance of introduced water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and their potential to induce competition-related ecological and demographic effects on native rusa deer (Rusa timorensis) in Komodo National Park and the Wae Wuul Nature Reserve-two protected areas in Eastern Indonesia. To monitor ungulate population abundances and population growth rates of water buffalo and rusa deer, we counted their dung (a validated abundance index in these two species) along 350 permanently marked transects at 11 sites over five islands annually between 2003 and 2018. Water buffalo dung abundance varied with the site, year and their interaction. Water buffalo dung was most abundant within the Wae Wuul Nature Reserve, and their dung abundance varied considerably among sites in Komodo National Park. Water buffalo site-specific dung abundances fluctuated independently over time. In areas of high water buffalo dung densities, rusa deer altered resource use and had lower population densities than sites without water buffalo. Rusa deer dung-based population growth rates were negatively influenced by density-dependent regulation and only weakly by water buffalo dung density. Currently, managers do not control water buffalo in either protected area. Nevertheless, the benefits of control could reduce water buffalo effects on vegetation composition, watercourse integrity, or the potential to transmit disease into native ungulates.

AB  - Emerald ash borer (EAB) (Agrilus planipennis), non-native shrubs, and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have been independently shown to affect woody seedling communities. Our objective was to determine the relative importance as well as additive and interactive-effects of these stressors in the context of two environ-mental factors, canopy tree competition and site wetness. We sampled 24 sites, representing three natural non -congruent gradients in ash mortality, deer browse, and introduced shrub invasion. We explored the responses of seedling species abundance, diversity and richness to an array of deer herbivory, ash mortality, and introduced shrubs and varying levels of canopy tree competition, site wetness. The effects of each stressor on the differences in the relative abundance of seedling species was also evaluated. Our results indicate a persistent negative effect of non-native shrubs in drier forest plots on native seedling abundance, richness, and diversity. In wetter forests, non-native shrubs had no effect on native seedling richness or abundance and were positively related to diversity. Deer browse had a negative effect on seedling diversity in wetter forests and no effect in drier forests. Canopy tree competition had a positive effect on seedling diversity in drier forest plots, but negatively affected diversity in wetter forest plots. Ordination analysis revealed that site wetness, non-native shrubs and the total basal area of trees in the stand had the largest impacts on the species composition of seedlings found at each site. Our results suggest that site wetness and chronic stressors like deer and introduced shrubs are interacting to shift seedling communities towards fewer native species as well as to reduce seedling species richness and diversity.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems are shaped by disturbance regimes and environmental factors, with fire and herbivory historically maintaining biodiversity in grasslands. However, fire suppression in protected areas has led to unintended ecological consequences, including species dominance and litter accumulation, which limit space for herbaceous communities and increase the risk of severe fires. We assessed the influence of fire regimes, and local biotic and abiotic factors on species diversity in subtropical highland grasslands of southern Brazil. We expect species diversity to be lower in sites with longer periods without disturbances, as this may favor fast growing, dominant species and lead to an accumulation of litter. We sampled vegetation and environmental variables, and calculated fire regimes to assess their effects on species richness (alpha diversity) and species replacement (beta diversity). We found litter volume and community dominance increased with species richness, while with more bare soil there were fewer species. Prolonged time without fire and biomass accumulation contributed to greater dominance, but dominance was lower in steeper terrain. In terms of beta diversity, species replacement was influenced by litter, live biomass, soil depth, and rock cover. Our study suggests changes in disturbance regimes can have short-term effects, with litter accumulation negatively impacting diversity and increasing the likelihood of catastrophic fires due to the buildup of flammable material. Our findings highlight the indirect role of fire regimes in shaping diversity, with litter accumulation emerging as a critical factor influencing species richness, composition, and community dynamics, as well as increasing fire risk.

AB  - Climate change has led to shifts in species distribution and become a crucial factor in the extinction of species. Increasing average temperatures, temperature extremes, and unpredictable weather events have all become a part of a perfect storm that is threatening ecosystems. Higher altitude habitats are disproportionately affected by climate change, and habitats for already threatened specialist species are shrinking. The Siberian ibex, Capra sibirica, is distributed across Central Asia and Southern Siberia and is the dominant ungulate in the Pamir plateau. To understand how climate change could affect the habitat of Siberian ibex in the Taxkorgan Nature Reserve (TNR), an ensemble species distribution model was built using 109 occurrence points from a four-year field survey. Fifteen environmental variables were used to simulate suitable habitat distribution under different climate change scenarios. Our results demonstrated that a stable, suitable habitat for Siberian ibex was mostly distributed in the northwest and northeast of the TNR. We found that climate change will further reduce the area of suitable habitat for this species. In the scenarios of RCP2.6 to 2070 and RCP8.5 to 2050, habitat loss would exceed 30%. In addition, suitable habitats for Siberian ibex will shift to higher latitudes under climate change. As a result, timely prediction of the distribution of endangered animals is conducive to the conservation of the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems, particularly in arid areas.

AB  - Riparian woody plant communities, including shrubs and trees, are essential for maintaining biodiversity, protecting against floods, reducing erosion, and transporting nutrients. However, these habitats are greatly threatened by human activities, particularly agricultural land acquisition, and the introduction of invasive species. This study examined species diversity and interspecific association in riparian woody plant communities along rivers in the Romanian Carpathians. The study focused on communities of Salix purpurea, S. alba, and Hippopha & euml; rhamnoides in mountain regions, with varying sampling efforts at different sites for each species. A total of 174 plant species were found, predominantly herbaceous (77.9%), followed by trees (11.6%) and shrubs (10.5%). While S. alba and S. purpurea communities show high species richness and abundance, S. alba has slightly higher diversity (H ' approximate to 2.23, SD = 0.28) than S. purpurea (H ' approximate to 1.69, SD = 0.42). Contrarily, significant differences exist between H. rhamnoides and S. alba communities in species richness (p = .007) and Shannon diversity (p = .004). PCA analysis elaborated on distinct distribution patterns of plant associations within habitats S. purpurea community, H. rhamnoides community, and S. alba community. Four invasive species (Oenothera biennis L. and Oxalis stricta L. in S. alba communities, Reynoutria sachalinensis Nakai in both S. purpurea and H. rhamnoides communities, and Erigeron canadensis L. in H. rhamnoides communities) were identified, as requiring conservation efforts. Hemicryptophytes dominate species richness, while microphanerophytes and megaphanerophytes significantly contribute to plant abundance. H. rhamnoides formed Hippopha & euml; rhamnoides dunes (2160) Natura 2000 habitat, while S. alba created galleries within the 92A0 Salix alba and Populus alba habitat. In conclusion, the findings from this study highlight the importance of preserving riparian habitats because their value goes beyond local or regional considerations and extends to the global scale due to their unique characteristics.

AB  - Mediterranean landscapes have been shaped by millennia of human activities, but recent land use changes resulted in the loss of open habitats and the introduction of a novel predator, the cattle egret (Bublucus ibis). These processes may specifically affect reptiles, so we investigated their impacts on reptile communities in 272 maquis in Northern Israel. We collected data on climate, land use, land cover, and potential egret predation pressure, and modelled their effects on reptile species abundance, richness, and turnover. Reptile abundance increased in colder, wetter and higher sites whereas species richness peaked in sites with intermediate geoclimatic conditions. Both abundance and richness were positively associated with goat grazing. Reptile species known to be preyed upon by egrets exhibited lower abundance at sites with high egret predation pressure. Total reptile abundance, egret-prey abundance, and reptile richness tended to be higher in sites with intermediate cover of woody vegetation. Species turnover was weakly related to variation in climate and habitat variables. In sum, maquis reptile assemblages are shaped by an interplay of climate, land use, habitat structure, and predation risk. Consequently, climate warming may lead to abundance declines in drier sites and some reptile habitats are deteriorating in the absence of goat grazing. Alarmingly, a novel threat manifested by the expansion of cattle egrets can have adverse effects on the abundance of egret-sensitive species. Collectively, these processes highlight reptile communities as an emerging conservation concern in maquis ecosystems exposed to land use and climate change, specifically where cattle egrets are prevalent.

AB  - Deer populations and their impacts on forest ecosystems are increasing globally. Given the imperative and expense to mitigate impacts of invasive deer, we aimed to elucidate critical drivers of (i) deer density, (ii) deer impacts, and (iii) the relationship between them, to facilitate targeted management. We used quantile regression forests to model deer density (faecal pellet counts at 1948 locations) and impacts (browsing and other impacts on > 23,000 woody plants at 343 locations) across a mosaic of agricultural and forested ecosystems in Victoria, Australia (12,775 km2). Climate, topography, vegetation cover, and distance to water features were included as model covariates. Modelled deer density (r (2) = 0.71, MAE = 0.56 pellets/m(2) ) was most influenced by distance to waterbodies (> 10 ha, 31.2%), elevation (14.3%) and woody vegetation cover (12.9%). Modelled deer impact (r (2) = 0.32, MAE = 6.9%) was most influenced by deer density (21.0%), mean annual precipitation (12.8%) and elevation (12.2%). Deer density was typically highest near large waterbodies, at low elevation, and with intermediate tree cover (40-70%). Impacts increased steadily with deer density up to similar to 2 pellets/m(2). Our study demonstrates the importance of forest water and forest agricultural interfaces for both deer density and impacts. Deer are likely to be most abundant near waterbodies due to the availability of high-quality forage and water, and prefer lowland locations that have access to both open and forested habitats. Spatial models can be used to predict deer density and associated impacts to facilitate targeted invasive deer management.

AB  - AimDespite the evidenced importance of insects in savannah ecosystems, the drivers of their diversity patterns remain poorly understood, particularly in the Afrotropical region. This study addresses part of this gap by investigating the effects of climate, habitat, disturbance and vegetation variables on species richness and community composition of phytophagous and predatory insects in South African savannahs.LocationKruger National Park (KNP), South Africa.TaxonPhytophagous insects (moths) and carnivorous insects (mantises).MethodsMoths and mantises were light-trapped in 60 plots distributed across KNP during two seasons. Direct and indirect effects of environmental variables on insect species richness were analysed using structural equation models, and on community composition through distance-based redundancy analyses (db-RDA).ResultsBased on an extensive dataset of 65,593 moth individuals representing 817 species and 3511 mantis individuals representing 38 species, we identified plant communities as the primary driver of species richness and community structure for both insect groups. The effects of vegetation on insect communities were indirectly shaped by climate, particularly mean temperature (negatively correlated with precipitation), through its effects on plant species richness. Additionally, a complex interplay among bedrock type, water availability and disturbance from large herbivores further shaped insect diversity.Main ConclusionsOur findings highlight the critical role of plant species richness in determining insect diversity patterns in savannah ecosystems. We also confirmed the region's vulnerability to climate change, as decreasing precipitation and increasing temperatures alter vegetation composition and biomass, consequently affecting insect communities. Effective conservation strategies should focus on managing large herbivores to maintain diverse vegetation, which is crucial for supporting insect diversity. Priority should be given to balancing water availability and disturbance intensity, particularly in preserving the health of rivers and their surroundings, to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on these ecosystems.

AB  - Community stability is a fundamental factor sustaining ecosystem functioning and is affected by species richness and species evenness. The Arctic is warming more rapidly than other biomes, and cryptogam plant species (specifically lichens and bryophytes in this study) are major contributors to tundra biodiversity and productivity. However, to our knowledge, the impacts of warming on cryptogam community stability and the underlying mechanisms have not been investigated. We conducted a 13-year summer warming experiment in mesic birch hummock tundra vegetation near Daring Lake in the continental interior of low Arctic Canada and recorded patterns of cryptogam species abundance in several different growing seasons. Warming decreased the stability of total community abundance, had no effects on species richness, but increased species evenness and species synchrony. Structural equation model analyses indicated that higher species richness was the principal factor associated with the stronger community abundance stability in the control plots and that this effect was driven primarily by a negative correlation with species synchrony. By contrast, higher species evenness was the principal factor associated with the weakened community abundance stability in the warming plots, and this effect was driven primarily by a positive correlation with species synchrony. Our study suggests that climate warming could reduce cryptogam plant community stability in low Arctic tundra and, therefore, decrease important ecosystem services, including carbon storage and food availability to caribou in northern regions.

AB  - Human disturbance directly affects animal populations and communities, but indirect effects of disturbance on species behaviors are less well understood. For instance, disturbance may alter predator activity and cause knock-on effects to predator-sensitive foraging in prey. Camera traps provide an emerging opportunity to investigate such disturbance-mediated impacts to animal behaviors across multiple scales. We used camera trap data to test predictions about predator-sensitive behavior in three ungulate species (caribou Rangifer tarandus; white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus; moose, Alces alces) across two western boreal forest landscapes varying in disturbance. We quantified behavior as the number of camera trap photos per detection event and tested its relationship to inferred human-mediated predation risk between a landscape with greater industrial disturbance and predator activity and a "control" landscape with lower human and predator activity. We also assessed the finer-scale influence on behavior of variation in predation risk (relative to habitat variation) across camera sites within the more disturbed landscape. We predicted that animals in areas with greater predation risk (e.g., more wolf activity, less cover) would travel faster past cameras and generate fewer photos per detection event, while animals in areas with less predation risk would linger (rest, forage, investigate), generating more photos per event. Our predictions were supported at the landscape-level, as caribou and moose had more photos per event in the control landscape where disturbance-mediated predation risk was lower. At a finer-scale within the disturbed landscape, no prey species showed a significant behavioral response to wolf activity, but the number of photos per event decreased for white-tailed deer with increasing line of sight (m) along seismic lines (i.e., decreasing visual cover), consistent with a predator-sensitive response. The presence of juveniles was associated with shorter behavioral events for caribou and moose, suggesting greater predator sensitivity for females with calves. Only moose demonstrated a positive behavioral association (i.e., longer events) with vegetation productivity (16-day NDVI), suggesting that for other species bottom-up influences of forage availability were generally weaker than top-down influences from predation risk. Behavioral insights can be gleaned from camera trap surveys and provide complementary information about animal responses to predation risk, and thus about the indirect impacts of human disturbances on predator-prey interactions.

Detailed knowledge about foraging is essential as it may influence the vital rates, which, in turn, can affect trophic relationships between species, and population dynamics. The aims of this study were to evaluate resource and trophic niche partitioning in summer/autumn between the endangered Atlantic-Gaspesie caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) population, moose (Alces americanus) and their incidental predators, the black bear (Ursus americanus) and coyote (Canis latrans), and to quantify the extent to which these predators consumed caribou. Bayesian isotopic analysis showed a small overlap in trophic niche for the two sympatric ungulates suggesting a low potential for resource competition. Our results also revealed that caribou occupied a larger isotopic niche area than moose, suggesting a greater diversity of resources used by caribou. Not surprisingly, coyotes consumed mainly deer (Odocoileus virginianus), moose, snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and occasionally caribou, while bears consumed mainly vegetation and, to a lesser extent, moose and caribou. As coyotes and bears also feed on plant species, we documented trophic niche overlap between caribou and their predators, as searching for similar resources can force them to use the same habitats and thus increase the encounter rate and, ultimately, mortality risk for caribou. Although the decline in the Gaspesie caribou population is mostly driven by habitat-mediated predation, we found evidence that the low level of resource competition with moose, added to the shared resources with incidental predators, mainly bears, may contribute to jeopardize the recovery of this endangered caribou population. Highlighting the trophic interaction between species is needed to establish efficient conservation and management strategies to insure the persistence of endangered populations. The comparison of trophic niches of species sharing the same habitat or resources is fundamental to evaluate the mechanisms of coexistence or competition and eventually predict the consequences of ecosystem changes in the community.

AB  - Afforestation with nature-based solutions is beneficial for restoring biodiversity. On the Loess Plateau of China, numerous monocultures have been converted to mixed plantations following nature-based solutions. However, the effect of plant mixture on understory plant species diversity remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the understory plant species diversity of different Hippophae rhamnoides mixed plantations resulting from nature-based solutions and assessed the relative importance of associated factors driving their changes. The results showed that the response of understory plant species diversity to plant mixture was nonsignificant, except for Armeniaca sibirica, which significantly reduced the understory plant species diversity. However, mixed plantations had higher variability in plant species diversity and environmental factors among individual plots than monocultures. In mixed plantations, understory plant species diversity was mainly affected by shrub stratum, followed by overstory stratum, soil nutrients, herbaceous stratum, and topography. Specifically, understory plant species diversity was positively associated with stand density and herb biomass but negatively associated with elevation and soil nitrogen. In particular, soil nitrogen also had negative impacts on herb biomass but was beneficial for the growth of trees and shrubs, indicating that trees and shrubs outperformed herbs in exploiting soil nutrients, a consequence of intense interspecific competition. In addition, the impacts of canopy cover and slope aspects on understory plant species diversity were nonsignificant. Overall, in mixed plantations on the Loess Plateau, understory plant species diversity was primarily affected by interspecific competition for preempting soil nitrogen.

AB  - Grazing from megaherbivores such as bison (Bison bison) and periodic fire are 2 important disturbance regimes in grassland ecosystems. In restored tallgrass prairies where these processes were previously removed, prescribed fire application and bison reintroduction are tools used by managers to recreate habitat heterogeneity formed by these disturbances. Tallgrass prairie bird communities may be indirectly affected by these disturbances, as bison and prescribed fire alter the structure of critical breeding habitat for grassland birds. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of bison and prescribed fire on grassland breeding birds in 2 tallgrass prairie preserves in the Midwest region of the United States. We surveyed bird communities, vegetation structure, and bison activity at an Illinois preserve (n = 20 sites) and an Indiana preserve (n = 27 sites) in 2020 and 2021 and compiled a history of restoration activities (e.g., prescribed fire, planting year) at these sites. Grazing and fire disturbances affected grassland bird diversity and abundances, whereas we found little to no evidence that restoration planting age and spatiotemporal factors affected grassland bird populations. Disturbance effects often corresponded to species-specific responses to changes in vegetation structure. Grassland-obligate bird diversity was lower in recently burned and ungrazed management units, in comparison to unburned-ungrazed and unburned-grazed sites. Henslow's sparrow (Centronyx henslowii), a species known to be sensitive to recent prescribed fire, exhibited increased abundance with time since fire, an increase that was further amplified with bison presence. These results highlight the importance of applying varying levels of grazing and fire disturbance to provide variable vegetation structure to accommodate the habitat preferences of a diversity of grassland bird species. Moreover, our results indicate that bison may play a role in mediating the differing effects of variable prescribed fire frequencies on grassland bird species of concern.

AB  - Perennially and intermittently available water in lentic, spring-fed herbaceous meadows supports wetland plants that build and maintain absorbent soil organic matter, capture sediment, prevent erosion, and thereby sustain riparian ecosystems. Enhanced forage and available water attract a diversity of wildlife and grazing animals that can degrade riparian vegetation through prolonged overuse. We tested novel monitoring methods and adapted existing methods to obtain quantified vegetation data that have been consistently linked to riparian functionality and compared these data to ungulate species use. We quantified ungulate use with time-lapse cameras at 10 Nevada spring-fed herbaceous meadows where core greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat, public land grazing allotments, and free-roaming horse (Equus caballus) herd management areas (Bureau of Land Management) or territories (U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service) overlapped. Free-roaming horses used most study sites over longer periods and grazed more intensely than cattle or domestic sheep. Native ungulate grazing intensity was comparatively negligible. Free-roaming horses selected spring-fed meadow sites on average 51 (+/- 33 [SE]) times more than the surrounding rangelands, and cattle selected them 30 +/- 23 times more. Within the wettest area of a site, study sites with longer duration of use and higher intensity of use had more soil alteration and bare ground. Riparian ecosystem degradation occurred where meadows had limited rest or recovery time from grazing during the growing season. At all sites we noted loss of riparian function, especially within the hydric areas with the highest potential to grow abundant cover of stabilizing wetland plant species. Transects for monitoring soil alteration and vegetation cover in this hydric location can provide a leading indicator of riparian recovery or degradation and help in adjusting free-roaming horse population levels or livestock management strategies.

AB  - Fire and herbivory have profound effects on vegetation in savanna ecosystems, but little is known about how different herbivore groups influence vegetation dynamics after fire. We assessed the separate and combined effects of herbivory by cattle and wild meso- and megaherbivores on postfire herbaceous vegetation cover, species richness, and species turnover in a savanna ecosystem in central Kenya. We measured these vegetation attributes for five sampling periods (from 2013 to 2017) in prescribed burns and unburned areas located within a series of replicated long-term herbivore exclosures that allow six different combinations of cattle and wild meso- and megaherbivores (elephants and giraffes). Vegetation cover (grasses, mainly) and species richness were initially reduced by burning but recovered by 15-27 months after fire, suggesting strong resilience to infrequent fire. However, the rates of recovery differed in plots accessible by different wild and domestic herbivore guilds. Wildlife (but not cattle) delayed postfire recovery of grasses, and the absence of wildlife (with or without cattle) delayed recovery of forbs. Herbivory by only cattle increased grass species richness in burned relative to unburned areas. Herbivory by cattle (with or without wildlife), however, reduced forb species richness in burned relative to unburned areas. Herbivory by wild ungulates (but not cattle) increased herbaceous species turnover in burned relative to unburned areas. Megaherbivores had negligible modifying effects on these results. This study demonstrates that savanna ecosystems are remarkably resilient to infrequent fires, but postfire grazing by cattle and wild mesoherbivores exerts different effects on recovery trajectories of herbaceous vegetation.

AB  - Rare grassland herbs are increasingly threatened by increase in large herbivores. Exclosures that exclude large herbivores can be effective tools for the protection and conservation of grazed plant communities. However, installation of the exclosures in abandoned semi-natural grasslands has two aspects: protection of vegetation and elimination of disturbance by herbivores. We aimed to clarify the exclosures promote or hinder the conservation of grassland herbs in a semi-natural grassland. The field survey was conducted in a semi-natural grassland under grazing pressure by sika deer in central Japan. Fences were erected in 2010 and 2011. Plant species composition and species in flower were recorded from 2011 to 2022 inside and outside the fences. We compared the change of species composition with species composition data recorded in the same grassland patch in 1980s, before deer numbers increased, as reference. Within the fence erected in 2010, species composition was getting similar to the reference from 2011 to 2017, but regressed by 2022. Correspondingly, the cover of grassland herbs and the number of grassland herbs in flower first increased and then decreased. Tree species conversely increased from 2017 to 2022. Within the fence erected in 2011, the species composition was hardly getting similar to the reference, and grassland herb cover remained lower. Long-term fencing can lead to a decline in grassland herbs with an increase in competing shrubs though the grassland herbs temporarily increase within the fence erected earlier. Anthropogenic disturbance may be necessary for the conservation of grassland herbs in long-term fenced grassland communities.

AB  - Large herbivores (>= 45 kg) fulfill key ecological functions. Since the Late Pleistocene megafauna diversity and abundances have declined sharply, with profound consequences for ecosystems. On this background the concept of trophic rewilding has emerged and is increasingly applied to restore natural disturbance regimes and trophic interactions, ultimately aiming to recreate self-sustaining, dynamic and diverse ecosystems. Effects of such efforts (e.g., more heterogeneous habitats) are evident, but herbivore space use, and the resulting distribution of effects on vegetation remain poorly understood. Here, we examine habitat selection of semi-feral water buffalos (Bubalus bubalis), horses (Equus ferus) and cattle (Bos taurus) in a Danish rewilding area. We modelled space use with remote sensed covariates, reflecting resources (vegetation greenness, distance to water) and infrastructure (distances to fences, paths, shelter). Seasonal differences and former land use were tested separately. We found large-herbivore space use to shift seasonally, reflecting food and water availability, and to be influenced by infrastructure and former land use. Horses reacted less to vegetation greenness and water than the two bovids. Cattle selected for green vegetation in summer, while buffalos showed the strongest association with water bodies. Overall, the three semi-feral herbivore species diverged in their habitat use both spatially and seasonally. This can be expected to translate to variable and complementary ecological impacts such as grazing, physical disturbances and habitat engineering. Such variable space use likely increases habitat heterogeneity and species richness. We therefore suggest that a diverse large-herbivore guild is key, both to understanding megafauna ecology and for successful rewilding efforts.

AB  - Invasion of non-native shrubs comprises a serious economic and ecological problem in North American forests. Prescribed grazing by goats may offer an effective alternative to traditional methods of control, but has received little study in forest settings. In a 5-year field experiment, we varied the stocking of goats and number of grazing periods to determine effects of prescribed grazing on both invasive shrubs and native plant species. Specifically, we examined how varied stocking levels and grazing periods affect: (1) the cover and height of invasive shrub and native woody species (2) the cover and diversity of herbaceous species, and (3) the density of native tree seedlings. Data were analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. We found that prescribed grazing by goats significantly reduced the cover and height of invasive shrubs, regardless of goat stocking or duration. Generally, the greatest reductions in invasive shrub cover occurred in treatments with two grazing periods, regardless of goat stocking. While we observed mostly neutral or positive effects on the herbaceous layer, all grazing treatments reduced the cover and height of native understory woody species. While changes were not significant, we observed a general decline in the aggregate height of native tree species regeneration. Our results suggest that prescribed grazing by goats provides an effective and environmentally friendly treatment for heavy invasions of non-native shrubs such as Rosa multiflora, but grazing needs to be followed by focused mechanical or chemical treatments to maintain control while allowing the regeneration of native tree species.

AB  - Aims Viable seeds in herbivore dung constitute the dung seed bank, and the contribution of livestock dung to this seed bank in grazing pastures is often overlooked. Grazing season (warm and cold), seed characteristics (size and shape), and forage preference are the main factors that affect the size and composition of the dung seed bank and ultimately affect grassland ecology. However, how these three factors interact is unclear. Methods We collected yak dung as well as seeds of the common plant species from warm- and cold-season alpine meadows in northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and explored how grazing season (warm and cold), seed characteristics (size and shape) and foraging preferences (temporary cages method) affects yak dung seedling density, richness and diversity in an alpine pasture. Results Forty-three plant species (mainly perennials) germinated from yak dung. Dung seedling density, richness, and diversity did not differ significantly between the two grazing seasons. Small to medium-sized spherical seeds (seed size < 10 mg, shape index < 0.5) had the greatest germination potential. Conclusions Yaks vary their forage preference depending on the season (phenological period), and endozoochory occurs throughout both grazing seasons. Seed shape and size directly regulate the dung seedling density, richness, and diversity. Dung seedlings increase the heterogeneity of the aboveground vegetation near the microsites of the dung pieces and therefore promote grassland patching. Our study demonstrates that grazing season, seed characteristics, and yak forage preferences affect the dung seed bank in grazing ecosystems.

AB  - Uncertainties in carbon storage estimates for disturbance-prone dryland ecosystems hinder accurate assessments of their contribution to the global carbon budget. This study examines the effects of land-use change on carbon storage in an African savanna landscape, focusing on two major land-use change pathways: agricultural intensification and wildlife conservation, both of which alter disturbance regimes. By adapting tree inventory and soil sampling methods for dryland conditions, we quantified aboveground and belowground carbon in woody vegetation (AGC and BGC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) across these pathways in two vegetation types (scrub savanna and woodland savanna). We used Generalized Additive Mixed Models to assess the effects of multiple environmental drivers on AGC and whole-ecosystem carbon storage (C-total). Our findings revealed a pronounced variation in the vulnerability of carbon reservoirs to disturbance, depending on land-use change pathway and vegetation type. In scrub savanna vegetation, shrub AGC emerged as the most vulnerable carbon reservoir, declining on average by 56% along the conservation pathway and 90% along the intensification pathway compared to low-disturbance sites. In woodland savanna, tree AGC was most affected, decreasing on average by 95% along the intensification pathway. Unexpectedly, SOC stocks were often higher at greater disturbance levels, particularly under agricultural intensification, likely due to the preferential conversion of naturally carbon-richer soils for agriculture and the redistribution of AGC to SOC through megaherbivore browsing. Strong unimodal relationships between disturbance agents, such as megaherbivore browsing and woodcutting, and both AGC and C-total suggest that intermediate disturbance levels can enhance ecosystem-level carbon storage in disturbance-prone dryland ecosystems. These findings underline the importance of locally tailored management strategies-such as in carbon certification schemes-that reconcile disturbance regimes in drylands with carbon sequestration goals. Moreover, potential trade-offs between land-use objectives and carbon storage goals must be considered.

AB  - Supplementary feeding is a commonly used wildlife management practice, but while it may bring benefits and fulfil management goals, it can also result in unintended negative consequences. In the temperate zone, winter supplementary feeding may reduce movement of some ungulate species, leading to increased utilization of feeding sites by individuals and, consequently, animal aggregation. However, the intensity of feeding site utilization can vary depending on various extrinsic factors, e.g. habitat type, population density or weather conditions. Here, we predicted that the index of feeding sites utilization, expressed as the distance of European bison (Bison bonasus) to feeding sites, would be positively associated with the severity of winter conditions; thus, bison will be closer to feeding sites on colder days and in the presence of snow cover. We analysed winter (December to March) tracking data of 43 VHF- and GPS-collared European bison (24 males and 19 females) collected from 2005 to 2012 in Bialowieza Primeval Forest (NE Poland), where bison are supplementally fed with different intensity throughout winter. Female bison were closer to feeding sites than males throughout winter, and regardless of sex, bison were the closest to feeding sites in mid-winter (January to February) and on colder days independently of the time of the season. Additionally, the distances of bison to feeding sites were significantly related to snow cover and depth; i.e. bison were closer to the feeding sites on days with present snow cover and deeper snow. Hence, the winter area occupied by bison differed with changing weather severity - being 4 and 28 times larger in the warmest periods compared to the coldest days with snow cover (for females and males, respectively). This may have direct and indirect ecological consequences for the ecosystem due to potential impact on nutrient cycling, seed dispersal, interspecific competition, vegetation growth, forest succession and carrion distribution. Given these ecological impacts of bison and weather-dependent utilization of supplementary fodder, we recognize the possible need in the future to revise and adapt winter supplementary feeding to annual and seasonal variation in winter severity to meet management goals while optimizing the costs.

AB  - Trophic rewilding that reintroduces large animals into landscapes to re-establish food web interactions and restore biodiverse ecosystems has gained widespread attention. Despite this attention, few empirical studies have assessed the effectiveness of trophic rewilding for promoting biodiversity and its wider ecological benefits. Here we tested if trophic rewilding that introduced functional analogues for extinct large herbivores into former farmland of lowland England delivered additional benefits to biodiversity and ecosystems functioning. We predicted that these benefits would exceed those achieved through passive rewilding, that is, unassisted habitat succession after the cessation of agricultural activity. Using a 9-year exclosure experiment, we found trophic rewilding reduced woody plant diversity and total carbon storage by 73% and 23%, respectively, compared to passive rewilding plots that excluded mammalian herbivores. However, trophic rewilding likely increased plant diversity and carbon storage compared to if land was left under continued agricultural production, e.g. artificial pastures associated with intensive livestock production. The vegetation changes accompanying trophic rewilding were further linked to a greater diversity and biomass of ground-dwelling arthropods by 21% and 167%, respectively, relative to passive rewilding, partly by creating more structurally complex vegetation. Given the trade-offs in biodiversity and ecosystem functions between trophic and passive rewilding, our study highlights that trophic rewilding will need to be applied alongside other interventions to tackle biodiversity loss while combatting climate change. Ultimately, the utility of trophic rewilding as a restoration tool will depend on the conservation outcomes valued by society.

AB  - Woodlands are under threat from a variety of global change stressors, and understanding the main effects and interactions between these is critical for their protection. Here, we analyse vegetation change over 50 years within approximately 100 broadleaved woodland sites across Great Britain from 1971 to 2022 and quantify the interactions between management history, deer herbivory and ash dieback. We find an overall trajectory towards a less diverse, more shade-adapted ground flora which has recently been locally disrupted by ash dieback. Plots with evidence of ash dieback have higher forb cover and ground flora richness relative to plots without dieback. However, this effect of ash dieback was shown mainly where there was high grazing risk; the grazing reduces the vigour of generalist understorey shrubs which can also lead to lower tree regeneration. Our results reveal how woodland dynamics have been shaped initially by a response to a reduction in interventionist management and then by disturbance driven by high herbivory risk and a novel tree disease.

AB  - Urban trees support biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services but are increasingly threatened by native and non-native insect pests. Biosecurity of urban trees (i.e., tree protection from biological threats such as pests and pathogens) is enhanced by several intrinsic factors, such as tree defences, and extrinsic factors, such as the occurrence of predators of insect pests. Among the predators of insect pests of trees, birds include many species that might substantially contribute to tree biosecurity. We investigated which levels of urban tree canopy cover and tree species richness support the insectivory function delivered by birds and the overall bird diversity. We measured bird predation and bird diversity in three cities in Switzerland along gradients of urban tree canopy cover, including: industrial/commercial areas with low canopy cover; residential areas with intermediate canopy cover; urban parks and cemeteries with high canopy cover; and peri-urban forests. We used caterpillar mimics and naturally occurring invasive insect larvae of Cameraria ohridella to measure bird predation rates. Bird diversity was assessed using rarefaction curves. We found that bird predation on caterpillar mimics increased with tree canopy cover and decreased with exotic tree species richness, whereas predation on live non-native insect larvae was mostly determined by prey density. We found differences in how urban tree canopy cover influenced bird functional groups. Species richness of insectivorous birds included 75 % of forest species when urban tree canopy cover was at least 30 %. The combined influence of native trees and canopy cover has the potential to increase the insectivory function delivered by birds, with expected benefits for non-native insect control. Our findings match current urban planning targets for sustainable and green cities, that include achieving 30 % tree canopy cover in all city districts.

AB  - Wild boar is among the most abundant ungulates in Europe and its spread is locally creating concerns as a major threat to biodiversity. However, through their rooting activity, wild boars could play an effective role in the creation of specific microhabitat resources for plants and animals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild boar affects the habitat suitability to threatened butterflies, by evaluating the influence of rooting on multiple key aspects of the biology and ecology of the Mediterranean endemic Zerynthia cassandra. Namely, we used Z. cassandra as a model to test the effects of wild boar rooting on adult foraging opportunities, host plant occurrence, and oviposition site selection. We found that herbaceous communities disturbed by wild boar rooting have a higher proportion of plants representing nectar resources for early-flying butterflies. We also discovered that wild boar rooting positively influences the occurrence and abundance of the larval host plant of Z. cassandra, as well as the butterfly site selection for egg-laying. Our results indicate that wild boars may locally prove beneficial to endangered butterflies by favoring habitat quality and availability, and their role as ecosystem engineers should thus be further investigated to improve species and habitat management and conservation actions.

AB  - Background: Crop-tree thinning (CTT) is a forest management practice aiming at enhancing the growth of target trees in plantations by harvesting neighboring trees. Along with the positive effect on tree growth, thinning represents a disturbance, which likely affects belowground organisms and may feed back to stand productivity. However, the impact of CTT on the belowground food web is poorly understood. Since nematodes are species-rich and abundant belowground organisms, occupying a variety of trophic positions in soil food webs and being sensitive to disturbances, they serve as ecological indicators of ecosystem disturbance. Results: We studied the effect of CTT on the soil nematode community structure in pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) and cypress (Cupressus funebris Endl.) plantations in the Sichuan Basin three years after applying CTT. Crop-tree thinning significantly increased the abundance of soil nematodes in each of the plantations. Moreover, CTT significantly increased the relative abundance of herbivorous nematodes in each of the plantations. Furthermore, CTT increased the proportion of stress tolerators (c-p 1) and enrichment opportunists (c-p 2) and reduced the maturity, structure and enrichment indices of nematodes in Chinese fir and cypress plantations, while only subtle changes were observed in pine plantations. Interestingly, across plantations, the effects of CTT on soil nematode communities were mainly due to changes in microbial biomass nitrogen and understory vegetation diversity. Conclusions: Forest management practices resulting in more open canopies uniformly affect soil food webs by changing the quantity and quality of resources associated with increased understory cover and diversity as well as microbial food. These insights increase our understanding of the impacts of forest management on the structure and functioning of belowground communities, which may contribute to management and conservation policies for more sustainable forestry.

AB  - QuestionsFree-ranging herbivores are often seen as important endozoochorous dispersal vectors for plant propagules. Dispersal by free-ranging animals, in contrast to domestic animals, and its effects on vegetation have rarely been studied. We ask what are the effects of deposition of dung on open landscape vegetation, how does it influence vegetation development after disturbance by soil removal, and does it change species richness or composition?LocationThe Doupov Mountains, Czech Republic.MethodsWe established a six-year experiment in 2015 to study the effects of dung deposition on vegetation of an open grassland landscape. The experiment comprised 300 plots distributed across five fenced site locations and treatments were implemented in partially crossed design, with soil removed (disturbance) and dung pellets deposited; treatments were applied once to five replicates, from June to October 2015. We recorded plant species cover at the beginning of the vegetation seasons of 2016, 2017 and 2021.ResultsDung deposition increased species richness and Ellenberg Indicator Values for nutrients, and these effects were stronger in disturbed plots; however, these effects diminished with time. There were no effects of dung deposition on species composition. In contrast, disturbance affected species diversity, composition, Ellenberg Indicator Values for nutrients, proportion of dung-dispersed species, but not species richness. Surprisingly, there were no effects of timing of dung deposition.ConclusionsOur results indicate that endozoochorous seed dispersal by red deer impacts vegetation dynamics of this open grassland landscape, but effects are weak and diminish with time. Considering the large seed load in dung, it is possible that endozoochorous seeds from wild herbivores are incorporated into the soil seed bank, where they persist until appropriate ecological conditions for germination arise.
   Does deer poop influence vegetation? The answer seems to be 'it depends'. When deer drop dung into fully grown vegetation, the effect is close to zero. But when deer poop into disturbed vegetation with bare soil, more species appear, even though this effect does not last long.image

AB  - Forest management can enhance the ecosystem services forests provide, but it can also alter the capacity of forests to provide those services in the future. Ecosystem-based management has been widely implemented to mitigate the deterioration of forest ecosystems by reducing dissimilarities between managed and natural forests. Ecosystem-based management objectives generally aim to maintain community composition, stand structure, ecosystem functions and services. Heavy browsing pressure by ungulates at densities unrepresentative of past abundance could interfere with these objectives by chronically and selectively browsing tree regeneration following logging.Using a browsing exclusion experiment, we investigated how the effects of different moose browsing pressures on tree regeneration could interfere with ecosystem management objectives in boreal forests of Quebec, Canada. Management objectives in this region include, among others, reaching targeted coniferous trees densities for commercial harvest, favouring the conservation of birches (Betula spp.) to maintain soil quality and conserving fruit-bearing trees due to their ecological significance for biodiversity. We used path analyses to differentiate direct and indirect effects of moose on seedling density and mixed models to investigate how browsing affected sapling recruitment and whether resulting densities are compatible with ecosystem management objectives.By directly reducing the overall sapling density, moose browsing indirectly increased seedlings densities of all deciduous species. This indirect effect increased with browsing pressure and favoured raspberry cover, which was positively or negatively linked to seedling density, depending on tree species. Moderate and heavier browsing pressures reduced coniferous sapling density below the ecosystem management target. Moose suppressed birch saplings so that the minimal target of 50 birches ha-1 was not met under heavier browsing pressure. Sapling density of fruit-bearing trees was low under all browsing pressures when compared to exclosures. Policy implications Heavy moose browsing is preventing the achievement of ecosystem management objectives in our study area.Positive indirect effects on seedling densities suggest that reducing moose density could allow released seedlings to replenish the sapling layer, but we discuss why this would not guarantee reaching ecosystem management objectives. To help forest managers evaluate and respond to challenges posed by high ungulate densities, we suggest incorporating browsing inventories in national forest surveys to monitor this chronic disturbance and modulate decisions for forest ecosystem management.

AB  - Rangeland management has traditionally focused on the grazing effects of livestock, or on wild ungulates because they are potential competitors with livestock. However, herbivory by smaller herbivores, such as lagomorphs, could play a much greater role in shaping the plant community than is commonly thought. Being selective feeders with high mass-specific metabolic rates, we hypothesized that lagomorphs impose an herbivory regime on the rangeland that differs from that of ungulates and drives the plant community toward a different composition. We used an 8-year exclosure experiment with three plot types (complete exclosure, partial exclosure, open rangeland), each 5.95 m2, to separate the effects of grazing by lagomorphs (jackrabbits and cottontails) from the effects of the large grazers (mainly cattle and bison) on vegetation structure and plant community composition. We replicated the experiment across 20 sites in a semiarid rangeland in the western US. The plant community in the complete exclosure plots (lagomorphs and ungulates excluded) developed a fivefold greater standing crop of grass than the open rangeland but supported the lowest biomass, density, and aerial cover of forbs. Partial exclosure plots (ungulates excluded, lagomorphs included) developed a community with higher forb phytomass (33.6% increase relative to open rangeland) and lower forb species richness (16.4% decrease relative to open rangeland). This effect was mainly caused by the encroachment of noxious weeds, including Salsola tragus (prickly Russian thistle/tumbleweed), which covered up to 37% of the ground in plots that lagomorphs had exclusive access to. We infer that selective grazing by lagomorphs facilitates noxious weeds that are elsewhere controlled to some extent by (a) the coarse grazing and trampling effects of large ungulates and (b) competition with native herbaceous species. For semiarid rangelands that have been degraded by livestock grazing, our complete and partial exclosures show that a reduction in stocking rate might not return the rangeland to its former state due to a hysteresis effect resulting from the facilitation of noxious weeds by lagomorphs. Rangeland management should be informed by an understanding of the entire food web, which includes the direct and indirect grazing effects of small herbivores such as lagomorphs.

AB  - Ecological niche partitioning is fundamental for the coexistence of sympatric species. However, the relationship between herbivore body size and forage availability on resource segregation and selection remains debatable. This study quantifies the niche differentiation and selectivity of forage species consumed by six Asian large herbivores (SLH), including mega-herbivores like Greater one-horned rhino (Rhinoceros unicornis), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) and Asiatic wild buffalo (Bubalus arnee), and meso-herbivores like swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii), hog deer (Axis porcinus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) in tropical wet-grasslands of the Brahmaputra floodplains. We hypothesized that body size influences dietary niche breadth and interspecific dietary similarities or dissimilarities, while forage availability influences forage selectivity among Asian herbivores. We used micro-histological technique, harvest method and Jacobs Index to quantify SLH foraging patterns, forage availability and preference, respectively. Results of the study revealed high niche breadth for elephant (0.56>B-s <= 0.74) among mega-herbivores and for sambar (0.49>B-s <= 0.64) among meso-herbivores. SLH showed a significant positive correlation between body size and niche breadth in wet season. High dietary overlap was recorded between buffalo and hog deer (0.79-0.86) and swamp deer and hog deer (0.75-0.86) among SLH, rhino and buffalo (0.80-0.83) among mega-herbivores, and swamp deer and hog deer (0.75-0.86) among meso-herbivores. High dietary dissimilarity was recorded between elephant and swamp deer (36-37 %), elephant and buffalo (27-33 %), and swamp deer and sambar (27-29 %). Compared to dry season (1354.54 +/- 641.30 g m(-2)), significantly higher biomass was recorded in wet season (3026.93 +/- 1632.65 g m(-2); p<0.05). From dry to wet season, rhino, buffalo and hog deer shift their preferred forage from dicot to monocot. Dicot was the most preferred forage of elephant among mega-herbivores, and monocot of swamp deer and sambar among meso-herbivores. Mega- and meso-herbivores avoid invasives Merremia umbellata and Mimosa spp., while meso-herbivores avoid Mikania micrantha. Body size explains niche partitioning only for rhino, elephant and swamp deer. Forage availability contributed to niche breadth and forage preference. In conclusion, forage segregation, despite being challenging to interpret at taxonomic level, influences niche partitioning among mega- and meso-herbivores.

AB  - Local-scale studies have shown that an overabundance of Cervidae species (deer, elk, moose) impacts forest bird communities. Through meta-analysis, we provide a generalized estimate of the overall direction and magnitude of the indirect effects overabundant cervids have on avian species. We conducted 2 distinct meta-analyses that synthesized data on 130 bird species collected from 17 publications. These analyses compared bird species' population abundance and/or species richness at sites with overabundant cervids to sites with lower cervid abundance or without cervids. We evaluated whether the impacts of overabundant cervids are generally in the same direction (positive, negative) across avian species and locations and if effects vary in magnitude according to avian nesting location and foraging habitat. We found that where cervids were overabundant, there was a significant decrease in mean bird population abundance and species richness. Species that nest in trees, shrubs, and on the ground showed the largest decreases in abundance, as did species whose primary habitat is forest and open woodland and species that are primarily insectivores or omnivores. We did not find significant decreases in abundance for avian species that nest in cavities, whose primary habitat is grassland or scrub, nor for species that mainly eat seeds. Our results indicate that overabundant cervids, likely through their direct effects on vegetation and indirect effects on insects and forest birds, negatively impact individual bird populations and decrease overall avian species richness.

AB  - Studies conducted in forests have resulted in much of the ecological theory we build upon today. However, our basic understanding of forest ecology comes almost exclusively from the study of trees, even though they represent only a small fraction of the plant diversity present in forests. In recent decades there has been an increasing number of studies of forest herbs, broadening our understanding of plant community ecology in forest ecosystems. Here we highlight ten recent studies examining patterns and drivers of, as well as threats to, herbaceous plant diversity in forests. We first examine local, regional, and global patterns of herbaceous diversity in forests and how such patterns differ for woody versus herbaceous species. We then focus on ecological mechanisms that contribute to forest herb diversity, including the role of abiotic and biotic interactions. We end by discussing some major anthropogenic impacts on forest herb diversity, identifying where herbs are particularly susceptible or particularly resilient to current and predicted changes in comparison to trees. The studies we feature demonstrate that patterns and drivers of diversity often differ between woody and herbaceous plant communities. To facilitate cross-site comparisons, there is great need for more standardized survey methods for herbaceous plants, for simultaneous measurements of multiple plant growth forms, and for incorporating herbs into long-term forest monitoring networks. In addition, the selected studies reveal how land-use history, overabundant herbivores, invasive species, and climate change are all impacting forest herb communities. Some common characteristics of herbaceous plants, such as limited dispersal and small stature, may make forest herb communities more susceptible to these anthropogenic impacts, while others (e.g., resprouting ability, clonal reproduction) may make them more resilient compared to forest trees. More research is needed from both plant ecologists and applied forest practitioners to predict how herbaceous forest diversity will change in the future.

AB  - Clearing of woodlands is used by graziers to promote pasture production, even though understanding of impacts of clearing on native fauna is lacking. We evaluate impacts of clearing on biodiversity by comparing invertebrates associated with ground-layer vegetation of cleared woodlands (grasslands) to that of nearby uncleared woodlands. Two replicates of grasslands consisting of pastures dominated by introduced grasses were compared with two woodlands at each of four locations. The adjacent riparian forest to each grassland and woodland site allowed evaluation of the effect of woodland clearing on the adjacent riparian zone. All habitats were grazed. Invertebrates of ground-layer vegetation were sampled using three suction subsamples of 1m(2 )at each site. Grasslands had significantly lower order richness and abundance of herbivores, pollinators and macroinvertebrates (food for birds) than the woodlands, whereas the riparian forests closely resembled each other in all metrics. Invertebrate assemblages of grasslands also differed significantly from those of the woodlands. BEST analysis showed that groundcover and leaf-litter percentage cover correlated strongest with invertebrate composition. This study has demonstrated that grazing management relying on clearing of fertile grassy woodlands of the rangelands of Central Queensland alters invertebrate diversity and assemblage. Thus, tree clearing not only leads to biodiversity losses in the canopy layer, but also in the ground-layer vegetation.

AB  - Increasing resource extraction and human activity are reshaping species' spatial distributions in human-altered landscape and consequently shaping the dynamics of interspecific interactions, such as between predators and prey. To evaluate the effects of industrial features and human activity on the occurrence of wolves (Canis lupus), we used wildlife detection data collected in 2014 from an array of 122 remote wildlife camera traps in Alberta's Rocky Mountains and foothills near Hinton, Canada. Using generalized linear models, we compared the occurrence frequency of wolves at camera sites to natural land cover, industrial disturbance (forestry and oil/gas exploration), human activity (motorized and non-motorized), and prey availability (moose, Alces alces; elk, Cervus elaphus; mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus; and white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus). Industrial block features (well sites and cutblocks) and prey (elk or mule deer) availability interacted to influence wolf occurrence, but models including motorized and non-motorized human activity were not strongly supported. Wolves occurred infrequently at sites with high densities of well sites and cutblocks, except when elk or mule deer were frequently detected. Our results suggest that wolves risk using industrial block features when prey occur frequently to increase predation opportunities, but otherwise avoid them due to risk of human encounters. Effective management of wolves in anthropogenically altered landscapes thus requires the simultaneous consideration of industrial block features and populations of elk and mule deer.

AB  - Most alpine ecosystems are subject to non-native species invasion as climate warms and human disturbance increases. Therefore, it is important to identify the main barriers and facilitators of alpine plant invasions. While there is much research in continental alpine areas, there is limited research in maritime environments, which have distinctive biological, edaphic and geomorphologic features due to the scarcity of snow in winter. Here, we examine the contribution of anthropogenic and biotic factors on non-native plant invasions in the alpine areas of lutruwita (Tasmania), Australia. Specifically, we test whether disturbances associated with roads and livestock grazing facilitate non-native plant invasion and if biotic resistance from native plants and wild grazing animals inhibits such invasion. We used floristic data from: a statewide database; data from long-term grazing exclosures, and data from paired quadrats on roadsides and natural vegetation. Our results showed that non-native plants were associated with roadside disturbance and livestock grazing, with the latter having a legacy effect of 50 years. The persistent effect of stock grazing was evident in the exclusion experiment monitored over 30 years, where non-native plants occurred sporadically in time and space. In contrast, we found that the presence of wild grazing mammals, complete vegetation cover and high native richness, restricted non-native plants, emphasizing the importance of biotic resistance in controlling non-native plant invasions. These results indicate that livestock removal and road closure could be effective in reversing non-native plant invasion in this and other areas with wild vertebrate herbivores and high plant cover.

AB  - Increases in the number of wild herbivores resulted in understory degradation because of their overgrazing in forest ecosystems. Deer overgrazing has occurred soil erosion in Japanese beech forests where dwarf bamboo used to be densely covered. Soil erosion can result in a decrease in soil carbon and nutrient contents, causing the soil microbial respiration in such forest ecosystems to be degraded. The objective of this study was to clarify the effects of soil erosion, which sporadically occurs within the forests, on soil properties and microbial activity. Soil erosion indices, such as the maximum height of exposed roots from the soil surface (MAXH), tree and soil properties, microbial basal and substrate-induced respiration, were measured under the canopy of 16 beech trees in each of three deciduous broadleaved forests on southern Kyushu Island, Japan. Soil properties such as the humus mass and the organic matter contents of soil and humus decreased with MAXH. Basal and substrate-induced respiration decreased with increases in MAXH. Soil properties associated with organic matter increased with basal and substrate-induced respiration. These results suggest that soil surface layers that were rich in organic matter ran off because of soil erosion, resulting in the degradation of soil microbial activity. This study suggests that increases in wild herbivore populations degrade soil ecosystem functioning owing to the soil erosion induced by understory disappearance.

AB  - In the degraded and modified environment of the Scottish Highlands, novel ungulate communities have arisen following local extinctions, reintroductions, and the introduction of non-native species. An understanding of the dynamics and interactions within these unique mammal communities is important as many of these mammals represent keystone species with disproportionate impacts on the environment. Using a camera trap survey, we investigated land cover preferences and spatiotemporal interactions within a Scottish ungulate community: the sika deer (Cervus nippon), the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), the red deer (Cervus elaphus), and the wild boar (Sus scrofa). We used generalised linear models to assess land cover preferences and the effect of human disturbance; spatiotemporal interactions were characterised using time interval modelling. We found that sika deer and roe deer preferred coniferous plantations and grasslands, with sika deer additionally preferring woodland. For red deer, we found a slight preference for wetland over woodland; however, the explained variance was low. Finally, wild boar preferred grassland and woodland and avoided coniferous plantations, heathland, and shrubland. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that human disturbance negatively impacted ungulates' distributions, potentially because ungulates temporally avoid humans or because dense vegetation cover mitigates the impacts of humans on their distributions. Furthermore, we detected a spatiotemporal association between sika deer and roe deer. Although the underlying cause of this is unknown, we hypothesise that interactions such as grazing facilitation or an anti-predator response to culling could be driving this pattern. Our work provides a preliminary analysis of the dynamics occurring within a novel ungulate community and also highlights current knowledge gaps in our understanding of the underlying mechanisms dictating the observed spatiotemporal associations.

AB  - Deer browsing is a form of selective disturbance that homogenizes plant community composition and structure. In mountainous regions, disturbance intensity, together with topographical factors, affect plant communities. However, studies on the multiple effects of deer browsing and topographical factors on plant communities are limited. Here, we investigated the effects of deer exclusion on understory vegetation across the upper and lower slopes of a temperate deciduous forest in a mountainous area of Japan. We established six pairs of exclosure and control quadrats, with three pairs at each topographical position. We assessed changes in vegetation and plant structure (coverage and height), species composition, numbers of flowering/fruiting species, and damage to the plant species caused by deer browsing between 2009-2016. Vegetation coverage and the number of flowering/fruiting plant species increased in the exclosure quadrats during the study period, indicating that browsing prevents herb-layer species from reaching the flowering and fruiting stages in this site. Moreover, dissimilarity in species composition between the exclosure and control quadrats increased on the upper slope. However, the dissimilarity between upper and lower slopes in the control quadrats tended to decrease. Large herbs, which mainly include forbs and perennial species, were characteristically abundant on the lower slopes and decreased in the control quadrats on the lower slope. Our results indicate that the exclusion of deer had different effects on the understory vegetation of upper and lower slopes, suggesting that deer overbrowsing weakens the correlation between plant functional traits and topographic factors, resulting in homogenized plant communities.

AB  - Overabundance of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) constitutes a threat to the biological diversity and ecosystem function of forested natural areas. Managers of Eagle Creek Park, a large forested park in Marion County, Indiana, that is surrounded by densely populated residential housing, implemented a deer population reduction program in 2014 to reduce negative impacts to park ecosystems. Starting in 2013, we instituted a monitoring program within two nature preserves imbedded within Eagle Creek Park to track the response of vegetation communities to population reductions. We found positive response in the heights of two published indicator species, Arisaema triphyllum (jack-in-the-pulpit) and Actaea pachypoda (white baneberry). We also observed increased richness and density of native woody species and an overall reduction in the proportion of twigs browsed at both preserves. The reduction efforts coincided with heavy mortality of overstory Fraxinus (ash) trees from emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis). Consequently, while we observed recovery of native woody species at both sites, one of the preserves also experienced a large increase in the abundance of nonnative woody plants in response to increased light availability and reduced browse pressure. Overall, our monitoring showed that deer population reductions have allowed the recovery of vegetation communities in the park. However, continued monitoring is needed to track vegetation community response to continued management of the deer population in conjunction with other human pressures on biological communities in the park.

AB  - Question Plant-plant facilitation is a critical ecological mechanism in arid environments, influencing biodiversity and ecosystem resilience globally. Shrubs often serve as nurse species, enhancing tree regeneration and sheltering plant communities, particularly in overgrazed or degraded habitats. In this study, we examine the role of shrubs as nurse species in the Socotra Archipelago (Yemen), a biodiversity hotspot in which several endemic tree species, including the iconic frankincense (Boswellia spp.), myrrh (Commiphora spp.), and Socotran dragon's blood (Dracaena cinnabari) trees, are threatened. This is largely due to a lack of natural regeneration caused by the combined effects of overgrazing by goats, sheep, and climatic events such as extreme droughts and cyclones. To aid conservation of threatened trees in arid regions, nature-based solutions are urgently needed to help tree regeneration. Effective nurse plants have this potential, particularly in arid environments. We therefore examined the role of thorny, poisonous, and/or unpalatable shrubs as nurse plants in sheltering threatened plant communities, with a focus on woody species in an arid insular context. Study Area The Socotra Archipelago (Yemen) situated in the western Indian Ocean, east of the Horn of Africa. It is a biodiversity sanctuary and a UNESCO Natural World Heritage Site. Methods Vegetation surveys were conducted in 144 paired plots under six common shrub species and adjacent open areas. Community data, environmental variables, and functional traits were analysed using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses, while Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) evaluated the effects of environmental variables and nurse species on key functional traits based on Community Weighted Means (CWMs). Facilitation effects were quantified using the Relative Interaction Index (RII). Results Our analysis revealed significant variations in species composition and functional traits between under-canopy and open-area plots. Certain shrubs, such as Cebatha balfourii, facilitated significantly higher species richness under its canopy compared to open areas. Elevation and grazing pressure influenced these interactions, with notable effects on functional traits like the occurrence of legumes and tree growth forms. Buxus hildebrandtii was less effective in supporting species richness, while C. balfourii, Lycium sokotranum, and two Cissus species exhibited significant positive facilitation. The LMMs confirmed the importance of environmental variables and nurse shrub characteristics in shaping plant community dynamics. Conclusions The results highlight differences in the facilitative potential of the studied species, with some showing a stronger ability to act as nurse shelters through microhabitat amelioration and protection from herbivory. The presence of tree species under shrubs is confirmed, and the role of these nurse species in supporting diverse plant communities provides critical insights for conservation strategies, supporting biodiversity resilience and sustainable management in degraded landscapes like Socotra Island and other arid environments. Future efforts should focus on leveraging nurse shrubs to mitigate environmental pressures and enhance ecological restoration, in particular to help conserve range-restricted and threatened plant species.

AB  - Swahili coastal forests, spanning the Kenyan and Tanzanian coastlines and the Zanzibar Archipelago, are integral to the biodiverse Eastern Arc and Coastal Forest region. These forest ecosystems face considerable anthropogenic threats. This study contributes to the available knowledge on the floral composition and plant community assemblages of Mnemba Island, a small sandy cay in the Zanzibar Archipelago, which helps to establish baseline data for conservation purposes. Two main coastal forest plant communities were identified: (1) the Casuarina cunninghamiana-Suriana maritima open to closed sandy dry coastal forest, and (2) the Eugenia capensis-Mimusops obtusifolia coastal forest. A total of 91 different plant species belonging to 54 plant families were identified for the island. Community 2, an indigenous forest, supports diverse bird breeding colonies and is a crucial habitat for the threatened Aders' duiker. Understory development is limited due to the historical Suni antelope overpopulation. Environmental factors like salt spray, allelochemicals, herbivore browsing, and climate fluctuations influence the vegetation abundance and composition. The study underscores differences in species diversity and composition between the planted Casuarina community and the natural atoll vegetation. The natural vegetation shows affinities with the Zanzibar-Inhambane edaphic coral-rag scrub forest and the transitional rainforest. Several species characteristic of Indian Ocean atolls were identified, providing insights into invasion ecology and conservation strategies. The study contributes conceptually to our understanding of vegetation dynamics in island ecosystems by highlighting the interplay between plant communities, environmental processes, and human activities. The fragile yet resilient nature of Mnemba's unique ecosystem is emphasised, offering insights for conservation management, long-term monitoring, and adaptive approaches tailored to island environments.

AB  - Understanding the degree to which management interacts with ecological processes to drive the structuring of biodiversity remains a central challenge in ecology. For instance, the effects of herbivores on post-disturbance vegetation development may depend on the degree to which anthropogenic interventions have altered plant communities.
   We hypothesized that by simplifying plant species composition at local scales, intensive forest management practices should amplify herbivore-mediated changes in early-successional vegetation development and diversity at multiple levels of biological observation (i.e., alpha, beta, and gamma diversity). To test this hypothesis, we implemented a six-year experiment that manipulated post-timber harvest vegetation establishment via a gradient in vegetation management intensity (i.e., herbicides), and quantified compositional changes with and without wild-ungulate herbivores. Increasingly intensive herbicide treatments suppressed broadleaf vegetation and reduced plant diversity at alpha and gamma levels, while the effects of wild-ungulates were most evident in measures of community change and beta diversity for a commonly applied treatment type. Following the broad-spectrum and follow-up herbaceous treatment combination, herbivory contributed to the suppression of vegetation cover, slowing plant community development by 21%, and resulting in 27% less among-plot heterogeneity (i.e., lower beta diversity). We found no effects of herbivory alpha diversity, but the divergence in communities subjected to herbivory resulted in disparate community composition and lower gamma diversity.
   Herbicide and herbivore-mediated alterations in community composition was due the suppression of broadleaf species and subsequent release of common herbivory-tolerant herbaceous species. Although herbivory also slowed vegetation development without herbicides, the high diversity and abundance of broadleaf forages likely buffered untreated sites from the herbivore-mediated alterations of plant composition at alpha, beta, and gamma levels. The variation in effects of herbicide and herbivory in this experiment highlight the importance of testing for interactions between natural and anthropogenic agents on vegetation development and quantifying diversity responses beyond local scales. These results also suggest that large herbivores may contribute to managementinduced simplification of young forests, with potential implications for successional processes and regional biodiversity conservation.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) impact the ecological integrity of eastern deciduous forests by modifying plant community composition and structure. Previous studies have shown that overabundant deer can negatively impact the recruitment and persistence of both woody and herbaceous plants. However, the strength and nature of these interactions can depend on habitat context. Forest edges provide favorable habitat for deer along with many introduced plant species, and have the potential to modify the nature of deer impacts. Here, we explore whether forest edges shape the impacts of deer on plant communities within the forest landscape. Specifically, we excluded deer, or, alternatively, allowed deer access, in plots along the edge and within the interior of two northern hardwood forests. Background deer abundance in these forests was approximately 6-12 individuals per km(2). After eight years of exclusion, we surveyed plant communities within plots to assess the impacts of deer on plant community composition across the forested landscape. We found that the impacts of deer were robust across habitat context within the forest, with relatively weak impacts on cover and richness of both native and introduced species. Edge habitat, on the other hand, had strong impacts on cover of both native and introduced species, as well as woody and herbaceous species, but the magnitude of these impacts was variable across the two forest sites. This work suggests that deer can have modest impacts when at relatively low densities, and that these effects can be consistent across forest habitat types, while forest fragmentation and subsequent generation of edge habitat can be an important driver of composition in the forest understory.

AB  - Increasing woodland cover is at the heart of global and national strategies to combat climate change. While tree planting is a rapid and scalable means of woodland creation, it remains expensive and prone to high mortality, highlighting the need for additional more cost-effective methods including natural colonisation and regeneration. A key question is whether trade-offs between the advantages of rapid planting and natural colonisation can be avoided by using a combined approach. Yet few studies have quantified ongoing colonisation and regeneration within planted woodlands and the habitat and management drivers influencing these processes. This study explores the relative importance of seed source (parent candidate) trees, woodland habitat, management, browsing, and scrub variables in influencing natural colonisation and regeneration within 57 planted woodlands across East Anglia, UK. We test for these effects on three species of colonising tree sapling, and the total number and species richness of all tree saplings (colonising and regenerating). Fraxinus excelsior and Acer campestre, showed parent candidate (PC) variables to have greater influence on colonising sapling abundance than woodland or management variables, while effects were much weaker for Quercus robur. Woodland age was a positive predictor for A. campestre saplings, more equivocal for F. excelsior, and had no influence on Q. robur. However, woodland age had a strong positive influence on species richness of tree saplings and on percentage cover and species richness of scrub. Canopy cover was the strongest predictor of total tree sapling abundance. Management had negative effects on Q. robur, total number of saplings and scrub coverage. Species compositional analyses showed most sapling taxa were associated with older, unmanaged, more diverse plantations, with greater canopy cover and scrub species richness. We conclude that substantial natural colonisation occurs within planted woodlands, complementing regeneration and tree planting in enhancing woodland creation. Further research on the potential benefits of combining active and passive methods of afforestation is needed to ensure woodland creation and management is optimised for biodiversity and ecosystem services.

AB  - Naturalistic grazing by large herbivores is an increasingly practiced way of managing habitats with conservational value. It has the potential to restore and enhance biodiversity, creating self-sustainable environments vital for organisms requiring regular disturbances to moderate and/or reverse successional changes. European bison, Exmoor pony, and Tauros cattle were introduced in 2015 to a former military training area in Milovice, Czech Republic. The prevailing vegetation type is a forest-steppe savanna with Bromus erectus-dominated xeric grasslands mixed with deciduous shrubs and trees. After the cessation of military use, the area was abandoned which led to successional changes, including the dominance of tall grasses, litter accumulation, and bush encroachment. In 2017-2021, we monitored grassland vegetation in 30 grazed permanent plots (2 x 2 m) and 5 control plots representative of ungrazed, abandoned vegetation adjacent to the grazed areas. Naturalistic grazing increased species richness and the cover of forbs, while the cover of grasses and legumes was minimally affected. Grazing increased functional diversity of plant community, promoted a compositional change to small statured species and an increased incidence of red-list species. Seven years of continuous grazing increased the conservation value of this forest-steppe vegetation, a habitat type rapidly declining in Europe.

AB  - Burrowing mammals that disproportionately affect their physical environment, creating habitat and providing resources for other organisms, are considered ecosystem engineers. Such modifications are particularly important in dry grassland environments, where low precipitation and soil nutrients limit plant growth. We tested 5 hy-potheses about the impact of Cape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris) on plants and animals in a semi-arid grassland of South Africa. At each burrow cluster and paired control site without burrows, we estimated plant cover, height, and richness using quadrats, and invertebrate and small mammal abundance and richness using pit-fall traps and mark-recapture, respectively. We determined nitrogen concentrations in grasses on and off burrows and measured carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in plants and squirrel hair to determine squirrel diet. Burrows had greater plant cover and richness, particularly more shrubby vegetation, but plant height and nitrogen concentrations did not differ on and off burrows. Invertebrate and small mammal abundance and richness were greater on burrows. Squirrel disturbances in semi-arid grassland improved conditions for disturbance-dependent shrubs, which were rarely consumed by squirrels but are valuable forage for antelope and provide cover for invertebrates and small mammals. By altering habitat for plants reliant on disturbance, Cape ground squirrels enhance grassland biodiversity.

AB  - Background and Aims The role of deer (family Cervidae) in ecosystem functioning has traditionally been neglected by forest ecologists due to the animal's scarcity in most parts of the northern hemisphere. However, the dramatic rebound in deer populations throughout the 20th century has brought deer browsing to the forefront of forest ecological questioning. Today there is ample evidence that deer affect tree regeneration, understorey plant and animal diversity, and even litter decomposition. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of deer on forest ecosystems remain unclear. Among others, the relative role of abiotic factors versus biotic interactions (e.g. herbivory) in shaping plant assemblages remains largely unknown.
   Methods We used a large-scale experiment with exclosures distributed along abiotic gradients to understand the role of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitchensis) on the forest understorey on the Haida Gwaii archipelago (western Canada), a unique context where most of the key ecological effects of deer presence have already been intensively studied.
   Key Results Our results demonstrate that 20 years of deer exclusion resulted in a clear increase in vascular plant richness, diversity and cover, and caused a decline in bryophyte cover. Exclusion also unveiled abiotic (i.e. soil water availability and fertility) filtering of plant assemblages that would otherwise have been masked by the impact of abundant deer populations. However, deer exclusion did not lead to an increase in beta diversity, probably because some remnant species had a competitive advantage to regrow after decades of over browsing.
   Conclusions We demonstrated that long-term herbivory by deer can be a dominant factor structuring understorey plant communities that overwhelms abiotic factors. However, while exclosures prove useful to assess the overall effects of large herbivores, the results from our studies at broader scales on the Haida Gwaii archipelago suggest that exclosure experiments should be used cautiously when inferring the mechanisms at work.

AB  - The function of the dung seed bank from large generalist herbivores in grassland ecosystems is often overlooked. The dung seed bank is the product of the canopy seed bank ingested by herbivores that then accumulates in their feces. However, the mechanisms by which aboveground vegetation composition and structure affect the dung seed bank remain unclear, especially when considering the forage preferences effects of large generalist herbivores. We conducted a 4-year (2019-2022) rotational grazing experiment with yaks in an alpine meadow during the warm season on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and investigated the aboveground vegetation community height, richness, and biomass; the forage preferences of the yaks; and the richness and density of dung seedlings. Aboveground vegetation community height, richness, and biomass showed fluctuations across the years and seasons. During the warm season, the dung seedling richness and density were 0.042 +/- 0.013 species/g dung and 0.112 +/- 0.043 seedlings/g dung, respectively. Among the 63 species of plants that were present as aboveground vegetation and that germinated from the dung samples, 65.08 % had a neutral preference for foraging by the yaks. Significant differences between yak dung seedlings and aboveground vegetation composition indicated the potential for dung seedlings to promote microhabitat patchiness around dung deposition sites. Aboveground vegetation community height had a negative effect on the dung seed bank, whereas richness and biomass had a positive effect. Our findings suggest that the aboveground vegetation community structure affects the size and composition of the dung seed bank through its effect on the diet selection of large generalist herbivores. We emphasize that the complementary roles of the herbivore dung seed bank and the soil seed bank should be considered when assessing the contribution of the soil seed bank to aboveground vegetation regeneration.

AB  - Across boreal forests, trees are the main living biomass carbon (C) stock, but the understory vegetation can contribute significantly to the C cycling and net forest carbon dioxide (CO2) balance. The patchy understory vegetation, which consists of sunlit (i.e. lichen-like) and shaded habitats (i.e. dwarf shrub-like), is often altered by ungulate grazers. Grazers may influence understory CO2 exchange and, consequently, the forest CO2 balance. Grazing affects differently the biomass of slow-growing lichens compared to the faster-growing mosses and dwarf shrubs, and therefore the effects of grazing on CO2 exchange in the patchy understory vegetation may vary temporally. We studied how excluding grazing for short and long periods affects the CO2 exchange and vegetation biomass in the understory of an oligotrophic Scots pine forest. We measured growing season (2019, 2020) CO2 exchange across sunlit and shaded habitats inside fences that had excluded large grazers for 0-1 and 25-26 years and in the adjacent grazed area. In addition, we measured the height of understory vegetation. We found that short-term grazer exclusion increased ecosystem CO2 source fluxes only in the shaded habitats. However, long-term exclusion of grazing decreased CO2 net release regardless of the habitat type. Furthermore, grazer exclusion increased moss depth immediately, which coincided with an abrupt intensification of CO2 net release. Considering the impacts of grazing over both short- and long-term periods may help to forecast C fluxes more accurately, which may be relevant for informed climate solutions regionally and even on a larger scale.

AB  - Natural disturbances can maintain forest diversity by creating a heterogeneous resource landscape, which can contribute to coexistence of early-and late-successional species. However, almost all forested ecosystems are also subject to multiple anthropogenic stressors, which could inhibit plant diversity and forest recovery after natural disturbances. Here, we present the first large-scale replicated field experiment testing the interactions among two natural and two anthropogenic disturbances in a mature secondary temperate forest. Specifically, we test the extent to which: 1. a natural windthrow (tornado), 2. deer browsing, 3. salvage logging, a common forestry practice to generate revenue after natural disturbances, and 4. mechanical removal of the understory, drive subsequent plant community assembly, diversity, and abundance. Our results have two clear messages. First, the combined disturbances, especially salvage logging, increased plant species richness and abundance; we found 65 more species in 0.1 ha of the disturbed areas versus the same area of reference forest. Second, we found that it was critical to analyze plant growth forms separately; each major plant growth form responded to the distur-bances differently. Surprisingly, salvage logging, browsing, and vegetation removal had negligible effects on the diversity and abundance of tree seedlings or saplings. In contrast, salvaging increased herb richness by 30% (six extra species per 36 m2 plot), and shrubs were twice as abundant in salvaged versus unsalvaged plots. The combined disturbances created unique plant communities in comparison to adjacent undisturbed reference sites, but plant growth forms differed in which combination of disturbances shifted community composition the most. We did not find that non-native invasive species substantially increased in abundance in response to the dis-turbances, nor were invasive species unique to the salvaged areas. Together, our results demonstrate that a patchwork of combined natural and anthropogenic disturbances can promote plant diversity in a human-modified temperate forest. In particular, the combination of a natural wind disturbance and salvage logging benefited native herbaceous species, the plant group that represents the vast majority of vascular plant species (similar to 80%) in temperate forests across the world.

AB  - As a globally important alpine ecological zone, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and the stability of its ecosystem are of substantial significance to the East Asian and global climates. Livestock grazing is a traditional and important method to use grassland resources and has influenced the structure and functions of alpine grassland ecosystems; therefore, a rational grazing management strategy is important for the stability of the structure and functioning of alpine grassland. In this study, we conducted a manipulated grazing experiment with yak and Tibetan sheep, which are indigenous livestock, to investigate the effects of livestock type and its mixing ratio on soil properties, functional traits of plants, and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) in alpine grassland. The results showed that (1) the livestock assembly regulated EMF of alpine grassland by changing the vegetation functional traits and soil physicochemical properties; (2) all grazing treatments increased EMF of alpine grassland, with Tibetan sheep single grazing and mixed with 1:6 yak to Tibetan sheep being significantly higher than no grazing; (3) and grazing achieved EMF regulation based on the indirect effects of community functional dispersion and soil quality index. Our results demonstrate that soil quality improvement due to livestock activities is more conducive to enhancing the ecosystem multifunctionality of alpine grassland vegetation than that under moderate grazing intensity, and Tibetan sheep are more conducive to improving and optimising the ecosystem multifunctionality of alpine grassland compared with yaks under moderate grazing intensity.

AB  - Shrub encroachment threatens grassland ecosystem services including herbaceous plant diversity, productivity, and overall grazing capacity. Hence, various shrub control methods including mechanical removal and herbicides are applied to restore herbaceous vegetation. However, the knowledge regarding the outcomes of integrated shrub management on herbaceous vegetation is limited. We investigated herbaceous vegetation responses after 7 years following the integration of shrub control and herbivory at Telperion Nature Reserve, Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. In a split-plot experiment using four enclosures and non-enclosures as main plots, we randomly assigned each of the following treatments in four 4 x 4-m subplots in each main plot: 1) foliar metsulfuron-methyl herbicide, 2) 50% mechanical shrub removal, 3) 100% removal, and 4) no removal (untreated controls). A one-off Seriphium plumosum removal and the application of species-specific herbicide were conducted in 2015. Shrub control by herbivory interaction was significant (p < 0.05) for herbaceous canopy cover, basal cover, density, and species richness. The effects of herbivory were significant (p < 0.05) in the 50% removal treatment, increasing herbaceous plant diversity, density, and richness to the same level as 100% removal and herbicide treatments. In enclosures, however, the 50% shrub removal treatment attained relatively low herbaceous plant cover, density, species diversity, and richness compared to the herbicide treatment. Overall, this study revealed that herbivory and shrub control interact to facilitate herbaceous vegetation restoration, with 50% shrub removal by herbivory combination showing potential for management of S. plumosum-encroached grasslands.

AB  - Large herbivores can exert top-down control on terrestrial plant communities, but the magnitude, direction, and scale dependency of their impacts remain equivocal, especially in temperate and boreal forests, where multiple disturbances often interact. Using a unique, long-term, and replicated landscape experiment, we assessed the influence of a high density of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on the spatiotemporal dynamics of diversity, composition, and successional trajectories of understorey plant assemblages in recently logged boreal forests. This experiment provided a rare opportunity to test whether deer herbivory represents a direct filter on plant communities or if it mainly acts to suppress dominant plants, which, in turn, release other plant species from strong negative plant-plant interactions. These two hypotheses make different predictions about changes in community composition and alpha and beta diversity in different vegetation layers and at different spatial scales. Our results showed that deer had strong effects on plant community composition and successional trajectories, but the resulting impacts on plant alpha and beta diversity patterns were markedly scale dependent in both time and space. Responses of tree and non-tree vegetation layers were strongly asymmetric. Deer acted both as a direct filter and as a suppressor of dominant plant species during early forest succession, but the magnitude of both processes was specific to tree and non-tree vegetation layers. Although our data supported the ungulate-driven homogenization hypothesis, compositional shifts and changes of alpha diversity were poor predictors of beta diversity loss. Our findings underscore the importance of long-term studies in revealing nonlinear temporal community trends, and they challenge managers to prioritize particular community properties and scales of interest, given contrasting trends of composition and alpha and beta diversity across spatial scales.

AB  - The American Midwest has been at the forefront of urban and agricultural land conversion in the last century, which has dramatically eroded biodiversity and altered mammal community assemblages. To compare the effects of ecological drivers on the characteristics of mammal communities in this landscape, we used a statewide camera-trapping network deployed between autumn and spring for three years in Illinois. We used linear and generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape, ordination, and nestedness temperature analysis to determine drivers of mammal diversity and community composition across >160 sites. We found a nuanced relationship between mammal diversity and urbanization, with impervious surface reducing richness and diversity, while human footprint increased diversity. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and agricultural land cover were associated with reduced community evenness and more unstructured communities, while shrubland cover had positive effects on richness, evenness, and diversity. We did not find strong support for the negative effects of coyotes (Canis latrans) on mammal diversity, likely because suppressive effects from coyotes are largely limited to sympatric canids. Our results highlight the complex relationships between mammal communities and anthropogenic expansion, while demonstrating that ecological processes such as herbivory can play an important role in shaping mammal communities. Successfully conserving mammalian diversity, therefore, may require ungulate population management in addition to preserving natural habitat, including undervalued habitat such as shrubland.

AB  - In some regions of the world, long traditions of herding practices have coevolved with the natural ecosystems, sustaining livelihoods and biodiversity. However, in emerging economies, the populations that have long relied on livestock as their main income are now driving a dramatic increase in livestock numbers on the landscape. This study investigates the impacts of livestock (cattle and horses) and human activities on wild ungulates, Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), wapiti (Cervus canadensis), and wild boar (Sus scrofa), in Bogd Khan Mountain, Mongolia. Protected since the 12th century, this mountain is experiencing escalating anthropogenic pressures. Using camera traps in a random habitat stratified design, we analyzed temporal and spatial overlap between wild ungulates, livestock, and human activity. Livestock and human activities showed varying degrees of temporal overlap with wild ungulates, indicating potential competition and behavioral adaptations. Higher cattle relative abundance was associated with reduced wapiti abundance, suggesting potential competition for resources, whereas higher horse abundance corresponded to increased abundance of both wapiti and roe deer. Human abundance negatively impacted Siberian roe deer, likely due to disturbance, whereas wild boar exhibited resilience to these pressures. Our findings underscore the need for sustainable livestock management to mitigate competition and maintain ecological integrity. Integrating traditional herding practices with modern conservation strategies can enhance wildlife and livelihood resilience. This research highlights the utility of evidencebased approaches to balance biodiversity conservation and resource use in similar socio-ecological systems globally, where traditional livelihoods are increasingly at risk from modern disturbances.

AB  - The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) depends on changes in environmental disturbance. Plant and soil biological diversity can mediate EMF, but how these change in response to grazing disturbance remains unknown. Here we present an 8-year experiment on sheep grazing control in alpine grasslands in Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, China. Plant species richness, FRic (functional richness), PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), soil biological diversity (bacterial, fungal, and ciliate diversity), and multiple ecosystem functions were measured and calculated. The results showed that increasing grazing intensity caused a decrease in biodiversity and EMF and that biodiversity and ecosystem function differed significantly (P < 0.05) between grazing intensities. EMF was positively correlated with species richness, functional diversity, and soil bacterial diversity (P < 0.05), with 23.6 %,10.8 %, and 12.1 % of EMF explained by changes in grazing intensity, respectively. The interaction terms of grazing intensity, plant species richness, and soil biological diversity were negatively correlated with EMF (P < 0.05). This shift in the relationship between plant or soil biological diversity and EMF occurs at a grazing intensity index of around 0.7, i.e., the impact of plant species richness on EMF is more significant when the grazing intensity index is below 0.67. The effect of soil biological diversity on EMF is more substantial when the grazing intensity index is above 0.86. Conclusion: High grazing intensity directly affects soil bulk density and pH and indirectly affects EMF by regulating plant species richness and soil biological diversity changes. Loss of plant and soil biological diversity can have extreme consequences under low and high grazing intensity disturbance conditions. Therefore, we must develop biodiversity conservation strategies for external disturbances to mitigate the effects of land use practices such as grazing disturbances.

AB  - Resource selection by animals varies depending on spatial and temporal context, thus it is important to account for these factors when conducting studies that examine this behavior relative to the availability and distribution of resources. Many resource selection studies combine fine-scale animal location data obtained using global positioning system (GPS) technology and coarse-scale, remotely sensed, spatial layers. Fewer studies combine fine-scale animal location data with vegetation data collected in the field, which can identify important fine-scale drivers of resource selection. Understanding fine-scale resource selection of ungulates inhabiting regions dominated by closed-canopy forests may provide important information regarding management actions that improve habitat quality. From April 2021 to August 2022, we conducted vegetation surveys at locations (n = 1294) used by 39 GPS-collared elk Cervus canadensis and at paired random locations (n = 2509) available to elk. We used conditional logistic regressions to compare seasonal (spring, summer, fall, winter) vegetation characteristics between used and available locations. We also conducted a species indicator analysis to compare plant species found at used and available locations during peak foraging periods (dawn/dusk). Regardless of season, the probability of use by elk increased as tree basal area (m2/ha) decreased, and the presence of herbaceous plants increased. Clovers (Trifolium spp.) were indicators of locations used by elk during primary foraging periods regardless of season. Other plants that were indicators of locations used by elk during at least one season included purple-crown vetch Securigera varia, bird's foot trefoil Lotus corniculatus, and black medick Medicago lupulina. This research highlights the importance of managed openings, ecotones, and other communities characterized by reduced tree cover and increased herbaceous plants to meet the foraging needs of elk in landscapes dominated by closed-canopy forests. Creating and maintaining managed herbaceous openings and restoring open-forest communities will likely facilitate elk population growth and expansion.

AB  - Habitat restoration is a necessary component of wildlife conservation in anthropogenic landscapes. To ensure restoration initiatives achieve the desired effects on wildlife communities, it is useful to investigate how animals use landscape features. Understanding the relationships between wildlife use and ecological cues provides specific and measurable targets that can be used to measure restoration success. In western Canada, linear feature networks formed by seismic lines, pipelines and roads have altered the boreal forest landscape and resulted in population declines for woodland caribou. Restoration is aimed at supporting caribou recovery by deterring linear feature use by caribou predators and ungulate competitors. Information on how linear feature characteristics facilitate or deter wildlife use supports restoration initiatives by providing specific targets for restoration. Here, we used wildlife track and sign data to investigate biophysical characteristics related to the use of linear features by canines, bears, deer, elk and moose in caribou ranges of west-central and north-western Alberta and British Columbia. We built generalized linear mixed models consistent with three hypotheses that could explain likely mechanisms for use: (1) ease of movement, (2) risk avoidance and (3) resource availability (prey and forage). Moose, deer, elk and bears were more likely to use linear features with either human or game trails. Bears and canines were less likely to use seismic lines with greater lateral vegetation cover and taller vegetation, respectively. Moose, deer and elk were more likely to use linear features with a greater cover of ungulate forage taxa such as willow, birch, sedges and forbs. These results suggest that restoration focusing on trails, online vegetation structure and online vegetation type should deter predators and ungulate prey species to the overall benefit of caribou. Our study corroborates the findings of other research recommending structural and functional restoration using high-intensity line blocking and vegetative regeneration. We provide specific targets for linear feature restoration to assist in prioritization according to restoration objectives, which translates to a broader goal of linking local-level restoration actions to landscape-level conservation goals. This approach to restoration has implications for any major system experiencing anthropogenic landscape change.

AB  - Ungulates often alter behavior and space use in response to interspecific competition. Despite observable changes in behavior caused by competitive interactions, research describing the effects of competition on survival or growth is lacking. We used spatial modeling to determine if habitat use by female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) was affected by other ungulate species prior to, during, and after parturition. We conducted our study in the Book Cliffs region of eastern Utah, USA, during 2019 and 2020. We used resource selection function (RSF) analysis to model space use of 4 ungulate species that potentially competed with mule deer: bison (Bos bison), cattle, elk (Cervus canadensis), and feral horses. We incorporated RSF models for competing species into a random forest analysis to determine if space use by mule deer was influenced by these other ungulate species. We used survival and growth data from neonate mule deer to directly assess potential negative effects of other ungulates. Habitat use by elk was an important variable in predicting use locations of mule deer during birthing and rearing. The relationship was positive, suggesting interference competition was not occurring. Survival of neonate mule deer increased as the probability of use by elk increased (hazard ratio = 0.185 +/- 0.497 [SE]). Further, probability of use by elk in rearing habitat had no influence on growth of neonate mule deer from birth to 6 months of age, suggesting that exploitative competition was not occurring.

AB  - Natural disturbances are critical ecosystem processes, with both ecological and socioeconomic benefits and disadvan-tages. Large herbivores are natural disturbances that have removed plant biomass for millions of years, although her-bivore influence likely has declined during the past thousands of years corresponding with extinctions and declines in distributions and abundances of most animal species. Nonetheless, the conventional view, particularly in eastern North America, is that herbivory by large wild herbivores is at unprecedented levels, resulting in unnatural damage to forests. Here, we propose consideration of large herbivores as a natural disturbance that also imparts many crucial ecological advantages, using white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), the only wild large herbivore remaining throughout the eastern U.S., as our focal species. We examined evidence of detrimental effects of browsing on trees and forbs. We then considered that deer contribute to both fuel reduction and ecological restoration of herbaceous plants and histor-ical open forests of savannas and woodlands by controlling tree and shrub densities, mimicking the consumer role of fire. Similarly to other disturbances, deer disturbance 'regimes' are uneven in severity across different ecosystems and landscapes, resulting in heterogeneity and diversity. In addition to biodiversity support and fuel reduction, socioeco-nomic benefits include >$20 billion dollars per year by 10 million hunters that support jobs and wildlife agencies, non-consumptive enjoyment of nature by 80 million people, cultural importance, and deer as ecological ambassadors, whereas costs include about $5 billion and up to 450 human deaths per year for motor vehicle accidents, along with crop damage and disease transmission. From a perspective of historical ecology rather than current baselines, deer im-part a fundamental disturbance process with many ecological benefits and a range of socioeconomic effects.

AB  - Human-induced biodiversity loss negatively affects ecosystem function, but the interactive effects of biodiversity change across trophic levels remain insufficiently understood. We sampled arboreal spiders and lepidopteran larvae across seasons in 2 years in a subtropical tree diversity experiment, and then disentangled the links between tree diversity and arthropod predator diversity by deconstructing the pathways among multiple components of diversity (taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) with structural equation models. We found that herbivores were major mediators of plant species richness effects on abundance, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity of predators, while phylogenetic, functional and structural diversity of trees were also important mediators of this process. However, the strength and direction differed between functional, structural and phylogenetic diversity effects, indicating different underlying mechanisms for predator community assembly. Abundance and multiple diversity components of predators were consistently affected by tree functional diversity, indicating that the variation in structure and environment caused by plant functional composition might play key roles in predator community assembly. Our study highlights the importance of an integrated approach based on multiple biodiversity components in understanding the consequences of biodiversity loss in multitrophic communities.

AB  - Understanding ongoing vegetation dynamics is essential to disentangle ecosystem response to climate variability and identify threats and management opportunities. The basic distribution of vegetation cover and activity is largely determined by climatic conditions and management. Recent field studies suggest that herbivore-induced disturbances are important factors in vegetation dynamics, but analyses relying on long timeseries of empirical observations investigating the combined effect on vegetation of changing climate and herbivore densities are limited. In this study, the impact of temperature, precipitation, and large ungulates (both livestock and wildlife) on vegetation greenness (assessed with the enhanced vegetation index) from 2003 to 2021 in Norway are reconstructed for the growing season (May to October) and elucidated using multiple linear regression models. Vegetation greenness shows a widespread dominant increase in all months, with temperature being the dominant driver. Vegetation greenness is mostly affected by climate and ungulates in May, June and October (i.e., the start of growing season and the senescence), and at relatively high elevations (above 1000 m), where temperature is a limiting factor to vegetation growth. Precipitation can further contribute to explain the changes, especially in June and July. Generally, the positive temperature effect is amplified by increasing precipitation, but it has been hampered in places where precipitation was insufficient. Livestock mainly affect vegetation greenness negatively in northern grassland/shrubland ecosystems due to semi-domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) grazing, while wild cervids (mostly moose Alces alces) negatively affect vegetation greenness in southeastern deciduous forests. The impact of livestock grazing on vegetation greenness is usually stronger than that of wildlife, which leads to a slightly more prevalent negative temperature-livestock interaction than temperature-wildlife interaction. Improving our understanding of these fundamental mechanisms is vital to support informed management of livestock, wildlife and natural vegetation under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Land use is known to influence the diversity of vascular plants in the Miombo woodlands. However, little is known about the interaction between soil and land use in herbaceous and woody species. We compared the diversity of vascular plants at the plot level (20 m x 50 m) and site level for three sites in the Miombo woodlands of western Zambia subject to different levels of intensity classes of diffuse land use (e.g., livestock herbivory and selective timber harvesting). For each of the sites, twenty plots were randomly selected for assessment of species composition of vascular plant species, indicators of land-use intensity, and soil chemistry per plot. We hypothesized that the site with the lowest human impact would have the highest richness and diversity of woody and herbaceous species. At the site level, we found that richness and diversity of woody species were unaffected by land-use intensity, whereas herbaceous species richness was higher for the protected site (28 species on average per 1000 m(2)) than the two other sites (23 and 21 species on average per 1000 m(2)). At the plot level, herbaceous species richness was positively associated with woodcutting and soil pH. We interpret the positive effect of woodcutting on herbaceous species richness as the effect of lower competition by the woody component for resources such as water, nutrients, and light. With regard to the absence of any effect of land-use intensity on the richness of woody species, we conclude that in our study areas selective timber harvesting may be at a sustainable level and might even have a positive effect on the diversity of the herbaceous layer.

AB  - Aim: Reconstructing megafauna diversity in the past before anthropogenic impacts is crucial for developing targeted restoration strategies. We estimated the diversity and functional decline of European megafauna in the present compared with the nearest in-time climate period analogue to the present but prior to the worldwide diffusion of Homo sapiens.Location: Europe.Time Period: Last Interglacial (LIG; ca. 127,000 years ago) to present.Major Taxa Studied: Wild, large (>= 10 kg) terrestrial mammals.Methods: We assessed the distribution of 48 European megafauna species during the LIG using hindcasting modelling and fossil records. Then, we estimated the decline in megafauna community diversity and potential trait-based functional effects from the LIG to the present, accounting for climate differences between the two periods.Results: Species richness and community biomass dropped by 70.8% (+/- 11.7%) and by 94.5% (+/- 9.9%). Functional diversity dropped by 80.3% (+/- 15.3%) for herbivores and by 64.9% (+/- 29.1%) for carnivores, while trait-informed potential vegetation and meat consumptions dropped by 82.3% (+/- 13.4%) and 60.5% (+/- 26.0%). The loss in megafauna diversity and associated ecological processes were high everywhere, but particularly in western Europe for carnivores and in the East European Plain for herbivores. Potential megafauna richness in the two periods was similar if only climate-driven differences were considered.Main Conclusions: Severe, size-biased defaunation has degraded megafauna assemblages and megafauna-mediated ecological processes across Europe from the LIG to the present. These patterns cannot be explained by climate differences between the two periods, thus were likely driven by prehistoric Homo sapiens. The results suggest that the structure of wild ecosystems of the present strongly deviates from the evolutionary norm, with decreased functional heterogeneity and decreased fluxes of biogeochemical compounds across the trophic networks, highlighting the importance of ambitious policies of megafauna community restoration to support ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The study evaluates the interactive effects of mammalian herbivores and trees on soil biochemical properties of a semi-arid savanna ecosystem in South Africa. Composite soil samples were collected at three radial distances from a tree base, namely besides the tree trunk, canopy edge, and outside canopy, for two trees (Combretum apiculatum and Grewia bicolor), in the full exclosure and open access area in the Nkuhlu exclosures of Kruger National Park. We measured total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), pH, available phosphorus (P), microbial activity, exchangeable cations (calcium [Ca2+], magnesium [Mg2+], sodium [Na+] and potassium [K+]) and cation exchange capacity (CEC). Result indicates that pH and Mg2+ in full exclosure were significantly higher than outside, whereas TN, TC, available P, microbial activity, K+ and CEC were lower. Under canopy samples had more pH, TN, TC, available P, K+ and Ca2+ than those collected from other sampling zones, mainly because of the effect of litter accumulation under the tree canopies. With the exceptions of CEC and microbial activity, the effects of the two tree species on soil nutrients were similar. Microbial activity was significantly high, whereas CEC was low under G. bicolor than C. apiculatum. The canopy edge of G. bicolor had the highest microbial activity, while the area outside the canopy of C. apiculatum had the lowest than all the other treatments. These results indicate that the presence of herbivores and woody species differentially affects the spatial distribution of the various nutrients, soil microbiota and other chemical properties depending on their radial distances from the tree base.Conservation implications: It is ecologically unwise to completely eliminate trees and herbivores from savanna ecosystems, as they help to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity.

AB  - Patterns of habitat selection for sympatric urial Ovis vignei and Siberian ibex Capra sibirica are poorly known, in part because there are few places where such overlap exists. Using envelope modeling methodology, we analyzed location data of these species in the Hindu Kush range along the Wakhan Valley of the Wakhan National Park (10,950 km(2)) in northeastern Afghanistan, recorded during field surveys in April-May of 2011, 2015, and 2018. Distribution models showed significant ecological niche differences (P < 0.05) between urial (a true sheep species) and ibex (a true goat species) for most variables. Urial stayed at lower elevations compared to ibex, both species tended to avoid flat areas, but urial avoided slopes above 60 %.
   Urial used southeast-facing slopes more, and west-facing slopes less, than available, whereas ibex had a slightly more than expected use of southwest-facing slopes. Urial preferred terrains with ruggedness index (similar to 20-40) of the values available (15-60), whereas ibex were more generalist in terrain preference. Urial utilized habitats closer to human activity areas compared to ibex. Both species utilized the higher quality vegetation areas (NDVI > 0) and showed the same avoidance of lower quality areas. Understanding selection criteria of habitat use by urial and ibex in Wakhan Valley, inhabited by over 14,000 people and their livestock (ca. 78,000), will enable adjustments to the protection schemes regarding the requirements of two key mountain ungulate species critical to the sustainability and conservation of this unique ecosystem. This type of information is very scarce in the literature for the sympatric mountain ungulates in Asia.

AB  - Past and current anthropogenic practices have resulted in dramatic alterations to ungulate population densities worldwide. When ungulate populations are overabundant, they can alter the dynamics, structure, and function of ecosystems. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), specifically, can occur at densities far greater than their historical records in parts of their native range, which includes forests in the northeastern U.S. They have been shown to alter community structure of native plants, indirectly impact animal communities, and promote the success of invasive species. Despite much research into the effects of overabundant ungulates and deer in particular, less is known about the effects of deer on soil microbial communities. Here, we utilized soil samples from inside and outside of six deer exclosures located in a regional second growth mixed hardwood forest on the Binghamton University campus in Vestal NY, USA. A metagenomic analysis was conducted on DNA extracted from the soil to identify the microbes present. Soil characteristics, including soil organic matter, soil moisture, pH, and electrical conductivity were also measured. Soil samples from inside exclosures had on average lower pH, higher soil moisture and organic matter, and higher electrical conductivity. The microbial communities across all samples were dominated by Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. However, the structure of the microbial soil community appeared to differ between samples taken inside and outside the exclosures, with those taken outside more closely resembling other outside samples and those sampled inside soils showing more variability in community structure. Overall, our results suggest that overabundant deer may have a homogenization effect on the soil abiotic environment and the soil microbial community.

AB  - Savannas, defined by a balance of woody and herbaceous vegetation, are vital for global biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Yet, their stability is increasingly at risk due to climate change and human impacts. The responses of these ecosystems to extreme drought events remain poorly understood, especially in relation to the regional variations in soil, terrain, climate history and disturbance legacy. This study analysed time series of a vegetation index, derived from remote sensing data, to quantify ecosystem stability metrics, i.e., resistance and resilience, in response to a major drought event in the semi-arid savanna of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Using Bayesian Generalized Linear Models, we assessed the influence of ecosystem traits, past extreme climate events, fire history and herbivory on regional patterns of drought resistance and resilience. Our results show that sandier granite soils dominated by trees have higher drought resistance, supported by the ability of deep-rooted water access. In contrast, grassier savanna landscapes on basalt soils proved more drought resilient, with rapid vegetation recovery post-drought. The effects of woody cover on ecosystem drought response are mediated by differences in historical fire regimes, elephant presence and climate legacy, underscoring the complex, context-dependent nature of savanna landscape response to drought. This research deepens our understanding of savanna stability by clarifying the role of regional drivers, like fire and climate, alongside long-term factors, like soil composition and woody cover. With droughts projected to increase in frequency and severity in arid and semi-arid savannas, it also highlights remote sensing as a robust tool for regional-scale analysis of drought responses, offering a valuable complement to field-based experiments that can guide effective management and adaptive strategies.

AB  - Riparian areas can be highly biodiverse and provide critical ecosystem services. However, they are frequently subject to anthropogenic impacts such as land clearing, agricultural use, and urban development. Restoration of riparian areas via revegetation commonly improves the health of waterways and surrounding areas, but vegetation outcomes are rarely assessed. Our study compared 10 to 14-year-old revegetation to remnant vegetation in riparian areas of south-eastern Australia to determine if species composition, vegetation structure, and ecosystem function (plant recruitment) differed. We also assessed if the amount of surrounding native vegetation, browsers (including deer, rabbits, and macropods), or soil characteristics influenced native woody plant recruitment at revegetated sites. While native and exotic woody species richness did not differ, native woody plants were less abundant and exotic woody plants twice as abundant at revegetated sites. The ground layer of revegetated sites was dominated by weeds, whereas remnant sites largely comprised native herbaceous plants and leaf litter. Tree heights and tree canopy cover were similar in revegetated and remnant areas, although shrubs and ferns were lacking in revegetation. Native woody plant recruitment was lower at revegetated sites and was negatively associated with browser presence. Our results suggest that while revegetation may have similar species richness and tree cover as remnant areas, weeds often dominate and important structural components such as shrubs and ferns, and ecological processes such as plant recruitment, are lacking. Better consideration of all vegetation strata, reduced browsing pressure and weed control are likely to achieve better revegetation outcomes.

AB  - The interaction between livestock and wildlife causes challenges for wildlife conservation and public health. Mapping interface areas is essential for prioritizing disease surveillance, implementing mitigation measures, and developing targeted control programs to protect threatened wildlife. We used spatial overlays of habitat suitability to predict interface areas with high risk of pathogen transmission for three Thai wild bovids (gaur [Bos gaurus], banteng [Bos javanicus] and wild water buffalo [Bubalus arnee]) and domestic cattle. We assumed that domestic cattle are the reservoir of important bovine infectious diseases and that high cattle density is a proxy for a higher transmission risk. We calculated the interface inside and outside Thai protected areas and classified these by land use types. Then, we counted the number of bovine infectious disease occurrences reported in high-risk areas. Our study indicated that the highest risk areas for these species are at the forest edges where high habitat suitability and cattle densities overlap. Suitable habitats for wild water buffalo had the largest proportion of high-risk areas (9%), while gaur and banteng had similar risk areas (4%). Kuiburi National Park had the largest risk area (274 km2) for gaur and banteng, whereas the largest risk area for wild water buffalo overlapped with Huai Thabthan-Had Samran by 126 km2. Cropland and unclassified forests had the highest percentage of interface areas, indicating a higher risk of pathogen transmission. Our results highlight how habitat suitability analyses could help infectious disease prevention and control strategies and may also support wild bovid conservation initiatives.

AB  - Questions Livestock grazing is an important driver of plant diversity in grasslands. Different mechanisms summarized in three main hypotheses have been proposed to explain its varying effects depending on productivity. The insufficient compensation hypothesis (ICH) states that livestock causes the extinction of species that cannot compensate for biomass removal in unproductive sites, reducing species richness. The competitive release hypothesis (CRH) states that livestock increases plant diversity by attenuating competition, especially in productive environments. In the convergent evolution hypothesis (CEH), livestock has minor effects on diversity in unproductive sites because plants that endure stress are pre-adapted to grazing. These hypotheses have rarely been compared formally, and have mostly been tested on large spatial scales. Here we simultaneously test these hypotheses on a local scale. Location Natural semi-arid grassland, Oaxaca, Mexico. Methods We performed a long-term exclosure experiment, recording plant diversity annually over 17 years. In 2017 we measured species richness over a grazing intensity gradient. We used linear mixed-effects models, nestedness and beta-diversity analyses to evaluate diversity and composition in relation to grazing and productivity. Results Plant diversity generally increased with grazing intensity. In line with CRH, species richness increased as grazing became more intensive due to a progressive incorporation of increasingly poor competitors to the community, with a seemingly stronger effect under high productivity. This suggests that herbivores limit competitive species and prevent competitive exclusion. ICH may play a secondary role because the effect was reversed in low productivity inside exclosures. Conclusions Our finding implies that in productive sites, the exclusion of livestock can be detrimental to plant diversity as a lack of grazing accelerates competitive exclusion. By contrast, in limiting environments, grazing can preserve diversity if livestock are kept at low stocking densities. Our results show that small-scale variations in productivity need to be considered when designing livestock management.

AB  - Alteration of local biodiversity by climate change may be especially impactful in the Arctic, where species richness is characteristically low and environmental conditions are changing rapidly. Two species of arctic large herbivores that survived rapid warming during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, caribou and muskoxen, again face accelerated warming and changes in vegetation seasonality under contemporary climate change. While numerous studies have investigated the roles of weather and primary productivity in population dynamics of these species, opportunities for investigation of their dynamics in sympatric populations have been limited. We analyzed the population dynamics and offspring production of sympatric caribou and muskoxen at a study site in West Greenland over an 18-year period (2002-2019) during which the timing of spring green-up has advanced rapidly. In caribou, population growth rate and calf production were greater following warm winters but lower in years with earlier spring green-up. While calf production was highly variable, caribou abundance declined over the course of the study. In contrast, muskox population growth and calf production both increased following earlier springs. Moreover, muskox abundance increased over the course of the study, despite a negative association between their rate of increase and winter temperature, perhaps indicating that winter weather was less important than spring green-up timing in their dynamics. Hence, sympatric populations of these two herbivores displayed opposing demographic responses to winter weather and spring plant phenology at this shared location. These results emphasize the complexity of predicting large herbivore responses to climate change, and highlight the potential for impacts to species richness of large herbivore communities as the Arctic continues to warm.

AB  - The spread of invasive plant species (IPS) is widely recognized as one of the major threats to biodiversity. However, the impact of IPS on wildlife habitat utilization remains poorly understood. This study investigated the impact of IPS on the habitat utilization of wild ungulates in Parsa National Park (PNP) of Nepal. We used camera traps and sign survey methods to detect wild ungulates between December 2022 and October 2023. In each survey plot, we also recorded the occurrence and coverage of IPS, tree canopy cover, and the distances to the nearest settlement, road, and water source. Twenty IPS were recorded in the PNP during this study. Our results revealed that the barking deer were more prevalent at sites with lower IPS coverage ((3 = -0.065; p = 0.009), while the sambar deer were more prevalent at sies with higher IPS coverage ((3 = 0.053; p = 0.019) and at low tree canopy cover ((3 = -0.078; p = 0.008). The habitat use of barking deer was found to be higher closer to roads ((3 = -0.641; p = 0.004), while the sambar deer were found far from settlements ((3 = 0.953; p = 0.021). These results highlight the importance of managing wild ungulate habitats by controlling IPS in the PNP to conserve wild ungulate species.

AB  - As the urgency to mitigate climate change becomes more important, so too does the need for effective policies and management that deliver effective carbon storage and sequestration world-wide. Tidal marshes are one of several 'blue carbon' ecosystems where enhanced management offers natural climate mitigation solutions. However, their capacity to store carbon can be diminished by anthropogenic land use. We measured carbon stocks and rates of decomposition in tropical tidal marshes that have experienced disturbance from ungulates (cattle and feral pigs). We found that tidal marsh carbon stocks were higher near the surface of the sediment relative to estimates from deeper in the soil profile. Generally, both carbon stocks and decomposition rates were higher in areas with greater tidal inundation, apart from a unique location where tidal flow has been severely restricted by a road. Remarkably, the fenced wetland had the lowest surface soil carbon ratio in the surface sediments (30 cm), a response presumably due to the wetland being used by cattle (seasonal grazing) that are more concentrated because they are trapped in the fenced enclosure (not outside the fenced protection area), compared to open wetland areas that also still have grazing impacts, but apparently causing much less impact because of a distributed use regime. Our study outlines that fencing wetlands to hold out ungulates but to then use the restored area for seasonal grazing seems counter-intuitive and a misuse of government funds.

AB  - Disentangling the effects of environmental variation and management actions on vegetation condition is increasingly important given increasing efforts to tackle biodiversity loss and the advent of environmental accounting programs. The Mount Lofty Ranges (South Australia) contains temperate ecosystems supporting rich but threatened biodiversity. Using 15 years of vegetation monitoring, we quantified drivers of and trends in four indicators of vegetation health; native species richness, vegetation structure, regeneration, tree habitat quality, and two indicators of vegetation threats; grazing pressure and weed species richness. After correcting for differences between vegetation communities, we found all indicators were significantly associated with environmental variables. Seasonal effects were found for native and weed species richness and vegetation structure with peaks in spring. Significant spatial effects for native and weed species richness, vegetation structure and grazing scores reflect historic and current land use. Rainfall in the year before a survey resulted in higher native and weed species richness and higher grazing scores. To demonstrate the application of model-based correction factors when monitoring vegetation change in this system, we simulated a management-induced native species gain and tested the capacity of different before-after survey regimes to detect this gain under environmental variability. Across sites, model-based corrections increased the probability of detecting the simulated gain by c. 8% and reduced the variance in this probability approximately six-fold. Our results quantify the effects of environmental drivers on vegetation in the study region and highlight the improved capacity to detect the true effects of management actions through model-based adjustments for environmental drivers.

AB  - Introduction Climate warming, combined with grazing pressures, poses significant challenges to vegetation cover and ecosystem stability. In particular, livestock grazing is a primary factor in vegetation degradation, adversely affecting plant diversity, soil health, and key ecological interactions.Methods This study investigates the impact of grazing on vegetation in the Alborz region of Iran, focusing on the comparison between native herbivores (Artiodactyla) and livestock in the Central Alborz Protected Area (CAPA). We utilized 30 years of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data from May to June (1994-2024) to assess vegetation dynamics and evaluate the influence of climate and grazing. ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and regression analyses were performed to identify relationships between vegetation cover, climate variables (temperature and rainfall), and grazing intensity.Results Results show a significant increase in vegetation cover, with Golestanak (without livestock) exhibiting a stronger positive response to climate variables (R-2 = 65%), while Z & amacr;noos (higher livestock density) showed greater variability (R-2 = 58%). Vegetation in Golestanak demonstrated a more significant positive correlation with temperature and rainfall, reflecting resilience to climatic stressors and the beneficial effect of moderate grazing by native Artiodactyla. In contrast, Z & amacr;noos showed more fluctuation in vegetation trends due to high livestock grazing pressure.Discussion This study highlights that while climate warming can positively affect vegetation cover, intensive livestock grazing can impede these gains, underlining the importance of adaptive management strategies for maintaining ecosystem health.

AB  - Large herbivorous mammals strongly influence vegetation structure by creating and maintaining open areas and causing disturbance within closed woody habitats. The herbivores alive today in Europe are only a small remnant of the large species that existed in high diversity and abundance before modern humans. The extinction of so many large herbivores during the last 50,000 years, and the loss of megaherbivores (body weight >= 1000 kg) from most of the continent before the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, is likely to have had cascading effects on vegetation structure and composition. To evaluate these effects within the European temperate forest biome, we examine the abundance change of three important European woody taxa (deciduous oaks, Quercus spp.; hazel, Corylus [mainly C. avellana]; and yew, Taxus baccata) before and after the late-Quaternary downgrading of the region''s large herbivore fauna. These taxa are disturbance-favoured, depend on canopy openings for regeneration, and tend to decline in closed dense forests. Quercus and Corylus may thrive in systems affected by megafauna herbivory or fire, whilst Taxus is fire-sensitive but can thrive in grazed systems. Using pollen-based reconstructions (REVEALS), we investigated the proportional cover of these three focal taxa in the Last Interglacial (129,000-116,000 before present [BP]) and early-mid-Holocene (8700-5700 BP). We found that woodlands in the Last Interglacial exhibited higher cover of Corylus and Taxus relative to the Holocene, with the former reaching very high percentage cover; meanwhile, Quercus had a consistent, moderately high percentage cover in both periods. Furthermore, we found that the cover of Corylus and Taxus appeared to be influenced more by unmeasured, non-climatic factors than Quercus. Synthesis: The abundance of Taxus suggests a limited role of fire; whilst the observed levels of Taxus, Corylus and Quercus align with the potential influence of megafauna herbivory; however, a direct quantitative link remains to be established. Our results suggest that vegetation was structurally and compositionally affected by differences in disturbance regimes between the Last Interglacial and early-mid-Holocene, with the loss of diverse disturbance regimes likely contributing to the divergence of Holocene vegetation from long-term ecological baselines.
   The late-Quaternary extinctions of many large herbivores in Europe likely impacted forest structure and composition. Using pollen-based REVEALS reconstructions, the authors compared the cover of Quercus, Corylus and Taxus between the Last Interglacial and early-mid-Holocene. Their findings suggest megafauna herbivory influenced these taxa, with the loss of such disturbance regimes contributing to shifts in Holocene vegetation away from pre-Holocene baselines.

AB  - Tree-removal treatments have been broadly applied across pinon-juniper ecosystems of the western United States to reduce tree cover, stimulate understory plant production, and promote habitat for shrub- and grassland-obligate wildlife species. Mastication treatments have become an increasingly common approach, yet the efficacy of these treatments can vary on the basis of a variety of factors, including soil characteristics, woodland structure, and grazing pressures. Here, we assessed vegetation responses to mastication treatments across three dominant soil types in two-needle pinon (Pinus edulis Engelm. [Pinaceae])- one-seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma [Engelm.] Sarg.) woodlands in southeast Colorado, United States, a region characterized by monsoonal precipitation, limited presence of introduced plant species, and relatively high grazing intensity by cattle and wildlife. We found that mastication treatments were effective at increasing herbaceous plant cover and species diversity (by 1.2 x and 1.5 x) and at reducing the amount of exposed soil (60% reduction) 3 yr following treatment. This was mainly due to increases in native perennial grasses. Further, there were limited (and insignificant) increases in cover of annual plants and low abundance of introduced species in treated plots. Understory plant responses to treatment were similar across soils with a range of available water capacities. The increase in understory plant cover and richness paired with the low abundance of introduced species suggests that mastication treatments increase forage production for cattle and wild ungulates. In addition, the lack of soil type differences in treatment response suggests that mastication treatment placement does not need to prioritize soil type and can instead focus on other key areas of importance, such as wildlife habitat connectivity, historic woodland structure, and treatment feasibility.

AB  - Elk Island National Park (EINP) is a fenced park in the Beaver Hills UNESCO Biosphere Reserve of central Alberta where aspen parkland is being conserved. This area maintains high densities of native ungulates including elk (Cervus elaphus), bison (Bison bison bison, B. bison athabascae), moose (Alces alces), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and mule deer (O. hemionus). Our objective was to evaluate spatiotemporal overlap and interspecific interactions between bison and elk in EINP using camera traps. Bison and elk have overlapping habitat use and diet and are the primary focus of ungulate management in EINP. We examined distributions of both species in relation to season, landscape characteristics, anthropogenic features, and heterospecifics using generalized linear models (GLMs). We then examined seasonal daily activity patterns of bison and elk and calculated the degree of overlap. The spatial analysis revealed that bison counts were positively associated with higher proportions of open habitats across seasons and in areas farther from water in summer and fall but had no associations with distance to water during winter. Bison removal year (years during which bison removals were conducted by Parks Canada) was a significant predictor variable for bison counts in winter when the bison roundup takes place. Elk avoided areas with high linear feature density across seasons. During fall and winter, we observed higher elk counts associated with bison presence. Temporal activity patterns revealed that elk were crepuscular in all three seasons, but bison activity patterns varied with diurnal activity being more common in the summer, crepuscular activity in winter, and intermediate activity patterns during fall. Coefficients of overlap between elk and bison were high in all three seasons with the greatest difference in daily activity patterns in summer and the highest overlap in winter when both species showed strong crepuscular activity. Despite the fenced perimeter in EINP resulting in high ungulate densities, limited dispersal, and low predation, our data show patterns of habitat use and interactions between bison and elk that were similar to those in other systems. Spatiotemporal partitioning does not appear necessary for coexistence of bison and elk in the aspen parkland.

AB  - Understanding the relative importance of threats to species across their range is critical for large-scale conservation planning. Scaling-up localized research to inform the Canada-wide boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) recovery strategy epitomizes the challenge. Current policy draws heavily from data obtained at the southern front of range retraction. Here, disturbances benefiting early successional herbivores (e.g., moose [Alces alces]), and hence wolves (Canis lupus) imparts increased predation risk to caribou (via "disturbance-mediated apparent competition" [DMAC]). Anthropogenic linear features (e.g., corridors, roads etc.; LFs) also improve wolf hunting efficiency, exacerbating DMAC, with caribou thereby losing functional habitat. However, similar to 2/3 of extant caribou range occurs in northern Canadian Shield and Taiga habitat, which contrasts with southern areas in both disturbance regime (fire-dominated) and community assembly (e.g., no deer [Odocoileus spp.]). To test predictions of DMAC and LF-avoidance in a northern caribou population (Saskatchewan Boreal Shield; similar to 3% of habitat within 500 m of anthropogenic disturbance), we tracked 94 GPS-collared females (2014-2018). Unexpectedly, caribou did not avoid LFs at most scales of observation. Although they responded to vegetation in line with apparent competition, resiliency of conifer-dominated successional trajectories and muted moose-wolf responses to disturbance suggest that poor primary productivity may modulate the strength of DMAC to caribou-including its potential interaction with LFs to influence movements. Before focusing on DMAC as the principal threat to caribou in northern ecoregions, further studies investigating if caribou and predators functionally respond to increasing LF-availability are needed, as it may be most critical for conserving crucial source populations.

AB  - Vegetation type is an important component of savannas contributing to changes in soil health. In savanna landscapes, the tree-grass balance is primarily governed by water, nutrients, fire, herbivory, and their interactions. Here we investigated the long-term effect of herbivores, fire, and vegetation type, and their interactions on selected physical properties (bulk density, penetration resistance, aggregate size fractions, and mean weight diameter (MWD)) of water stable aggregates within the crest and foot-slope of 20-year-old Nkuhlu exclosures located in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Burning, herbivory, and open grassland zones had a significant main and interactive ecological impact on all the soil physical properties under investigation. The interactions between fire, herbivores, and vegetation type within the crest and foot-slope of the Nkuhlu exclosure had a significant impact on soil bulk density, with areas under tree canopies having lower bulk density than open grassland zones in all the exclosures. In all the sampling sites, both burnt and unburnt plots of the full exclosure had lower penetration resistance than the control site and partial exclosure. Moreover, unburnt plots and canopy cover increased aggregate size distribution and mean weight diameter of water stable aggregates. Since fire and herbivory are closely linked and bring about changes in soil physical properties, the understanding of the dynamics of fire, herbivory, vegetation, and their interactions can then be used to help make effective management decisions that incorporate concerns of biodiversity in savanna ecosystems.

AB  - 1. Sustainable provision of critical ecosystem services in drylands is reliant on their stability under anthropogenic disturbances. Livestock grazing and shrub encroachment are the primary drivers of disturbance that impact their biodiversity and production dynamics. However, the effects of grazing on the stability at multiple scales, particularly following the transition from grass-dominated to shrub-encroached drylands, is still largely unexplored.2. Here, we conducted comparable sheep-grazing experiments in two types of drylands (grass-dominated vs. shrub-encroached grasslands) on the Mongolia Plateau to explore the effects of grazing and shrub encroachment on biodiversity and stability at multiple scales. We examined how grazing affected the temporal stability of aboveground biomass in herbaceous communities in both grass-dominated and shrub-encroached grasslands, through two potential mechanisms: insurance effects and changes in the population-level stability of individual species.3. We found that an increase in sheep grazing intensity had significant and negative effects on insurance effects by decreasing both species asynchrony and spatial asynchrony but it had no effects on population stability, consequently leading to reductions in herbaceous community stability of the grasslands. However, grazing-increased insurance effects cancelled out grazing-decreased population stability, contributing to no changes in the community stability of shrub-encroached grasslands. Likely, because grazing-induced reductions in the relative abundance of the dominant species were more noticeable in shrub-encroached grasslands than that of in grasslands. Moreover, the grazing-decreased abundance of dominant species was directly correlated to increases in insurance effects in shrub-encroached grasslands but not in grasslands, despite the positive relationships between population stability and the relative abundance of the dominant species in both grass-dominated and shrub-encroached drylands.4. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that grazing can decrease the stability of herbaceous production in drylands but this negative effect is attenuated with the transition from grasslands to shrub-encroached grasslands, suggesting that grazing effects on herbaceous community stability can be altered by shrub encroachment in drylands. Furthermore, the stability of dominant grasses plays a crucial role in stabilizing herbaceous communities and should be considered in promoting sustainable ecosystem functioning and services in drylands.

AB  - The semi-domesticated nature of the reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.) makes it a distinct case among the world's herbivores. Here, we review the literature on how reindeer shape vegetation and soil carbon and nitrogen cycles in northernmost Fennoscandia. We first describe main historical events that shaped the present-day grazing patterns in the different countries, then discuss the methodological considerations needed for interpreting evi-dence from grazer exclosures in ecological and environmental contexts. We argue that it is critical to be aware that these experiments do not measure the effect of grazing per se, but rather, they measure the responses of existing ecosystem structure and function to the sudden cessation of grazing in an environment, which was to a large degree shaped by it. Studies show that the direction and the magnitude of the effects of reindeer on vegetation and soil processes vary across habitats and depend on both the current land-uses and the historically formed grazing regimes; knowledge of the history is thus a key prerequisite for understanding the role of reindeer in ecosystems. As a general trend, reindeer affect soil nutrient cycles to a stronger extent in subarctic than in boreal ecosystems. In sites where reindeer have changed soil nutrient availability, they indirectly modify vegetation and productivity even after the cessation of grazing. We reason that the concepts of cultural and natural landscapes are not mutually exclusive in the case of reindeer ranges. Understanding how the intensity and seasonal timing of both past and present grazing direct ecosystem changes under climate warming is crucial for predicting future ecosystem structures and functioning in northern Fennoscandia as well as ecosystems in general.

AB  - A major side effect of urbanization is the increased availability of food for wildlife in peri-urban areas. Most research has focused on highly adaptive exploiter species that thrive under such conditions, overlooking avoider species, which are often predated upon by exploiters. Moreover, peri-urban areas are often grazed by livestock, mainly to reduce the frequency and intensity of fires, a practice that can also adversely affect vulnerable wildlife species. We examined the long-term effects of excess food provided to discourage exploiter species, namely golden jackal (Canis aureus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa), from foraging on farmland and in human residencies. Both species prey on endangered mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella) in our peri-urban study area, which is nested within a mosaic of settlements and agricultural lands in Mediterranean Israel. Because the park is routinely subjected to seasonal cattle ranching, we included cattle stocking rate (mean +/- SD: 51.77 +/- 18.21 cow grazing days/ha) as an alternative factor, into our analysis. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models to analyze an extensive dataset, comprising 724 surveys conducted over 17 years, and modeled gazelle encounter rates in response to excess food and cattle ranching, while controlling for environmental factors. Our results suggest that anthropogenic excess food through diversionary feeding led to decreasing gazelle densities, probably through increased predation by exploiter species. When diversionary feeding ceased after 12 years, gazelle encounter rates increased. We argue that this increase corresponds to population recovery, although it could be consistent with alternative mechanisms such as altered space-use and movement patterns. To conserve vulnerable and endangered wildlife species in urban and peri-urban areas, managers should reduce the availability of anthropogenic food for predators and scavengers. Furthermore, moderate cattle ranching (i.e., seasonal with low stocking rates) could mitigate potential adverse impacts of cattle ranching on mountain gazelle populations.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers that modify the soil and ground-layer properties exert a strong influence on vegetation communities in ecosystems worldwide. Understanding the interactions between animal engineers and vegetation is challenging when in the presence of large herbivores, as many vegetation communities are simultaneously affected by both engineering and herbivory. The superb lyrebird Menura novaehollandiae, an ecosystem engineer in wet forests of south-eastern Australia, extensively modifies litter and soil on the forest floor. The aim of this study was to disentangle the impacts of engineering by lyrebirds and herbivory by large mammals on the composition and structure of ground-layer vegetation. We carried out a 2-year, manipulative exclusion experiment in the Central Highlands of Victoria, Australia. We compared three treatments: fenced plots with simulated lyrebird foraging; fenced plots excluding herbivores and lyrebirds; and open controls. This design allowed assessment of the relative impacts of engineering and herbivory on germination rates, seedling density, vegetation cover and structure, and community composition. Engineering by lyrebirds enhanced the germination of seeds in the litter layer. After 2 years, more than double the number of germinants were present in "engineered" than "non-engineered" plots. Engineering did not affect the density of seedlings, but herbivory had strong detrimental effects. Herbivory also reduced the floristic richness and structural complexity (<0.5 m) of forest vegetation, including the cover of herbs. Neither process altered the floristic composition of the vegetation within the 2-year study period. Ecosystem engineering by lyrebirds and herbivory by large mammals both influence the structure of forest-floor vegetation. The twofold increase in seeds stimulated to germinate by engineering may contribute to the evolutionary adaptation of plants by allowing greater phenotypic expression and selection than would otherwise occur. Over long timescales, engineering and herbivory likely combine to maintain a more-open forest floor conducive to ongoing ecosystem engineering by lyrebirds.

AB  - Grazing by domestic herbivores is applied across Europe to combat the loss of light-dependent, species-rich communities due to encroachment by competitive woody and herbaceous plants. However, the billions of euros spent annually by the EU on grazing subsidies have failed to halt the loss of species in open habitats. We hypothesized that typical agri-environmental, seasonal grazing fails to simulate the ecological effects of now-extirpated, large, wild herbivores, which coevolved with these species-rich communities. We conducted a survey of 30 semi-natural sites, where grazing was either absent, seasonal, or year-round, across a spectrum of abiotic conditions. We recorded plant species diversity and cover and used plant traits to assess taxonomic and functional responses. Year-round grazing supported higher plant species richness and forb cover compared to seasonal or no grazing. Specifically, dormant-season (winter) grazing pressure increased species richness and forb cover, superseding additional effects of growing-season (summer) grazing pressure. Functional richness was similar across management types, likely due to higher plant trait similarity in year-round grazed sites. Our results support that dormant-season grazing plays a key role in weakening interspecific competition among plants and in enabling diverse forb communities to replace species-poor grass dominance. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that typical, seasonal grazing may be counterproductive in terms of promoting plant diversity. We found the most effective management strategy for conserving species-rich forb communities to be year-round grazing. Our results urge a greater focus on the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms behind the relationship between large herbivores and plants, not least the balance between grasses and forbs. We advocate a shift in conservation strategies towards natural grazing, to halt the continued loss of species that depend on open and semi-open, forb-rich habitats such as grasslands, wetlands, and woodlands.

AB  - The presence of seeds in livestock dung can alter the composition of aboveground vegetation. However, there have been few studies of the composition of the dung seed bank of Tibetan livestock on different vegetation types on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The aims of this study were to identify the differences of endozoochorous seed dispersal in dung type and vegetation type and determine the relationships between the dung seed bank and aboveground vegetation in meadow and shrubland. We conducted experiments to assess the density and plant diversity of the seed bank of yak and sheep dung in meadow and shrubland. The dung seed density in Tibetan sheep dung from meadow sites was the highest (239.3 +/- 13.8 seeds kg(-1)), and the number of species in yak dung from meadow sites was the highest. Among seasons, the livestock dung seed density was highest in November and the lowest in April. The species richness of the dung seed bank was higher in meadows than shrubland and higher in yak dung than that in Tibetan sheep dung only for shrubland. The dispersal of dung seeds has a greater impact on vegetation changes in meadows than shrubland, and the dispersal of seed in yak dung has a greater effect on vegetation changes than does dispersal in Tibetan sheep dung in shrubland. There were more monocotyledons in yak dung of shrubland (42%), whereas there were more dicotyledons in Tibetan sheep dung of meadow (45%). This suggests that yak and Tibetan sheep are complementing each other in their seed dispersal potential. Therefore, we recommend grazing more Tibetan sheep in the meadow and more yak in the shrubland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. (c) 2022 The Society for Range Management. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Community interaction webs describe both direct and indirect interactions among species. Changes in direct interactions often become noticeable soon after a perturbation, but time lags in the responses of many species may delay the appearance of indirect effects and lead to temporal or spatial variation in interaction webs. Accurately identifying these shifts in the field requires time-specific, spatially differentiated interaction webs. We explore how variation in browsing affects interaction webs in a long-unburned chaparral shrubland near the central California coast. Most prior work in chaparral focused on rapid changes for <5 years after a wildfire that were assumed to determine community patterns until the next fire. Here, we report the results of the first 15 years of an ongoing experiment monitoring how interaction webs in long-unburned chaparral (at least 100 years postfire) respond to experimental variation in browsing by deer and rabbits on dominant shrubs (Arctostaphylos pumila, Ceanothus cuneatus var. rigidus, and Ericameria ericoides). We hypothesized that variation in browsing would directly affect foodplants, indirectly modify growth and survival of other shrubs, and impact habitat needed by herbaceous plants. We found a dynamic web of plant-herbivore and plant-plant interactions that responded rapidly to changes in deer browsing on Ceanothus followed by indirect interactions that continued developing over several years, affecting shrubs, open space, herbaceous plants, and small mammals. Experimental variation in the intensity of deer browsing led to temporal and spatial changes in interactions that produced three different community interaction webs. With deer, community webs were complex, having numerous direct and indirect interactions. Removing deer simplified the community web, changed outcomes of interactions, and reduced open space and herbaceous plant densities. Finally, changes in Ceanothus morphology without deer allowed woodrats to browse these shrubs, with negative impacts on Ceanothus growth and survival. General field observations also showed that all three alternative interaction webs occurred naturally at our fieldsite, varying across space and over time. Long-unburned chaparral communities browsed by deer maintain high biological diversity, but maintenance of this diversity involves many key direct and indirect biotic interactions.

AB  - Animals can be important vectors of nutrient transfer within and across landscapes, with important implications for ecosystem productivity and composition. While it is presumed large ungulates are agents of nutrient dispersal via movement and activity, research analyzing their net effects on landscapes remains scarce. We present an individual-based model that investigates how caribou affect the distribution of nutrients on a landscape through consumption only, as well through the cumulative effects of consumption and nutrient deposition (i.e. fecal waste and carcass deposition). We explored these dynamics in simulations that altered the context of environments, either initially containing heterogeneous or homogeneous nutrient distributions, animal densities and sociality of caribou behavior. In the consumption-only simulations, caribou density and sociality created different patterns of heterogeneity at both the landscape and local scale depending on the initial landscape conditions. In these simulations, caribou populations crashed at high densities because the lack of animal deposition resulted in low resources across the landscape. This was not the case when considering the cumulative effects of consumption and deposition, indicating the return of nutrients from animals may be important for population stability. Additionally, in simulations considering the cumulative effects of caribou, increasing caribou density increased landscape heterogeneity irrespective of the initial condition (i.e. heterogeneous and homogeneous landscapes), and maintained or increased local heterogeneity in heterogeneous and homogenous landscape, respectively. Importantly, in all simulations the net impact of caribou at the individual patch level was extremely variable, suggesting that animal inputs are highly varied throughout the landscape. Our results indicate the movement of large ungulates such as caribou can increase the heterogeneity of available nutrients within a landscape and provide an important feedback for population stability. Thus, the loss of large ungulates from natural ecosystems via anthropogenic activity is likely to result in less heterogeneous natural landscapes.

AB  - Cattle grazing profoundly affects abiotic and biotic characteristics of ecosystems. While most research has been performed on grasslands, the effect of large managed ungulates on forest ecosystems has largely been neglected. Compared to a baseline seminatural state, we investigated how long-term cattle grazing of birch forest patches affected the abiotic state and the ecological community (microbes and invertebrates) of the soil subsystem. Grazing strongly modified the soil abiotic environment by increasing phosphorus content, pH, and bulk density, while reducing the C:N ratio. The reduced C:N ratio was strongly associated with a lower microbial biomass, mainly caused by a reduction of fungal biomass. This was linked to a decrease in fungivorous nematode abundance and the nematode channel index, indicating a relative uplift in the importance of the bacterial energy-channel in the nematode assemblages. Cattle grazing highly modified invertebrate community composition producing distinct assemblages from the seminatural situation. Richness and abundance of microarthropods was consistently reduced by grazing (excepting collembolan richness) and grazing-associated changes in soil pH, Olsen P, and reduced soil pore volume (bulk density) limiting niche space and refuge from physical disturbance. Anecic earthworm species predominated in grazed patches, but were absent from ungrazed forest, and may benefit from manure inputs, while their deep vertical burrowing behavior protects them from physical disturbance. Perturbation of birch forest habitat by long-term ungulate grazing profoundly modified soil biodiversity, either directly through increased physical disturbance and manure input or indirectly by modifying soil abiotic conditions. Comparative analyses revealed the ecosystem engineering potential of large ungulate grazers in forest systems through major shifts in the composition and structure of microbial and invertebrate assemblages, including the potential for reduced energy flow through the fungal decomposition pathway. The precise consequences for species trophic interactions and biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships remain to be established, however.

AB  - Old growth forests are increasingly rare but important carbon sinks which harbour rich biodiversity. Chronic browsing by the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is a threat to the sustainability of the services provided by these forests, particularly in northern temperate forests where deer numbers have increased in recent decades (driven by stricter hunting rules and reduced predation) and necessitating local monitoring of vegetation responses. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of deer exclusion on tree regeneration dynamics and soil nutrients in an old growth Carolinian forest. This was performed using exclusion fencing and tip-up mounds at McMaster Forest Nature Preserve and the Sheelah Dunn Dooley Nature Sanctuary in Hamilton Ontario. Tree regeneration was surveyed from thirty 1 m x 1 m quadrats within exclusion plots and another thirty quadrats from deer-browsed areas adjacent to the exclusion plots. Soil samples were taken from each quadrat to analyze browsing impacts on nitrate, phosphate and soil organic matter. Red oak (Quercus rubra) was planted at the top and base of tip-up mounds of varying heights and widths and monitored for deer access and browsing activity. Results show a significantly higher density of woody plants within exclosures compared to non-exclosures (p = 0.0089) and twice more abundance of highly palatable species within the exclosures. However, species richness (p > 0.05) and diversity (p > 0.05) were minimally impacted by deer browsing, showing a resilient old growth forest. Soil nitrate was consistently higher in the non-exclosures, while phosphate was consistently higher within deer exclosures. Finally, more seedlings survived at the top of mounds than the bases, showing the potential of tip-up mounds to be a natural method of deer exclusion and a critical avenue for restoring over-browsed forests.

AB  - Herbivores moderate grazing is a fundamental driver of plant diversity maintenance in grassland ecosystems. However, the effects of grazing with different herbivores on plant community composition and recruitment are still little known. Here, we conducted a field moderate grazing experiment to examine the effects of different grazing modes under moderate intensity in the cold season, including sheep grazing (SG), yak grazing (YG), and mixed grazing by sheep and yak (MG), on plant community composition and recruitment. Results showed that all grazing modes significantly decreased plant cover and average height of standing plant litter. Additionally, herbivores grazing significantly increased species richness but decreased community evenness (P < 0.05), with highest richness and evenness found in YG and SG plots, respectively. The trends of increasing aboveground biomass of common and rare species groups were most pronounced in the SG plots relative to the YG and MG plots. MG promoted the increasing of the common species group. From community recruitment, moderate grazing increased the sexual recruitment and decreased the asexual recruitment, and MG significantly inhibited the recruitment of asexual seedlings. Meanwhile, all grazing modes increased the species of poor palatability. These findings imply that the cold-season grazing with moderate intensity facilitated a rapid divergence succession of alpine meadow community by regulating the relative abundance of common and rare species, as well as the asexual seedlings recruitment induced by the removal of standing plant litter. Consequently, the coldseason grazing with different herbivores under moderate intensity can be used as a management tool to modulate grassland community structure and maintain species diversity in alpine grassland ecosystem.

AB  - Central Europe's temperate forests are heavily shaped by centuries of human activity. Their natural vegetation, mainly consisting of beech-dominated (Fagus sylvatica) deciduous forests, has been widely replaced by more profitable species grown outside of their natural ranges. This has strongly influenced forest-dwelling communities. Necessary adaptations to changing climatic conditions and the increasing demand for forest ecosystem multifunctionality are reversing these shifts in tree species composition. Integrative approaches that seek to balance production and conservation goals promote mixed forests of beech with spruce (Picea abies), pine (Pinus sylvestris), or oak (Quercus spp.). These mixed forests more closely resemble the natural vegetation and have reduced vulnerability to disturbances compared to coniferous monocultures, but higher commercial value compared to pure beech forests. However, our understanding of how different levels of admixture of commercially relevant tree species to beech forests affect multi-trophic diversity and community composition remains limited. We investigated herbaceous plants, fungi, oribatid mites, springtails, true bugs, beetles, birds and bats in 41 mature forest stands differing in tree species composition. We assessed the effects of admixtures on abundances and alpha and gamma diversity, i.e. the total number of species per forest type, and a measure of multidiversity by comparing reference beech stands with stands containing varying proportions of admixed species. At the plot level, the proportion of admixtures was especially important regarding oak and pine. Increasing shares of oak positively affected birds, true bugs and herbivorous beetles. Increasing shares of pine benefitted herbivorous true bugs and understory plants but negatively affected other true bugs, bats, and litter-decomposing fungi. Spruce admixture resulted in higher saproxylic beetle and bird diversity. At the landscape level, admixture significantly increased gamma diversity in plants, mycorrhizal and litter decomposing fungi and herbivorous and saproxylic beetles. Only springtail gamma diversity decreased in the presence of admixture. Admixture also significantly altered community composition for six out of 13 taxa. Indicator species were found for all forest types, and seven species groups included species significantly associated with pure beech stands. Our results indicate that forestry decisions determine forest biodiversity across trophic levels via tree species composition, combining habitat heterogeneity effects and tree species-specific associations. Even low shares of admixed species affect local abundances and diversity. By displacing some species while benefitting others, admixing also alters community composition. This study provides a basis for estimating how altering tree species composition in Central European forests changes the diversity and composition of forest communities.

AB  - The American bison (Bison bison) is a species that strongly interacts with its environment, yet the effects of this large herbivore on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) have received little study. We documented bison breaking the stems of aspen saplings (young aspen >2 m tall and =5 cm in diameter at breast height) and examined the extent of this effect in northern Yellowstone National Park (YNP). Low densities of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis) after about 2004 created conditions conducive for new aspen recruitment in YNP's northern ungulate winter range (northern range). We sampled aspen saplings at local and landscape scales, using random sampling plots in 87 randomly selected aspen stands. Across the YNP northern range, we found that 18% of sapling stems had been broken. The causal attribution to bison was supported by multiple lines of evidence: (1) most broken saplings were in areas of high bison and low elk density; (2) saplings were broken in summer when elk were not foraging on them; (3) we directly observed bison breaking aspen saplings; and (4) mixed-effects modeling showed a positive association between scat density of bison and the proportion of saplings broken. In a stand heavily used by bison, most aspen saplings had been broken, and portions of the stand were cleared of saplings that were present in previous sampling in 2012. Bison numbers increased more than fourfold between 2004 and 2015, and their ecosystem effects have similarly increased, limiting and in some places reversing the nascent aspen recovery. This situation is further complicated by political constraints that prevent bison from dispersing to areas outside the park. Thus, one important conservation goal, the preservation of bison, is affecting another long-term conservation goal, the recovery of aspen and other deciduous woody species in northern Yellowstone.

AB  - Lumpy skin disease is a transboundary, emerging and a notifiable disease of cattle with huge economic impacts throughout the globe. In recent years, the disease has also been reported in Indian Gazelle, Camel, Banteng, Gaur, and Giraffe. This report provides an insight into the occurrence of LSD in red serow (Capricornis rubidus), a globally vulnerable wild goat-antelope from Mizoram, India. The pathological findings observed in the affected red serow have suggested severe acute systemic disease. The occurrence of LSD was confirmed by detection of p32, GPCR, RP030 genes of LSDV in various tissue samples. Phylogenetic analysis of RPO30 and GPCR genes have identified the circulating strain in lineage 1.2 and the sub-lineage 1.2 KSGP O-240. Detection of LSDV in this new wild species has serious implications for both the conservation of red serow and the epidemiology of the disease.

AB  - The Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve encompasses a heterogeneous landscape which provides numerous ecosystem services. Semi-natural grasslands provide forage for traditionally managed livestock and are important sources of nectar and pollen for pollinators. However, these services are not evenly distributed due to different biotic and abiotic constraints of the fjord landscape, which stretches from flat coastal areas to steep hills and mountains inland. We studied how geographic location and grazing livestock type affect the plant species richness, plant functional group composition, nectar and forage resources of these grasslands. We recorded plant species percentage cover in 30 fields in the Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve grazed by sheep, goats or cattle, and from these data we calculated indicator values for forage and nectar resource using species index values from existing trait databases. Sites grazed by cattle had significantly different plant functional group compositions than sites grazed by sheep or goats, independent of geographical location. Forage resource indicator values were lower at coastal sites grazed by sheep. We found a weak but significant positive correlation between nectar resource indicator value and plant species richness, as well as between nectar and forage resource indicator values. Type of livestock and geographical location are not the only factors influencing provisioning services in semi-natural grasslands. Nonetheless, traditional grazing maintains ecosystem service delivery even in low-productive coastal areas. Forage resource, nectar provision and plant species richness appear to be bundled, providing clear guidance for managing ecosystem services in Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve's valuable cultural landscapes.
   Challenges for the assessment of ecosystem services across the Nordhordland UNESCO Biosphere Reserve: the Nordhordland Biosphere Reserve (BR) has a unique heterogeneous landscape with semi-natural grasslands in coastal and fjord areas grazed by different livestock types (sheep, goats, cattle).From one dataset to three indicators: we collected plant species data from these grasslands, from coast and fjord, grazed by sheep, goats or cattle. We generated 3 indicators: plant species richness, nectar resource and forage provision services.Farmer management implication choices: farmers adapting management to their environment and to available resources on their fields help to preserve diversity and BR cultural landscape value. There was very high between-site variation in indicator scores, even between sites with the same livestock species.This low-intensity grazing system offers ecosystem services synergies: correlations between richness and nectar, and forage value and nectar, imply 'bundling' rather than tradeoffs between ecosystem service delivery.

AB  - The extinction of megafauna, such as rhinos, from tropical Asian forests may have detrimental effects on the regeneration of plant species that rely heavily on their dispersal services. Understanding the potential of other animals to substitute the ecological function of megafauna is important for predicting ecosystem change following declines or extirpation of megafauna. Anthropogenic activities have led to the presence of domestic bovids in many tropical habitats, and these animals could be capable of substituting seed dispersal roles of megafauna. Here, we conducted feeding trials, germination tests, and collected movement data on greater one-horned rhino ( Rhinoceros unicornis) ) and domestic bovids ( Bos primigenius; Bubalus bubalis) ) in the national parks of Chitwan and Shuklaphanta, Nepal. Our aim was to investigate whether domestic bovids can serve as effective substitutes for rhinos in dispersing the megafaunal-fruited Mallotus nudiflorus, , which are specialized for rhino dispersal. Specifically, we assessed the long-distance seed dispersal capabilities of rhinos and bovids by combining gut passage times and movement patterns. Additionally, we compared the seed germination success rates among rhinos, bovids and other dispersal modes (e.g., deer and water dispersal). We found that rhinos dispersed 80 percent of seeds over distances greater than 1 km, with potential dispersal distances of up to approximately 5.4 km within their maximum gut passage time. In contrast, cattle dispersed 20 percent of seeds over 1 km, with a maximum distance of around 2.2 km, while buffaloes dispersed 15 percent of seeds over 1 km, with a maximum distance of around 1.4 km. Seeds consumed by rhinos exhibited similar or better germination rates compared to seeds retrieved from cattle and buffalo dung, as well as other dispersal modes. These findings indicate that rhinos provide a functionally unique dispersal service for this megafaunal fruit, especially in long-distance dispersal. While domestic bovids can partially substitute the seed dispersal functions of rhinos, they cannot fully compensate for the loss of seed dispersal that occurs with the disappearance of rhinos.

AB  - Questions Does clear-cutting intended to boost regeneration of abandoned secondary forests lead to an irreversible shift to non-forest vegetation under high deer density? Location Warm-temperate forests in Boso Peninsula, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Methods We designed a factorial experiment including two levels of forest canopy treatment (clear-cutting or intact canopy) and two levels of herbivory control (presence or absence of deer) using 24 plots of 10 m x 10 m. Vegetation dynamics occurring under each experimental treatment were tracked for 7.5 years. Results Ground vegetation under the closed canopy did not change significantly for 7.5 years both inside and outside the deer fences. However, plots were rapidly covered by early-seral plants till 1.5 years after the cutting event. The quick growth of ground vegetation after clear-cutting was supported by plants that are known to have soil seed banks, as suggested by their ubiquity immediately after clear-cutting. Species richness of ground vegetation was maximized at that time and gradually decreased afterward, suggesting biological filtering. This filtering process worked differently inside and outside the deer fences, resulting in different types of vegetation. The clear-cut-and-fence plots became dominated by tree recruits that will recover secondary forests in the future. Contrastingly, vegetation outside the fences lacked many species (e.g., common tree species) that were found inside the fences and became dominated by shrubs and plants unpalatable to deer. This post-cutting vegetation outside the fences was not similar to that inside the deer fences at any seral stage. This means that the vegetation outside the fences could be tracking an alternative successional trajectory rather than a case of arrested succession. Conclusions Here, abandoned secondary forests still seem to maintain a high regeneration potential that would be triggered by clear-cutting, but reducing herbivory pressure by deer is necessary to avoid the risk of alternative successional trajectories.

AB  - The tree diversity-productivity relationship is key to effective forest restoration and management; however, it remains unclear what role foliar chemical diversity and interactions between trees and their enemies play in driving this relationship. Trees produce chemical metabolites in their leaves that impact herbivory and pathogen infection. If trees alter the diversity of metabolites they produce when grown in more diverse communities, this could impact interactions with herbivores and pathogens. Ultimately, these tropic interactions with plant enemies, mediated by chemical diversity, could be important drivers of diversity-productivity relationships. Using a large-scale tree diversity experiment, we used a focal tree sampling design from 14 species across a gradient of tree species richness to assess the role of foliar chemicals and trophic interactions in the diversity-productivity relationship. We used untargeted metabolomics to measure foliar phytochemical diversity, monitored tree-enemy interactions, including foliar fungal pathogens, caterpillar communities and deer browsing, and modelled their relationship to tree growth using path analysis. We unravelled significant evidence for top-down mediation of the diversity-productivity relationship driven primarily by herbivores rather than foliar pathogens and contrasting effects of foliar chemical diversity on different enemy types. Individual trees growing in more diverse communities had higher phytochemical diversity and higher caterpillar richness, but lower leaf fungal pathogen richness. Leaf phytochemical diversity was positively associated with caterpillar richness and fungal pathogen richness, but negatively associated with browsing by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Path analysis revealed that phytochemical diversity, caterpillar richness, insect damage and deer damage-but not foliar pathogens-all mediated positive indirect effects of tree richness on tree growth rate. Synthesis. We highlight the significant mediation of diversity-productivity relationships via contrasting effects of phytochemical diversity on plant-enemy interactions. Ultimately, our study underscores the importance of incorporating trophic interactions into biodiversity-ecosystem function studies.

AB  - As climate change intensifies and demand for timber rises, forest disturbances are increasing. Disturbances in forests cause an abrupt loss in canopy cover and increase resource availability on the ground, which can have manifold effects on the habitat quality of forest-dwelling species. One pathway through which disturbances influence habitat quality is by creating edges within forests. Disturbance-created edges differ from edges to other land cover types in that they are transient, that is, they persist only for a limited period of time until canopy closes again. While the effects of permanent edges are well-studied in ecology, the role of transient edges remains largely unclear. Here, we investigated whether edges caused by forest disturbances affect the individual fitness of two contrasting ungulates by examining the body mass of 378,602 roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and Alpine chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra rupicapra) yearlings collected between 1992 and 2019 in the Eastern Alps. Transient edges had a significant positive effect on the body mass of both species. The effect size was larger for chamois than for roe deer, with yearling body mass increasing by up to 0.18 kg in female chamois for each 10 m ha(-1) increase in edge density. Elevation modulated the effect of edges on chamois body mass, with a weaker effect of transient edges in high-elevation forests that are naturally more open. The effect duration of transient edges was longer for roe deer than for chamois, lasting for up to 9 years post-disturbance. The body mass effect of transient edges created by forest disturbances was an order of magnitude stronger than the effect of permanent edges between forests and other land cover types. Synthesis and applications: Increasing forest disturbances under climate change could improve the fitness of ungulates, potentially affecting forest recovery through browsing. Managers and hunting authorities should consider the effect of disturbances and dynamically changing carrying capacity of forest landscapes more explicitly when making decisions regarding habitat management and hunting policies. Such a dynamic perspective is an important element in balancing vital ungulate populations and healthy forest ecosystems.

AB  - Aim The synergy between human land use and climate change is accelerating the global decline of biodiversity. In the fragile Himalayas, this trend has a strong ecological impact on wildlife communities, and a better understanding is needed to discern changes in the mechanisms. This study aims to understand the effects of land use and climate change on the functional (FD) and phylogenetic diversity (PD) of mammal and bird communities across the land use gradient. Location Eastern Himalayan biodiversity hotspot, Bhutan. Methods Mammal data were gathered from a camera trap survey and bird data from point counts. We used morphological and ecological traits of 45 mammal species and 336 bird species to construct functional trait space. We quantified FD and PD using standardized effect size of functional richness, functional dispersion, mean pairwise distance and mean nearest taxon distance. We used linear regression to evaluate the relationship between FD and PD and land use/climate variables. Results The functional space of mammals was structured by body mass (small-large) and diet (herbivore-carnivore) as one major axis, and habitat breadth (generalist-specialist) as the other, whereas bird functional space was structured by beak shape and size (large and long-small and short), body mass (small-large), foraging strata (canopy-ground) and diet (ectotherm-scavenge) along four axes. Land use (agriculture and road) negatively affected mammal FD, whereas both land use (tree cover and built-up area) and climate (temperature and precipitation) affected PD, although the effects were highly variable. Climate (temperature) had a pronounced negative effect on bird FD while land use (agriculture, built-up area and settlement) on PD. Main conclusions The realized functional space of the vertebrate groups can be represented by different planes on which species are clumped around a small number of functional strategies. The loss of species at the edge of functional space is non-random and could result in the loss of irreplaceable traits impacting long-term ecological and evolutionary processes. Our study demonstrates the filtering effect of anthropogenic pressure and climate change on vertebrate FD and PD. However, the association with land use suggests the potential for ecosystem services (particularly by birds). Our findings reveal nuances of dimensions of biodiversity and provide novel insights into the structure and drivers of vertebrate assemblages in the eastern Himalayas.

AB  - Most tundra carbon flux modeling relies on leaf area index (LAI), generally estimated from measurements of canopy greenness using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to estimate the direction and magnitude of fluxes. However, due to the relative sparseness and low stature of tundra canopies, such models do not explicitly consider the influence of variation in tundra canopy structure on carbon flux estimates. Structure from motion (SFM), a photogrammetric method for deriving three-dimensional (3D) structure from digital imagery, is a non-destructive method for estimating both fine-scale canopy structure and LAI. To understand how variation in 3D canopy structure affects ecosystem carbon fluxes in Arctic tundra, we adapted an existing NDVI-based tundra carbon flux model to include variation in SFM-derived canopy structure and its interaction with incoming sunlight to cast shadows on canopies. Our study system consisted of replicate plots of dry heath tundra that had been subjected to three herbivore exclosure treatments (an exclosure-free control [CT], large mammals exclosure), and a large and small mammal exclosure [ExLS]), providing the range of 3D canopy structures employed in our study. We found that foliage within the more structurally complex surface of CT canopies received significantly less light over the course of the day than canopies within both exclosure treatments. This was especially during morning and evening hours, and was reflected in modeled rates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP). We found that in the ExLS treatment, SFM-derived estimates of GPP were significantly lower and NEE significantly higher than those based on LAI alone. Our results demonstrate that the structure of even simple tundra vegetation canopies can have significant impacts on tundra carbon fluxes and thus need to be accounted for.

AB  - Global climate change and overgrazing have led to the degradation of natural grasslands and seriously threaten the diversity of grassland plant species, as plant species richness is very sensitive to natural grassland degradation. Therefore, we conducted a sheep grazing experiment in Zinniquan pasture on the northern slope of Xinjiang Tianshan Mountains to test the effects of grazing on plant species diversity in natural grasslands through the spatial and temporal characteristics of the foraging behavior of grazing sheep and the plant species composition on the grazing trajectories. Data on sheep grazing tracks were collected based on GPS, vegetation composition around the tracks was investigated and seeds were collected from sheep manure to determine germination rates by simulating rumen fistula uptake tests in sheep. We found that sheep grazing can bring seeds from agricultural fields to grow on natural grasslands, causing changes in plant species diversity and community structure. The results of this study provide new insights into natural grassland species restoration and offer a range of new strategies that can be applied to the management of natural grassland plant ecological restoration.

AB  - As one of the most important ecosystems, grassland ecosystems maintain an abundance of flora and fauna, and provide humans with rich resources. The structure and function of most grassland ecosystems around the world have been significantly affected by human activity. The overgrazing of livestock and their feces has caused grassland degradation and flora and fauna losses. However, we know little about the relationship between grassland degradation, livestock feces and the arthropod community. In this study, we conducted surveys of the epigeic arthropod community in alpine grassland of the Zoige wetlands in eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. We used ANOVA, multiple linear regression and model-averaging to explore how grassland degradation and livestock feces affected epigeic arthropods community. We found that together grassland degradation and season differently affected taxonomic richness, abundance and different feeding groups of the epigeic arthropod community. Because of the influence of temperature on the epigeic arthropod, the taxonomic richness and abundance of epigeic arthropod community fluctuated dramatically among seasons. Epigeic arthropod community diversity had a significant positive correlation with plant height of all species and Compositae percentage cover in most levels of degradation. The amount of sheep feces had a significant negative correlation with taxonomic richness and abundance of the epigeic arthropod community, because overgrazing sheep reduces the availability of resources and the suitability of micro-habitats for epigeic arthropods. Our study found that moderate levels of disturbance can increase the richness and abundance of epigeic arthropod community over a short period of time.

AB  - Human activities have significantly altered over three-quarters of the Earth's land surface, intensifying in the last century and threatening remaining ecosystems with ongoing land use changes and climate change. In Chile's Mediterranean zone, habitat degradation and climate change pose severe threats to biodiversity, particularly affecting endemic tree species with recalcitrant seeds, such as Beilschmiedia miersii, which can face recruitment limitations due to changing environmental conditions and prolonged droughts. This study aims to determine if soil and site-specific conditions at B. miersii population sites limit seed germination and establishment. The study used Lens culinaris as a surrogate bioindicator species to assess soil conditions and their effects on germination and growth. We used laboratory-based experiments and statistical models to analyze the influence of biotic and abiotic factors, including soil nutrients, vegetation cover, and climatic changes. The study's findings indicate that soil conditions at the examined sites do not pose significant limitations to germination and plant growth. This suggests that the studied sites retain the potential for recruitment, despite the observed variations in soil and site conditions. The results imply that other factors, such as historical climate changes and herbivory, may be impeding recruitment success. While further research is needed to identify the specific factors hindering recruitment and develop effective conservation strategies, this study provides valuable insights into the potential limitations affecting B. miersii recruitment. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple environmental factors beyond soil conditions when addressing recruitment challenges in threatened species.

AB  - Aim Climate warming and increasing human disturbance are expected to promote non-native plant invasions in mountain ecosystems. Although biological invasions are also expected to be modulated by biotic interactions, it is still not clear how invertebrate herbivores can affect plant invasion dynamics. Using a large manipulative experiment, we aimed at testing: (1) the effect of soil disturbance and elevation on native and non-native plant communities, and (2) the effect of plant-herbivore interactions, nitrogen deposition, and elevation in driving plant establishment after soil disturbance.
   Location European Alps, NE Italy.
   Taxon Vascular plants.
   Methods We selected remote, uninvaded dry semi-natural grasslands along the core elevational range of non-native plants in the European Alps (c. 100-1300 m) and manipulated soil disturbance, nitrogen deposition, and invertebrate herbivory. Then, we followed the natural establishment under real field conditions of both native and non-native plants over one growing season. We used generalized mixed-effects models to test the effects of the experimental treatments.
   Results Native and non-native species showed contrasting responses to soil disturbance and elevation. Low elevations and disturbance promoted non-native success, while affecting native species diversity negatively. Two-thirds of the experimental sites acquired novel non-natives after disturbance. Most of the observed non-natives were not present in the surrounding vegetation as mature plants, indicating that propagules were able to reach even remote natural areas. While current N deposition levels did not affect plant establishment, we found that after disturbance invertebrate herbivory might play an important role in facilitating non-native invasions by reducing native cover.
   Main conclusions Our findings show that highly resistant ecosystems such as continuous grasslands can be easily invaded once the resident vegetation has been removed, and that natural herbivory pressure from invertebrates might amplify the negative effects of disturbance on resident native species irrespective of elevation. Together, these results indicate increasing risks of future plant invasions on mountains under global change.

AB  - Mountain ungulates perform a key role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems as they are the primary consumers of vegetation and prey for large predators. The mountain ranges of northern Pakistan are home to six species of mountain ungulates, and the Himalayan ibex (Capra sibirica), hereafter ibex, is the most abundant among them. This study was conducted in three adminis-trative regions of northern Pakistan, viz. Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), to generate a range-wide density pattern map of ibex. A double -observer survey was conducted in 25 study sites during 2018-2021 across the ibex distribution range, covering an area of about 35,307 km2, by walking transects totaling 1647 km. Within the ibex range where the survey was not conducted due to financial and logistical constraints, we obtained species population information from local wildlife departments' most recent annual survey data. The aim was to generate a density map for the entire ibex range. Using the BBRe-capture package in program R, we estimated an ibex population of 7639 (95 % CI) with a mean density of 0.21/km2 in the surveyed area. Combining with the secondary data from un-surveyed areas, the total population estimate for the country came to 10,242 ibex. The largest population densities were observed in four valleys (Shimshal, Gulkin-Hussaini, Khyber, and Khunjerab) of the Karakoram-Pamir range, followed by the Hindu Kush range (Chitral Wildlife Division [WD]). The central and eastern parts of the Karakoram range had moderate to low densities, while the Himalayan range (e.g., Astore Valley) supported a small population. The mean herd size was 15 individuals (range: 5-41), and the average detection probability of observers A and B was 0.69 and 0.48, respectively. The average male and young ratios per 100 females were estimated to be 75 and 81, respectively. The range-wide density map developed during the study provided an evidence for the impact of trophy hunting programs and an objective tool for range-wide con-servation planning of the species.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions account for much of the biodiversity observed in an ecosystem. Plants may alter defense expression dependent on the specific herbivore present. Many studies focus on the optimization of these defenses against a single herbivore, but in an ecological context, there may be a myriad of herbivores at any given time. We designed a study to examine defenses employed by swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor) against insects and large mammals. We established six deer exclosures with trees located inside and outside each exclosure. Outside the exclosures, physical constraints only allow deer to feed up to a browseline on trees, whereas insects can potentially access all portions of the tree. Trees inside exclosures were only accessible to insect herbivores. Furthermore, insecticides were applied to half of the exclosures to create insect-free (i.e., insecticide applied), deer-free (i.e., inside exclosures), deer-only (i.e., outside exclosures with insecticide), and herbivore-free (i.e., inside exclosures with insecticide) environments. This design allowed us to analyze simultaneous defensive responses of individual trees to mammal and insect herbivores. We predicted that because insects represent a continuous threat, plants should invest in fixed concentrations of defenses (e.g., polyphenols, tannins, and condensed tannins), even when deer are absent. When deer are present, plants should increase investment in defenses in tissues that deer have access to. We found that plant defense strategies varied spatially on individual trees. When only insects were present, nutritional constituents (e.g., nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates) did not change but antinutritional constituents increased. Contrastingly, when deer were present, both nutritional and antinutritional constituents decreased. We found a decrease in insect functional group diversity when deer were present. Our findings suggest that plants may partition defense strategies depending on the most prominent herbivore pressure. However, changes in insect functional group diversity may result from either changes in plant defense strategy or intraspecific competition among multiple herbivores. Future studies should investigate patterns of chemical heterogeneity displayed by plants in response to diverse herbivore pressures.

AB  - Globally, subalpine and alpine plant communities are receiving increasing attention owing to disproportionately rapid warming at high altitudes, and the resultant habitat shrinkage leaving high-altitude specialists with nowhere to migrate. The Hawaiian subalpine zone (1,700-3,000 m) is an interesting example of this potential phenomenon because of the high endemism. We analyzed plant species richness, cover, and density from 89 plots (1,000 m(2)) sampled in 2010-2018 across two volcanic mountains, Haleakala on Maui, and Mauna Loa on Hawai'i. Most of the 139 plant species recorded were non-native (55%), with the remainder endemic (31%) and indigenous (14%). Plot-level richness differed from gamma diversity, with endemic species more abundant than non-native species. Non-native species richness was higher on Haleakala than Mauna Loa. These communities are patchy with low-lying (< 1 m) vegetation, and lower cover on younger drier Mauna Loa (36%) than Haleakala (54%). Density was largely consistent with the understory cover data, with endemic Vaccinium reticulatum (>3,500/ha) and indigenous Leptecophylla tameiameiae (>2,430/ha) shrubs dominant on both volcanoes. Woodland communities were encountered only on Mauna Loa, with endemic trees Metrosideros polymorpha on wetter, south aspects, and Sophora chrysophylla on the drier, leeward side. Hawaiian subalpine vegetation varies among islands, volcanoes, and aspects, yet remains largely native-dominated, though with increasing threats from climate change, invasive non-native species, and wildfire. We recommend continued monitoring of biotic communities and climate in this sensitive zone, in situ physiological studies for the native matrix species, stricter non-native species biosecurity and sanitation protocols, wildfire prevention, and improved documentation of the effects of feral ungulates.

AB  - Grazing herbivores may affect soil microbial communities indirectly by impacting soil structure and vegetation com-position. In high arctic environments, this impact is poorly elucidated, while having potentially wide-reaching effects on the ecosystem.This study examines how a key arctic herbivore, the muskox Ovibos moschatus, affects the soil microbial community in a high arctic fen. Environmental DNA was extracted from soil samples taken from grazed control plots and from muskox exclosures established 5 years prior. We sequenced amplicons of the 16S rRNA gene to provide insight into the microbial communities. We found that in the grazed control plots, microbial communities exhibited high evenness and displayed highly similar overall diversity. In plots where muskoxen had been excluded, microbial diversity was significantly reduced, and had more uneven intra-sample populations and overall lower ecological richness and even-ness. We observed that the composition of microbial communities in grazed soils were significantly affected by the pres-ence of muskoxen, as seen by elevated relative abundances of Bacteroides and Firmicutes, two major phyla found in muskox faeces. Furthermore, an increase in relative abundance of bacteria involved in degradation of recalcitrant carbo-hydrates and cycling of nitrogen was observed in grazed soil. Ungrazed soils displayed increased abundances of bacteria potentially involved in anaerobic oxidation of methane, whereas some methanogens were more abundant in grazed soils. This corroborates a previous finding that methane emissions are higher in arctic fens under muskox grazing. Our results show that the presence of large herbivores stimulates soil microbial diversity and has a homogenizing influence on the inter-species dynamics in soil microbial communities. The findings of this study, thus, improve our understanding of the effect of herbivore grazing on arctic ecosystems and the derived methane cycling.

AB  - The frequency of severe wildfires is on the rise in the Mediterranean Basin as a result of climate change and land abandonment. Recurrent wildfires may retard or impede ecosystem recovery, frequently requiring the implementation of restoration practices. In that context, a post-fire deer exclusion experiment was conducted in a Mediterranean mixed forest ecosystem with high population densities of deer species (Fallow deer and Red deer). A deer exclusion area was established as a form of restoration intervention to promote post-fire vegetation recovery. We surveyed plant species during the second and third springs after fire in both deer-excluded and deer-allowed areas in order to detect changes in the community. We analyzed the plant species composition, species diversity, and structure of herbaceous and woody plant communities. We also compared the frequency of annual and perennial herb species, functional groups, and post-fire plant regeneration strategies. The main differences were due to differences between springs rather than of deer-excluded and deer-allowed plots. Deer consumed both woody and herbaceous species, favoring the assemblage of herbaceous over woody species. Deer favored the establishment of annual forbs, including unpalatable and/or exotic species, while limiting the abundance of graminoids. Observed deer impacts could have been magnified during the second spring by a drought. Our study demonstrates that deer exclusion can be an effective restoration practice for promoting post-fire herbaceous regeneration in forests with significant densities of wild ungulates, although seasonal effects may override restoration practice effects.

AB  - Contemporary and predicted declines in tree species diversity and forest resilience have prompted renewed interest in even-aged systems and/or site preparation to overcome bottlenecks to tree recruitment or facilitate range expansion of future-adapted species. The impact of this intensification on the herbaceous layer in forests traditionally managed with uneven-aged systems, however, is unclear, especially for uncommon dispersal limited species with heterogenous distributions. We leveraged a large-scale experiment (the Northern Hardwood Silvi-cultural Experiment to Enhance Diversity) to investigate the response of Trillium cernuum L., a somewhat un-common and heterogeneously distributed non-clonal herb in our study system, to a gradient of canopy removal and soil disturbance. We monitored 16 small populations from 2015 (the year prior to treatment) to 2019 (3 -years post treatment). Our results suggest that initial population size and stage structure were inextricably coupled with T. cernuum response. Independent of treatment, T. cernuum abundance and flowering generally increased over time commensurate with initial population size. Moreover, our study highlights the confounding effect of deer herbivory, which increased significantly following treatment. Collectively, our findings suggest that T. cernuum populations were resilient to canopy disturbance associated with single-tree selection and shelter-wood harvests and the levels of scarification applied as part of our study. Higher levels of site impact or other site preparation methods such as herbicides will likely have greater impacts and warrant further investigation. Our results also suggest that directly monitoring populations of interest may be necessary to quantify treatment ef-fects for uncommon and/or heterogenous species that are missed with common plot-based sampling designs or of conservation concern.

AB  - The urgent need to preserve ecosystems over vast areas has placed rewilding with wild herbivores to the forefront. However, there are still few scientific experimental field studies dealing with its effects on biodiversity and ecosystem services. Since 1993, in France, a socially natural population of wild horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) has been managed for its conservation. This introduction is an opportunity to compare this new management system with the multi-secular extensive sheep breeding and the more recent conventional domestic horse breeding. We sought to discover if plant communities show differences depending on the grazers and the managing system. We surveyed 208 plots divided into six grazed sites (two sites per type of grazer), where all plants species and their percent cover were listed within 1m2, and environmental variables - such as stones percent cover, slope - were measured within 100m2. To focus on the grazer effects, we used a subsample of plots with similar environmental variables. To study the grazing system - management choices - effects, we ran the analyses using all the plots. At both scales, our results show that species richness, evenness and heterogeneity are significantly higher with wild horses than with sheep grazing. Intermediate value is measured for evenness concerning domestic horses at the grazing system scale. Species richness is significantly higher for domestic horses than sheep focusing on the grazer; intermediate values are measured for evenness and heterogeneity. At both scales, wild horses also favour dicots rather than monocots. Our results indicate that grazing by horses maintains and promotes grassland diversity, especially when horses are managed 'as wild' - allowing them to express their natural behaviour. However, further studies are needed focusing on populations of patrimonial plant species over time, other taxonomical groups and/or on functional diversity and ecosystem services to compare and test more finely the effects of an animal bred extensively and 'as wild'.

AB  - Overbrowsing by ungulates has degraded understory vegetation in worldwide forests. Understory degradation causes soil erosion and environmental degradation, causing mature tree decline. Although ungulate exclosure fences are installed to protect vegetation, their effectiveness in preventing tree decline associated with soil degradation remains unclear. We aimed to fill this gap on slopes of Mt. Shiraga, Japan, where sika deer have overbrowsed for >20 years. Tree-ring records in 1960-2022 for eight beeches per each of inside and outside fences were analyzed to compare stem basal area increment (BAI, cm(-2) yr(-1)) and trend change timings for BAI (i.e., break-point). Soil properties, exposed root height (ERH) as cumulative soil erosion index, and intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) as water limitation proxy were also compared. Compared with areas inside fences, areas outside fences had no understory vegetation, higher ERH, and higher soil hardness and moisture. BAI outside fences turned their growth trend from positive to negative since 2004, but not inside fences. Break-point of BAI outside fences matched the understory degradation period in the field. The long-term BAI trend (i.e., regression slope of BAI) after the break-point was negatively related to ERH but not to soil properties (e.g., soil hardness and moisture). Furthermore, BAI outside fences was negatively related to iWUE after the break-point, whereas BAI inside fences was not. These results indicate that the maintenance of understory by fencing prevents overbrowsing-associated mature tree decline through mitigating root exposure and related water limitation, despite the potential of water competition with understory.

AB  - Soil phototrophic microbes play key roles in many ecosystem functions, including nutrient cycling, water absorption and retention, substrate weathering and soil stabilization, as well as colonization and persistence of other organisms. Knowledge about the diversity and biomass of soil phototrophs remains limited, especially in tropical forests and savannas. Here, we investigate changes in the diversity and abundance of soil phototrophs across the 4-km elevation gradient on Mt. Cameroon, Africa, from tropical forests (0-2300 m) to treeless savanna (2300-3600 m) and afroalpine vegetation (3600-4000 m). We evaluated the role of soil chemistry and vegetation cover in shaping phototrophic diversity patterns using soil, tree and herb census data from 224 permanent plots. Cyanobacteria from Chroococcales accounted for 65% of the species richness and > 70% of the biovolume. The highest phototrophic diversity and biovolume were recorded in treeless savanna and afroalpine vegetation, and lowest values in mid-elevation tropical forests with dense understory vegetation and hence limited light availability. Higher diversity and biovolume of soil phototrophs were associated with less productive, well-illuminated soils with lower organic matter and nitrogen content and higher pH, phosphorus and cation content. Changes in microbial richness and biovolume across tropical forests showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with higher values recorded in coastal and lowland forests up to 1000 m elevation, the lowest values in the mid-elevation open-canopy forests with dense understory vegetation caused by disturbances of forest elephants and higher values again in montane forests between 1800 and 2200 m. Above the tree line, soil phototrophic biovolume also showed a U-shaped elevation pattern, with lower richness recorded in compact grasslands between 2700 and 3400 m. At lower-elevation savanna, soil phototrophs are indirectly supported by regular fires during the dry season, which reduces plant cover and increases soil phosphorus and cations, while barren lava fields at higher elevations around the summit support soil phototrophs directly via increased soil P and K content and indirectly by inhibiting plant growth and vegetation cover. Our results shed light on an overlooked part of soil biodiversity in major tropical ecosystems and uncover the role of various ecological filters in structuring phototrophic microbial communities in tropical soils.

AB  - Rapid climate warming has contributed to significant changes in Arctic and boreal vegetation over the past half century. Changes in vegetation can impact wildlife by altering habitat and forage availability, which can affect behavior and range use. However, animals can also influence vegetation through foraging and trampling and therefore play an important role in determining ecosystem responses to climate change. As wildlife populations grow, density-dependent processes can prompt range expansion or shifts. One mechanism for this is density-dependent forage reduction, which can contribute to nutritional stress and population declines, and can also alter vegetation change trajectories. We assessed the range characteristics of a migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) herd in east-central Alaska and west-central Yukon Territory as it grew (1992-2017) then declined (2017-2020). Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between caribou relative spatial density and vegetation change over this period using remotely sensed models of plant functional type cover. Over this period, caribou population density increased in all seasonal ranges. This was most acute in the calving range where density increased 8-fold, from 1.5 to 12.0 animals km-2. Concurrent with increasing density, we documented range shifts and expansion across summer, post-calving and winter ranges. In particular, summer range size doubled (12,000 km2 increase) and overlap with core range (areas with repeated year-round use) was halved. Meanwhile, lichen cover, a key forage item, declined more in areas with high caribou density (2.4% absolute, 22% relative decline in cover) compared to areas where caribou were mostly absent (0.3% absolute, 1.9% relative decline). Conversely, deciduous shrub cover increased more in high caribou density areas. However, increases were dominated by less palatable shrubs whereas more palatable shrubs (i.e., willow [Salix spp.]) were stable or declined slightly. These changes in vegetation cover were small relative to uncertainty in the map products used to calculate change. Nonetheless, correlations between vegetation change and caribou range characteristics, along with concerning demographic trends reported over this same period, suggest changing forage conditions may have played a role in the herd's subsequent population decline. Our research highlights the potential of remotely sensed metrics of vegetation change for assessing the impacts of herbivory and trampling and stresses the importance of in situ data such as exclosures for validating such findings.

AB  - Grazing and browsing by large ungulates can have a strong effect on habitat composition and structure. Associated effects can be reduction in the abundance of palatable tree species and alter understory properties, thereby affecting habitat complexity. Changes in habitat structure and complexity can in turn affect arthropod predation pressure, as arthropod predators are strongly influenced by habitat characteristics. This may be increasingly important in production forests, as such systems are often more vulnerable to disturbances such as pest insects. However, studies exploring this indirect link between ungulates and predation rate are sparse. We explore this link through the comparison of fenced plots excluding ungulates (for four years) with associated control plots replicated in 16 forest stands covering a large geographical area. We measured vegetation characteristics to assess the effect of exclusion on habitat structure. We used plasticine models to compare predation rates in fenced and control plots on pine trees. In addition, we sampled herbivorous insects to explore the potential relationship between predation and herbivore abundance. We could only demonstrate a weak effect of browser exclusion on habitat structure, suggesting that the time of exclusion was too short to cause a vegetation response. In terms of arthropod predation, we found that predation was positively affected by understory cover, but not related to herbivore abundance. Understory properties such as species composition and biomass has been demonstrated to be affected by ungulates in other studies. Therefore, we propose that ungulate browsing -despite weak effects of browsing exclusion in our study -can affect arthropod predation via changes in the understory, which could potentially affect pest populations. Our study is one of the first attempts to connect effects of mammalian browsing to changes in predation rates on herbivorous insects.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The forests of Southeast (SE) Asia support large ungulate species listed as globally threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature 's Red List. In Thailand, Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary (HKK) still contains the endangered banteng ( Bos javanicus ) and the vulnerable gaur ( Bos gaurus ) and sambar ( Rusa unicolor ). These species have been declining for decades in SE Asia. HKK is within the core area of the Western Forest Complex, one of the largest protected forest landscapes in SE Asia. This area is one of the few remaining that have the capacity to support species recovery for large ungulates and the tiger that depend on them. However, critical knowledge gaps remain on ungulate population metrics and trends of the species. In 2021, we revisited the locations surveyed in 2007 -2008 and used distance sampling methodology to estimate density and abundance of banteng, gaur, and sambar. Using 32 transects in 2007, 2008 and 2021, we conducted replicated sample surveys with a total walk-efforts of 1,000 km per year and collected Distance-sampling data on target species. Banteng density increased two-fold from 0.91 +/- 0.40 -1.71 +/- 0.79 individuals/km 2 , and sambar density doubled from 2.03 +/- 0.51 -3.99 +/- 0.95 individuals/km 2 . In 2021, HKK supported 2,736 +/- 1,264 banteng and 9,855 +/- 2,347 sambar, the largest populations of these two globally threatened species in SE Asia. These results indicate evidence for recovery of large ungulate species in HKK and hope for the conservation of these globally threatened species. Our results illustrate the value of HKK as an important tiger recovery site in SE Asia, as these species are primary prey for tigers and underscore the value of ongoing efforts to eradicate poaching.

AB  - Management of tree cover, either to curb bush encroachment or to mitigate losses of woody cover to over-browsing, is a major concern in savanna ecosystems. Once established, trees are often "trapped" as saplings, since interactions among disturbance, plant competition, and precipitation delay sapling recruitment into adult size classes. Saplings can be directly suppressed by wildlife browsing and competition from adjacent plants, and indirectly facilitated by grazers, such as cattle, which feed on neighboring grasses. Yet few experimental studies have simultaneously quantified the effects of cattle and wildlife on sapling growth, particularly over long time scales. We used a series of replicated 4-ha herbivore-manipulation plots to investigate the net effects of wildlife and moderate cattle grazing on Acacia drepanolobium sapling growth over 10 years that encompassed extended wet and dry periods. We also simulated more intense cattle grazing using grass removal treatments (0.5-m radius around saplings), and we quantified the role of intraspecific tree competition using neighborhood tree surveys (trees within a 3-m radius). Wildlife, which included elephants, had a positive effect on sapling growth. Wildlife also reduced neighbor tree density during the 10-yr study, which likely caused the positive effect of wildlife on saplings. Although moderate cattle grazing did not affect sapling growth, grass removal treatments simulating heavy grazing increased sapling growth. Both grass removal and neighbor tree effects on saplings were strongest during above-average rainfall years following drought. This highlights that livestock-driven reductions in grass cover and catastrophic wildlife damage to trees during droughts present a need, or an opportunity, for targeted management of sapling growth and woody plant cover during ensuing wet periods.

AB  - Invasive plant species can have significant, adverse effects on forest ecosystems. By outcompeting native species for resources, invasive species suppress the richness and diversity of many forest communities. This study focuses on the associations of Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii Rupr.) with spring flora in Raven Run Nature Sanctuary in Lexington, Kentucky, where abundant L. maackii threatens native biodiversity. Plots were surveyed for percent herbaceous groundcover and abundance of flowering spring flora at three levels of L. maackii density (high, low, and no L maackii). Results indicate that L. maackii abundance is associated with lower species richness, abundance, and early-season diversity of flowering native spring flora. Importantly, this study extends the existing robust literature evaluating the widespread effects of L. maackii to the Kentucky River Palisades, a sensitive and botanically important corridor in central Kentucky.

AB  - The simultaneous agricultural conversion of North American prairies and removal of native megagrazers-primarily bison (Bison bison)-has limited our understanding of how bison impact prairie plant communities. Further obscuring the role of native megagrazers is that, in what little prairie remains, either grazers are absent or domestic cattle are dominant. We used a three-decade experiment to assess how fire frequency and reintroducing bison affected upland tallgrass prairie plant communities and their phylogenetic diversity (PD). Grazing and fire shifted plant communities significantly over time. The ungrazed treatment was a largely static community dominated by four grass species, with occasional forbs and subshrubs. In contrast, community composition in the bison treatment shifted dramatically, with increasing abundance of native forbs, subdominant grasses, and small annual plant species. Compared to ungrazed areas, bison treatments had 225 % more unique species, 125 % more unique plant families, and higher richness within common plant families such as Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Poaceae. Cattle-grazed communities fell between these two treatments with higher abundance and richness of Carex spp. Most treatments had similar, unchanging PD values over time, except annually burned, ungrazed prairie, where PD steadily declined. All treatments were resistant and/or resilient to an extreme drought in 2011 and 2012, with no lasting changes in composition or PD before, during or after the drought. This resistance to change emphasizes the importance of the core grassland plant species to maintain functional group composition. Grazing and fire drove shifts in tallgrass prairie plant communities, which were resilient to extreme drought.

AB  - Wildfires are a key driver of boreal forest structure and community composition that alter food resources affecting the behaviour and ecology of wildlife. In the first 50 years post-wildfire, woody browse availability in upland forests increase in quantity and quality for generalist ungulates, such as moose (Alces alces) and whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Greater favorable habitat for these generalist ungulates results in increases to their respective populations, and through apparent competition, leads to increases in wolf populations; thus, causing unsustainable levels of predation on threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations. However, the duration of post-wildfire browse availability is not well understood in the Boreal Plains of Alberta as previous studies are primarily from the Taiga and Boreal Shield where vegetation communities are structurally different. This study examines the changes in winter browse richness, evenness, abundance, and community composition, as well as their use (browse levels) by moose and white-tailed deer, over a 150-year post-wildfire period. In the summer of 2019, we collected vegetation and ungulate browsing data from 164 upland and lowland forest sites in northeastern Alberta, Canada. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and ordinal logistic regression to examine changes in browse measures. Species richness and evenness showed a double peak at 10?25 years and 90 years post-wildfire in mixedwood forests, as a result of fluctuations in browse palatability, while browse abundance was constant. In contrast, black spruce and lowland forests had similar species richness, evenness and abundance over the 150-year chronosequence. However, browse abundance in lowland forests was higher than mixedwood forests, but this consisted of low palatable browse. Browsing was significant in jack pine forests, mixedwood forests and poor fens; coniferous saplings were generally avoided, whereas 35?65% of available deciduous saplings were browsed. Understanding post-wildfire succession and ungulate browsing in post-wildfire forests provides useful information for managing alternative prey populations necessary for long-term woodland caribou conservation.

AB  - Large herbivores often co-occur and share plant resources with herbivorous insects in grassland ecosystems; yet, how they interact with each other remains poorly understood. We conducted a series of field experiments to investigate whether and how large domestic herbivores (sheep; Ovis aries) may affect the abundance of a common herbivorous insect (aphid; Hyalopterus pruni) in a temperate grassland of northeast China. Our exclosure experiment showed that 3 years (2010-2012) of sheep grazing had led to 86% higher aphid abundance compared with ungrazed sites. Mechanistically, this facilitative effect was driven by grazing altering the plant community, rather than by changes in food availability and predator abundance for aphids. Sheep significantly altered plant community by reducing the abundance of unpalatable forbs for the aphids. Our small-scale forb removal experiment revealed an "associational plant defense" by forbs which protect the grass Phragmites australis from being attacked by the aphids. However, selective grazing on forbs by sheep indirectly disrupted such associational plant defense, making P. australis more susceptible to aphids, consequentially increasing the density of aphids. These findings provide a novel mechanistic explanation for the effects of large herbivores on herbivorous insects by linking selective grazing to plant community composition and the responses of insect populations in grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Agents of global change commonly have a higher impact on island ecosystem dynamics. In the Mediterranean region, those dynamics have historically been influenced by anthropogenic impacts, for example, the introduction of invasive species and overharvesting of resources. Here, we analysed the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in sa Dragonera island, which experienced a large environmental change ca. 4000 years ago by the arrival of humans. Anthropogenic impacts, such as herbivory by goats and over-logging, ended in the 1970s, while in 2011 the site became the largest Mediterranean island where rats were eradicated. Invasive rats and goats played the ecological role of two endemic species, the cave goat and the giant dormouse, which inhabited the island for more than 5 million years and were rapidly extinct by humans. We used Landsat imagery to explore NDVI as a proxy of vegetation productivity over the years 1984-2021, orthophotos to assess changes in land and vegetation covers and historical plant inventories to study the dynamics in plant diversity. Results showed that those indicators steadily increased both in spring and in summer, while the noise around the trends was partially explained by climate variability. The regime shifts in the temporal dynamics of vegetation productivity suggested a transient from a perturbed to a non-perturbed stable state. Trends in successional dynamics, spatial self-organization and plant diversity also showed the same type of transient dynamics. Historical perturbations related to harvesting (mainly the synergies between goat browsing, burning and forest over-logging) were more important than rat eradication or the influence of climate to explain the vegetation dynamics. Our study shows the transient nature of this small island ecosystem after 4000 years of perturbations and its current path towards vegetation dynamics more controlled by ecological interactions lacking large herbivores and omnivores, drought dynamics and the carrying capacity of the island.

AB  - Across Japan, populations of Sika deer (Cervus nippon) have grown rapidly over recent decades, and Odaigahara has particularly high densities of Sika deer. In Odaigahara, this overpopulation has led to changes in stream flow and riparian landscapes, with formerly diverse communities of dwarf bamboo growing increasingly homogenous. Lower-layer vegetation (Sasamorpha borealis, Sasa nipponica, bryophytes) that had covered Odaigahara disappeared, the number of trees of higher-layer vegetation decreased, and the landscape changed from a humid, dense landscape to a bright, homogenous landscape. Vegetation plays an important role in the succession of benthic invertebrates in streams. In this study, we examined changes in the benthic invertebrate assemblages of Odaigahara and related them to vegetation history. In 2006, there were fewer individuals and genera of benthic invertebrates than in 1983. Benthic invertebrate composition also differed from 1983 and the degree of difference varied by stream basin. The abundance of Ephemeroptera (e.g. Drunella spp.) was decreased and of Plecoptera (e.g. Sweltsa spp.) was increased. Over the same period, lower-layer vegetation and humidity decreased while temperature increased; these factors also likely contribute to the observed changes to benthic invertebrate assemblages.Implications for conservation: The forests of Odaigahara are still subject to complex factors such as sika deer, human activities and global environmental changes. Comparison of current and historical benthic invertebrate communities will help to identify the restoration goals for the forest ecosystems necessary for benthic invertebrate communities. Proper management of deer and conservation of remnant vegetation, including rhizomes, in the Odaigahara will contribute to the maintenance of the present and future benthic invertebrate community.

AB  - Changing climatic conditions and unsustainable land use are major threats to savannas worldwide. Historically, many African savannas were used intensively for livestock grazing, which contributed to widespread patterns of bush encroachment across savanna systems. To reverse bush encroachment, it has been proposed to change the cattle-dominated land use to one dominated by comparatively specialized browsers and usually native herbivores. However, the consequences for ecosystem properties and processes remain largely unclear. We used the ecohydrological, spatially explicit model EcoHyD to assess the impacts of two contrasting, herbivore land-use strategies on a Namibian savanna: grazer- versus browser-dominated herbivore communities. We varied the densities of grazers and browsers and determined the resulting composition and diversity of the plant community, total vegetation cover, soil moisture, and water use by plants. Our results showed that plant types that are less palatable to herbivores were best adapted to grazing or browsing animals in all simulated densities. Also, plant types that had a competitive advantage under limited water availability were among the dominant ones irrespective of land-use scenario. Overall, the results were in line with our expectations: under high grazer densities, we found heavy bush encroachment and the loss of the perennial grass matrix. Importantly, regardless of the density of browsers, grass cover and plant functional diversity were significantly higher in browsing scenarios. Browsing herbivores increased grass cover, and the higher total cover in turn improved water uptake by plants overall. We concluded that, in contrast to grazing-dominated land-use strategies, land-use strategies dominated by browsing herbivores, even at high herbivore densities, sustain diverse vegetation communities with high cover of perennial grasses, resulting in lower erosion risk and bolstering ecosystem services.

AB  - Questions: Herbivores change plant communities and biogeochemical cycles by changing species composition and soil organic matter contents through different mechanisms. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of livestock removal on plant species composition and soil organic matter stocks in savannas of the R & iacute;o de la Plata grasslands. Locations: A subtropical savanna in R & iacute;o Negro, Uruguay. Methods: The experiment consisted of a paired grazing exclusion randomized block design with five sites, where livestock was excluded for 29 years. We recorded differences in plant species composition in different strata and extracted soil cores to analyze soil carbon and nitrogen stocks, and delta(13) carbon contents in two different soil organic matter fractions. Results: Long-term livestock removal reduced plant species richness and diversity, altered the floristic composition and facilitated native-shrub encroachment. Grazing exclusion modified the relative frequency of plant functional types and reduced summer-growing grasses. We recorded 45 species common to both grazing and exclosure treatments, while 19 were present only in exclosure sites and 39 only in grazed sites. Livestock exclusion had a differential effect on soil organic matter formation, increased soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in the mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) but tended to slightly reduce them in the particulate organic matter fraction (POM). Grazing removal modified the C-3/C-4 species cover and these differences were reflected in the delta C-13 contents of both POM and MAOM fractions. Conclusions: Removal of domestic herbivores increased shrub abundance, decreased plant species richness and diversity but increased total carbon and nitrogen contents in soil organic matter. Our results suggest that grazed and exclosure areas should be combined mosaically in the landscape to maximize plant species diversity and soil organic carbon sequestration.

AB  - Aoudad (Ammotragus lervia), native to northern Africa, were introduced as exotic game animals to the Chihuahuan Desert in West Texas, USA, and have become invasive. Aoudad and bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) are adapted to rugged terrain in arid climates, and both persist in desert regions with low primary productivity and limited perennial water availability, which suggests potential for competition for food and water resources. Aoudad are highly adaptable, which could make them more resilient to a changing environment with extreme conditions, providing a competitive edge over bighorn sheep. To evaluate the potential for exploitative competition between invasive aoudad and endemic desert bighorn sheep, we used genetic metabarcoding to assess diet composition using fecal samples collected from adults of each species in the Sierra Vieja Mountains in West Texas. We collected 32 composite samples from aoudad and 27 composite samples for bighorn sheep and identified 88 genera consumed. Bighorn sheep and aoudad diets (as inferred by genera) were most different during the warm-wet season (16 June-15 October; Kulczynski similarity index = 0.81) and most similar during the warm-dry season (16 February-15 June; Kulczynski similarity index = 1.05). During the warm-wet season, the 2 herbivores tended to consume different genera, suggesting the possibility of resource partitioning, with less likelihood of resource partitioning during the warm-dry season when forage was more limited and diets were similar. Diet diversity, measured by Shannon's diversity index, did not vary substantially between species, but for aoudad it was highest during the warm-wet season (1.1 +/- 0.0.1 [SE]) and lowest during the cool-dry season (16 October-15 February, 0.9 +/- 0.0.1). For bighorn sheep, diet richness was highest during the cool-dry season (1.1 +/- 0.2) and lowest during the warm-dry season (0.8 +/- 0.10). Bighorn sheep may specialize on high-quality forage species, particularly during the warm-wet season, while aoudad have a more generalist foraging strategy, although temporal windows for increased competition for food resources likely occur. Aoudad are well-adapted to low-quality forage and arid climates, which could increase their competitive ability and compromise bighorn sheep conservation efforts in areas of sympatry.

AB  - Invasive species such as vertebrate herbivores cause threats to native ecosystems through causing changes to vegetation composition and structure, competition, ecosystem engineering, impacts on soil, and through spreading disease. In the mountainous country of Australia, Sambar Deer (Rusa unicolor) are becoming an increasing threat to fragile and endangered ecosystems, which are also facing other significant threats such as climate change. Methods for ameliorating these impacts are currently limited to lethal control programmes through shooting or fencing key areas. Fencing is not a viable option for large areas and can have large logistical costs as well as negative ecological outcomes. This study aimed to compare two shooting methods (ground shooting vs thermally assisted aerial culling with thermal image operator) for controlling sambar at low densities in a mountainous area. This programme was the first to use this specific thermal technique for deer in mountainous country in Australia. We found that thermally assisted aerial culling was more effective for removing Sambar than ground shooting. Thermally assisted aerial culling removed more Sambar in total, shot more animals per hour, covered a larger search area, was cheaper per hectare covered, and had very high "seen", "targeted", and "shot" ratios. Ground shooting sessions were lower in cost overall, but the cost per hectare was higher and rate of Sambar shot was lower than that of thermally assisted aerial culling. Ground shooting did remove more Sambar per hectare as ground shooting focuses on a smaller area, but this advantage is outweighed by the fact that thermally assisted shooting also allowed the concurrent removal of Feral Pigs. This work indicates that thermally assisted aerial culling is the preferred method for effective management of Sambar in an alpine environment. Ground shooting may be beneficial when Sambar are concentrated in key areas or to complement initial knock down by thermally assisted aerial culling.

AB  - Restoration of plains bison (Bison bison bison) in the northern Great Plains has been controversial for a variety of reasons, including the public concern that bison will supplant cattle on public rangelands. Riparian zones are among the most biologically rich areas within rangelands, but they are highly sensitive to disturbances such as grazing, leading to the public perception that riparian vegetation communities will be negatively impacted by year-round bison grazing compared with the norm of seasonal cattle grazing. Our objective was to evaluate the vegetation community and soil compaction conditions of areas in the northern Great Plains of Montana, where bison have been restored 5 -10 yr as year-round grazers, compared with adjacent sites where cattle have been retained as seasonal grazers. Out of the 24 variables we assessed, only 2 significantly differed between the grazer treatments within our study's time frame and stocking rates. Native species diversity was significantly higher in the bison-grazed treatment (F [1,1,5.98] = 8.16, P = 0.03), and woody height heterogeneity was twice as high in the bison-grazed treatment than the cattle-grazed treatment (F [1,5.97] = 5.81, P = 0.05). Although longer-term studies are required, our findings indicate that year-round bison grazing under the current stocking rates did not degrade riparian vegetation communities compared with seasonal cattle grazing and rather benefitted some aspects of the plant community.

AB  - There is widespread concern that cessation of grazing in historically grazed ecosystems is causing biotic homogenization and biodiversity loss. We used 12 montane grassland sites along an 800 km north-south gradient across the UK, to test whether cessation of grazing affects local alpha- and beta-diversity of below-ground food webs. We show cessation of grazing leads to strongly decreased alpha-diversity of most groups of soil microbes and fauna, particularly of relatively rare taxa. By contrast, the beta-diversity varied between groups of soil organisms. While most soil microbial communities exhibited increased homogenization after cessation of grazing, we observed decreased homogenization for soil fauna after cessation of grazing. Overall, our results indicate that exclusion of domesticated herbivores from historically grazed montane grasslands has far-ranging negative consequences for diversity of below-ground food webs. This underscores the importance of grazers for maintaining the diversity of below-ground communities, which play a central role in ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Feral hogs modify ecosystems by consuming native species and altering habitat structure. These invasions can generate fundamentally different post-invasion habitats when disturbance changes community structure, ecosystem function, or recovery dynamics. Here, we use multiple three-year exclusion experiments to describe how feral hogs affect hyper-productive brackish marshes over time. We find that infrequent yet consistent hog foraging and trampling suppresses dominant plants by generating a perpetually disturbed habitat that favors competitively inferior species and disallows full vegetative recovery over time. Along borders between plant monocultures, trampling destroys dominant graminoids responsible for most aboveground marsh biomass while competitively inferior plants increase fivefold. Hog activities shift the brackish marsh disturbance regime from pulse to press, which changes the plant community: competitively inferior plants increase coverage, species diversity is doubled, and live cover is lowered by 30% as large plants are unable to take hold in hog-disturbed areas. Release from disturbance does not result in complete recovery (i.e., dominant plant monocultures) because hog consumer control is a combination of both top-down control and broader engineering effects. These results highlight how habitats are susceptible to invasive effects outside of structural destruction alone, especially if large consumers are pervasive over time and change the dynamics that sustain recovery.

AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) vegetation structure is vital in maintaining the functions of forest ecosystems and species diversity. Temperate forests of Northeast Asia support a variety of fauna but is also affected by large herbivore disturbances or management practice (e.g., livestock grazing), resulting in varying degrees of habitat degradation and fragmentation in many areas. However, traditional methods lack the quantification of 3D vegetation structure at a fine scale, which makes it difficult to obtain complete and accurate detailed data on the multi-level structure below the canopy and limits our understanding of the impact of disturbance on habitat quality and species diversity. In this study, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data were used to quantify the 3D habitat structural characteristics of different stand types affected by forest management or large herbivore activities (deer-browsed forest, livestock-grazed forest, secondary forest, and mixed forest) in Northeast China. TLSderived parameters in this study revealed the subtle changes of habitat structures below the canopy: 1) livestock-grazed forest had a much lower canopy height, tree number, and stem volume than that of the other stand types; 2) the vegetation area index (VAI) of low canopy height (0-5 m) in livestock-grazed forest and deerbrowsed forest were significantly lower than those in secondary and mixed forest with less disturbance; 3) intensive large herbivores activities led to the larger understory gaps and visibility in livestock-grazed and deerbrowsed forest. TLS-derived parameters in this study are implicated in wildlife habitat selection and fitness, which contribute to revealing fine scale habitat structure-species diversity relationships. In forest management, it is proposed to use TLS to quantify the structural and functional attributes of habitats from a new perspective, thus guiding conservation practices at local scale to balance the relationship between plants and animals.

AB  - Grazing and global change (e.g., warming, nitrogen deposition, and altered precipitation) both contribute to biodiversity loss and alter ecosystem structure and functioning. However, how grazing and global change interactively influence plant diversity and ecosystem productivity, and their relationship remains unclear at the global scale. Here, we synthesized 73 field studies to quantify the individual and/or interactive effects of grazing and global change factors on biodiversity-productivity relationship in grasslands. Our results showed that grazing significantly reduced plant richness by 3.7% and aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) by 29.1%, but increased belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) by 9.3%. Global change factors, however, decreased richness by 8.0% but increased ANPP and BNPP by 13.4% and 14.9%, respectively. Interestingly, the strength of the change in biodiversity in response to grazing was positively correlated with the strength of the change in BNPP. Yet, global change flipped these relationships from positive to negative even when combined with grazing. These results indicate that the impacts of global change factors are more dominant than grazing on the belowground biodiversity-productivity relationship, which is contrary to the pattern of aboveground one. Therefore, incorporating global change factors with herbivore grazing into Earth system models is necessary to accurately predict climate-grassland carbon cycle feedbacks in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Introduced ungulates have a profound impact on Hawaiian ecosystems yet are also considered a valuable resource for recreational and subsistence hunting. These conflicting values have led to challenging issues for resource managers. Distribution assessments allow resource managers to simultaneously prioritize areas for targeted removal for conservation benefit while also maintaining or even promoting hunting opportunities in other areas. This study identified distribution trends for three introduced ungulate species, wild pigs ( Sus scrofa), black-tailed deer ( Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), and feral goats ( Capra hircus) on the island of Kaua'i in the Hawaiian Islands. Using species distribution modeling techniques, we aimed to identify patterns in ungulate distributions across ecosystems and time, and potential species interactions. Data were collected using motion activated cameras deployed across the entire island of Kaua'i from July 2020 to July 2021. Wild pigs were the most frequently detected species, observed at 53 out of 59 locations, followed by black-tailed deer at 30 locations, and feral goats at 9 locations. Distribution models indicate some degree of competition between deer and pigs and show considerable overlap between black-tailed deer distribution and much of the last remaining critical habitat for threatened and endangered native species. Our results suggest that pigs prefer mid-elevation areas with moderate rainfall while goats preferred arid areas regardless of slope and elevation. Differences in the distribution and abundance of these species highlight the divergent impacts invasive ungulates have on native ecosystems throughout the Hawaiian Islands and may help identify high priority areas for their management.

AB  - Temperatures over the Arctic region are increasing at three times the rate of the global average. Consequently, Arctic vegetation is changing and trees are encroaching into the tundra. In this study, we examine the establishment and growth of mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa), which forms the treeline in subarctic Europe, and its impact on community composition across the treeline ecotone nearby Abisko, Sweden. Birch advancement along elevational gradients was studied by comparing data collected in 2016 with data collected 10 and 15 years previously. Species identity, cover, and phylogenetic relatedness were used to assess the impact of birch encroachment on community composition. Our results show that birch occurrence above the treeline did not affect plant community composition, probably owing to the observed lack of significant growth due to herbivore browsing, nitrogen limitation, or a reduction in snow cover. Independent of birch performance, the tundra community structure shifted toward a novel community dissimilar from the forest plant community found below the treeline. Taken together, our findings are explained by species-specific responses to climate change, rather than by a linear forest advance. Future treeline advancements are likely more restricted than previously expected.

AB  - Aim: Livestock production is among the main anthropogenic disturbances in seasonally dry tropical forests. However, its effects on plant functional composition in dry forests is poorly understood. Our goal was to analyze the variation in both functional composition and functional diversity of plant communities under goat grazing and at different ages of fallow in a tropical dry forest. Location: Brazilian dry forest (Caatinga) in Rio Grande do Norte State, northeastern Brazil. Methods: We measured the height, leaf area, and specific leaf area of all shrub-tree and herbaceous species along a gradient of stocking rate, years of grazing, and age of fallow. Additionally, we quantified the foliar contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, and tannins in the tree shrub layer. We tested the effects of grazing and deforestation using linear mixed models. Results: Our findings suggest that the functional diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga is not altered when goat grazing and secondary succession are examined independently. However, the interaction of both factors has affected the functional diversity, particularly in the herbaceous layer. Although grazing influenced specific traits in the shrub-tree layer, the overall functional diversity remained unaltered by grazing, succession, or their interaction. Conclusions: Grazing does not interfere with the natural succession process nor diminish the functional diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga. Therefore, with appropriate management, grazing can coexist with the conservation goals of the Caatinga.

AB  - AimAnthropogenic effects, for example, urbanisation, induce environmental stressors that often result in biodiversity loss, with significant implications for ecosystem services. In particular, the decline in insect biodiversity can reduce essential services such as pest suppression or food web disruption in urban areas. Potentially, the impact of urbanisation may differ between above- and belowground insect communities. This is because the two groups may be influenced by different abiotic and biotic factors. However, this remains unclear to date.LocationKorea.MethodsWe investigated the consequences of landscape changes and urbanisation factors, for example, increased temperature, impervious surfaces, building density, and changes in vegetation cover, on the diversity and functional group of aboveground and belowground insects. We used sweeping methods to sample aboveground insects, while belowground insects were collected using the sifting method and Berlese funnel. We also collected environmental and insect diversity data from urban areas with varying population densities and analysed the correlational patterns between the degree of urbanisation and insect richness and abundance.ResultsDespite varying urbanisation levels, overall insect species richness and abundance remained relatively stable across the studied landscapes. Aboveground insects showed no relationship with urbanisation, while belowground communities exhibited declining species richness and abundance. Notably, belowground generalist and specialist species richness showed opposite patterns. Belowground predator insect species richness and abundance suffered most from urbanisation, while aboveground herbivorous insect abundance increased.Main ConclusionThis study highlights the disproportionate impact of urbanisation on belowground insect communities compared to aboveground communities. These findings can inform the development of targeted conservation strategies that safeguard insect diversity during urban planning initiatives, promoting healthy and resilient urban ecosystems.

AB  - Land-use change for crop production is one of the key drivers of habitat loss and fragmentation and consequently biodiversity loss and change in tropical regions. This may impact biodiversity-regulated ecosystem services; birds are important to crop health regulating services (e.g. seed dispersal, pest control) and disservices (e.g. seed predation, grain herbivory). However, knowledge is limited on how birds use heterogeneous agricultural landscapes and the consequences for spatial distribution and flow of services and disservices. We studied crop and non-crop-habitat associations of birds in forest-agricultural landscapes of the Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. We focused on dietary preference as a key trait impacting bird responses to land-use change, services, and disservices to crops. We surveyed birds across four main habitat types using repeated point counts, recording a total of 148 species. We found that crop habitats supported higher species richness and larger communities of potentially beneficial species to crop health, whereby 34.5% of invertebrate-feeding species were recorded in cropland. We found that habitat heterogeneity within the landscape supports bird functional diversity and that each habitat type supported unique communities of species. Furthermore, the number of species unique to forest habitats increased with increasing forest canopy closure. Our findings suggest that management strategies for maintaining trees and shrubs, and enhancing tree cover within the crop production landscape, can be effective approaches for maintaining bird diversity and services. However, in-depth studies on trade-offs with disservices need further exploration to mitigate negative impacts of birds on crop yields.

AB  - Earth's tropical savannas typically support high biomass of diverse grazing herbivores that depend on a highly fluctuating resource: high-quality forage. An annual wet-dry cycle, fire and herbivory combine to influence forage quality and availability throughout the year. In the savannas of northern Australia, a depauperate suite of large native (marsupial) herbivores (wallaroos [Osphranter spp.] and the agile wallaby [Notamacropus agilis]) compete for resources with non-native large herbivores introduced in the late nineteenth century, particularly bovines (feral and managed cattle [Bos spp.] and feral water buffalo [Bubalus bubalis]) that now dominate the landscape. Anecdotal reports of recent population declines of large macropods and negative impacts of bovines highlight the need to better understand the complex relationship between forage, fire and abundance of native and introduced large herbivores. The pyric herbivory conceptual model, which posits complex feedbacks between fire and herbivory and was developed outside Australia, predicts that native and introduced large herbivores will both respond positively to post-fire forage production in Australian savannas where they co-occur. We used grazing exclosures, forage biomass and nutrient analyses and motion-sensor camera-trapping to evaluate the overall robustness of the pyric herbivory model in the Australian context, specifically whether forage quantity and quality are impacted by herbivory, season and fire activity, and which forage attributes most influence large grazing herbivore abundance. Forage quantity, as measured by live, dead and total herbaceous biomass and proportion of biomass alive, was higher inside herbivore exclosures, even at relatively low densities of herbivores. Forage quality, as measured by fibre content, was not affected by herbivory, however, crude protein content of live herbaceous biomass was greater outside herbivore exclosures. Recent fire was an important predictor of all measures of forage quantity and quality. Recent fire occurrence decreased overall quantity (biomass) but increased quality (decreased fibre content and increased crude protein content); late dry season fires resulted in forage with the highest crude protein content. The predictions of the pyric herbivory conceptual model are consistent with observations of the feeding behaviour of introduced bovines and some large macropods in northern Australian savannas, lending support to the global generality of pyric herbivory in fire-prone grassy biomes.

AB  - Throughout eastern North America, chronic white-tailed deer overbrowsing and widespread exotic plant invasions degrade native plant diversity and abundance. However, because deer densities are high across entire regions, it is challenging to find large areas where deer have been at low density for long periods. We predicted native plant diversity and abundance would be significantly higher during gap-phase regeneration where deer have been maintained at low densities (similar to 7 deer/km(2)) compared to where deer have been chronically overabundant. Simultaneously, we predicted that exotic plant diversity and abundance would be lower in gaps where deer have been maintained at low versus high densities. We also evaluated whether deer density interacts with gap age, gap size, and gaps in dry versus more mesic forest patches. We studied 41 gaps throughout an 88 km(2) fenced military post where deer were maintained near pre-European-settlement densities for 67 years and in nearby forests where deer have been overabundant for decades. Native species richness, diversity, and cover were 37-65% higher, and exotic species cover was 80% lower in canopy gaps at low relative to high deer density. Stem height and density of multiple native canopy tree species (e.g., two Quercus spp.) were 5-20-fold higher within canopy gaps at low deer density. Moreover, 10 native woody species were indicators of low deer density, including three Quercus species, whereas no native woody species were indicators of high deer density. Deer were the primary filter underlying these different patterns in diversity, abundance, and plant height. Our findings demonstrate that gaps develop a vigorous and diverse native sapling layer, with far fewer exotics, in areas of low deer density without a history of chronic overbrowsing. We propose that military posts may be conservation and native plant regeneration hotspots wherever they regularly cull deer.

AB  - The savanna ecosystem is dominated by grasses, which are a key food source for many species of grazing animals. This relationship creates a diverse mosaic of habitats and contributes to the high grass species richness of savannas. However, how grazing interacts with environmental conditions in determining grass species richness and abundance in savannas is still insufficiently understood. In the Kruger National Park, South Africa, we recorded grass species and estimated their covers in 60 plots 50 x 50 m in size, accounting for varying proximity to water and different bedrocks. To achieve this, we located plots (i) near perennial rivers, near seasonal rivers, and on crests that are distant from all water sources and (ii) on nutrient-rich basaltic and nutrient-poor granitic bedrock. The presence and abundance of large herbivores were recorded by 60 camera traps located in the same plots. Grass cover was higher at crests and seasonal rivers than at perennial rivers and on basalts than on granites. The relationship between grass species richness and herbivore abundance or species richness was positive at crests, while that between grass species richness and herbivore species richness was negative at seasonal rivers. We found no support for controlling the dominance of grasses by herbivores in crests, but herbivore-induced microsite heterogeneity may account for high grass species richness there. In contrast, the decrease in grass species richness with herbivore species richness at seasonal rivers indicates that the strong grazing pressure over-rides the resistance of some species to grazing and trampling. We suggest that the relationships between grasses and herbivores may work in both directions, but the relationship is habitat-dependent, so that in less productive environments, the effect of herbivores on vegetation prevails, while in more productive environments along rivers the effect of vegetation and water supply on herbivores is more important.

AB  - Alpine grasslands are vital in regulating carbon balance on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) because of the large soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, while persistent disturbance from the endemic small semifossorial herbivore, plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae, hereafter pika), may break this balance. Pika affect the soil microclimate by creating a heterogeneous underlying surface, which is expected to alter soil microbial communities and eventually SOC stocks. However, our knowledge regarding the potential influence mechanism is still limited. Here, we investigated vegetation biomass, soil properties and soil microbes among 4 different surfaces (i.e., original vegetation, new pika pile, old pika pile and bare patch) of typical alpine grasslands to reveal soil microbial communities and the associated effect on SOC in response to pika bioturbation. Our results showed that pika bioturbation increased both bacterial and fungal diversity and their phyla abundance for SOC decomposition. Vegetation biomass, electrical conductivity and NH4+-N accounted for the variation in both bacterial and fungal community compositions and diversity. SOC stocks were 15-30% lower in pika piles and bare patches than in the original vegetation, which was mainly attributed to the reduced soil organic matter input from vegetation and the enhanced SOC consumption by soil microbial communities. Overall, we conclude that pika bioturbation altered the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities, which was associated with SOC loss and positive carbon feedback in alpine grasslands. Our findings provide insights into the role of small semifossorial herbivores in the carbon cycle of global grasslands.

AB  - The paper evaluates the experience of intentional introduction of mammals into Yakutia. The total of eight alien and one native mammal species were introduced during the period between 1930 and 2020. Two alien species (the muskrat and American mink) naturalized successfully, as well as the reintroduced sable. Introduction of the muskox launched in 1996 has proved successful, and with the proper conservation measures, one can expect a further increase in its abundance and expansion of its range to cover the entire tundra zone of Yakutia. Attempts to introduce the Eurasian beaver, raccoon dog, steppe polecat, and domestic yak have failed. Efforts on the introduction of the wood bison continue, but its reproduction rate and specifics of its winter behavior and feeding habits suggest difficulties in the adaptation to new climate conditions. Intentional introduction of alien species poses a potential threat to ecosystems of the North, particularly from attempting to reconstruct paleofauna by introducing the species characteristic of paleolandscapes rather than recent fauna of the region. In the absence of the comprehensive biological analysis, efforts directed at "increasing the biodiversity" can lead to disturbance of the balance of the northern ecosystems.

AB  - Tallgrass prairies are important habitat for bee pollinators because they provide diverse floral and nesting resources throughout the growing season. Management strategies such as fire and grazing can maintain plant diversity within prairies; however, it is unclear how pollinators, respond to these management practices, and whether all groups of pollinators are affected similarly. In a two-year study, we examined the direct and indirect effects of fire frequency and bison grazing on above-ground (AG) and below-ground (BG) nesting bees through changes in both their floral and nesting resources. We found that overall bee abundance was greater in bison grazed sites but the effect was stronger in the second year of the study. Furthermore, we found that overall bee richness was greater in the second year of the study and that fire and grazing interacted to affect bee community composition. Using structural equation models, we found the mechanisms by which fire and grazing affected bee communities varied by bee nesting strategies. For example, fire and grazing increased the amount of bare ground, which in turn increased BG nesting bee abundance. However, bison-mediated changes in soil compaction increased AG nesting bee abundance and richness. Both fire and grazing impacted forb communities but these changes in floral resources did not translate to changes in bee communities. Because disturbance mediated changes in soil structure influenced both AG and BG bees, our research highlights the need to consider how disturbances influence nesting resources for bee pollinator conservation and habitat restoration.

AB  - The desert steppe is unique as a transition zone from the steppe to the desert of the Eurasian Steppe. The spatial distribution of shrubs and perennial plants has changed due to long-term disturbance caused by overgrazing in the ecosystem. This study aimed to determine the degree of patchiness of shrubs and perennial plants under grazing disturbance, which is of great significance to better understand the succession mechanism of plant community in the desert steppe. This study investigated the spatial distribution of shrubs and perennial plants under four stocking rates (no grazing, CK, 0 sheep center dot hm(-2)center dot half year(-1); light grazing, LG, 0.93 sheep center dot hm(-2)center dot half year(-1); moderate grazing, MG, 1.82 sheep center dot hm(-2)center dot half year(-1); heavy grazing, HG, 2.71 sheep center dot hm(-2)center dot half year(-1)) in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, primarily using geostatistical methods. The density of perennial grasses increased with increasing stocking rate, while its height decreased (except for HG). The density and height of the shrubs and the perennial forbs showed an exponential or gradual decline. The spatial distribution of shrubs and perennial plants is mainly affected by structural factors such as topography, soil parent material, and climate, and the density of shrubs and perennial plants is most sensitive to changes in stocking rate. An appropriate stocking rate increases the spatial heterogeneity of shrubs and perennial plants, but heavy grazing reduces the spatial heterogeneity of shrubs and perennial plants.

AB  - Livestock grazing is one of the most common management practices for grasslands and can greatly affect their biodiversity. However, arthropod diversity response patterns to grazing regimes are difficult to predict. We conducted a short-term grazing exclusion experiment in traditionally managed alkali grasslands in Hungary to investigate differences between grazed and ungrazed vegetation for different arthropod groups. The experiment was laid out in a full factorial design, with twelve 50 x 100 m short-term grazing exclosures in vegetation types with high (alkali wet meadow) and low productivity (alkali steppe). We sampled ground beetles and spiders with pitfall traps and true hoppers by sweep netting. We used vegetation type (wet meadow vs dry steppe), man-agement (grazed vs ungrazed) and their interaction as fixed effects in mixed models. We found higher species richness and activity density of spiders and ground beetles in the more productive wet meadow vegetation, where the community structure of each arthropod group also shifted toward hygrophilous species. Significant interactions between vegetation type and management indicated a dependence of management effects on vegetation types: arthropod community structure shifted towards hygrophilous species in ungrazed meadows, but not in ungrazed steppe sites. True hopper abundance was higher in grazed meadow sites, but lower in grazed steppe sites, compared to ungrazed sites. True hopper community structure shifted toward generalist herbivores in ungrazed sites, regardless of vegetation type. We concluded that vegetation types determine arthropod communities and modulate the effects of grazing on arthropods. Our results suggest that moderate disturbance from low-intensity grazing has a positive or neutral effect in wetter, more productive vegetation, but a negative or neutral effect in drier, less productive vegetation, depending on the arthropod group. Herbivorous insects that dwell on plants are particularly affected by management because they are more susceptible to direct impacts, such as unintentional predation by grazing cattle, and because of asymmetrical competition between mammalian and insect herbivores.

AB  - Nature conservation and restoration in terrestrial ecosystems is often focused on increasing the numbers of megafauna, expecting them to have positive impacts on ecological self-regulation processes and biodiversity. In sub-Saharan Africa, conservation efforts also aspire to protect and enhance biodiversity with particular focus on elephants. However, elephant browsing carries the risk of woody biomass losses. In this context, little is known about how increasing elephant numbers affects carbon stocks in soils, including the subsoils. We hypothesized that (1) increasing numbers of elephants reduce tree biomass, and thus the amount of C stored therein, resulting (2) in a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC). If true, a negative carbon footprint could limit the sustainability of elephant conservation from a global carbon perspective. To test these hypotheses, we selected plots of low, medium, and high elephant densities in two national parks and adjacent conservancies in the Namibian component of the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Area (KAZA), and quantified carbon storage in both woody vegetation and soils (1 m). Analyses were supplemented by the assessment of soil carbon isotopic composition. We found that increasing elephant densities resulted in a loss of tree carbon storage by 6.4 t ha(-1). However, and in contrast to our second hypothesis, SOC stocks increased by 4.7 t ha(-1) with increasing elephant densities. These higher SOC stocks were mainly found in the topsoil (0-30 cm) and were largely due to the formation of SOC from woody biomass. A second carbon input source into the soils was megaherbivore dung, which contributed with 0.02-0.323 t C ha(-1) year(-1) to ecosystem carbon storage in the low and high elephant density plots, respectively. Consequently, increasing elephant density does not necessarily lead to a negative C footprint, as soil carbon sequestration and transient C storage in dung almost compensate for losses in tree biomass.

AB  - Aim: Evaluate the temporal changes in species diversity, composition, and structure of ephemeral plant communities and the seed bank in response to long-term herbivore exclusion over 11 years in plots with and without herbivores.LocationNorth-central Chile.Methods: We obtained information on ephemeral vegetation cover in August and September using the intercept point method and recorded seed abundance in April. The Bosque Fray Jorge National Park Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER) provided these records covering 11 years (2009-2019). From the original experiment of 20 plots, we used eight plots divided into two treatments: four plots allowed free access to all herbivores (with herbivores), while the other four plots excluded herbivores (without herbivores).Results: We found that Hill-Shannon diversity increased in plant communities with herbivores and a temporal increase in the cover of the dominant species, Plantago hispidula, under herbivore exclusion. In wet years, species richness and temporal turnover of plant communities increased independently of treatment. Although seed abundance differed among treatments and years, population structure remained constant over time and among treatments, suggesting that the seed bank acts as a buffer against shocks that modify plant community dynamics. Structural equation modeling revealed that precipitation, via its positive effects on Plantago hispidula, increases native plant richness to a greater extent than herbivores. However, in the absence of herbivores, precipitation directly affects native species richness. Moreover, we found that precipitation also influences the native species richness of the seed bank, both directly and indirectly, although its impacts exhibit a time lag.Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that the temporal dynamics of ephemeral plant communities and seed banks in semi-arid ecosystems are strongly coupled to climate variability, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities to biodiversity loss and climate change.

AB  - This study provides novel insight into herbaceous-layer dynamics across three distinct South African savanna bioregions (Central Bushveld, Lowveld, and Mopane) using a Total Count Quadrat approach to investigate species densities, community composition, diversity, and spatial patterns. A total of 196 unique herbaceous species were recorded across all bioregions. Contrary to typical expectations, our findings reveal no statistically significant differences in overall herbaceous density (ranging from 24.3 +/- 2.31 to 32.0 +/- 1.28 individuals/m(2); F-2,F-6 = 1.89, p = 0.23), species richness (F-2,F-6 = 1.91, p = 0.23), or Shannon diversity (F-2,F-6 = 3.23, p = 0.11) among bioregions, suggesting a more complex interplay of environmental drivers beyond broad climatic gradients. However, there was significant within-bioregion spatial heterogeneity in density, notably in the Central Bushveld (F-2,F-87 = 4.96, p = 0.009) and Mopane (F-2,F-87 = 7.54, p < 0.001) regions, indicating important fine-scale variation, unlike in the Lowveld region (F-2,F-87 = 1.25, p = 0.292). Growth form analysis revealed that forbs consistently dominated species richness across all three bioregions (Central Bushveld: similar to 64%; Lowveld: similar to 70%; and Mopane: similar to 67%) and were also the dominant growth form by density in the Lowveld (54.3%) and Mopane (63.8%) regions. While numerical differences in grass density were observed, no statistically significant difference was found across bioregions (F-2,F-6 = 4.15, p = 0.07). Sedges consistently contributed a small proportion to both species richness and total density. Non-metric multidimensional scaling further revealed patterns of dispersion in herbaceous community compositions between the Lowveld and Mopane regions, with Central Bushveld communities exhibiting greater variability. These findings underscore the critical ecological importance of forbs in South African savannas, not only for biomass but also for driving herbaceous diversity and highlighting the necessity of considering fine-scale spatial variation in future ecological research and conservation strategies.

AB  - Aims: Islands harbor crucial ecosystems that face expressive threats from invasive species, including goats, which have dramatically altered the vegetation dynamics of Trindade Island since their introduction in the 1700s. This study aimed to assess the effects of goats, as a primary biotic factor, alongside many abiotic factors influencing vegetation dynamics over time. Location: Trindade Island, South Atlantic Ocean. Methods: We analyzed vegetation cover changes from 1994 to 2024 using remote sensing data. We also evaluated the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and vegetation cover, and compared vegetation data obtained from fieldwork and remote sensing for 1994 and 2010. Results: A supervised classification approach was applied to identify vegetation types, achieving an overall accuracy of 89% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8. The NDVI analysis explained 77% of the variation in vegetation cover, revealing increases in forest (65.06 ha) and grassland (325.14 ha) by 2024. No significant differences were found between fieldwork and remote sensing data (p > 0.05) for the earlier years analyzed. Although goats had a notable impact on vegetation (D-2 >= 0.75), their influence was amplified by abiotic factors, producing statistically significant correlations (D-2 >= 0.91) in generalized linear models. Incorporating both biotic and abiotic variables yielded models with higher explanatory power. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the complex interplay between goats and abiotic factors shaping vegetation dynamics on Trindade Island. The study highlights the necessity of targeted conservation strategies to mitigate the impact of invasive species on island ecosystems.

AB  - The native bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn) has become increasingly invasive in abandoned or undergrazed Alpine grasslands. Bracken stands are generally assumed to be poor in species, but there is still very little information about the impact on the fauna. We recorded Orthoptera communities of 24 sample plots with varying bracken cover. Compared to plots with only sparse or medium bracken cover, species richness was highly significantly lower in densely overgrown plots, while the former two did not differ markedly. Multivariate ordination analyses revealed gradients with unequal orthopteran communities, showing distinct patterns of bracken cover clustering. Based on indicator values, 13 of 23 Orthoptera species turned out to be significantly or marginally significantly associated with a single bracken cover stratum or a combination of two strata, whereby all nine Red List species were primarily restricted to sparse or medium bracken cover. However, some generalist species were found to favor denser bracken stands, such as Tettigonia viridissima, contributing to the local Orthoptera beta diversity. Our data suggest that ongoing rotational sheep grazing with temporary paddocks is regarded as the most preferable management system. However, selected parts of the study area, which have only sparse vegetation and no pressure of bracken or scrub overgrowth, are recommended to be alternately left ungrazed for a few years to allow for the coexistence of different successional stages. Low-intensity bracken control measures, situationally by mowing or uprooting, are considered appropriate and should be pursued. Implications for insect conservation Even though most specialized and rare Orthoptera species in Western Europe tend to prefer sparsely vegetated areas, subareas with medium to even dense vegetation cover might promote certain generalist species, leading to a higher local species richness.

AB  - 1. Given the current rates of climate change, with associated shifts in herbivore population densities, understanding the role of different herbivores in ecosystem functioning is critical for predicting ecosystem responses. Here, we examined how migratory geese and resident, non-migratory reindeer-two dominating yet functionally contrasting herbivores-control vegetation and ecosystem processes in rapidly warming Arctic tundra.
   2. We collected vegetation and ecosystem carbon (C) flux data at peak plant growing season in the two longest running, fully replicated herbivore removal experiments found in high-Arctic Svalbard. Experiments had been set up independently in wet habitat utilised by barnacle geese Branta leucopsis in summer and in moist-to-dry habitat utilised by wild reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus year-round.
   3. Excluding geese induced vegetation state transitions from heavily grazed, moss-dominated (only 4 g m(-2) of live above-ground vascular plant biomass) to ungrazed, graminoid-dominated (60 g m(-2) after 4-year exclusion) and horsetail-dominated (150 g m(-2) after 15-year exclusion) tundra. This caused large increases in vegetation C and nitrogen (N) pools, dead biomass and moss-layer depth. Alterations in plant N concentration and CN ratio suggest overall slower plant community nutrient dynamics in the short-term (4-year) absence of geese. Long-term (15-year) goose removal quadrupled net ecosystem C sequestration (NEE) by increasing ecosystem photosynthesis more than ecosystem respiration (ER).
   4. Excluding reindeer for 21 years also produced detectable increases in live above-ground vascular plant biomass (from 50 to 80 g m(-2); without promoting vegetation state shifts), as well as in vegetation C and N pools, dead biomass, moss-layer depth and ER. Yet, reindeer removal did not alter the chemistry of plants and soil or NEE.
   5. Synthesis. Although both herbivores were key drivers of ecosystem structure and function, the control exerted by geese in their main habitat (wet tundra) was much more pronounced than that exerted by reindeer in their main habitat (moist-to-dry tundra). Importantly, these herbivore effects are scale dependent, because geese are more spatially concentrated and thereby affect a smaller portion of the tundra landscape compared to reindeer. Our results highlight the substantial heterogeneity in how herbivores shape tundra vegetation and ecosystem processes, with implications for ongoing environmental change.

AB  - Temperate grassland biomes are globally imperiled, and grassland birds are in precipitous decline as a result. The majority of North America's grassland birds breed on rangelands occupied by domestic cattle, but reintroductions of bison to restore evolutionary grazing patterns are increasingly common. Grassland landscapes in western North America have undergone drastic changes since millions of bison occupied this landscape, and the biodiversity effects of bison on modern rangelands remain poorly understood. Here, we test the biodiversity effects of native versus non-native grazers in the context of a highly diverse grassland bird community on the Northern Great Plains of North America. We compared the effects of 2 different grazing treatments common across the region on avian diversity: seasonally grazed and manually rotated domestic cattle, and year-round, free-moving bison. We also test whether estimated abundances of 11 grassland/steppe obligate songbirds differ between these two management regimes. We found roughly equivalent bird diversity, as measured by species richness and Shannon's diversity index, at sites occupied year-round by bison and seasonally by cattle. We also found no significant effect of grazer type on 9 of 11 grassland songbird species. The two exceptions were Grasshopper Sparrow and Vesper Sparrow, which were more abundant in bison pastures. Our results suggest that both native and nonnative grazers can create habitat for a highly diverse assemblage of grassland birds under grazer-specific management regimes.

AB  - Grasslands support a variety of herbivores that profoundly impact biodiversity and ecosystem functioning at local and regional scales. Understanding how different herbivores influence plant diversity across multiple scales is crucial for effective biodiversity conservation. However, most studies have focussed on the effects of grazing intensity on plant diversity, neglecting the impacts and associated mechanisms of different herbivores across scales. Based on a 7-year grazing experiment with 16 plots in Inner Mongolia's typical steppe, we compared the scale-dependent effects of different herbivores (cattle, sheep and goats) on plant diversity at moderate grazing intensity. We used the species-area relationship (SAR) and linear mixed models to analyse the changes in species richness across multiple scales (1, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024 m2). To understand SAR slope changes, we examined four potential mechanisms: overall species richness, total number of individuals, species abundance distribution and species aggregation. We found that grazing had scale effects on plant diversity, as indicated by a significant decrease in the SAR slope. This decrease in slope suggests that the negative impacts of grazing were more pronounced at larger scales. Additionally, the scale effects of different herbivores on plant diversity varied. Cattle had stronger positive impacts on diversity than sheep and goats at both small (1 m2) and large (1024 m2) scales. Conversely, sheep and goats had stronger negative effects on diversity than did the control at the large scale (1024 m2). The decrease in the SAR slope was mainly caused by changes in overall species richness and species abundance distribution. This was primarily because cattle had a stronger impact on dominant species, whereas sheep and goats had a stronger impact on rare species. Synthesis: Our results demonstrate that even at the same intensity, the grazing effects on species diversity vary with the study scale, herbivore type and their interaction. This finding has important implications for the conservation of grassland biodiversity given that grazing typically occurs at larger scales than in studies with quadrats and involves various herbivores with distinct effects on plant diversity.

AB  - The foraging strategies of sympatric ungulates with similar ecological niches are important for understanding ecological niche differentiation, resource utilization, competition, and coexistence and for understanding the ecological impacts on plant communities in the ecosystem. The behavior of the wapiti (Cervus elaphus) and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) foraging on Japanese yew (Taxus cuspidata) has affected its succession and renewal in the northeastern forests of China, which has become an urgent problem for the relevant departments. This study analyzed the foraging strategies of the wapiti and Siberian roe deer on Japanese yew from July 2021 to January 2024 using field investigations and infrared camera monitoring in the Muling National Nature Reserve, Heilongjiang Province, China. It was found that the wapiti and Siberian roe deer have different foraging strategies in terms of time, space, and behavior. Temporally, they both preferred to forage for the saplings of the Japanese yew during the winter season, the degree of overlap in foraging rhythms was medium (Dhat1 = 0.67), and the diurnal foraging activity index (D-RAI) of the wapiti was larger than that of the Siberian roe deer. Spatially, the suitable foraging habitat of the Siberian roe deer was twice that of the wapiti, and their overlap was low in the location and direction of saplings and the distance of the seed tree. Behaviorally, the foraging intensity of the wapiti was high, and that of Siberian roe deer was low. Foraging reduced the average primary branch height, number of new branches, and length of lateral branches of saplings, and the influence of the wapiti was significantly greater than that of the Siberian roe deer. This study provides a scientific basis for solving the conservation and management problems of the deer animals foraging on Japanese yew and contributes to further understanding of the competition-coexistence mechanism of sympatric species.

AB  - European bison (Bison bonasus) are one of the few European megafaunal species to survive the Late Pleistocene mass megafaunal extinction. Current conservation management efforts have proceeded in the absence of information about their evolutionary history, which has been obscured by recent severe population bottlenecks. We characterized mitochondrial genomes from 135 ancient bison samples spanning > 50,000 years (> 50 ka) across the Eurasian continent and detected three distinct phylogenetic groups: two distinct clades of European bison and the extinct steppe bison (Bison priscus). The geographical distributions and dietary/ecological signatures of the three groups overlapped during the Late Pleistocene climate cycles and tracked environmental changes including vegetation cover and human impacts. The abundance of European bison specimens responded negatively to the extent of forest cover, including Holocene cycles of abrupt atmospheric-ocean circulation changes originating in the North Atlantic. European bison remain preferentially adapted to an open environment, but with today's anthropogenic landscapes, are now largely restricted to forest habitats with negative implications under scenarios of future environmental change.

AB  - The burrowing activity of plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae; hereafter, pikas) may profoundly influence vegetation species composition on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Although significant efforts have been made to examine the relationship between vegetation species composition and pikas disturbance, our knowledge regarding the direct influence of pikas activity on vegetation species diversity is still limited. We conducted field observations on pikas burrows and surrounding vegetation patches at 23 alpine grassland sites to investigate this effect. When compared to vegetation patches, pikas burrowing activity decreased soil hardness, thus improving water infiltration, while caused the less reduction of soil nutrition and soil moisture when compared to adjacent vegetation patches. Vegetation species composition on pikas burrows significantly differed from that on vegetation patches. Common plant species between pikas burrows and vegetation patches were fewer than three in all types of grasslands, and ten species were found exclusively on pikas burrows. The total species richness, including both pikas burrows and vegetation patches, was approximately 1.3-2.5 times higher than that on each single patch type (pikas burrows or vegetation patches). A conceptual framework was proposed to synthesize the evolution of vegetation species composition under a disturbance regime resulting from pika's burrowing. Overall, we concluded that pika's burrowing activity enhanced vegetation species richness by loosening the soil, creating safe sites for seed settling and germination, which provided a novel habitat for vegetation invasion.

AB  - Effective fire and grazing management practices are crucial to the restoration of prairie ecosystems, but prairie restoration efforts have only recently included bison (Bison bison) reintroduction. Given the novelty of such efforts and the importance of grazing in ecosystem dynamics, questions remain regarding how human activity and habitat management affect bison habitat selection. We radiocollared seven female bison at an enclosed restored grassland site in northern Illinois during 2014-2016 and developed resource selection models to evaluate the influence of land cover, fire management, and concentrated human activity on habitat selection by bison. To help managers target areas for future activities, we used the most-supported model to map predicted bison use across the study area. Our results indicated that bison habitat selection was primarily driven by the type of restoration conducted at a location, with strong selection for partially restored prairie and avoidance of nongrassland areas. These results are likely due to the expected high relative abundance of perennial grasses at partially restored prairie sites in our study area. Our research emphasizes the relationship between restoration approaches and grazers in prairie ecosystems and underscores the importance of including restoration practices in habitat selection research. Additionally, the map of predicted bison use highlights areas to focus further management and conduct vegetation surveys to ensure grazing is resulting in increased plant diversity and species richness.

AB  - Greenhouse gases accumulation constitutes one of the main problems of modern society. Forests, which are a main terrestrial carbon sink, could represent a great help to reduce carbon footprints. Recent studies show that animals play a big role in carbon dynamics, and while the impacts of animals such as ungulates are affected by human presence, these effects have not been considered in studies on carbon stocks. Here, we studied the impact of ungulates on different carbon pools of a temperate coniferous forest at the Veluwe area (Gelderland, the Netherlands), and incorporated the influence of humans on ungulates presence and vigilance at fine spatial scales. We selected 22 paired plots at 20 and 100 m distance from human trails, ensuring that all of them had comparable environmental conditions. We divided each plot in three subplots, and in each subplot, we collected a sample of aboveground vegetation, understory litter and soil. Using camera traps in the same plots, we related differences in presence and behaviour of ungulates with the abovementioned carbon stocks measured in the same plots. We found consistently fewer ungulate visits per day at 20 m than at 100 m from human trails, while their vigilant level was not significantly different. The concentrations of carbon were substantially higher in all three measured carbon pools at 20 m than at 100 m distance from the human trails. Hence, our study suggests that ungulates not only have an impact on the carbon stocks of temperate forests, but moreover that this impact is affected by human presence through the proximity to human trails. We suggest that for a proper understanding of carbon dynamics in forests, not only the impact of animals should be considered, but also how this impact is influenced by human activities.

AB  - Despite wide recognition of the importance of anthropogenically driven changes in large herbivore communities-including both declines in wildlife and increases in livestock-there remain large gaps in our knowledge about the impacts of these changes on plant communities, particularly when combined with concurrent changes in climate. Considering these prominent forms of global change in tandem enables us to better understand controls on savanna vegetation structure and diversity under real-world conditions. We conducted a field experiment using complete and semi-permeable herbivore exclosures to explore the difference in plant communities among sites with wild herbivores only, with cattle in addition to wild herbivores, and with no large herbivores. To understand variation in effects across climatic contexts, the experiment was replicated at three locations along a topoclimatic gradient in California. Critically, this is the first such experiment to compare cattle and wildlife impacts along an environmental gradient within a single controlled experiment. Vegetation structure responded strongly to herbivore treatment regardless of climate. Relative to the isolated effects of wildlife, exclusion of all large herbivores generally increased structural components related to cover and above-ground biomass while the addition of cattle led to reductions in vegetation cover, litter, shading and standing biomass. Furthermore, wildlife had a consistent neutral or positive effect on plant diversity, while the effect of livestock addition was context dependent. Cattle had a neutral to strongly negative effect at low aridity, but a positive effect at high aridity. These results suggest that (a) herbivore effects can override climate effects on vegetation structure, (b) cattle addition can drive different effects on diversity and (c) herbivore effects on diversity are modulated by climate. Synthesis. Our results illustrate very distinctive shifts in plant communities between two realistic forms of change in ungulate herbivore assemblages-livestock addition and large herbivore losses-particularly for plant diversity responses, and that these responses vary across climatic contexts. This finding has important implications for the management and protection of plant biodiversity given that over a quarter of the Earth's land area is managed for livestock and climate regimes are changing globally.

AB  - The effect of non-native herbivores on ecosystems and diversity has become a global concern in conservation. Management challenges associated with non-native free-roaming equids have existed for decades in a wide range of ecosystems yet have been difficult to resolve. Although much of the challenge is associated with non-biological considerations, empirical ecological research is crucial for guiding sound management decisions. We conducted a field study on the associations between feral burros (Equus asinus) and elements of the Sonoran Desert ecosystem in Arizona, USA, during 2017-2019. We identified areas with and without established burro herds, and collected data on vegetation, ungulate sign, small mammals, birds, and herpetofauna at multiple, randomly selected grids within these areas, while accounting for vegetation community and distance to water. We predicted that burros would be associated with differences in vegetation metrics such as lower ground cover, smaller perennial plant size, and lower plant density, foliage density, recruitment, and species richness among perennial native plants susceptible to burro foraging or trampling. We further predicted that these differences would be accompanied by lower density or relative abundance and lower species richness of small mammals, birds, and herpetofauna. Finally, because burro distribution has been documented to be associated with water in this arid landscape, we predicted that effects would be most pronounced near water. The results of our study did not consistently support our predictions, perhaps because of small sample sizes or, in several cases, inherent complexities associated with seasonal burro habitat use and plant phenology patterns. However, our study documented that the presence of this feral equid is associated with a number of key differences that may be ecologically important and have the potential to alter community structure in this sensitive arid ecosystem. In areas with established burro herds, we documented lower ground cover, plant density, foliage density, or smaller plant size in several species, and changes were often influenced by distance from water. For example, density of Engelmann's prickly pear cactus (Opuntia engelmannii) was 94% lower and Anderson wolfberry (Lycium andersonii) plants were 49% smaller in areas with established burro herds. In areas with burros, we also recorded lower density of white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa) in areas distant from water. Of notable concern was that our metric of recruitment indicated 63% lower recruitment in saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) and that foliage densities of yellow paloverde (Parkinsonia microphylla) and desert ironwood (Olneya tesota) were lower in areas with established burro herds. Data on some plant species did not support our predictions. For example, white bursage and Anderson wolfberry plants were found at similar densities in areas with and without established burros near water, but they occurred at lower densities far from water in areas with established burros. Our data revealed that in 4 of 7 small mammal species evaluated (Bailey's pocket mouse [Chaetodipus baileyi], desert pocket mouse [C. penicillatus], deer mice [Peromyscus spp.], and Merriam's kangaroo rat [Dipodomys merriami]), density was associated with an interaction between burros and distance to water, with lower densities close to water in burro areas.
   Contrary to predictions, 3 of these species (Bailey's pocket mouse, desert pocket mouse, and deer mice) exhibited higher densities in burro areas than in non-burro areas at grids farther from water. Density of a fifth species (Arizona woodrat [Neotoma devia]) was 68% lower in burro areas than in non-burro areas, and the densities of 2 species were not associated with burros. Across species, we did not find consistent patterns in our analysis of bird group density, with some species exhibiting a negative effect associated with burros and others exhibiting a positive effect. When we categorized birds by hypothesized nesting and foraging vulnerabilities (low, medium, high), vulnerability levels did not predict the effect of burros. However, all categories exhibited a negative burro effect distant from water but not close to water, contrary to our expectations. Relative abundance of common side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) was 26% lower in areas with established burros, but data on other herpetofauna species did not support our predictions, with some species exhibiting higher relative abundance in areas with established burros. Our data did not reveal an association between burros and bird, small mammal, or herpetofauna species richness, but species richness of native perennial plants was higher in burro areas close to water. We recommend that future bird studies focus on riparian birds and nest success, and possibly evaluate potential effects in relation to other aspects of bird ecology such as feeding guilds or nesting ecology, and that future herpetofauna studies use survey methods that can better account for detection. Although some results did not support our predictions, our study documented negative associations between burros and a number of native plant species, and density in some small mammal species. These associations are important and of concern in and of themselves because changes in long-lived keystone plant species and in small mammal densities indicate that the long-term sustainability of portions of this ecosystem may be affected, and it is likely that these changes can have additional indirect effects on plants and wildlife in this ecosystem. Field data on ungulate sign (fecal groups and tracks) suggested that the associations detected in our study were related to burros and not cattle (Bos taurus) or native ungulates such as mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) or bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis). Our results indicate that the presence of established burro herds was associated with changes, primarily in the plant community that is critical for ecosystem function, and we suggest that current management of this feral equid may not be adequate for maintaining the long-term viability of this arid and fragile ecosystem.

AB  - The effects of wild game feeding on the local environment have been widely investigated in northern European countries but have received little consideration in Central Europe. Bait sites, that is, places where food is set out to entice wild boar for hunting are becoming ever more widespread, and they are having an increasing impact on surrounding vegetation. The aim of the present study was to assess the extent of weed invasion at different bait types. 3 bait sites located in forests, 3 baits in clearings and 3 baits on unpaved forest roads in the Central European lower montane zone, in Hungary. The field work was conducted in May and August. Four transects were laid out (at right angles to each other) from the centre of each bait, and consisted of 22 one meter square quadrats, in which vegetation survey were conducted. The application of multivariate statistical methods (PCA) and UPGMA analysis to the data collected revealed substantial differences between the bait types. The baits in the forest were the least degraded, with a sparse understory cover in both surveys. Road baits displayed a notable difference, as they varied depending on canopy closure, accessibility and exposure. Sites in clearings proved to be the most infected. Furthermore, there was a significant difference between the vegetation of the periods examined, arable weeds dominated in August. A stress gradient was detected along the transects, with the proportion of weeds decreasing from the centre, while the natural components of the vegetation increased. The effect was more noticeable in clearings, probably due to their greater openness. Invasion is typically limited to the immediate environment of the bait sites, but valuable patches of habitat can also be destroyed, and bait sites may serve as bridgeheads for biological invasions.

AB  - Animal movement patterns are affected by complex interactions between biotic and abiotic landscape conditions, and these patterns are being altered by weather variability associated with a changing climate. Some animals, like the American plains bison (Bison bison L.; hereafter, plains bison), are considered keystone species, thus their response to weather variability may alter ecosystem structure and biodiversity patterns. Many movement studies of plains bison and other ungulates have focused on point-pattern analyses (e.g., resource-selection) that have provided information about where these animals move, but information about when or why these animals move is limited. For example, information surrounding the influence of weather on plains bison movement in response to weather is limited but has important implications for their conservation in a changing climate. To explore how movement distance is affected by weather patterns and drought, we utilized 12-min GPS data from two of the largest plains bison herds in North America to model their response to weather and drought parameters using generalized additive mixed models. Distance moved was best predicted by air temperature, wind speed, and rainfall. However, air temperature best explained the variation in distance moved compared to any other single parameter we measured, predicting a 48% decrease in movement rates above 28 degrees C. Moreover, severe drought (as indicated by 25-cm depth soil moisture) better predicted movement distance than moderate drought. The strong influence of weather and drought on plains bison movements observed in our study suggest that shifting climate and weather will likely affect plains bison movement patterns, further complicating conservation efforts for this wide-ranging keystone species. Moreover, changes in plains bison movement patterns may have cascading effects for grassland ecosystem structure, function, and biodiversity. Plains bison and grassland conservation efforts need to be proactive and adaptive when considering the implications of a changing climate on bison movement patterns.

AB  - Herbivores drive shifts in plant species composition by interacting with vegetation through defoliation, trampling and nutrient addition: urine and faeces. As herbivore effects on vegetation accumulate over time, they might spillover to other trophic levels, but how and when this happens is poorly understood. Since it is methodologically demanding to measure biodiversity across spatial gradients, an alternative approach is to assess it through biodiversity indices of vascular plants. We employed the Index of biodiversity relevance developed for Swedish flora which provides an estimated number of organisms associated with a plant species, allowing the quantification of trophic community size. Values from this index were coupled with vegetation data from a network of 96 fenced and paired grazed plots across Fennoscandia. We analysed the role herbivory has on plant richness and diversity, and on the number of organisms that interact with the vegetation according to the index values. We also explored how herbivores influence the competitive effects of tall shrubs on other plants since the dominance of a vegetation type links directly to biodiversity. Plant diversity had no clear response to grazing. Overall vegetation and the vegetation subgroups herbs and non-fruit shrubs had higher biodiversity index values in fenced plots, indicating a higher number of plant-host interactions. Herb cover was negatively related to shrubs in both treatments but with a faster decline in the absence of herbivores. This study highlights the importance of maintaining herbivore populations in the Arctic to conserve the vegetation structure and biodiversity of the tundra. This method of coupling biodiversity indexes with vegetation data provides complementary information to the plant diversity, especially when methodological or time constraints prevent complete field inventories.

AB  - QuestionLivestock grazing affects plant communities in drylands worldwide. However, our current understanding of the Patagonian drylands has primarily been derived from comparing exclosures with grazing conditions or from single-site grazing gradients. The pending question is: do impacts of grazing intensification on Patagonian plant communities change along aridity gradients?LocationPatagonia, Argentina.MethodsWe surveyed vegetation cover of perennial species in paddocks with different sheep-grazing pressure (ungrazed, lightly, moderately, and intensively grazed, based on long-term stocking rates), in three plant communities located along a regional aridity gradient: a semi-desert (arid), a shrub-grass steppe (semi-arid), and a grass steppe (dry sub-humid). In these communities, we analyzed the effects of grazing pressure on the total cover of vegetation, the cover of dominant plant life-forms (grasses and shrubs), the plant species diversity, and the traits of dominant plant species.ResultsIntensification of sheep grazing significantly decreased total vegetation cover in the semi-desert, but not in the steppes. Although grazing decreased the cover of grasses (particularly of the highly preferred ones) in all communities, in the shrub-grass and grass steppes this reduction was offset by an increase in the cover and size of shrubs. Plant diversity was not consistently affected by grazing pressure in these communities. Traits of dominant plant species partially explained community responses to grazing intensification.ConclusionsLivestock grazing intensification reduces the forage quantity and quality of Patagonian plant communities, but the severity depends on plant community types. In semi-deserts (the most arid), grasses were drastically affected, while in the steppes, the grazing effects on grasses were low and partially compensated by an increase in the cover and size of shrubs, which fulfill critical roles other than forage provision. It is fundamental that grazing pressure be adapted to forage resource availability for each community type to achieve sustainable management in the context of climate change.
   We studied the impacts of intensifying livestock grazing on Patagonian plant communities across an aridity gradient. Grazing intensification reduced both the quantity and quality of forage within all plant communities, but the severity of the impacts increased with increasing aridity. Management of grazing pressure should be adapted to each community type to achieve sustainable management in the context of climate change.image

AB  - Understanding species occupancy and habitat selection is fundamental to ecology and provides critical information for management. In the Rocky Mountain Foothills of western Canada, feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) are now sympatric with many native species and free-ranging cattle. From 2018-2020 we assessed the seasonal habitat selection of GPS-tracked feral horses in Alberta's Sundre Equine Management Zone; and compared summer probability of occupancy of horses, domestic cattle (Bos taurus; not present in winter), and elk (Cervus elaphus) using a 120-unit array of trail-camera data. GPS-tracked horses varied in selection for vegetation type and counter to expectations horses tended to avoid native rangeland in summer compared to greater selection for forestry cutblocks. In winter, horses were closer to native rangelands and selected areas closer to roads, areas of lower terrain ruggedness, and areas of higher solar radiation farther from forests, suggesting that forage, habitat accessibility, and thermoregulation are important drivers of winter habitat use. GPS-tracking results were supported by trail-camera occupancy analyses that pointed to the presence of cattle as a potential modulator of horse habitat use. Summer probability of occupancy for horses was highest with increasing coverage of cutblocks in contrast to cattle where occupancy probability decreased strongly with the latter. Cattle occupancy was also negatively influenced by terrain, though positively influenced by the presence of linear features and reduced distance to roads. Elk summer occupancy increased with decreasing distance to conifer forest and increasing native rangeland, though spatial coverage of elk was low compared to cattle and horses. Our results suggest that human-caused landscape changes are important drivers of feral horse occupancy in this northern ecosystem. While cattle may displace horses from native rangeland in summer, horses appear to seasonally adjust their foraging strategy to focus on forestry cutblocks and clearings that are less used by cattle, until cattle are removed from the system for winter. Horse populations can be expected to respond favorably to increasing access to cutblocks in this ecosystem, and their presence can be predicted by increasing anthropogenic activity.

AB  - Very few multi-species or ecosystem comparisons of post-fire vertebrate herbivore activity and food preference exist to inform fire management and conservation strategies. We inferred post-fire (1-3 years) native and introduced vertebrate herbivore activity and attraction to six diverse temperate vegetation communities (grassland to rainforest) from scat counts. We hypothesised that where fire reduced herbaceous and grassy vegetation ('fodder'), vertebrate herbivores would decline, and that post-fire preferences of native versus exotic herbivores would differ significantly. Instead, we found evidence for a 'fire and fodder reversal phenomenon' whereby native macropod and exotic deer scats were more abundant after fire in consistently 'fodder-poor' vegetation types (e.g., heath) but less abundant after fire in previously fodder-rich vegetation communities (e.g., grassland). Fodder cover predicted native macropod, wombat, and introduced deer activity and bare ground cover was strongly associated with introduced herbivore activity only, with the latter indicating post-fire competition for food sources due to their abundance in high-altitude open ecosystems. We, therefore, found environmental and vegetation predictors for each individual species/group and suggest broadscale multi-environment, multispecies observations to be informative for conservation management in potentially overlapping post-fire niches.

AB  - Water sources in arid and semiarid ecosystems support humans, wildlife, and domestic animals, forming nodes of activity that sculpt surrounding plant communities and impact critical grazing and soil systems. However, global aridification and changing surface water supply threaten to disrupt these water resources, with strong implications for conservation and management of these ecosystems. To understand how effects of herbivore aggregation at water impact plant communities across contexts, we measured herbivore activity, plant height, cover (trees, grasses, forbs, and bare ground), diversity, and composition at 17 paired water sources and matrix sites across a range of abiotic factors in a semiarid savanna in Kenya. The effects of proximity to surface water and herbivore aggregation on plant communities varied substantially depending on soil and rainfall. In arid areas with nutrient-poor sandy soils, forb and tree cover were 50% lower at water sources compared to neighboring matrix sites, bare ground was 20% higher, species richness was 15% lower, and a single globally important grazing grass (Cynodon dactylon) dominated 60% of transects. However, in mesic areas with nutrient-rich finely textured soils, species richness was 25% higher, despite a 40% increase in bare ground, concurrent with the decline of a dominant tall grass (Themeda triandra) and increase in C. dactylon and other grass species near water sources. Recent rainfall was important for grasses; cover was higher relative to matrix sites only during wet periods, a potential indication of compensatory grazing. These findings suggest that effects of herbivore aggregation on vegetation diversity and composition will vary in magnitude, and in some cases direction, depending on other factors at the site. Where moisture and nutrient resources are high and promote the dominance of few plant species, herbivore aggregations may maintain diversity by promoting grazing lawns and increasing nondominant species cover. However, in arid conditions and sites with low nutrient availability, diversity can be substantially reduced by these aggregations. Our results highlight the importance of considering abiotic conditions when managing for effects of herbivore aggregations near water. This will be particularly important for future managers in light of growing global aridification and surface water changes.

AB  - Livestock grazing and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have been reported as important factors affecting soil communities. However, how different large herbivore grazing and N addition may interact to affect soil biota in grassland ecosystems is unclear. Nematodes are the most abundant metazoan in soil ecosystems, play critical roles in regulating carbon and nutrient dynamics, and are valuable bioindicators. We examined the independent and interactive effects of grazing regimes (no grazing; sheep grazing; cattle grazing; mixed grazing of sheep and cattle) and N addition (ambient N; N addition) on soil nematodes in a meadow steppe. We found that grazing and N addition interacted to influence total nematode abundance, trophic group abundance, generic richness, diversity and several nematode-based indices (maturity index, channel ratio, enrichment index). In cattle grazing treatment, N addition significantly increased total nematode abundance, and the abundance of bacterial feeders, plant feeders, and omnivore-predators, and generic richness. By contrast, in the sheep and mixed grazing treatments, N addition had a negative effect on the same variables. Moreover, N addition reduced nematode maturity, enrichment and structure indices, and enhanced nematode channel ratio, in most grazing treatments, except mixed grazing where N addition had no effect on these variables. Structural equation modeling (SEM) revealed that N addition indirectly reduced nematode abundance and richness through increased soil NO3-N content, whereas the effects of grazing were associated with increased relative biomass of grasses. Our results suggested that the response of soil nematodes to N addition strongly depended on herbivore assemblages. Nitrogen addition enhanced soil nematode diversity and maintained a relatively complex and mature soil food web in the presence of cattle rather than sheep grazing. Furthermore, our study highlighted that under N deposition, cattle grazing could benefit the soil nematode community.

AB  - 1. Disturbances affect plant diversity with consequences on other trophic levels, like the associated insect communities. Domestic livestock is a major disturbance affecting flowering plant abundance at the bottom of insect food webs with unpredicted consequences on ecosystem functioning.2. This work evaluated livestock effect on flower-associated insect functional groups (i.e., predators, herbivores and pollinators) hypothesizing that plant damage produced by grazing exerts bottom up effects on insect populations, affecting their interactions. On contrary, livestock might supply food resources for several dipteran pests (e.g., scavengers, parasites or bloodsucking) or benefit predator species by increasing habitat transparency with grazing.3. Seven independent rangelands within the same arid environment and increasing livestock density, were used to test these hypotheses using a regression approach.4. Insect, herbivore and pollinator diversity decreased with increasing livestock density, and increased with increasing vegetation. Bare soil affected solitary bees (but not all the pollinators) and habitat transparency benefited predators, as expected. Dipteran pests quadratically decreased with increasing livestock density, rejecting the hypothesis of food supply. Apparently, predators reduced the abundance of almost all insect groups. 5. Grazing reduce vegetation positively affecting predators, which negatively affect other insect groups (top-down), potentially altering species complex interactions and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Processes leading to range contractions and population declines of Arctic megafauna during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene are uncertain, with intense debate on the roles of human hunting, climatic change, and their synergy. Obstacles to a resolution have included an overreliance on correlative rather than process-explicit approaches for inferring drivers of distributional and demographic change. Here, we disentangle the ecological mechanisms and threats that were integral in the decline and extinction of the muskox (Ovibos moschatus) in Eurasia and in its expansion in North America using process-explicit macroecological models. The approach integrates modern and fossil occurrence records, ancient DNA, spatiotemporal reconstructions of past climatic change, species-specific population ecology, and the growth and spread of anatomically modern humans. We show that accurately reconstructing inferences of past demographic changes for muskox over the last 21,000years require high dispersal abilities, large maximum densities, and a small Allee effect. Analyses of validated process-explicit projections indicate that climatic change was the primary driver of muskox distribution shifts and demographic changes across its previously extensive (circumpolar) range, with populations responding negatively to rapid warming events. Regional analyses show that the range collapse and extinction of the muskox in Europe (similar to 13,000years ago) was likely caused by humans operating in synergy with climatic warming. In Canada and Greenland, climatic change and human activities probably combined to drive recent population sizes. The impact of past climatic change on the range and extinction dynamics of muskox during the Pleistocene-Holocene transition signals a vulnerability of this species to future increased warming. By better establishing the ecological processes that shaped the distribution of the muskox through space and time, we show that process-explicit macroecological models have important applications for the future conservation and management of this iconic species in a warming Arctic.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementTo better understand the impact of human settlement on vegetation distribution and disturbance regimes in Madagascar, the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop called for an examination of the role of extinct megafauna in determining the historic distribution of habitat mosaics across regions that are today dominated by vast treeless grasslands. A systematic literature review facilitated the reconstruction and evaluation of giant tortoise habitat, feeding habitats, diets and Aldabrachelys tortoise impacts on disturbance regimes. In conclusion, reintroduction of mixed-feeding Aldabrachelys (the diets of which were often dominated by C-3 woody material, but never by C-4 grasses, across its range), will likely impact plant species composition, select a tree-rich habitat mosaic, reduce fire frequency, re-establish lost ecological functions and improve landscape productivity at a range of scales, including rangeland palatability, benefitting both biodiversity and human wellbeing.SummaryGrasslands with little tree cover today comprise 80% of Madagascar's habitat. Determining their extent at human settlement can guide ecological restoration and enhance human well-being, so the 2021 Malagasy Grassy Biomes Workshop identified the role of extinct megafauna in determining habitat as a critical knowledge gap. Using a systematic literature review, combined with extracted datasets, we address this, examining anticipated habitat selection by giant tortoises following reintroduction to Madagascar (where the Aldabran giant tortoise, Aldabrachelys gigantea, provides ecological functions lost when A. abrupta and A. grandidieri went extinct). When comparing current and historical tortoise selection of habitat across the Mascarenes and Aldabra with contemporary Malagasy habitat, areas in Madagascar where giant tortoises historically ranged, today have a significantly different habitat composition to the forested habitat that supported giant tortoises on other islands. Dietary C-13 isotope ratios show that Malagasy Aldabrachelys and Mascarene tortoises were mixed feeders, with diets often dominated by C-3 woody intake, but never by C-4 grasses. Across systems, giant tortoises required and selected, tree-rich habitat mosaics, different to current pastoralist fire-selected Malagasy grasslands characterized by sparse tree cover. Furthermore, Aldabran Aldabrachelys tortoise turf, restricted to small areas (large tracts of unshaded vegetation present physiological challenges to Aldabrachelys' survival), is compositionally different to Malagasy and African obligate C-4 grazing lawns. Ecological, palaeoecological, geomorphological and molecular evidence support a lost Malagasy habitat mosaic where hippo and tortoise diets were C-3-dominated, because they inhabited closed-canopy systems, with abutting open-canopy areas harbouring endemic-rich, C-4 grassy understories and limited grasslands. The review suggests that rewilding with A. gigantea will help restore ecological functions, productivity and landscape-scale degradation lost through cattle-based pastoralism, re-establish tree-rich habitat mosaics, and mitigate against frequent bushfires, benefiting biodiversity and humans at multiple scales.

AB  - Context. In south-eastern Australia, the abundance and distribution of non-native sambar deer (Cervus unicolor) has increased dramatically in alpine environments. As a result, significant concern surrounds the potential for the species to impact rare plant species and vegetation communities through browsing.Aims. We aimed to determine the diversity of the plant species eaten by sambar deer in the Alpine National Park and to understand any spatial and temporal variation in deer diets.Methods. We collected 90 sambar deer faecal pellet samples over a 3-month flowering period across two contrasting study sites with differing elevation, vegetation and underlying geology. We performed DNA sequencing using the ITS2 gene region and assigned dietary items to the lowest taxonomic level possible. The frequency of occurrence and sequencing read depth of each dietary item was calculated to investigate the diet of sambar deer at spatial and temporal scales, and dietary preferencing was assessed by comparing the frequency of occurrence of dietary items to the observation records for each dietary item in the study area.Key results. We detected a total of 369 unique plant Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) from sambar deer faecal samples, representing 35 families and 80 genera. Considerable variation in the diet was observed over small spatial scales, and evidence of temporal diet variation was noted in one of the study sites. We detected Silky Snow-daisy (Celmisia sericophylla), which is currently listed as critically endangered under the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988, and Hawkweed (Pilosella spp.), a highly invasive, non-native taxon that is sparingly established in Alpine ecosystems.Conclusions. Sambar deer displayed an intermediate feeder behaviour in alpine environments, foraging on a variety of forbs and shrubs, but forbs were the dominant dietary items. The spatial variation observed in the diet of sambar deer suggests that individual deer are unlikely to be dispersing widely while foraging.Implications. Our results emphasise the need for careful evaluation of sambar deer impacts within individual sites and at small spatial scales. The detection of species of conservation significance in the diet indicates that the presence of sambar deer should be considered a significant risk to biodiversity in areas of high conservation value.

AB  - Landscapes are undergoing ecological changes, and how organisms interact with changing habitats has implications for zoogeochemical influences on ecosystem function (processes and properties). This may be especially true for organisms that alter nutrient cycling, such as structure builders, in nutrient-limited systems such as the Arctic. Our aims were to examine the impact of brown lemming (Lemmus trimucronatus) structures (winter nests, runways, latrines, and burrows) on above- and below-ground processes in habitats that represent contemporary (flat-centered polygon) and potential future (high-centered polygon) tundra conditions near Utqia & gdot;vik, Alaska. Above-ground, structures influenced vegetation community structure at local scales, with winter nests having lower moss and forb cover and burrows, latrines, and runways having lower litter and higher bare ground cover; although effects did not vary by habitat type. Furthermore, structures influenced plant diversity, which may be driven by structure types supporting unique plant species. Below-ground, burrows had broad effects on soil nutrients, with soils under burrows generally having lower carbon and nitrogen contents and exo-enzyme activities in both habitat types. Other structures increased nutrient availability, with soils under winter nests having higher ammonium concentrations compared to controls in both habitat types, whereas soils under latrines had higher phosphate and extractable organic carbon than controls, but only in high-centered polygon tundra. Additionally, soil temperatures under winter nests were lower than at control sites, but only in flat-centered polygon tundra, and soil pH was higher under winter nests and runways in both habitat types. Effects of structures on soil physical properties probably helped to regulate the effects of structures on soil nutrient availability. Finally, differences in structure effects between habitat types suggest that as high-centered polygonal tundra becomes more prevalent, this herbivore's influence on ecosystem processes at local scales may feedback to alter the function of future arctic ecosystems.

AB  - Temporal niche-partitioning is a key strategy for prey to avoid predators and for predators to successfully coexist sympatrically. However, little is known about the temporal and spatial dynamics of snow leopards with key prey species. We investigated the spring daily activity patterns and spatial density distributions of snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Himalayan ibex (Capra ibex sibirica), and domestic yak (Bos grunniens) to unravel the spatiotemporal behavior within their shared alpine habitat in Northern Pakistan using trail cameras data. The results indicated that snow leopards exhibited a bimodal activity pattern, with peaks around midnight and dawn. In contrast, the ibex displayed a predominantly diurnal pattern, starting at dawn and minimally overlapping with the snow leopard. Attended yaks showed a uniform diurnal activity pattern under human protection, while unattended yaks exhibited irregular activity across day and night, suggesting higher vulnerability to predation. Spatial density analysis revealed notable overlaps between species pairs, particularly unattended yaks and snow leopards, highlighting the influence of spatial dynamics on predator-prey interactions. The clear off-phased and contrasting pattern of activity between snow leopard and ibex in our study showed temporal partitioning in spring and indicates that unattended yak may be a more heavily predated species than previously thought. This study provides the first comparative analysis of temporal activity patterns between a key predator and wild and domestic prey in Northern Pakistan. This research broadens our understanding of animal behavior through the lens of spatiotemporal interactions and provides insights into the complex dynamics between predator and prey in the challenging alpine landscape. Our findings emphasize the importance of livestock guarding to mitigate depredation and highlight the complexities of predator-prey interactions in both time and space, along with the resulting behavioral adaptations.

AB  - Northern mixed-grass prairies are recognized for their high biodiversity but are becoming increasingly threatened by conversion to agricultural rangeland. To determine how grazing by cattle or reintroduced bison may impact these plant communities, we examined the primary drivers of northern mixed-grass prairie plant communities, assessed the heterogeneity of community composition at two sites with differing land use histories, and identified factors important for heterogeneity in these prairie communities. Overall, community characteristics were similar across sites, but community composition differed markedly across short distances. Both landscape traits, including elevation, slope, and precipitation, and grazing pressure were primary drivers of community composition. While bison-grazed sites had lower grazing pressure, both relative cover and richness of native plant species were higher in cattle-grazed sites. As both sites were historically cattle grazed, our results suggest that management legacies play a large role in northern mixed-grass prairie community composition and the benefits of bison grazing may only become apparent after a substantial amount of time since reintroduction.

AB  - Conservation managers often monitor umbrella species as indicators of broader biodiversity patterns, but this assumption is seldom evaluated due to lack of survey data and objective umbrella criteria. We evaluated the performance of eight candidate umbrella species in representing broader patterns of mammal biodiversity in Sumatra, Indonesia, using a comprehensive camera trap dataset from the island's largest remaining tropical rainforest. We employed an occupancy modeling framework to quantify the association between species-level occupancy and four community-level biodiversity parameters while accounting for imperfect detection. Sambar deer and clouded leopard were consistently ranked the top umbrellas. Areas where these species were prevalent were associated with higher levels of community occupancy, species richness, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Sumatran tiger and rhino were among the lower ranked umbrellas, and inadequately represented other biodiversity parameters despite being the main subjects of monitoring. Our results demonstrate that the occurrence status of charismatic species commonly regarded as umbrellas does not necessarily represent broader patterns of biodiversity. Species that are frequently overlooked by conservation decision-making may better represent overall mammal diversity. We advocate utilizing umbrella fleets with multiple species monitored to better represent biodiversity patterns, and encourage broader application of our data-driven framework to assess umbrella species performance.

AB  - According to the disturbance-succession theory, natural disturbances support biodiversity and are expected to increase the complexity of food-webs in forest ecosystems by opening canopies and creating a heterogeneous environment. However, a limited number of studies have investigated the impact of disturbance by invasive pathogenic species and succession on arthropod predator-prey food-webs in forest ecosystems.
   Hymenoscyphus fraxineus is a pathogenic fungus of ash trees that is invasive in Europe and causes massive dieback, mainly of the common ash Fraxinus excelsior across its native range. Here we investigated how this pathogenic fungus affects food-webs of web-building spiders and their prey in understorey vegetation of ash plantations.
   In 23 young and middle-aged ash plantations that were distributed along a gradient of infestation by H. fraxineus (29%-86% infestation), we measured the vegetation structure (canopy openness, shrub coverage, herb/grass coverage), the trait composition of local spider communities (web type, body size), the prey availability and the prey intercepted by spider webs. We then evaluated the multivariate prey composition (prey type, body size) and network properties.
   Hymenoscyphus fraxineus opened the ash tree canopy, which resulted in denser shrub coverage. The dense shrub vegetation changed the composition of web types in local spider communities and increasing fungus infestation resulted in reduced mean body size of spiders. Infestation by H. fraxineus reduced the availability of predaceous Coleoptera and increased the availability of herbivorous Coleoptera as potential prey. The mean body size of captured prey and the per capita capture rates of most prey groups decreased with increasing fungus infestation. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus infestation indirectly reduced the complexity in bipartite networks and the trophic functional complementarity in local web-building spider communities. The plantation age affected the vegetation structure but did not affect the studied food-webs.
   Forest disturbance by the invasive pathogen affected four trophic levels (plant-herbivore-coleopteran intermediate predator-top predator web-building spiders) and, contrary to the disturbance-succession theory, disturbance by the fungus simplified the web-building spider-prey food-webs. The results support the view that H. fraxineus represents a threat to the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the simplified ecosystems of ash plantations.

AB  - Understanding the influence of post-disturbance forest management on tree regeneration is critical for assessing ecosystem recovery and guiding future responses. In particular, the influx of elevated coarse woody material (CWM) following wind disturbance, if left in situ, may impede herbivore access, thereby protecting saplings from browsing damage through a natural 'exclosure effect'.In 2013, a tornado in northcentral Maine, United States and subsequent salvage logging operations created three clear 'treatments' for evaluation of the exclosure effect: blowdown, blowdown plus salvage logging and an undamaged control. Nine years post-tornado, we inventoried tree regeneration within these treatments to evaluate differences in sapling abundance, species composition, size structure and browsing intensity. We also inventoried CWM, including the height above forest floor.Results revealed significant differences in sapling composition and browsing intensity among treatments. The salvage treatment had the highest proportion of browsed saplings (56 +/- 28%; mean +/- standard error), followed by the control (9 +/- 10%) and blowdown (5 +/- 8%). Blowdown had by far the greatest mean (50 +/- 9 cm) and average maximum (169 +/- 43 cm) heights for CWM. Binomial generalized linear models revealed that browsing probability was a function of mean CWM height and an interaction between sapling density and proportion of sapling hardwoods. Thus, browsing damage was less likely in plots with greater CWM heights and more likely in plots with greater sapling density and more hardwood saplings.Synthesis and applications. This study furthers our understanding of ecosystem recovery following blowdown and salvage logging. Results suggest that salvage logging created important differences in coarse woody material (CWM) abundance and height distribution, when compared to un-salvaged areas, and that these differences in turn altered sapling size structure and browsing intensity. These findings highlight the potential long-term effects of successive disturbances, as the differences evident in these early stages may persist for decades or longer. Importantly, we provide evidence of the exclosure effect, suggesting that CWM retained in the un-salvaged area protected saplings from moose browsing. Thus, in post-disturbance areas where browsing threatens regeneration, we recommend that managers consider retaining CWM to serve as a natural exclosure.

AB  - Antipredator behavior affects prey fitness, prey demography, and the strength of ecological interactions. Although predator-prey interactions increasingly occur in habitats that experience multiple forms of human-generated disturbance, it is unclear how different forms of disturbance might affect antipredator behavior. Fire is a contemporary disturbance that has dramatic effects on terrestrial habitats. Such habitats may have also experienced past disturbances, like agricultural land use, that leave lasting legacies on habitat structure (e.g., overstory and understory composition). It is unclear how these past and present disturbances affect the use of different antipredator behaviors, like temporal avoidance and vigilance. We examined whether variation in disturbance regimes generates differences in ungulate antipredator behavior by using cameras to measure white-tailed deer vigilance and activity time across 24 longleaf pine woodlands that vary in past land use and contemporary fire regime. Regardless of land-use history, woodlands with high fire frequencies had 4 times less vegetation cover than low-fire woodlands, generating riskier habitats for deer; however, deer responded to fire with different antipredator strategies depending on land-use history. In nonagricultural woodlands, fire affected deer activity time such that activity was nocturnal in low-fire woodlands and crepuscular in high-fire woodlands. In post-agricultural woodlands, fire affected vigilance and not activity time such that deer were more vigilant in high-fire woodlands than in low-fire woodlands. These results suggest that ungulate antipredator behavior may vary spatially depending on past land use and contemporary fire regime, and such disturbances may generate "landscapes of fear" that persist for decades after agricultural use.

AB  - In the Mediterranean basin, the structure and species composition of traditional landscapes have historically been shaped and maintained by human-driven disturbances, such as extensive livestock grazing. The cessation of these activities, which have partially replaced the role of natural disturbances, may lead to vegetation overgrowth and biomass accumulation, with potential adverse impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem functions and services. Recently, the use of livestock for ecosystem management, with the purpose of maintaining grazing disturbance and the associated ecosystem processes, has been gaining traction. Nevertheless, there is still limited evidence on the performance of such grazing interventions. This review assesses the state of the art regarding the use of livestock for ecosystem management in Mediterranean landscapes. It examines the association between the regime and duration of grazing interventions and their reported effects on ecosystems. The list of reviewed interventions (68 interventions, retrieved from 47 studies) covered a diverse range of landcover systems (from grasslands to forests), of grazing regimes (characterized by different levels of grazing intensity and livestock species), and of duration of grazing (from short-term, < 5 years to long-term grazing, > 20 years). Wildfire prevention and biomass control, biodiversity and habitat conservation and the regulation of soil quality are the main reasons for the use of grazing interventions. The results of this review suggest that the use of domestic herbivores in ecosystem management can contribute to wildfire prevention and biomass control, with these positive effects fading away in long-term grazing interventions. Goats seem to perform better than cattle for biomass control. The effects on biodiversity and habitat conservation depend on the grazing regime, with intensive grazing showing negative results, while the effects on soil quality are generally negative but require further assessment, due to data limitations.

AB  - Understanding the effects of traditional livestock grazing abandonment on the ability of mountain grasslands to sustain multiple ecosystem functions (ecosystem multifunctionality; EMF) is crucial for implementing policies that promote grasslands conservation and the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. In this study, we evaluated the effect of short- and long-term transhumant sheep abandonment on EMF through a grazing exclusion experiment in a grassland of the Cantabrian Mountains range (NW Spain), where transhumant sheep flocks graze in summer. We considered four key ecosystem functions, derived from vegetation and soil functional indicators measured in the field: (A) biodiversity function, evaluated from total plant species evenness, diversity and richness indicators; (B) forage production function, evaluated from cover and richness of perennial and annual herbaceous species indicators; (C) carbon sequestration function, evaluated from woody species cover and soil organic carbon indicators; and (D) soil fertility function, evaluated from NH4(+)-N, NO3(-)-N, P and K content in the soil. The EMF index was calculated by integrating the four standardized ecosystem functions through an averaging approach. Based on linear mixed modeling we found that grazing exclusion induced significant shifts in the considered individual ecosystem functions and also on EMF. Long-term livestock exclusion significantly hindered biodiversity and forage production functions, but enhanced the carbon sequestration function. Conversely, the soil fertility function was negatively affected by both short- and long-term grazing exclusion. Altogether, grazing exclusion significantly decreased overall EMF, especially in long-term livestock exclusion areas, while the decline in EMF in short-term exclusions with respect to grazed areas was marginally significant. The results of this study support the sustainability of traditional transhumance livestock grazing for promoting the conservation of grasslands and their ecosystem function in mountain regions.

AB  - Gap dynamics play a crucial role in forest regeneration by creating favourable regeneration and survival niches for some plant species. Nonetheless, potentially overriding factors, such as ungulate browsing, could limit or eliminate this gap dynamicrelated regeneration. The deleterious effects of browsing may be exacerbated for slow-growing species such as northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis L.), a tree highly selected by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman). We therefore aimed to understand how deer browsing and gap dynamics interact to affect cedar regeneration and hypothesized that cedar regeneration benefits from natural gaps but that deer browsing could override this effect. We inventoried natural canopy gaps along a spatiotemporal gradient of deer habitat use. We evaluated cedar regeneration abundance, tree height, and various gap, stand, and competition metrics. We found that deer browsing pressure greatly limited cedar regeneration; however, when deer populations decreased, cedar regeneration abundance increased within a decade, even after prolonged browsing pressure, and increased further over time. Our study illustrates that cedar regeneration can be favoured by gap creation and deer population control.

AB  - Tidal marsh plant communities in the Pacific Northwest are characterized by tall, perennial graminoids (TPGs), which provide forage for herbivores such as Canada geese. Excessive grazing by Canada geese leads to loss of marsh habitat, and removal of grazing pressure is required for the vegetation to recover. Grazing exclosures (fences) are used to allow time and space for vegetation to recover following intensive herbivory; however, their effects on native plant community recovery has not been tested. Generalized linear models were used to compare TPG abundance in aboveground vegetation and surface seed banks in 1-year-old and 10-year-old exclosures at Nanaimo River Estuary (NRE) and Little Qualicum River Estuary (LQRE), respectively, to areas of the marshes that had no known history of grazing (undisturbed) and areas still actively grazed (grubbed). Compared to undisturbed sites, grubbed sites had 187.3% less mean TPG vegetation cover and 190.7% lower proportion of TPG seeds. The 1-year-old exclosures at NRE had 105.0% less mean TPG vegetation cover and 193.2% lower proportion of TPG seeds. The 10-year-old exclosures at LQRE had 7.0% greater mean TPG cover and 55.7% greater proportion of TPG seed than all undisturbed sites; however, these exclosures had 110.0% greater mean relative abundance of non-native TPGs than undisturbed sites. These results indicate vegetation may not recover towards comparable historic conditions through grazing exclusion alone, and that active restoration methods may be required following intensive grazing, especially in estuaries where the vegetation community and surface seed bank has a high abundance of non-native, invasive species.

AB  - Grazing and shrub encroachment are major drivers of vegetation types and soils characteristics in arid and semiarid areas. However, the effects of grazing on shrub growth, particularly soil properties and plant reproductive traits, remain largely unexplored. Here, we conducted three long-term sheep grazing intensity experiments (e.g., no-grazing, moderate grazing, and heavy grazing) in Inner Mongolia to explore how different grazing intensities affect the distributions of soil property heterogeneity and reproductive traits of the dominant shrub species in the desert steppe, Reaumuria songarica. This study highlights the significant effects of grazing on soil properties, plant reproduction, and ecosystem heterogeneity in desert grasslands. Grazing modifies soil physicochemical properties by increasing soil moisture, bulk density, and nutrient content beneath shrubs, with these effects varying by soil depth, canopy width, and specific soil characteristics. Grazing enhances soil heterogeneity for carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, particularly in surface and deeper soil layers, while reducing heterogeneity in pH and surface phosphorus, thereby intensifying fertile island effects. Regarding plant reproduction, grazing reduces female fitness and seed quantity but improves seed quality. Overgrazing disrupts nutrient partitioning, negatively impacting reproductive traits. Shrub mound height and canopy cover positively influence reproductive success, yet changes in soil heterogeneity alter nutrient allocation, further affecting reproduction. Therefore, targeted grazing management is essential in arid ecosystems to balance soil quality, enhance plant reproduction, and promote rangeland sustainability.

AB  - The upland and mountainous regions of northern Europe provide a wide variety of ecosystem services. However, these ecosystem services are highly vulnerable to environmental and land-use change. To ensure their future conservation, it is therefore, essential to understand whether upland plant communities will respond positively or negatively to a range of environmental factors such as grazing pressure and landscape-scale factors such as changes in atmospheric SO2 and NOx deposition. To understand this, here, we describe the long-term trends in four UK upland communities (high-level grassland, intermediate grassland, blanket bog, high-level bog) using four replicated long-term experiments examining the effects of sheep grazing compared to no-sheep grazing in Moor House (from 1954 to 2016). Our results showed that species richness and abundance recovered in grazed plots after 2000, with improvements in species richness and abundance of vascular plants, mosses, and liverworts. Unfortunately, no improvement was found for lichens. Species richness, vascular plants, and mosses recovered the fastest, and much faster than liverworts. There was no evidence of slower recovery of species richness and abundance in plots where sheep grazing was removed. These results are consistent with longitudinal studies suggesting recovery after 2000 as a result of reduced atmospheric deposition. Although trends in diversity and abundance in the grazed and ungrazed plots were not identical, they were not markedly different either. The similar richness and abundance trends in the grazed and ungrazed plots found in each plant community suggest that within-community dynamics may overcome initial differences between the grazing treatments over time. In contrast, differences in richness and abundance among plant communities over time suggest that some landscape-scale trends, such as those caused by a reduction in nutrient inputs, initiate community-dependent recovery.

AB  - Plants are particularly vulnerable to physical disturbance in low productivity areas, due to the high energetic cost of replacing lost tissue. In the eastern United States, serpentine savannahs are fragmented ecosystems with high concentrations of rare endemic plant species, low concentrations of soil nutrients, and severe deer overpopulation. This study assessed the recovery of flowering plants in a serpentine savannah when deer were excluded. Plant count, flower count, vegetative area, and plant height of 10 serpentine plant species were compared inside and outside of deer exclusion structures throughout an entire growing season. Throughout the growing season and across the plant community, deer exclusion consistently increased values for all plant response traits measured. Species that responded most strongly to deer exclusion included Arabis lyrata (Brassicaceae, the wide ranging lyre-leaf rockcress) and the serpentine near-endemic Symphyotrichum depauperatum (a serpentine aster known only in the eastern US). The slender knotweed, Polygonum tenue performed worse in excluded areas, which may indicate exclusion by more competitive species, or, alternatively, local scarcity. Overall, species richness did not increase in excluded plots, which may indicate that years of deer overbrowsing have depleted the local seed banks. While longer term studies might reveal different results, this study showed significant differences in vegetation response traits between excluded and unexcluded areas in just one year. We recommend that further restoration efforts should include reintroductions of locally extirpated species, in combination with deer exclusion to allow rare serpentine plant communities and their seedbanks to recover from intense overbrowsing pressure.

AB  - Studies on the effects of human-driven forest disturbance usually focus on either biodiversity or carbon dynamics but much less is known about ecosystem processes that span different trophic levels. Herbivory is a fundamental ecological process for ecosystem functioning, but it remains poorly quantified in human-modified tropical rainforests.
   Here, we present the results of the largest study to date on the impacts of human disturbances on herbivory. We quantified the incidence (percentage of leaves affected) and severity (the percentage of leaf area lost) of canopy insect herbivory caused by chewers, miners, and gall makers in leaves from 1,076 trees distributed across 20 undisturbed and human-modified forest plots in the Amazon.
   We found that chewers dominated herbivory incidence, yet were not a good predictor of the other forms of herbivory at either the stem or plot level. Chewing severity was higher in both logged and logged-and-burned primary forests when compared to undisturbed forests. We found no difference in herbivory severity between undisturbed primary forests and secondary forests. Despite evidence at the stem level, neither plot-level incidence nor severity of the three forms of herbivory responded to disturbance.
   Synthesis. Our large-scale study of canopy herbivory confirms that chewers dominate the herbivory signal in tropical forests, but that their influence on leaf area lost cannot predict the incidence or severity of other forms. We found only limited evidence suggesting that human disturbance affects the severity of leaf herbivory, with higher values in logged and logged-and-burned forests than undisturbed and secondary forests. Additionally, we found no effect of human disturbance on the incidence of leaf herbivory.

AB  - The restoration of habitats degraded by industrial disturbance is essential for achieving conservation objectives in disturbed landscapes. In boreal ecosystems, disturbances from seismic exploration lines and other linear features have adversely affected biodiversity, most notably leading to declines in threatened woodland caribou. Large-scale restoration of disturbed habitats is needed, yet empirical assessments of restoration effectiveness on wildlife communities remain rare. We used 73 camera trap deployments from 2015 to 2019 and joint species distribution models to investigate how habitat use by the larger vertebrate community (>0.2 kg) responded to variation in key seismic line characteristics (line-of-sight, width, density and mounding) following restoration treatments in a landscape disturbed by oil and gas development in northeastern Alberta. The proportion of variation explained by line characteristics was low in comparison to habitat type and season, suggesting short-term responses to restoration treatments were relatively weak. However, we found that lines with characteristics consistent with restored conditions were predicted to support an altered community composition, with reduced use by wolf and coyote, thereby indicating that line restoration will result in reduced contact rates between caribou and these key predators. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis provides a framework to assess and predict wildlife community responses to emerging restoration efforts. With the growing importance of habitat restoration for caribou and other vertebrate species, we recommend longer-term monitoring combined with landscape-scale comparisons of different restoration approaches to more fully understand and direct these critical conservation investments. Only by combining rigorous multispecies monitoring with large-scale restoration, will we effectively conserve biodiversity within rapidly changing environments.

AB  - In grazing ecosystems, mature seeds fall directly to the soil to form the soil seed bank (SSB), or are ingested by grazing livestock to become part of the dung seed bank (DSB; i.e., seed circulation). Both the SSB and DSB form the basis for the natural regeneration of vegetation. However, little is known about the relationships between the SSB, DSB, and aboveground vegetation (AGV) community under different stocking rates (SRs). This study investigated the relationships between the SSB, seeds in Tan sheep (Ovis aries) dung, and AGV at different SRs (0, 2.7, 5.3, and 8.7 sheep ha(-1)) in a semiarid region of the Loess Plateau in China. We found that Tan sheep grazing increased the species richness heterogeneity of grassland vegetation, and negatively influenced the density of AGV. Under natural conditions, 17 species from soil-borne seeds and 10 species from Tan sheep dung germinated. There was low species similarity between the soil and DSBs and AGV. Sheep SR and the seed banks (soil and dung) were negatively correlated with AGV. Seeds are cycled from herbage to livestock to soil during cold season grazing; the seasonal nature of this seed dispersal is an adaptation to harsh, semiarid environments. Increased seed bank diversity under sheep grazing facilitates grassland regeneration on the Loess Plateau, similarly to other semiarid regions globally.

AB  - Worldwide, bush encroachment threatens rangeland ecosystem services, including plant biodiversity and forage for livestock. Various control methods for encroaching woody species and restoring herbaceous vegetation exist but have rarely been explored experimentally. We assessed the impact of post-tree thinning management on tree mortality, the herbaceous community, and overall rangeland condition in Borana, an Ethiopian savanna ecosystem. At two 1.4 ha areas of encroached mono-specific Vachellia drepanolobium (whistling thorn) stands, we set up twenty-four 20 x 10 m experimental plots with four post-tree-thinning treatments (goat browsing only (1), prescribed fire (2), fire and goat browsing (3), and control (4) (i.e., no management after tree cutting), with three replications in a complete block design. Over two growing periods, we monitored resulting tree mortality, coppicing, seedling mortality and recruitment, as well as herbaceous layer attributes (diversity, biomass) and overall rangeland condition. All three post-tree thinning management scenarios significantly enhanced tree mortalities, reduced seedling recruitment and increased the abundance of the dominant desirable grass species. Prescribed fire and fire and goat-browsing treatments resulted in significantly greater grass and forb species richness, forb diversity, and biomass, as well as the overall rangeland condition compared to goat browsing only and the control treatment. However, grass species diversity did not respond to treatments. Post-tree management significantly increased tree mortality, reduced seedling recruitment, and increased the abundance of desirable grass species. Our findings strongly suggest that post-thinning management, particularly prescribed fire or a combination of fire and browsing, is highly effective in suppressing woody encroachment and improving biomass and overall rangeland condition.

AB  - Tree diversity and landscape features have long been considered as the main drivers of insect herbivory in forest ecosystems. However, relatively little is known about how local and landscape factors, directly and indirectly, acting at different spatial scales affect insect damage under natural, non-outbreak conditions. Here, 30 mixed and pure forest stands were selected in natural forests along the Irtysh river in Xinjiang, Northwest China. To assess the effects of landscape-scale forest isolation, tree diversity, stand position, tree size, understory vegetation cover, and leaf traits on leaf herbivory on Populus laurifolia, we measured three leaf traits (i.e., leaf area, specific leaf area, and leaf dry matter content) and defoliation intensity of insect herbivores in host poplars in 30 sampling plots within mixed and pure forest stands. We also explored the indirect effects of tree diversity on insect herbivory via changes in leaf traits. We found that both forest isolation and tree height had positive effects on insect herbivory, but vegetation cover negatively affected it. Insect herbivory was lower in mixed than in pure forest stands, however, this difference was only significant in stands at the near distance from the river. All leaf traits differed significantly between mixed and pure stands, and varied with tree height. In addition, insect herbivory was positively correlated with leaf area and specific leaf area. However, the influence of tree diversity and tree size on insect herbivory mainly act indirectly through changes in leaf area and specific leaf area. Our results indicate that insect herbivory can be driven by a complex system of ecological factors at multiple scales, and offer an insight into the key role of leaf traits in driving tree diversity-herbivory interactions in a natural forest ecosystem. Thus, these findings are crucial to improve risk assessment and potential prevention strategies of insect damage in riparian forests in real-world situations.

AB  - Biodiversity and habitats are under threat from many factors such as human population increase, habitat loss, fragmentation, and climate change. In freshwater habitats, including wetlands, biodiversity is expected to decline on a greater scale than in terrestrial ecosystems. Ephemeral wetlands are little studied habitats compared to other wetlands, such as permanent lakes and rivers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the vertebrate fauna present by ephemeral vernal pools and to see whether vernal pools increase the activity and diversity of vertebrates in a boreal forest ecosystem in northern Europe. We studied the activity and species richness of birds and mammals with direct observations, camera traps, feces tracking, and snap-trapping by ten vernal pools and ten permanent wetlands. Bird activity was higher in the spring period in vernal pools than in permanent wetlands. For large mammals, both activity and species richness were greater around vernal pools than by permanent wetlands. Of individuals species, the moose (Alces alces), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and hares (Lepus europaeus and Lepus timidus) used vernal pools significantly more between seasons compared to permanent wetlands. Small mammal activity was higher by vernal pools in April, while in May and June the pattern reversed. In the light of these results, vernal pools seem to have different importance and use depending on the vertebrate group, e.g., for sheltering, foraging, resting, nesting, or thermoregulation.

AB  - The population status of the IUCN vulnerable Nubian Ibex Capra nubiana is largely unknown in the Middle East because of difficulties conducting intensive surveys. We tested the utility of camera-trapping at permanent water sites to estimate demographics and population trend of the species in the Dana Biosphere Reserve, Jordan. We also studied the relationship between precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI on water site use by the Nubian Ibex, demographics, and population trend. The Nubian Ibex showed a mean annual productivity of 0.81 neonate/female and an adult female survival of 0.87 which is a lower survival rate than found in other ibex species. The mean potential annual rate of increase of this population (lambda=1.14) was similar to those reported from other ibex species and indicated a viable population. The capture rate of camera traps (number of photographed animals/camera day) was found not to be a reliable index to monitor population trends because water site use was related to environmental conditions that could not be standardized or predicted a priori. Quantifying population demographic ratios using camera trapping allowed for monitoring the status of key population parameters and growth potential of Nubian Ibex populations in the Dana Reserve, and likely can be used to monitor population status and facilitate informed management of similar populations in the Middle East.

AB  - Adaptive multipaddock (AMP) grazing is a form livestock management that uses high stock density, frequent herd rotation, and long adaptive plant recovery periods to produce punctuated disturbances within pastures. This form of livestock management may benefit pasture biodiversity and ecosystem function. Arthropods are key to ecosystem functionality through the fulfillment of many ecological niches in pasture ecosystems like dung burial, pest control, and pollination. However, the effect of AMP grazing on arthropod communities has not been well studied. We assessed the effect of AMP grazing on arthropod community composition. Foliar, soil, and dung arthropod communities were collected from AMP and conventionally grazed (CG) pastures located in the southeastern US. Arthropod abundance, species richness, diversity, and guild composition were compared between grazing treatments. The herbaceous standing plant diversity was recorded in the immediate vicinity of arthropod sampling. AMP grazed pastures exhibited higher foliar arthropod species richness, along with higher foliar and dung guild diversity. The effects of AMP grazing on the arthropod community were likely correlated to changes to the vegetative community resulting from AMP grazing. No differences in pest abundance or species diversity were found between the AMP and CG pastures. This study shows AMP pasture management has a positive effect of arthropod community composition, which is likely to be an important mechanism to facilitating ecosystem services in AMP pastures.

AB  - Investigations into plant-herbivore interactions are of importance for understanding grassland ecosystem dynamics. Our research quantified the effects of vegetation heterogeneity at a patch scale of 30 m on bison space use in a tallgrass prairie through the analyses of the resource utilization function. In addition, we assessed the vegetation heterogeneity associated with bison locations by comparing the patch-scale vegetation characteristics between areas with high and low bison space use through Mann-Whitney U tests. Furthermore, we simulated the interactions between bison and vegetation patches (2 x 2 m) during the early growing season for the lowland topographic positions using agent-based modeling (ABM) as a preliminary study of linking bison foraging site selection with vegetation responses to bison grazing dynamically. The bison grazing strategy in the ABM of the grassland system was adjusted to ensure consistency in the vegetation pattern variations related to bison space use between the simulation and the empirical on-the-ground observations. The results indicated the following: (1) The effects of the patch-scale vegetation heterogeneity on the bison foraging site selection varied across the seasons, which were most evident in the middle of the growing season. (2) A relatively high level of bison space use generally resulted in diverse grassland canopies with high variability and interspersion. (3) From the ABM of the grassland system, it can be implied that bison select patches with high quality and quantity at the beginning of the growing season; as the vegetation quality and quantity improve overall, the bison graze randomly. This pattern was confirmed by observations of the bison foraging site selection in our study site. The ABM proved to be valuable in exploring and elucidating the underlying mechanisms of the grassland dynamics with a native North American grazer.

AB  - Aims Classical theory predicts that herbivores impact herb assemblages and soil nitrogen (N) cycling through selective plant consumption and the deposition of N-rich waste, with effects dependent upon ecosystem N availability. Herbivores are predicted to accelerate N cycling when N availability is high and decelerate cycling when availability is low. However, experimental tests of these theories in natural systems are limited and have yielded contradictory results. California's widespread chaparral shrublands provide a tractable system in which to test these theories. They are prone to periodic crown fire, which temporarily removes living shrub cover, deposits mineral N on soils and allows diverse herbaceous assemblages to dominate the landscape for 3-5 years. Chaparral is also increasingly vulnerable to herbaceous invasion; mammalian herbivory may limit the establishment of non-native herbs in the shrub understory.
   Methods We implemented a 2-year herbivore-exclosure experiment (Hopland, CA) to assess the impact of mammalian herbivory during early post-fire chaparral succession, both on herbaceous plant assemblages and soil N and C cycling. We predicted that, in high-N post-fire conditions, mammalian herbivory would not demonstrate a strong preference for N-fixing herbs, would accelerate N cycling and would reduce the abundance of non-native herbs.
   Important Findings Excluding mammalian herbivores increased herb standing biomass by 54%, but changed neither the relative abundance of N-fixing vs. non-N-fixing herbs nor any measure of N or C cycling. Herbivore impacts on nutrient cycling may not be significant over the 2-year time scale of the experiment and physical effects of herbivore activity could have counteracted the influence of plant litter and animal dung/urine inputs. Mammalian herbivores concentrated their feeding on typical non-native herbs, slightly decreasing their relative abundance; however, mammalian herbivory was not sufficient to stem the invasion of chaparral by invasive herbs or alter C and N cycling over the first 2 years after fire.

AB  - We present a rare insight into the biodiversity of a remote, mountainous area of central Asia and outline challenges to conserve the critically endangered keystone argali (Ovis ammon ammon L.), the largest subspecies of mountain sheep. Existing conservation is set in the context of competition with livestock grazing and disturbance by local pastoralists. We suggest how this pressure would increase as pastures become degraded by a future more arid climate. Focusing on the transboundary population, migrating between the Russian and Mongolian Altai over the Sailugem Ridge, we track historical population numbers. Due to increased protection, the argali's local population is currently growing. However, most argali populations live outside the protected areas where they are forced to compete for forage with livestock. Due to ever-increasing anthropogenic pressures, argali has almost reached the region's environmental capacity, so the number of local populations is decreasing. Consequently, even the current situation requires more areas of protection, and climate change will accelerate pasture degradation, thereby further increasing competition with livestock. We present various ways to predict the impacts of changes in climate, e.g., the "7 M's approach" and grazing pressure and then recommend additional conservation measures acceptable for the indigenous population of traditional pastoralists.

AB  - Introduced in similar to 59 countries and native across Europe and Asia, wild pigs, Sus scrofa, are the most wide-spread swine species in the world. As ecosystem engineers, wild pigs are a significant source of disturbance in introduced ecosystems due to their numerous, complex impacts on ecosystem processes. Wild pigs are often found in the resource-rich habitat of coastal forests. Coastal forests are complex, dynamic systems with tremendous biodiversity. Exposed to recurrent disturbances, the biophysical characteristics of coastal forests contribute to their ability to return to their original state post-disturbance. However, compounding disturbances can weaken this ability and threaten the health and function of the ecosystem. In this review, through the model of the forests of the southeastern United States Coastal Plain, we (1) describe conditions found across the forested coastal landscape, (2) describe wild pig disturbance, and (3) discuss how wild pig impacts can add to significant anthropogenic and climate-related disturbances threatening coastal forests. Through this review, we find that the impacts of wild pig disturbance on coastal forests often have similar effects as anthropogenic and climate change-related disturbances that may enhance these significant threats to coastal forest function and resiliency.

AB  - Abundant food resources in riparian zones provide efficient foraging sites for waterbirds. Herbivory is a key ecosystem process that has widely recognized effects on primary production and vegetation structure and composition. However, there is limited understanding of impacts of waterbird herbivory on riparian zone vegetation. In this study, a bird exclosure experiment with five levels of foraging intensities (no foraging, very little foraging, light foraging, moderate foraging and heavy foraging) was set up in Shengjin Lake to study the effects of waterbird foraging on the community structure of sedge meadows and individual traits of the dominant plant Carex thunbergii. Foraging intensity had little effect on community structure. The dry mass of C. thunbergii decreased with the increasing foraging time. Waterbird foraging reduced leaf dry mass under heavy foraging by 27.7% and root dry mass by 45.6% compared to CK (no foraging). Waterbird foraging increased allocation to shoot growth but had a weak effect on elemental allocation of C. thunbergii. The foraging intensity significantly affected the morphological traits of C. thunbergii. The results of structural equation modeling showed that RSR (root: shoot ratio represents the ratio of dry mass) and RL (root length) are key traits in driving the dry mass decline in the presence of bird foraging. This study may contribute to a better understanding of the adaptability of perennial herb plants to waterbird foraging and maintain the healthy development of wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Sea ice loss, disturbance, and habitat modification by humans can alter functional landscape connectivity, with negative impacts on wildlife. Connectivity facilitates movement and gene flow, and contributes to genetic diversity, metapopulation dynamics, and species range-shifts under climate change. For Arctic ungulates, which disperse over large areas including sea ice, environmental change threatens further isolation. Protecting habitat and its linkages is critical and depends on identifying such areas at commensurate, broad scales. Using caribou, the world's most vagile species, we modelled and mapped the drivers of connectivity across ca. 2 million km2 of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago - where the pace of climate change is among the fastest and caribou are threatened with extinction. First, we quantified hierarchical genetic structure and identified two discrete groups. Next, using circuit theory and simultaneous multi-surface optimization, we tested whether land- and sea-scape heterogeneity or geographic distance better accounted for movement and gene flow within each group. We show that anthropogenic interference is far-reaching. High Arctic Peary caribou displayed isolation-byresistance, where glacier cover, low sea-ice concentrations during fall, and human trails impeded connectivity. In contrast, more southerly barren-ground caribou displayed largely unrestricted gene flow. These divergent outcomes underscore that organism-landscape relationships can vary across space and highlight the importance of intra-specific structure and responses. By leveraging genetic data, our study demonstrates how critical movement pathways can be identified, even for remote and imperilled species. Such knowledge supports broadscale conservation planning, in particular, by accounting for complex organism-landscape relationships, across vast, heterogeneous ecosystems.

AB  - Recurring events like migrations are an important part of the biological cycles of species. Understanding the factors influencing the timing of such events is crucial for determining how species face the pervasive consequences of climate change in highly seasonal environments. Relying on data from 406 GPS-collared Alpine ibex Capra ibex monitored across 17 populations, we investigated the environmental and individual drivers of short-distance migrations in this mountain ungulate. We found that vegetation phenology, including spring growth and autumn senescence, along with snow dynamics-snowmelt in spring, onset of snow cover in autumn-were the main drivers of the timing of migration. In spring, ibex migration timing was synchronized with the peak of vegetation green-up, but more in males than in females. Specifically, a peak of green-up occurring 10 days later delayed migration by 6.4 days for males and 2.7 days for females. This led to increased differences in migration timing between sexes when the peak of green-up occurred early or late in the season. In addition, ibex delayed migration timing when the length of the spring season was longer and when the date of snowmelt on ibex summer ranges occurred later. Similarly, in autumn, prolonged vegetation senescence and delayed onset of snow cover led to later migration. Overall, we observed a high degree of behavioural plasticity, with individuals responding to inter-annual variations in vegetation and snow phenology, even though the extent of these adjustments in migration dates was lower than the magnitude of the interannual changes in environmental conditions. Nonetheless, females could be less plastic than males in their timing of spring migration, likely due to the parturition period following migration forcing them to trade off foraging needs with predation risk. As the identified drivers of ibex migration are known to be and will continue to be largely impacted by climate change, the capacity of ibex to respond to such rapid changes could differ between sexes.

AB  - The Tanintharyi Region in southern Myanmar is rich in biodiversity yet is facing threats from varying degrees of anthropogenic pressure. In this research we examine how anthropogenic pressures are influencing large carnivores (tiger Panthera tigris, leopard Panthera pardus and dhole Cuon alpinus) and their major prey species (wild pig Sus scrofa, muntjac Muntiacus spp., sambar Rusa unicolor, gaur Bos gaurus and banteng Bos javanicus) in the Lenya Reserved Forest and adjacent areas of Sundaic forest. We used data from camera-trap surveys during May 2016-March 2018 and logistic regression to analyse the relationships between the presence of large carnivores and explanatory variables such as human disturbance, landscape variability and changes in prey distribution. Tiger presence was positively associated with the occurrence of gaur and distance to villages. The occurrence of prey did not explain the detection of leopards in the study area. We suspect this was because leopards have a broad diet, including arboreal primates, and their prey was not fully recorded in our camera-trap survey. Dholes were positively associated with wild pigs and the total number of prey but not associated with forest type and landscape variables. To restore the carnivore population and conserve the biodiversity of this area, effective protection of predators and habitat management for large ungulates are crucial.

AB  - Vegetation has a profound impact on climate through complex interactions and feedback loops, where especially regulation of albedo, the ratio of reflected to incoming solar radiation, is important at high latitudes. How vegetation albedo varies along environmental gradients in tundra ecosystems is still not well understood, particularly for ecosystems dominated by nonvascular vegetation. We studied broadband shortwave albedo of open boreal, arctic, and alpine ecosystems over a 2000 km long latitudinal gradient (60 degrees N-79 degrees N) and contrasted this against species composition, vegetation greenness (normalised difference vegetation index-NDVI), momentary ecosystem CO2 fluxes and reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) grazing pressure. High cover of pale terricolous fruticose lichens was the single most important predictor for vegetation albedo, which had a maximum value of 0.389 under clear sky conditions and solar zenith angle 60 & DEG;. To our knowledge, this is the highest broadband albedo recorded for a vegetated surface. NDVI was negatively correlated to lichen biomass (r(s) = -0.56), and albedo (r(s) = -0.19). Gross primary production and ecosystem respiration varied considerably less between plots and vegetation types than albedo. While it is well-known that Rangifer affects climate-relevant aboveground biomass, we here show that its regulation of surface albedo in northern ecosystems may also be of high importance for land-atmosphere interactions. The data presented here thus advocate for an increased understanding of the important and complex role of herbivores and lichen cover in climate-vegetation interactions.

AB  - Extensive grazing carried out freely by exotic goats represents an important source of anthropogenic degradation in seasonally dry tropical forests of Brazil. The presence of these herbivores may negatively impact the local fauna through the reduction of habitat complexity. In this study, we investigate the effect of goat farming in scorpion assemblage from Brazilian seasonally dry tropical forest. Scorpions were sampled in 36 areas (18 disturbed and 18 undisturbed) distributed in three sites in the seasonally dry tropical forest of Brazil. At each location, we recorded a set of local variables such as litter depth, diameter at breast height of trees, vegetation density (trees and shrubs), and detritus (stones and fallen logs). In total, 396 scorpions were collected, distributed across six species and two families. Our results showed that scorpion diversity was negatively affected, with species richness and abundance reduced in areas influenced by goats. Furthermore, in these sites, the composition of the species was also affected, with habitat-generalist species favoring habitat-specialist species. Finally, sites with free pasture of goats presented scorpions with reduced body condition (body mass and size) than sites without goats. Furthermore, habitat degradation caused by free pasture of goats negatively affects the assemblage of scorpions in terms of their diversity and body condition the seasonally dry tropical forest of Brazil.

AB  - The Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim Reserve (Reserve de l'Ouadi Rime-Ouadi Achim) in central Chad supports large numbers of livestock and rare antelopes, and is the site of ongoing reintroductions of the scimitar-horned oryx Oryx dammah and addax Addax nasomaculatus. We present results of surveys conducted during 2011-2019 to examine patterns of relative abundance and distribution of dorcas gazelles Gazella dorcas, dama gazelles Nanger dama and livestock in relation to each other and to water sources in a 3,500 km(2) area in the centre of the Reserve. Dorcas gazelles numbered 7,700-18,000, moving extensively across the area. Livestock varied between c. 2,000 and 68,000 tropical livestock units across surveys, with density doubling in the wet season. Dorcas gazelle distribution was negatively associated with livestock, and livestock density was positively associated with artificial water sources. Dorcas gazelle densities were positively associated with locations where there had been wild fires in the 6 months prior to a survey. Dama gazelles were encountered only 13 times, insufficient to estimate their population size reliably. Opportunistic observations suggest dama gazelles avoid livestock and burnt ground. Our findings highlight the importance of the Reserve. We recommend the designation of a large, well-managed conservation priority zone in the Reserve's core area in which no further development of water resources is permitted. Management of livestock numbers within this zone at or below current levels is essential to integrate national goals for both biodiversity conservation and pastoralism development.

AB  - Do hotspots of plant biodiversity translate into hotspots in the abundance and diversity of large mammalian herbivores? A common expectation in community ecology is that the diversity of plants and animals should be positively correlated in space, as with the latitudinal diversity gradient and the geographic mosaic of biodiversity. Whether this pattern 'scales down' to landscape-level linkages between the diversity of plants or the activities of highly mobile megafauna has received less attention. We investigated spatial associations between plants and large herbivores by integrating data from a plant-DNA-barcode phylogeny, camera traps, and a comprehensive map of woody plants across the 1.2-km(2) Mpala Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) plot, Kenya. Plant and large herbivore communities were strongly associated with an underlying soil gradient, but the richness of large herbivore species was negatively correlated with the richness of woody plants. Results suggest thickets and steep terrain create associational refuges for plants by deterring megaherbivores from browsing on otherwise palatable species. Recent work using dietary DNA metabarcoding has demonstrated that large herbivores often directly control populations of the plant species they prefer to eat, and our results reinforce the important role of megaherbivores in shaping vegetation across landscapes.

AB  - Many ungulate species in Africa range in habitats that vary in type and quality over space and time, but ongoing environmental change is substantially altering their habitats. Identifying key environmental variables that regulate ungulate population densities can guide management actions for effective conservation. We studied the local population density responses of a community of sympatric ungulate species in the Tarangire Ecosystem of northern Tanzania, to a suite of environmental factors that vary over space and time, to quantify population trends, determine the primary environmental correlates of densities, and identify covariation in densities among species. We estimated seasonal densities of five commonly detected species (impala, dik-dik, Grant's gazelle, eland, and waterbuck) based on 7 years of distance-sampling data from 41 replicate surveys of 237 line transects. We systematically analyzed the effects of spatial, seasonal, and annual environmental covariates on variation in transect species-specific densities across space and time. Large fluctuations in climatic factors mediated highly synchronous temporal density variation among all species. We documented more spatial than temporal variation in four of the five species, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity may provide some buffer against temporal variation in the environment. Protection of sufficient habitats and water sources should allow ungulates to respond to a temporally changing world by moving across space. Further, among-species covariation patterns identified two potential ungulate guilds (impala-dik-dik-waterbuck; eland-Grant's gazelle) that should aid in developing efficient and coordinated management actions.

AB  - QuestionFire and grazing, and their interaction, are the main drivers of vegetation structure and plant species composition in many grasslands globally. However, for subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil, the interactive effects of fire and grazing on plant community composition characteristics remain relatively understudied, even though this ecosystem is recognized as fire-dependent with critical importance for livestock grazing.LocationSubtropical grassland in southern Brazil (Santiago, Rio Grande do Sul state).MethodsBeginning in 2017, we established an experiment with three treatments: fire only (F), grazing only (G), and fire and grazing (F + G). Grazing was continuous with ca 1.1 animal unit per hectare annually and prescribed fires were applied annually in winter. We assessed vegetation structure (via percentage of bare soil, height of canopy, and available forage) and plant species composition during spring (November) and summer (March) of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (only summer season).ResultsDifferences in vegetation structure were found among treatments, wherein bare soil, height of canopy and available forage were higher in F, and lower but similar in F + G and G. Plant species richness was equal among treatments, but cover of C3 grasses was higher in F than in other treatments, and shrub cover was lower in F and F + G in comparison to G. In F + G treatment, available biomass for subsequent burning was limited, resulting in lower amounts of fuel, reduced fire spread, and ultimately less total area burned in the subsequent years.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that interaction of fire and grazing can be a useful vegetation management tool for conserving native plant species, increasing availability of more desirable forage plants, and decreasing shrubs (including toxic Senecio species which contain hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids). The singular and interactive effects of fire and grazing suggest the subhumid R & iacute;o de la Plata grasslands are a fire-adapted ecosystem with variable plant functional trait responses facilitating differential dominance. There is a need for future work to address spatio-temporal variability and vegetation heterogeneity.

AB  - The Gabes oasis in the southeastern Tunisia is particularly important as it represents a unique coastal oases in the Mediterranean and the world. Chott Sidi Abdel Salam oasis, with an area of approximately 100 ha, was chosen for this study (2018-2019). Aiming to effectively manage and protect the biodiversity of this coastal oasis, the cultivated vegetable, fungal and livestock diversity were investigated using ecological indicators. Our results indicated that the agricultural system in this oasis is traditionally organized into three vegetation layers: palm trees, fruit trees and herbaceous plants. 41 vegetable species, representing 18 families and 32 genera, have been recorded. The highest values of species richness, species diversity, Simpson's concentration of dominance, Simpson's diversity index and equitability of evenness were registered for the lowest layer. Also, 15 fungal families, belonging to 27 genera and 33 species, were recorded in this oasis where the most frequent fungal species were Erysiphe pisi, Leveillula taurica and Sphaerotheca fuliginea. The ongoing results revealed that sheep (35.91%) registered the highest number of livestock, followed by poultry (32.17%). The findings of this study establish basic information on the overall biodiversity status in Chott Sidi Abdel Salam coastal oasis; some recommendations to maintain and conserve this rare agrosystem are also presented in this paper.

AB  - Plant diversity is a key component of an ecologically stable environment and plays a crucial role in regulating nutrient cycling, energy flow and overall resilience of ecosystems. This study assessed the plant diversity across 4 tehsils (Lahor, Razzar, Swabi and Topi) in district Swabi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. The objective of the study was to examine the interaction between plant communities and ecological dynamics. Also documented the plant diversity of district Swabi, identifying 173 plant species belonging to 61 families. Angiosperms were the most dominant group with 168 species, followed by pteridophytes (3 species) and gymnosperms (2 species). Diverse habitat preferences were observed, with mesic habitats hosting 57.2 % of the species. Herbaceous species were the most abundant (25.4 %), followed by shrubs (25.4 %) and trees (17.3 %). Phenological assessment showed a variety of life cycles, with perennials making up 32.3 % of the species. Albeit, identified threats such as overgrazing (23.6 %) and habitat fragmentation impacted 74 % of the species. Chorotype analysis categorized species into uni-regional (31.2 %), bi-regional (42.7 %) and pluri-regional (20.2 %) distributions, with 8.67 % exhibiting cosmopolitan characteristics. The species abundance heatmap revealed Tehsil-Topi exhibited the highest alpha diversity, while Tehsil-Lahor showed the lowest. Additionally, Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity Heatmap highlights key ecological relationships among plant species. The analysis suggests that Topi is a diverse ecological hotspot, contributing significantly to overall biodiversity in the region. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) further indicates that geographical and anthropogenic influences shape plant diversity patterns. These findings underscore the need for targeted conservation strategies to protect Swabi unique biodiversity.

AB  - Wild boar ( Sus scrofa ) is a widespread megaherbivore that can intensively disturb large areas of its habitat both in its native and non-native ranges, when populations reach high densities. The main problem is its rooting habit, which entails intensive disturbance of the topsoil and herbaceous layer. The extent of concomitant habitat degradation varies across ecoregions; some ecosystems are rather resilient, although the damages are long-lasting in others. In mown meadows, a secondary problem is the inability to resume mowing due to the uneven soil surface of rooted patches. This can lead to both economic loss and a loss of management-dependent biodiversity. We assessed the short-term effects of rooting on vegetation cover and composition in central European permanent hay meadows and tested the utility of manual soil surface resmoothing to enable the continuation of mowing. We found that rooting increased bare soil surface but vegetation recovery occurred within a year. Similarly, high resilience was found for species composition. We could not detect any difference between rooted and intact grassland patches after 1 yr. This short-term perturbation of the composition could be associated with a temporary decrease in grassland specialist species and an increase in ruderal and pioneer species. Soil surface resmoothing was an additional disturbance, but vegetation cover returned to the level of intact grasslands within a year. Vegetation composition needed a slightly longer time (2 yr) to recover than that without resmoothing. We thus recommend the application of manual resmoothing in hay meadows with high short-term resilience to rooting, but a risk of long-term degradation (e.g., shrub encroachment) if mowing is not resumed. In hay meadows with lower resilience (because of, e.g., steep slopes), resmoothing should be applied with caution and may be supplemented with seeding to support the recovery of the vegetation and prevent soil erosion.

AB  - Climate affects seasonality and plant phenology, which can influence seasonal body mass dynamics of herbivores in temperate environments. We investigated long-term trends of seasonal body mass changes in male Alpine ibex Capra ibex. We used SEM to test direct and indirect relationships between body mass, mass changes and environmental and climatic variables. Individually recognizable Alpine ibex were weighed repeatedly between 2000 and 2022 in Gran Paradiso National Park (Italy). Autumn mass increased substantially over these two decades, up to 15% in some age classes. Over the same time frame, both summer mass gain and winter mass loss decreased, suggesting that heavier autumn body mass was due to the cumulative effects of reduced mass loss over several winters. The environmental factor with the strongest effects on winter mass changes was the starting date of vegetation green-up at low altitude, where ibex gather after winter to feed on new growth vegetation. Early springs led to lower winter mass loss, likely because ibex relied on stored fat for a shorter period and had greater access to forage. High population density also increased winter mass loss. Environmental conditions and resource availability, possibly also influenced by density in winter and early spring, seem therefore to directly affect the body mass dynamics of male Alpine ibex, while the effect of summer conditions appears less relevant. By affecting seasonal body mass dynamics, climate change may have consequences for life history and population dynamics of mountain herbivores, for example via earlier access of young males to reproduction.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) grazing represents one of the main disturb for soil and plants in Mediterranean ecosystems. The wild boar grubbing activity of soil mixing is recognizable by disturbance of topsoil layer and modification in main characteristics as decomposition rates, hydrological connectivity, species richness and diversity. These effects depend on grazing pressure and plant cover that shows a different ability to adapt and recover. For these reasons, to shed light on the impact of wild boar activity on soil quality and C dynamics in different Mediterranean ecosystems, i.e. olive grove, managed pine forest, low and high maquis ranging from coastal areas to hilly grounds, were studied. We evaluated the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of soils under different vegetation, with and without the impact of wild boar in "Cilento, Vallo di Diano e Alburni" National Park (Southern Italy). We focused on soil C amount, carbon compounds (carboxyl-C, phenol-C, aryl-C, O-alkyl-C, methoxyl-C, and alkyl-C) and specific labile C fractions (Soluble C, Microbial and Fungal C). The results showed that wild boar overgrazing induced an increase in the soil C and N content and a significant reduction in its soluble fraction, regardless of plant cover. The maquis grubbed soils showed an increase in microbial respiration and mineralisation rate related to the improvement of resource availability and soil aeration stimulating the microbial community, and in particular the bacterial component. In the grubbed soil of pine forests, bacterial biomass as well as the microbial respiration and mineralization seemed to be inhibited. Similarly, a reduced resource utilization of microbial community was found in the grubbed soil of olive grove where an increase in microbial carbon was also detected. The effects of grubbing activities on edaphic community in pine forest and olive grove soils likely revealed a previous stress condition.

AB  - The ongoing transition within forest management towards more biodiversity-oriented practices, such as close-to-nature forestry and retention forestry, may benefit forest fauna such as forestspecialized ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae). However, it remains unclear how forest carabids are jointly affected by these practices in Central European montane forests, which host particularly sensitive, range-restricted carabid species, and where biodiversity-oriented forestry is widely applied. Moreover, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), the most common large herbivore in these forests, is intensively managed to reduce browsing pressure, but it is yet unknown how this may affect carabids, alongside the effect of silviculture. On 66 1-ha plots in the Black Forest region of Germany, we sampled carabids with pitfall traps, measured roe deer abundances using camera trapping, and measured several structural variables directly related to close-to-nature and retention practices, as well as variables describing microclimate and landscape-level forest cover. We found that the carabid assemblage was dominated by forest specialists, with little influence from fragmentation of the surrounding forest. Higher broadleaf share (and canopy cover for montane specialists) was correlated with higher carabid activity-density. Increasing stand maturity (and lying deadwood volume for montane specialists), was correlated with higher species richness. Plots with higher roe deer abundances showed higher carabid richness and activity-density. Assemblage composition changed along the altitudinal gradient, and both richness and activity-density increased with elevation. Thus, carabid communities, including montane specialists and several species of conservation interest, stand to benefit from close-tonature and retention practices, if applied throughout the altitude range of montane forests. Forest carabids may additionally profit from maintaining higher roe deer abundances, but further research is needed to understand this causal link, as well as to weigh the costs and benefits of deer culling for forest biodiversity.

AB  - Understanding wildlife behavioral responses to anthropogenic disturbance is crucial for assessing its effects and managing protected areas. We used camera traps to investigate the behavioral responses of two of the most frequently hunted Bornean ungulate species, bearded pigs (Sus barbatus) and sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), to anthropogenic disturbance in three protected areas in Sabah, Malaysia, that have varying levels of human activity. We found that human activities generally influence the activity patterns of both ungulates, albeit with variations among the sites. Temporal activity levels of both species would be affected by anthropogenic disturbance; temporal activity levels of bearded pigs were generally low where poaching of this species is reported and both species reduced their activity during daytime, the period of highest probability of encountering humans. Bearded pigs approached plantations during times of low human activity, presumably to forage, indicating that they adjust their spatiotemporal activity patterns to minimize human contact. Conversely sambar deer approached plantations when humans were active during the daytime, suggesting acclimation to non-lethal human contact to maximize energy intake. We observed a reduction in active times for both species at sites of high anthropogenic disturbance. Despite these challenges, both species demonstrated behavioral adaptability to anthropogenic disturbance by utilizing artificial environments such as roads and oil palm plantations probably as foraging places, thereby potentially compensating for reduced active times especially for feedings. Our study underscores the negative impact of human activities on the activity patterns of these two ungulate species. Meanwhile, they showed behavioral plasticity to anthropogenic disturbance by utilizing food resources in artificial environments efficiently. Our findings highlight the need for additional research into the behavioral responses of ungulates in Southeast Asia.

AB  - With progressing climate change, increasing weather extremes will endanger tree regeneration. Canopy openings provide light for tree establishment, but also reduce the microclimatic buffering effect of forests. Thus, disturbances can have both positive and negative impacts on tree regeneration. In 2015, three years before an extreme drought episode hit Central Europe, we established a manipulation experiment with a factorial block design in European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)-dominated forests. At five sites located in southeastern Germany, we conducted three censuses of tree regeneration after implementing two different canopy disturbances (aggregated and distributed canopy openings), and four deadwood treatments (retaining downed, standing, downed + standing deadwood and removing all deadwood), as well as in one untreated control plot. In addition, we measured understory light levels and recorded local air temperature and humidity over five years. We (i) tested the effects of experimental disturbance and deadwood treatments on regeneration and (ii) identified the drivers of regeneration density as well as seedling species and structural diversity. Regeneration density increased over time. Aggregated canopy openings supported species and structural diversity, but reduced regeneration density. Tree regeneration was positively associated with understory light levels, while maximum vapor pressure deficit influenced tree regeneration negatively. Deadwood and browsing impacts on regeneration varied and were inconclusive. Our study indicates that despite the drought episode regeneration in beech-dominated forests persisted under moderately disturbed canopies. However, the positive effect of increased light availability on tree regeneration might have been offset by harsher microclimate after canopies have been disturbed.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances are increasing worldwide, causing wildlife habitat loss, alteration, and fragmenta-tion. In Canada, the decommissioning of linear anthropogenic structures is identified as a promising tool to restore the habitat of threatened populations of boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) by reducing food availability for alternate prey and decreasing encounter probabilities with predators. In this study, we monitored the use of 40 km of decommissioned forest roads by caribou, gray wolves (Canis lupus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and moose (Alces americanus) 1-3 years after reclamation, using 232 motion-activated camera traps. We compared four additive treatments (meaning that each successive treatment included the treatment prior): closing the road to human access, decompacting its soil, planting black spruce (Picea mariana) trees, and adding enriched soil. We assessed the influence of treatments, use by other large mammals, and characteristics of the surrounding environment on road use by the four species. Caribou used the planted treatment (which also included closing and decompacting) more than the closed-only (reference) treatment, but treatments did not influence the use of decommissioned roads by bears and moose. We could not assess the use of treated roads by wolves because of low sample size. Road use by caribou declined with local moose density, but increased with local bear density. Caribou were observed more frequently on roads surrounded by regenerating and mature coniferous stands; caribou also preferentially used roads surrounded by wetlands. Our results suggest that the treatment combining road closure, soil decompaction, and tree planting could be beneficial to caribou, high-lighting the relevance of including active restoration efforts in caribou conservation programs. We recommend that such a treatment be added to road decommissioning protocols for the conservation of caribou, alongside broad-scale habitat

AB  - Plant-herbivore networks comprise over 40% of the global biodiversity and are negatively impacted by habitat loss and fragmentation. However, the extent to which these networks are affected by chronic anthropogenic disturbances and aridity, the most common threats to biodiversity in dry forests, remain unknown. In this study, we examined plant and insect herbivore communities and their interaction networks facing chronic disturbance and aridity gradients in the Caatinga dry forest of northeast Brazil. Our results indicate that aridity and disturbance differentially influenced plant and insect communities. Aridity was accompanied by a reduction in the richness of plant, but not insect species. In contrast, while disturbance was associated with an increase in species richness of sap-sucking insects, it remained unrelated to plant richness. Both aridity and disturbance were identified as factors shaping plant community composition, while insect assemblages only corresponded to aridity. Aridity, but not disturbance, was consistently accompanied by a reduction in network metrics. More precisely, aridity was negatively correlated with network specialization and with the modularity of local webs. Our results also showed that aridity can alter the specialization of specific insect species, suggesting that not only species composition changes can be a key factor modifying network topology, but also shifts in insect behavior across environmental gradients. Our key takeaways are: (1) aridity adversely impacts the dry forest plant community; (2) disturbance can benefit insect feeding guilds such as sap-sucking; and (3) aridity can provoke less specialized interactions at both, species, and network levels. Implications for insect conservation Our results show that aridity disrupts plant-insect herbivore interactions and may trigger cascading extinctions of insect species by reducing the specialization level of their interaction networks.

AB  - Ant species are highly sensitive to environmental changes, and ant community structure can be shaped by environmental heterogeneity and interspecific interactions. We tested 2 hypotheses: (1) vegetation structure negatively affecting ant diversity in simplified habitats and (2) interspecific interactions shaping ant communities. We collected ants on shrubs distributed in 16 sampling units of 100 m2 using the entomological umbrella and beating technique in a regenerating Cerrado area of Brazil. The richness, abundance and average height of the plants were used as a measure of environmental heterogeneity. A total of 457 ants belonging to 17 species were sampled. We observed higher ant species richness in plots with greater plant abundance and lower plant height. We observed a negative relationship between ant abundance and plant height per plot. These results corroborate that vegetation structure negatively affects ant diversity in simplified habitats. The observed values of co-occurrence index differed from the expected values of simulated matrices, suggesting that competition shaping ant community in simplified habitats. We highlight the importance of conserving small trees, especially in structurally less complex habitats, because they represent key elements that harbor high ant species diversity.

AB  - Understanding causal mechanisms of decline for species at risk is critical for effective conservation. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) face threats from habitat loss and degradation due to human activities, and many caribou populations across Canada have experienced dramatic declines in recent decades. Disturbance-mediated apparent competition (DMAC) has been implicated in many of these declines, but its generality has been questioned, particularly for low-productivity caribou ranges. The DMAC hypothesis leads to the following predictions: 1) a vegetation productivity pulse after disturbance, 2) primary ungulate prey attraction to disturbed areas, 3) predator attraction to primary prey and disturbance, and 4) increased caribou predation risk due to overlapping habitat use with primary prey and predators. We tested these predictions for the declining Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou population, located in the low-productivity Chilcotin Plateau region of west-central British Columbia, Canada. We used a remotely sensed productivity index to examine vegetation recovery patterns after disturbance and used camera traps and Bayesian mixed effects negative binomial regression models to estimate the responses of primary prey, predator, and caribou relative abundance to landscape disturbances <40 years old, interacting species, and other habitat features. We identified a productivity pulse in harvested and burnt forest patches, but overall productivity was lower than in other caribou ranges where DMAC occurs. Primary prey, moose (Alces alces) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), showed strong positive responses to burnt areas and weak positive responses to harvested forest. For predators, wolves (Canis lupus), black bears (Ursus americanus), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) were positively associated with primary prey species, while coyotes (Canis latrans) and Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) were more strongly associated with snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), and wolverines (Gulo gulo) were not associated with any focal prey species. Wolves, grizzly bears, and wolverines were not associated with habitat disturbance, but black bears, coyotes, and lynx responded positively to burned and harvested areas. Caribou did not have reduced relative abundance in harvested forests or burns, potentially increasing their overlap with predators. Overall, we found mixed support for DMAC for the Itcha-Ilgachuz caribou population, with stronger evidence for a pathway mediated by disturbance from forest fire, rather than forest harvest. We recommend further research and action on wildfire management for the recovery of this population, including monitoring population trends of caribou and interacting species in response to habitat management. Our results emphasize the context-dependency of mechanisms of decline for caribou and underscore the need for population-specific knowledge to effectively conserve threatened species.

AB  - Windstorms are natural factors in vegetation dynamics, but their intensity is increasing and undermines the forest resilience. Post-event interventions depend on forest types and management purposes. To promote mixed stands that are less susceptible to windthrow than monocultures, natural tree regeneration is usually recommended. However, wild ungulates attracted by the increased food supply in the new clearings can influence the secondary succession and slow down vegetation recovery. The impact of ungulate pressure on secondary successions in blowdown areas is still poorly known, especially in Mediterranean areas, which is particularly vulnerable to climate stressors. We investigated this topic using a monospecific silver fir (Abies alba) forest of artificial origin in the Apennines as a model system. The forest was left to natural succession after a severe windthrow in 2015, offering the opportunity to establish an ungulate exclosure experiment to analyse vegetation changes over six years. For the whole plant community, cover and height, alpha-diversity (species richness, Shannon and evenness indexes), and species composition were recorded yearly, together with tree seedling density, in open and fenced plots at increasing distances from the forest edge. Ecological and functional traits (proportion of light-demanding and forest specialists, endo-/epi-zoochorous species), and life-forms of the community samples were also analysed. Overall, we found that ungulates significantly influenced the dynamic trajectories of secondary succession. The effects on plant cover and diversity were negative and increased with distance from the forest edge. The presence of ungulates favoured generalist species and endozoochorous taxa. However, distance from the forest edge strongly reduced the latter effect. The average density of tree seedlings was overall high (ca. 10,000/ha), but it was strongly reduced by ungulates for three deciduous species and A. alba, the most browsed species. Natural recolonization after windthrow in Apennine pure silver fir stands may favour the formation of mixed, less susceptible forests, but the current ungulate pressure slows down this process, especially in the areas furthest from the forest edge.

AB  - Throughout the southeastern U.S., white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) are the dominant herbivores and have the potential to impact vegetation communities through selective browse pressure. Previous studies regarding deer herbivory impacts focused on northeastern and midwestern U.S. forests. Additionally, most studies have observed herbivory effects over short timescales (i.e., <10 years). Therefore, we sought to determine deer herbivory effects on vegetation structure and composition among three different ecoregions in Mississippi at 0, 5, and similar to 20 years after exclusion. In 2000, 3 pairs of experimental units were identified in each of the Upper Coastal Plain, Lower Coastal Plain, and Mississippi Alluvial Valley ecoregions. An exclosure treatment was randomly assigned within each pair (averaging 2.7 ha) with the other experimental unit a control. From May-June, vegetation structure and composition were measured among 10 systematic sampling points per plot during 2000, 2005, and 2021. While no treatment effects on vegetation composition and structure were observed, among-year differences suggested a shift in overstory canopy conditions between 2005 and 2021 towards greater basal area and canopy coverage resulting in a decrease in forbs, legumes, shade intolerant species, and high year-round deer-preferred forage species. Deer herbivory effects could have been obscured by overstory conditions, low deer densities, and similar baseline conditions reflecting past herbivory effects. Regional differences in forest structure and composition and exclosure breaches may also be responsible for the lack of treatment effects. Future studies should consider utilizing disturbance to offset prior herbivory impacts and to standardize overstory conditions.

AB  - The UN declaration of the Decade of Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 emphasizes the need for effective measures to restore ecosystems and safeguard biodiversity. Large herbivores regulate many ecosystem processes and functions; yet, their potential as a nature-based solution to buffer against long-term temporal declines in biodiversity associated with global change and restore diversity in secondary forests remains unknown. By means of an exclusion experiment, we tested experimentally the buffering effects of large wild herbivores to avert against long-term biodiversity collapse in old-growth and secondary tropical forests in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where sapling abundance and species richness declined c. 20% over the course of 10 years. The experiment comprised 50 large herbivore exclosure-open control plot pairs (25 at the old-growth forest and 25 at the secondary forest), where 2 m(2) were monitored in every plot during a 10-year period. Large herbivores were able to decelerate diversity declines and compositional change in the species-rich old-growth forest, but only decelerated compositional change in the secondary forest. In contrast, declines in species richness and abundance were unaffected by large herbivores on either forest. The buffering effects of large herbivores were strongly nonlinear and contingent on the initial level of diversity at the patch scale: highly diverse communities suffered the strongest collapse in the absence of large herbivores. Thus, larger buffering effects of large herbivores on the old-growth forest are the logical consequence of large herbivores buffering the many high diversity plant communities found in this forest. Conversely, as the secondary forest held fewer high diversity patches, buffering effects on the secondary forest were weak. Synthesis and applications. Our study indicates that large herbivores have moderate yet critical effects on slowing down community change and diversity loss of highly diverse plant communities, thus suggesting that the conservation of (and potentially trophic rewilding with) large herbivores is a fundamental nature-based solution for averting the global collapse of the strongholds of biodiversity. Its buffering effects on biodiversity loss operate at very small spatial scales, are likely contingent on successional stage and are most effective in old-growth or high diversity secondary forests.

AB  - BackgroundShrub encroachment suppresses ecosystem services of grasslands. Hence, the impact of herbivory and fire as shrub control measures needs to be ascertained for restoration of mesic grasslands.ObjectiveTo assess the impact of fire and wild ungulates on controlling Seriphium plumosum encroachment and restoration of herbaceous vegetation.MethodsFour 50 m x 25 m blocks were selected randomly in a large shrub-encroached site, with blocks demarcated at least 1 km apart in the Telperion Nature Reserve, South Africa. Half of each block was fenced off to exclude wild herbivores (enclosure) and the adjacent half was unfenced (non-enclosure). Two blocks burned in 2020, resulting in the following treatments: fire, herbivory, fire and herbivory combination, and no fire no herbivory. In each treatment, thirty-two 4 m x 4 m subplots were nested to repeatedly survey shrub and herbaceous vegetation.ResultsHerbaceous plant density, diversity, richness, and basal cover declined linearly with increase in shrub cover. All treatments significantly reduced shrub cover, with fire in combination with herbivory reducing it nearly three-fold compared to that in the control. Plant densities and species richness were higher in the treatment with fire and herbivory than in the other treatments, or in the control. For all treatments, the herbaceous canopy cover and diversity were comparable, but significantly higher than in the control.ConclusionsOur findings indicate that integration of burning, and herbivory is best for controlling shrub encroachment and restoration of herbaceous vegetation in mesic grasslands.

AB  - To estimate the effect of browsing on the mountain range of the Sierra de San Francisco, Mexico, we assessed browse species richness and canopy cover and the relative abundance of goats (large flocks), cattle, sheep, and equids (small herds) across 2700 m from pens used to milk goats in 1 lowland and 2 upland mesas, which differ in the sarcocaulescent shrublands that inhabit there. Also, we evaluated the relation between browse species preference by domestic herbivores and their canopy cover. Small ruminants (mainly goats), not cattle and equids, had a greater relative abundance near milking pens and, even more, far from them, which was observed as a ditch-shaped pattern across the distance. Goats did not affect browse species richness across the distance, but they affected the total canopy cover; sites with greater goat relative abundance had less total canopy cover, which was observed as a hump-shaped pattern. Preferred and non-preferred browse species by goats showed increasing and hump pattern across distance. Non-preferred species also showed decreasing and U-shaped patterns. Thus, goats have created trends in browse species canopy cover, stressing the hump pattern in the total canopy cover in lowland and upland sarcocaulescent shrublands.

AB  - Fire and herbivory interact to alter ecosystems and carbon cycling. In savannas, herbivores can reduce fire activity by removing grass biomass, but the size of these effects and what regulates them remain uncertain. To examine grazing effects on fuels and fire regimes across African savannas, we combined data from herbivore exclosure experiments with remotely sensed data on fire activity and herbivore density. We show that, broadly across African savannas, grazing herbivores substantially reduce both herbaceous biomass and fire activity. The size of these effects was strongly associated with grazing herbivore densities, and surprisingly, was mostly consistent across different environments. A one-zebra increase in herbivore biomass density (similar to 100 kg/km(2) of metabolic biomass) resulted in a similar to 53 kg/ha reduction in standing herbaceous biomass and a similar to 0.43 percentage point reduction in burned area. Our results indicate that fire models can be improved by incorporating grazing effects on grass biomass.

AB  - Ecosystem engineers like wild boar (Sus scrofa) can reset successional processes in grasslands, creating open swards rich in bare ground and exhibiting a warm microclimate. However, studies on the effects of soil disturbance by wild boar (Sus scrofa) on butterfly species in calcareous grasslands are missing. Here, we analysed the effects of wild boar rooting in abandoned calcareous grasslands of the Hainich National Park, Germany, on two rare butterflies: marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and Nickerl's fritillary (Melitaea aurelia). We sampled different environmental parameters as well as butterfly frequency and abundance in wild boar rootings and undisturbed calcareous grassland vegetation. Our study demonstrated that wild boar play a vital role as soil disturbing ecosystem engineers for the persistence of the butterfly species. They created early seral stages rich in bare ground, hence a warm microclimate, and host plants. The two fritillary species used almost exclusively (E. aurinia) or even solely (M. aurelia) rooting patches for reproduction. Overall, occurrence and abundance of the butterfly species were best explained by a (i) high host plant abundance/biomass and (ii) warm microclimate. Based on our study, high densities of wild boar and additionally wild herbivorous ungulates, which slow down the expansion of woody plants by browsing, should generally be promoted in the calcareous grasslands of the national park. However, overall, they cannot halt shrub encroachment and thus the continuous loss of calcareous grasslands. Accordingly, we recommend active grassland management, e.g. exhaustive shrub removal followed by large-scale grazing by cattle and horses with low stocking rates.

AB  - Martin A. Simonson, Michael J. Weber, Grace M. Wilkinson and Andrew R. Annear. 2023. Annual changes in water quality and sportfish community structure following commercial harvest of common carp and bigmouth buffalo. Lake Reserv Manage. XX:XXX-XXX.Commercial harvest of common carp (Cyprinus carpio; hereafter carp) and bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus; hereafter buffalo) populations had little detectable effect on shallow lake ecosystems. We tested whether carp and buffalo biomass removal affects limnological variables and fish community metrics across 6 shallow, natural lakes of northwestern Iowa using mixed effects models. Annual commercial harvest of carp ranged from 0 to 71 kg/ha; annual harvest of buffalo ranged from 0 to 356 kg/ha. Biomanipulation (i.e., commercial harvest) of carp was associated with decreases in soluble phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations, but not total phosphorus or nitrogen. Buffalo harvest was unrelated to annual changes in nutrient concentrations but was associated with reductions in chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations. Secchi disk transparency and total suspended solids were unrelated to carp and buffalo harvest. Carp harvest was associated with reduced biomass of large cladocerans but no other zooplankton biomass densities; buffalo harvest was unrelated to zooplankton biomass. Species richness and rake density of aquatic macrophytes were unrelated to carp and buffalo harvest. Carp and buffalo harvest was unrelated to changes in most indices of sportfish abundance, condition, and size distribution. Our results suggest harvest of carp and buffalo <71 kg/ha has little effect on abiotic and biotic ecosystem components on short time scales and highlights the challenges associated with shallow lake restoration.

AB  - Trees and shrubs in suburban forests can be subject to chronic herbivory from abundant white-tailed deer, influencing survival, growth, secondary metabolites, and ecological success in the community. We investigated how deer affect the size, cover, and metabolomes of four species in the understory of a suburban forest in central New Jersey, USA: the woody shrubs Euonymus alatus and Lindera benzoin, the tree Nyssa sylvatica, and the semi-woody shrub Rosa multiflora. For each species, we compared plants in 38 16 m(2) plots with or without deer exclosure, measuring proportion cover and mean height after 6.5 years of fencing. We scored each species in all plots for deer browsing over 8 years and assessed selection by deer among the species. We did untargeted metabolomics by sampling leaves from three plants of each species in an equal number of fenced and unfenced plots, conducting chloroform-methanol extractions followed by LC-MS/MS, and conducting statistical analysis on MetaboAnalyst. The proportion of a species browsed ranged from 0.24 to 0.35. Nyssa sylvatica appeared most selected by and susceptible to deer; in unfenced plots, both its cover and mean height were significantly lower. Only cover or height was lower for E. alatus and L. benzoin in unfenced plots, while R. multiflora height was greater. The metabolomic analysis identified 2333 metabolites, which clustered by species but not fencing treatment. However, targeted analysis of the top metabolites grouped by fencing for all samples and for each species alone and was especially clear in N. sylvatica, which also grouped by fencing using all metabolites. The most significant metabolites that were upregulated in fenced plants include some involved in defense-related metabolic pathways, e.g., monoterpenoid biosynthesis. In overbrowsed suburban forests, variation of deer impact on species' ecological success, potentially mediated by metabolome-wide chemical responses to deer, may contribute to changes in community structure.

AB  - Tree species richness, forest structure, and seasonal fluctuations between rainy and dry seasons can strongly affect trophic interactions in forest ecosystems, but the inter- and scale dependence of these variables remains unclear. Using artificial caterpillars (similar to 18,000 replicates), we analyzed predation pressure by arthropods, birds, and rodents along a tree species richness gradient across seasons in a subtropical tree diversity experiment (BEF-China). The aim of the study was to test if forest structure, in addition to tree species richness, has an effect on predation pressure and to further specify which structural variables are important in driving predation. We assessed the effects of tree species richness and forest structure at the plot and local neighborhood levels. We also included fine-scale placement covariates, plot size, and topographical covariates of the study site. Forest structure and tree species richness independently and interactively affected predation pressure. The spatial scale was an important determinant for tree species richness and structural effects, extending from within plot scales to the overall heterogeneity of the plots' surrounding environment. For example, the effect of branch density in the local neighborhood depended on both surrounding tree species richness and plot-level vegetation density. Similarly, visibility-enhancing factors increased attacks by arthropods (lack of branches in close surroundings) and by birds (open area), depending on the surrounding vegetation. A comparison of structural measures showed that predation pressure can be addressed in much greater detail with multiple specific structural features than with overall forest complexity. Seasonal change also affected predation pressure, with foliage being a stronger attractant in spring, but also by presumable topography-driven study plot differences in sun exposure and humidity between rainy and dry seasons. Our study demonstrates that predation pressure is not simply a function of tree species richness or structure but is shaped by the interplay of structural elements, spatial scale, and seasonal dynamics along gradients of tree species richness and forest structure. The structural and seasonal effects are important to take into account when addressing how current and future biodiversity loss may change top-down control of herbivory and overall ecosystem functioning.

AB  - Disruptive effects have been described on the plants and ecosystems of oceanic islands due to the introduction of invasive herbivores. In the Canary Islands the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) was introduced five centuries ago and currently is widespread in all ecosystems, although in the laurel forests it is very scarce. However, on Morello-Ericetum woodland mostly represented by disturbed laurel forest areas, rabbit density is higher. Here we analyzed the impact of rabbits on the Morello-Ericetum woodland using exclusion and control plots located in 11 sites in the Garajonay National Park (La Gomera Island). Rabbit browsing was assessed for 36 endemic species, 15 of them threatened, which were sowed in both control and exclusion plots. After three years of monitoring, our results show a significant negative effect on the establishment and seedling recruitment for 55% of the analyzed species, especially in summer when the rabbit density increases by nearly 30%. Also, plant growth (in 91% of the species) and flowering rate (36% of the species), were disrupted, which could cause a depletion of the seed bank. Among the five tree species included in the experiment, three were also significantly damaged, so rabbits could be even influencing canopy species, delaying forest recovery. The management of Morello-Ericetum woodland should be countered the effects produced by the rabbits on their tree composition, and to allow the development of an understory where endemic species recover their abundance.

AB  - This study evaluated the influence of human and elephant (Loxodonta africana) utilization of woody vegetation across three land use categories; a protected conservation area (Save Valley Conservancy, SVC), a buffer zone and the adjacent communal lands of MutemaMusikavanhu communities in the Save Valley landscape, south-eastern Zimbabwe. A total of 45 plots were assessed with 15 plots randomly placed in each of the three treatments. The following attributes were compared: tree, shrub and sapling density, tree and shrub species diversity, tree height, tree canopy cover and basal area, elephant dung density, and lastly, elephant, fire and human impacts (e.g., stump and coppicing density) on woody vegetation. Although there were no significant treatment effects (P > 0.05) on fire damage levels, number of stems per tree, alien woody plant density and coppiced woody plant density, human activities and elephant herbivory affected the rest of the measured attributes. Human and elephant herbivory disturbances were intermediate in intensity within the buffer zone where the maximum woody species diversity and the largest basal area were recorded. Elephant impact was high in the SVC and human harvesting high in the communal areas with variable negative consequences for woody vegetation (e.g., increased shrubbiness in SVC and lower tree densities in communal areas). It is likely that with an increasing population of elephants in the SVC and human population increases in Mutema-Musikavanhu communal area, severe disturbance of woodlands is likely to escalate in the Save Valley landscape. At present, the buffer zone serves as a refuge to woodlands, however there is need for continuous monitoring of woodlands across varying land use categories to inform future conservation strategies. ? 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Predators largely affect ecosystems through trophic interactions, but they also can have indirect effects by altering nutrient dynamics and acting as ecosystem engineers. Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are ecosystem engineers that concentrate nutrients on their dens, creating biogeo-chemical hotspots with lush vegetation on the nutrient-limited tundra. Red foxes (V. vulpes) similarly engineer subarctic environments through their denning behavior, and have recently expanded onto the tundra where they now often occupy historical Arctic fox dens. We evaluated the impact of fox denning activity on the spatial behavior of other tundra wildlife by comparing predator and herbivore visits to 12 natal dens and adjacent control sites over two years using camera traps in northeastern Manitoba, where both fox species are sympatric. Both the capture rates and species richness of wildlife were significantly greater at fox dens relative to control sites. Predators were detected almost exclusively on dens occupied by foxes, where they were observed investigating and scavenging prey remains (carrion, feathers), suggesting carcass presence or fox presence attracts predators to den sites. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) also visited dens more often than control sites, likely attracted by the enhanced vegetation typically found on dens. Our results suggest fox ecosystem engineering affects the spatial distribution of herbivores by enriching vegetation at dens, and other predators by providing carrion. Understanding how predators affect other organisms via non-trophic interactions provides an enriched view of their functional roles within ecosystems.

AB  - Most of Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil and can be released as carbon dioxide (CO2) when disturbed. Although humans are known to exacerbate soil CO2 emissions through land-use change, we know little about the global carbon footprint of invasive species. We predict the soil area disturbed and resulting CO2 emissions from wild pigs (Sus scrofa), a pervasive human-spread vertebrate that uproots soil. We do this using models of wild pig population density, soil damage, and their effect on soil carbon emissions. Our models suggest that wild pigs are uprooting a median area of 36,214 km(2) (mean of 123,517 km(2)) in their non-native range, with a 95% prediction interval (PI) of 14,208 km(2)-634,238 km(2). This soil disturbance results in median emissions of 4.9 million metric tonnes (MMT) CO2 per year (equivalent to 1.1 million passenger vehicles or 0.4% of annual emissions from land use, land-use change, and forestry; mean of 16.7 MMT) but that it is highly uncertain (95% PI, 0.3-94 MMT CO2) due to variability in wild pig density and soil dynamics. This uncertainty points to an urgent need for more research on the contribution of wild pigs to soil damage, not only for the reduction of anthropogenically related carbon emissions, but also for co-benefits to biodiversity and food security that are crucial for sustainable development.

AB  - Alpine ecosystems in the arid southwestern United States are vulnerable to climate change. Many of these ecosystems are experiencing increased recreational use and introductions of nonindigenous ungulates. In the La Sal Mountains of southeastern Utah, alpine plant communities support an endemic plant species, Erigeron mancus, 11 plant and two animal species of conservation concern, and a United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service Research Natural Area. Nonindigenous mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) were introduced by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (UDWR) in 2013 and 2014, and recreational use has increased in the intervening period. To evaluate potential effects of mountain goat and recreational use, vegetation monitoring was initiated by the USDA Forest Service in 2016. We used 5 y monitoring data (2016-2020) and generalized linear mixed models to analyze the separate and interacting effects of year, recreational use, and mountain goat use on: (1) populations of plant species of conservation concern; (2) vascular and nonvascular plant cover; and (3) ground cover. Our analyses revealed decreases in proportional frequency of E. mancus at the end of the monitoring. Proportional cover of dominant plant growth forms, especially forbs, declined, while proportional cover of litter and ineffective ground cover (bare soil and pavement) increased. Recreational or goat use were a factor in several of the observed changes, although weather and climate likely also influenced the results. Management complexity arises because of the different missions of USDA Forest Service and UDWR, but adjustments in mountain goat numbers and recreational use may be needed to maintain ecologically resilient ecosystems. Continued monitoring can provide the basis for adaptive management.

AB  - Identifying landscapes that are suitable for both biodiversity conservation and agricultural production is a major challenge. Traditionally, much research has focused on biodiversity conservation outside of agricultural production areas, e.g., in semi-natural habitats. In contrast, recent research has mainly focused on the potential of crop heterogeneity. This includes both compositional (crop diversity) and configurational heterogeneity (field border density). However, if and how crop heterogeneity, and semi-natural habitats interact to shape insect diversity in agricultural landscapes remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the combined effects of crop diversity, field border density, and semi-natural habitats (i.e., grassland proportion, hedge density) on insect diversity. We sampled insect communities from 14 - 17 June 2021 with pan traps in 27 study landscapes (500 m x 500 m) covering independent gradients of these landscape variables and identified a total of 587 insect species with DNA metabarcoding. We found that field border density mediated the effects of crop diversity, grassland proportion, and hedge density on insect richness. At low levels of field border density (i.e., landscapes with mostly large fields), effects were either neutral (crop diversity), negative (grassland proportion) or weakly positive (hedge density). By contrast, at high levels of field border density, crop diversity, grassland proportion, and hedge density all exerted positive effects on insect richness. Responses to crop heterogeneity and semi-natural habitat differed among trophic groups of insects (decomposers, herbivores, parasitoids, predators). While variation in richness of herbivorous insects followed the patterns of the overall richness, decomposer richness was not related to any of the investigated variables. Predator richness increased with hedge density in landscapes, whereas parasitoid richness increased when high levels of field border density and grassland proportion coincided. Our study shows that increasing crop heterogeneity is a viable strategy for promoting insect diversity in agricultural landscapes. However, the effects of the amount of remaining semi-natural habitats, such as grassland or hedges, are mediated by configurational heterogeneity, and vary between trophic groups. Efforts to conserve insects in agricultural landscapes must therefore focus on both increasing the heterogeneity of the crop matrix by promoting crop diversity and increasing the density of field borders, while also maintaining or restoring semi-natural habitats as important source habitats for insect species.

AB  - Managers of protected areas need to balance how they use or preserve their resources, especially regarding 'road ecology'. This study focuses on Kruger National Park's (KNP) common ungulates' response to tourist vehicles. We answered the following questions for impala, zebra, giraffe, blue wildebeest, greater kudu and steenbok: What mediates animal flight and flight distance from a vehicle? How much of KNP is affected by roads? Are ungulates using or avoiding roads? We sampled 55.9% of KNP's tourist roads, where we approached animals and determined whether and how far they fled. We georeferenced sightings and estimated the amount of land area along KNP's tourist roads where animals would be expected to flee from vehicles. Of 517 animal sightings, Impala were sighted most (263) and steenbok least (32). Impala had the highest flight propensity (42.6%) and wildebeest lowest (13%). Steenbok were found closest to the road (22.13 m) and wildebeest furthest (77.6 m). Impala had the closest tolerance distance (16.63 m), with zebra furthest (44.74 m). Impala fled the least distance (9.93 m) and zebra fled furthest (24.52 m). Binary logistic regressions (BLRs) showed that all species fled more consistently when closer to the road. The amount of KNP affected by animal flight based on BLRs was largest for zebra (2.32% of the park) and smallest for kudu (0.84%). Impala used the first 10 m of the roadside more than expected and 10-20 m from the road less. KNP's ungulates are habituated to vehicles since flight propensity was low, distribution analysis showed no-road avoidance, flight distance was short, and animals > 50 m from the road generally do not flee. Given the amount of KNP that is already affected by vehicle traffic, as tourism increases, the land solely devoted to wildlife will necessarily decrease. This study aims to provide information for the best management of roads and traffic in KNP.

AB  - Large herbivore communities are changing globally, with populations of wild herbivores generally declining while domestic herbivore populations are increasing, influencing ecosystem function along with the impacts of climate change. Manipulative experiments have rarely captured the interaction between patterns of large herbivore assemblage change and climatic conditions. This interaction may affect the functional traits and functional diversity of herbaceous communities; this requires investigation, as these metrics have been useful proxies for ecosystem function. We used a large herbivore exclosure experiment replicated along a topo-climatic gradient to explore the interaction between climate and herbivore assemblage on community-level functional traits and the functional diversity of herbaceous plant understories. Our findings demonstrate interacting effects between large herbivore assemblages and climate. We found a shift from drought-tolerant traits to drought-avoidant traits with increasing aridity, specifically with regard to plant leaf area and specific leaf area. We also determined that plant community responses to grazing changed from an herbivore avoidance strategy at drier sites to a more herbivore-tolerant strategy at wetter sites. We observed that the effects of herbivores on community-level traits can sometimes counteract those of climate. Finally, we found that cattle and large wild herbivores can differ in the magnitude and direction of effects on functional traits and diversity.

AB  - The impacts of grazing on rangelands have historically been studied within the framework of the equilibrium model, which predicts significant impacts of grazing on ecosystems. However, in recent decades, studies have observed a non-equilibrium pattern, suggesting that abiotic factors play a primary role compared to grazing. These studies are primarily focused on rangelands, despite animal husbandry occurring in other biomes, such as seasonally dry tropical forests. Our study examines the influence of goat grazing on biodiversity and forest succession in the Brazilian dry forest ( Caatinga ). Considering its high interannual precipitation variability, we hypothesize a response that aligns with the non-equilibrium paradigm. We established a gradient of grazing intensity and history in areas at different stages of vegetation succession. A survey of tree- shrub and herbaceous species was conducted at each site and the biomass of both strata was quantified. Linear mixed models and Permanova were employed to assess differences in richness, composition, structure, and biomass among the areas. Our results suggest that grazing (history and intensity) and forest fallow age did not affect species richness, but only species composition. Low and high grazing intensity drive ecosystems toward similar compositions, which align with the non-equilibrium model predictions. Biomass in the herbaceous layer remained unaffected by grazing history, intensity, or forest fallow age, whereas woody biomass was influenced by grazing intensity in older forest fallows. Although trees in low-intensity grazing sites were significantly taller compared to those in other levels, overall, grazing did not disrupt the natural succession process. Older forest fallows exhibited greater diversity and higher basal area compared to new forest fallows, irrespective of grazing intensity. Our findings suggest that: a) grazing has minimal effects on biodiversity and biomass due to non-equilibrium dynamics, and b) with appropriate management, grazing can coexist with the conservation of the Caatinga.

AB  - Climate change is threatening the persistence of many tree species via independent and interactive effects on abiotic and biotic conditions. In addition, changes in temperature, precipitation, and insect attacks can alter the traits of these trees, disrupting communities and ecosystems. For foundation species such as Populus, phytochemical traits are key mechanisms linking trees with their environment and are likely jointly determined by interactive effects of genetic divergence and variable environments throughout their geographic range. Using reciprocal Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii) common gardens along a steep climatic gradient, we explored how environment (garden climate and simulated herbivore damage) and genetics (tree provenance and genotype) affect both foliar chemical traits and the plasticity of these traits. We found that (1) Constitutive and plastic chemical responses to changes in garden climate and damage varied among defense compounds, structural compounds, and leaf nitrogen. (2) For both defense and structural compounds, plastic responses to different garden climates depended on the climate in which a population or genotype originated. Specifically, trees originating from cool provenances showed higher defense plasticity in response to climate changes than trees from warmer provenances. (3) Trees from cool provenances growing in cool garden conditions expressed the lowest constitutive defense levels but the strongest induced (plastic) defenses in response to damage. (4) The combination of hot garden conditions and simulated herbivory switched the strategy used by these genotypes, increasing constitutive defenses but erasing the capacity for induction after damage. Because Fremont cottonwood chemistry plays a major role in shaping riparian communities and ecosystems, the effects of changes in phytochemical traits can be wide reaching. As the southwestern US is confronted with warming temperatures and insect outbreaks, these results improve our capacity to predict ecosystem consequences of climate change and inform selection of tree genotypes for conservation and restoration purposes.

AB  - Beavers can change habitat composition by cutting down trees, digging, and damming activities, thereby affecting species richness and abundance. Although there is large body of literature regarding the effects of beaver activity on a wide range of taxonomic groups, relatively little is known about how space use by ungulates is affected by beavers in the human-dominated landscapes of Europe. Here, we present a case study from Denmark that investigated potential effects of beaver activity on mammals, with a special focus on roe deer and red deer. Beavers could either facilitate the presence of deer by providing food resources (increased abundance of deciduous trees and shrubs) or compete with them for resources. Using transect counts recording both cut and uncut stems of woody plants, we describe beaver browsing patterns, providing evidence that they either select for areas with higher woody vegetation richness and diversity, or alter woody plant species composition. We then assessed deer presence and relative abundance in relation to the distance from water and in areas with varying beaver activity. Our findings provide limited evidence for exploitative competition between beavers and roe and red deer, as roe and red deer avoided proximity to water in areas with high beaver activity, and deer numbers were higher in areas with low beaver activity. We speculate that the weak effect of beaver activity on deer (and/ or vice versa) might be related to the large human impacts in the area, e.g., forest management, potentially superseding effects of interspecific competition. An improved understanding of the complex effects beavers can have on ungulates in human-dominated landscapes will be relevant for wildlife and forestry management, potentially being an important tool to reduce human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - The introduction of mammalian herbivores negatively affects insular vegetation, especially plant species with narrow distributions that are vulnerable to herbivory or that evolved in the absence of native mammal herbivores. Eradication programs have been performed on many islands worldwide, though assessment of the responses of vegetation is crucial to guarantee the success of these programs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate vegetation recovery after a reduction in the feral goat population on Es Vedr`a, an islet in the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean Basin). We monitored nine permanent plots in three different habitats (rocky areas, grasslands, shrublands) to evaluate the variation in plant coverage, functional traits and diversity indexes over time. We obtained data for each plot by annual field sampling in mid-May of 2016-2019. We observed a significant recovery of the predominant species in each plant community and an increase in many functional traits. We found significant variation in taxonomic diversity in rocky areas and grasslands, but not in shrublands, and functional diversity only varied in rocky areas. Therefore, plant diversity benefited from the reduction in the goat population and functional redundancy increased in rocky areas, improving the capacity to respond against disturbances. However, the reduction in the goat population was not sufficient to preserve plant communities and negative effects reappeared in 2019, coinciding with the increase in the goat population. Therefore, absolute eradication of introduced herbivores represents a unique, efficient strategy to guarantee the ecological restoration of affected habitats in microinsular ecosystems.

AB  - Fire and grazing play an important role in managed rangeland ecosystems. These disturbances interact to shape plant communities and outcomes for rangeland biodiversity and livestock production. However, managers have a limited toolbox to reach vegetation management goals in shrub-steppe ecosystems. It is commonly assumed that deferring grazing for up to two growing seasons after a fire is necessary to ensure plant community recovery. We report on a 4-year long replicated experiment comparing the effects of season of fire (spring or fall) and sheep grazing deferment on sagebrush-steppe rangelands in east Idaho, USA. Deferment treatments included either no grazing for one or two growing seasons after fire, or no deferment, in which domestic sheep returned in the season after fire. We found no evidence that grazing deferment affected plant community composition in any plots compared to no grazing deferment, but deferred areas did have more litter relative to grazed areas 4 years after the fire. Burn treatment had a consistent effect on plant communities. One year after fire, spring and fall burned plots had 24 and 30% reductions in native shrub cover, respectively. After 4 years, fall and spring burned areas had moderate, statistically significant (14 and 9%, respectively) reductions in litter. Burned areas had less than 6% increases in perennial native grass cover, but no significant increases in invasive plants. The effects of fire and grazing management tools is context-dependent across climatic gradients in the sagebrush biome. At our study site, prescribed fire seasonality and grazing deferment have important economic but relatively moderate ecological implications.

AB  - Resource dynamism in seasonal forests leads ungulates to differential habitat preference; hence, their distribution aligns with environmental covariates across spatial and temporal scales. Seasonal patterns of four species of ungulates, namely sambar, chital, nilgai, and wild pig, were investigated and identified as the environmental variables driving the density gradient across two seasons, summer and winter, in the tropical dry deciduous forest of Panna Tiger Reserve, central India. Distance sampling data were analyzed using density surface modeling for ungulates with a survey effort of 518 km in winter and 356 km in summer in a generalized additive modeling framework. We found that season significantly affected the spatial densities of all ungulates, with sambar, chital, and nilgai congregating in summer and wild pig in winter. All ungulates showed a clear seasonal shift to the valley in summer and preferred plateaus in winter. The spatially explicit map outputs draw attention to the seasonal hot spots for ungulates abundance and the species and season-specific roles of environment variables in defining their distribution. These results provide a scientific basis for direct conservation efforts to the spatially prioritized habitats for cost-effective management interventions.

AB  - Understanding the factors driving species distribution patterns and diversity is fundamental to community ecology and prerequisite for undertaking biodiversity conservation and resource management. The mountains of Southwest China exhibit substantial environmental heterogeneity and harbor an exceptionally rich variety wildlife, making this an ideal region for studying species distribution and diversity. To investigate those factors driving wild ungulate diversity and elevational distribution patterns, here we conducted a systematic camera trapping survey from 2013 to 2024 in Gongga Mountain National Nature Reserve, Sichuan Province, China. Ten ungulate species were recorded, with tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus) having the highest relative abundance index. The ungulate species diversity exhibited a hump-shaped distribution pattern along the elevational gradient (2200 m - 4900 m), with peak species richness primarily occurring between 2800 - 3700 m. The elevational distribution pattern of ungulate species richness was primarily driven by three factors: the mid-domain effect, climate conditions, and primary productivity. Our findings on the factors driving elevation patterns in ungulate species richness in the GMNNR provide critical insights into the ecological requirements of ungulates in montane regions generally, useful for informing conservation strategies. Future research on ungulate distribution factors should focus on improving monitoring systems to obtain more comprehensive species data, and on exploring more nuanced impacts of climate and human disturbances.

AB  - Top-down control by large herbivores is a well-known driver of plant diversity structure and productivity. Yet, for forest ecosystems the sign and magnitude of herbivore control across resource gradients is not well understood. We conducted a series of replicated large herbivore exclusion experiments in defaunated and non-defaunated Atlantic forests of Brazil to evaluate the effects of large herbivores on tropical plant communities. We hypothesized that the top-down impact of large herbivores on seedling recruitment, species richness, diversity and productivity would change across a natural gradient in the density of a key plant resource, the palm Euterpe edulis, which is thought to act as a foundation species. We found both positive (agonistic) and negative (antagonistic) spatially-structured effects of large herbivores on plant communities driven by an interaction between large herbivores and palm density on non-defaunated sites, but not on defaunated sites. Indeed, through its interaction with large herbivores, palm trees were able to regulate the spatial structure of seedling communities. In the non-defaunated forest, the negative impact of large herbivores on plant recruitment and species richness decreased substantially as palms became more abundant and canopy cover decreased. Furthermore, large herbivores caused a 185% increase but a 194% decrease in aboveground seedling productivity in areas of high and low palm density, respectively. In contrast, in the defaunated forest we did not find any consistent large herbivore impacts on plant recruitment or species richness across the gradient of palm density, and herbivore activity consistently had negative effects on seedling productivity. Analyses using camera trap data indicate that white-lipped peccaries (Tayassu peccari) played a key role in modulating recruitment and seedling productivity, while tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) contributed significantly to an increase in plant diversity, hence playing a functionally complementary role. Our results demonstrate that a key interaction between large forest-dwelling tropical herbivores and their palm resource results in landscape-scale modulation of plant communities through positive and negative spatially-structured feedbacks, and support the view that palms might act as foundation species in tropical forests. Anthropogenic pressures posed by defaunation and illegal palm harvesting in the Neotropics might lead to the functional loss of this interaction and the collapse of the spatial structure along palm density gradients, with cascading effects on the dynamics and productivity of tropical forests.

AB  - Overgrazing by sheep causes degradation of grasslands in the Inner Mongolian steppe, yet our understanding of its impact on grassland plant communities is limited by lack of observations at high spatial resolution. Employing a nested experimental design in a long-term grazing experiment provides insights into effects of increasing sheep grazing intensity on community composition, diversity, and spatial patterns in the grassland vegetation. Effects of observed changes in the plant community are discussed based on monthly weight gain of sheep during grazing. The design of the long-term experiment included four triplicated grazing intensities applied during an 8-year period. At the end of that period, we evaluated vegetation coverage, categorized plant species by functional groups, and analyzed the data using a mixed linear model. Moreover, spatial autocorrelation methods were employed to investigate spatial patterns, visualized via a kriging model. We found that the plant community composition differed among grazing treatments, with high grazing intensity showing higher plant species richness and stronger clustering of plants at our fine scale of observation. These fine-grained spatial scale observations are usually not recorded in larger spatial scale analyses of grassland responses to overgrazing. While the grazing intensities used in our study did not influence individual sheep weight gain, total sheep weight gain per hectare increased with an increase in grazing intensity. Our study shows that in a sheep grazing intensity experiment in Inner Mongolia grasslands total sheep weight gain may increase at the expense of fine-scale species composition and spatial dynamics of the grassland vegetation. These insights may be used for determining tradeoffs of sheep meat production with original composition and structure of grassland plant communities. Effects on other ecosystem properties and functions, such as on belowground biodiversity, remain to be assessed.

AB  - Wood decomposition is faster in open habitats than closed-canopy forests, with the mechanisms unclear. When allowing access, termites outcompete fungi during wood decomposition. If increasing canopy density shifts the dominance from termites to fungi, decomposition rates will fall. We conducted wood decomposition experiments in 148 plots of two regenerating forest sites (Site A vs. B) in subtropical China with tree species diversity and composition (for example, specific leaf area) manipulated. Branches of seven species with varying quality were deployed and measured for wood mass-loss rates and decomposer abundance at two time steps (that is, after 1 year and 2 years). We also monitored understory microclimate and predatory ant diversity in 40 plots of Site A. We found that higher canopy density drove the shift of dominance from termites to fungi via facilitating predatory ants and wetter-cooler microclimate. Furthermore, termites promoted decomposition after 1 year especially for the species with highest wood quality, but fungi slowed decomposition after 2 years especially for two species with lower quality. Notably, canopy density negatively correlated with wood mass-loss rates in closed-canopy Site A but not so in more open Site B. Tree diversity and community-weighted mean specific leaf area increased canopy density but did not affect abundance nor decomposition. Our study highlights the importance of canopy density for retarding fine wood decomposition in closed-canopy regenerating forests, probably via shifting the dominance from more (that is, termites) to less efficient decomposer (that is, fungi). Future cross-regional studies are necessary to test the generality of canopy density effect on wood decomposition and the related mechanisms.

AB  - Grazing, a defining use of rangelands, can have immediate and legacy impacts in ecosystems with short evolutionary histories of grazing and where climatic conditions are marginal and variable. In arid rangelands of the Colorado Plateau, domesticated ungulates were introduced in the 1800s at high densities and grazing has been maintained in the region at variable stocking rates for approximately the past 150 yr. Historic grazing practices, combined with a marginal climate, may have caused an irreversible shift in the vegetation community leading to limited recovery with cessation of grazing. Using three exclosures ranging from 12 to 50 yr of age, we evaluated vegetation composition, diversity, and cover inside the exclosures and compared them with directly adjacent, actively grazed areas outside of the exclosures in the fall and spring of 2018 and 2019. We then asked 1) How do exclosures and their adjacent unexclosed sites differ in vegetation diversity, composition, and cover? and 2) Are there significant differences in cover of key forage species in exclosed versus unexclosed areas? Overall, there were significant differences in vegetation communities inside and outside of exclosures in both seasons. Composition, alpha, and beta diversity differed between grazed and exclosed sites, with higher alpha and beta diversity in the 50-yr exclosure in the fall. Composition was significantly different between exclosures and unexclosed sites at all sites and in all seasons. Cover of several important forage grasses (Achnatherum hymenoides, Hilaria jamesii, Elymus elymoides) was higher in exclosed areas, while cover of Scleropogon brevifolius and Bouteloua gracilis was higher in unexclosed areas. Taken together, these results indicate limited recovery of vegetation in the absence of grazing, with exclosures exhibiting higher plant diversity, as well as cover of some desirable forage species, suggesting this area has not undergone irreversible state change but recovery may require > 50 yr of grazing cessation.

AB  - Lowland tropical rainforests harbor the most diverse plant communities in the world, but the herbaceous plants of the understory are often overlooked. To address this knowledge gap, we asked to what extent the understory herbaceous community contributes to the species richness and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities by surveying a neotropical rainforest at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We used Gentry transects to characterize the woody overstory community, and line-intercepts within the same transects to survey understory herbs and subshrubs. We also used published phylogenies to calculate community phylogenetic diversity with and without the understory stratum. We found that the understory contained a diverse (23 species, or 22.1% of all species surveyed) and phylogenetically distinct plant community dominated by aroids (13 species) and ferns (4 species). Inclusion of the understory stratum increased total species richness by 28.4% but increased phylogenetic diversity by 41.4%. Additionally, in contrast to temperate forests, the understory plant community was much less diverse than the overstory, which contained 81 species > 1 cm dbh (77.9% of all species surveyed). This survey adds to the hitherto small body of literature comparing understory and overstory strata in tropical rainforests and reveals previously overlooked patterns of floristic diversity.

AB  - Current grassland restoration strategies aim to recreate grassland vegetation communities, and often rely on high-diversity native seeding to promote vegetation diversity. Questions remain concerning the influence of vegetation richness and diversity on grassland fauna. Small-mammal communities are integral parts of grassland ecosystems, but their responses to restoration are often mixed or overlooked. During July 2014 to 2016, we used Sherman live traps to survey grassland small-mammal communities of 24 study sites in northeastern South Dakota and southeastern North Dakota, USA, to better understand their responses to vegetation cover type, diversity, richness, and site-specific vegetation structure. Sites represented a vegetation species richness gradient and 3 vegetation cover types including low-diversity restorations planted with dense nesting cover (DNC) seed mix, high-diversity seeded restorations, and unseeded reference grasslands. Small-mammal abundance was highest at low-diversity DNC restoration sites and lowest in reference grassland. Small-mammal diversity was highest at high-diversity restoration sites and lowest at low-diversity DNC restoration sites. Models assessing the influence of vegetation structure on the abundance of focal taxa differed. Deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) were negatively influenced by percent native vegetation cover, and voles (Microtus spp.) showed yearly variation and were influenced positively by litter depth and negatively by vegetation richness. Small-mammal communities of low-diversity DNC restorations differed from reference sites, but high-diversity restorations were not different from reference or low-diversity DNC sites. Thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) abundance was higher at reference and high-diversity restored sites, while low-diversity DNC sites had higher deer mice abundance. Results indicate small mammals are unlikely to respond uniformly to vegetation characteristics, and diversity of seed mixes used in grassland restoration is likely to influence grassland small-mammal communities.
   Current grassland restoration strategies aim to recreate grassland vegetation communities, and often rely on high-diversity native seeding to promote vegetation diversity. We studied small mammal communities on 24 mixed-grassland sites in North Dakota and South Dakota, USA that represented three vegetation cover types: unseeded native reference prairie, low-diversity non-native seed mix, and high-diversity seed mix. Results indicated small mammals are unlikely to respond uniformly to vegetation characteristics, and diversity of seed mixes used in grassland restoration, as well as the resulting grassland structure, is likely to influence grassland small mammal communities. image

AB  - There is evidence that cattle grazing in forests limits big cat abundance. There is concern, too, about competition with wild ungulate prey through bottom-up effects on vegetation. Hence, there have been calls to remove or control forest livestock grazing in aid of restoring endangered large carnivores and their prey. To help inform scientific debate and decision making, we explored cattle-vegetation-prey dynamics in Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park, northeast China and present a reappraisal of livestock grazing in the context of coexistence and an integrated approach to land use in China. Inside long-term forest grazing enclosures, wild boar (Sus scrofa) density increased with cattle density. Roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) density and occurrence probability of wild boar and roe deer were not influenced by cattle density. Wild ungulate densities were not related with the number of annual shoots, i.e., forage plant abundance. The presence/absence and abundance of annual shoots was not related with cattle density. Wild ungulate density had mixed associations with vegetation structure; arbor tree diameter at breast height (DBH) and habitat "openness" increased with cattle density. Finally, inside and outside enclosures had different vegetation characteristics and wild boar densities, while roe deer densities were equal. We conclude that cattle density and associated changes to vegetation have positive, negative, and neutral effects on two wild ungulate prey species. Each of these factors warrant consideration in evidencebased management decisions in regard to regulating ungulate community composition to support different large predators as preferred prey in core areas and corridors of habitats.

AB  - Wild animals can modulate ecosystem-climate feedbacks, e.g. through impacts on vegetation and associated carbon dynamics. However, vegetation cover and composition also affect land surface albedo, which is an important component of the global energy budget. We currently know very little about the influence of wild animals on land surface albedo and the resulting climate forcing of these albedo changes. Leveraging a unique, ecosystem-scale, semi-experimental approach, we study how the local removals of the world's largest, terrestrial grazer, white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum), affected the coupling between fire dynamics, woody encroachment and surface albedo in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), South Africa. Our path analysis revealed that areas in the park where more rhinos had been removed showed a stronger increase in burnt area and woody encroachment compared to areas with fewer rhinos removed, which were both related to a decrease in surface albedo. Increasing burnt area was further associated with higher rates of woody encroachment, indirectly reinforcing the negative effect of rhino loss on albedo. Our study demonstrates that removals of megagrazers in HiP were related to complex ecosystem-wide cascades with measurable impacts on land cover and surface albedo and consequences on climate forcing. This highlights the importance of restoring functional ecosystems by reinstating trophic processes.

AB  - As habitat loss and fragmentation increase globally, biodiversity conservation approaches are increasingly being implemented at the landscape scale to maintain metapopulations of endangered species. The present study investigated the food habits of tiger Panthera tigris in the less protected reserve forests of Begur Range, a wildlife corridor in the Malenad-Mysore Tiger Landscape (MMTL) in India's Western Ghats. Fifty scat samples were collected and analyzed to determine the diet composition. The study recorded seven tiger prey species from the study area. The percentage composition of different prey species revealed that chital (Axis axis) constitutes 63.15% of the overall diet, whereas sambar (Rusa unicolor) and gaur (Bos gaurus) constituted 26.33% each. Contrary to our prediction, the relative biomass of different prey species showed that chital, sambar, and gaur constituted 95% of the overall diet. The presence of small prey species such as the Indian crested porcupine (Hystrix india) and small Indian civet (Viverricula indica) indicates opportunistic hunting behaviour and diverse prey selection by tigers. This study highlights the significance of areas outside the protected area network for conserving large carnivores and ecosystem processes associated with them in the Western Ghats global biodi-versity hotspot.

AB  - Grasslands have been widely grazed for livestock production by cattle and sheep. However, previous studies have mainly focused on the impacts of single-species grazing on grassland biodiversity and ecosystem functions; the effects of mixed grazing of cattle and sheep remain largely unknown. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the impacts of mixed grazing and analyzed the relative roles of cattle and sheep on grassland biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions. Mixed grazing studies mainly originated from Europe, the USA, and China. Generally, cattle and sheep exhibited distinctive impacts on grassland biodiversity and functions in single-species and mixed grazing regimes. Cattle grazing alone increased plant diversity and soil organic carbon content (SOC), while sheep grazing alone had little impact. Compared to single-species grazing, mixed grazing generally increased plant density and richness of insect herbivores and decreased soil nematode richness, but did not alter plant biomass, soil nitrogen, or nematode abundance. Cattle in the mixed grazing regime increased plant diversity, biomasses of forbs and legumes, SOC, and liveweight gains of livestock. The mixed grazing impacts were further regulated by climate conditions, grazing intensity, and grazing duration. Our findings provide compelling evidence that mixed grazing benefits biodiversity, soil carbon sequestration, livestock production, and community structure of grasslands, and cattle are more influential than sheep in creating the benefits of mixed grazing for sustainable management of grasslands.

AB  - Invasive smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) has been expanding rapidly through the coastal wetlands of eastern China and these changes negatively affect local birds. In the Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve (henceforth referred to as DMNNR), rapid degradation of spartina occurs after an increase in milu (Elaphures davidianus; hereafter elk) numbers and ecological hydrological engineering. We evaluated the impact of such degradation on the abundance and species diversity of birds in the DMNNR during 2017-2021. We found that the area covered by S. alterniflora decreased significantly in the study area at a rate of 310 ha per year and by 62% during 2017-2021 (p < 0.01). With this decrease in the S. alterniflora area, the species richness and abundance of birds first increased and then decreased. Songbird density clearly decreased but species richness did not significantly do so. This research demonstrated that during the initial stages of vegetation degradation, there was a positive effect on bird diversity. With the increasing vegetation degradation increases, both songbirds and waterbirds experience negative impacts. The DMNNR is an important stopover site for waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, and additional measures are needed to control vegetation degradation and to restore the native habitats for birds.

AB  - Mutualisms enhance ecosystem biodiversity, functioning, and service provisioning through direct and indirect positive interactions. However, invasive species can interrupt mutualisms and disrupt ecosystem functions when they affect foundation species and their keystone mutualist partners. In the southeastern US, mussels aggregate around cordgrass stems, a keystone mutualist-foundation species interaction that controls marsh structure, function, and resilience. Invasive hogs trample cordgrass and consume mussels, yet the multi-scale effects of this mutualism disruption remain uncertain. Here, we quantified the effects of hog-mediated mutualism disruption on four critical ecosystem functions: cordgrass biomass, macroinvertebrate biomass, denitrification, and sediment deposition. We compared a hog-disturbed marsh (27% area disturbed) and a hog-free marsh (0.05% disturbed) and experimentally demonstrated that hog predation causes the observed 93% reduction in mussels on the hog marsh. Plot-scale measurements revealed that hog trampling of cordgrass doubles net denitrification rates but decreases cordgrass biomass, crab biomass, and sediment deposition by 74%, 80% and 55%, respectively, relative to areas without hogs. Mussels stimulate cordgrass biomass, crab biomass, denitrification, and sediment deposition by 19%, 39%, 134% and 140%, effects that are only evident in the mussel-dense hog-free marsh. Using hog damage and mussel cover surveys to extrapolate plot-scale measurements to the 20 m2 scale, we estimate that hogs stimulate cordgrass biomass and denitrification by 27% and 5% but, by driving mussel loss, depress crab biomass and sediment deposition by 48% and 38%. Disruption of the cordgrass-mussel mutualism by invasive hogs alters ecosystem functioning, modifications which will likely affect marsh ecosystem service provisioning and resilience region-wide.

AB  - Over the last +150 years, increases in woody vegetation in drylands and associated declines in herbaceous vegetation have led to widespread interest in reversing this trend. However, the effects of native, noncharismatic herbivores, such as lagomorphs, on these efforts are largely unknown. For 11 years post-treatment, we quantified the effects of native lagomorphs on restoration efforts in sagebrush (Artemisia L.) communities exhibiting legacy effects of past management, including depleted understories and overabundant sagebrush. Reducing sagebrush and seeding perennial grasses was necessary to attain substantial increases in large perennial grass cover and density, but this outcome was realized only with lagomorph exclusion. A small native bunchgrass and perennial forb cover and density increased in all treatments with lagomorph exclusion. This suggests that lagomorphs contribute to the persistence of a depleted understory in areas with increased woody vegetation. In areas where sagebrush was reduced, the cover and density of sagebrush was greater with lagomorph exclusion. This suggests that lagomorphs could hinder sagebrush recovery after disturbances that reduce or eliminate sagebrush. Lagomorph herbivory had a substantial effect on vegetation dynamics and affected the outcome of restoration efforts in these dryland systems. This could reduce livestock forage and alter habitat of wildlife species, potentially affecting their conservation. Lagomorphs and other noncharismatic, native herbivores may facilitate the persistence of depleted understories in areas where woody plants have increased. Results of this study suggests that the potential effects of lagomorph and other native herbivores should be considered and addressed in management, restoration, and conservation plans.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities can profoundly affect ecological communities. This is true of the most ubiquitous type of anthropogenic land-use, livestock grazing. While livestock grazing is known to impact vegetation structure, soil, and hydrological features, the effects of livestock occurrence on animal communities are often more complex. Herein, we estimated the relative effects of cattle occurrence and vegetation structure on the occupancy of a carnivore guild in northern California and southern Oregon, USA. We used remote cameras to non-invasively collect detection and non -detection data of cattle and nine carnivore species. We incorporated detection data into a Bayesian hierarchical occupancy model to estimate the effects of livestock occurrence and vegetation structure on carnivore occupancy. We found varied effects of cattle occurrence on carnivore occupancy, with most species showing no clear response to cattle occurrence. Vege-tation structure, including structural diversity and vegetation productivity, had stronger effects on carnivore occupancy than cattle occurrence. This work provides an exploration of the effects of cattle occurrence and forest structure on carnivore space-use in a grazed forest system, and suggests vegetation structure may have stronger effects than cattle occurrence on carnivore oc-cupancy in grazed forest systems. Future work to clarify the direct and indirect effects of livestock occurrence can inform conservation and management strategies in forested ecosystems.

AB  - The current global decline in biodiversity is a matter of pressing concern, necessitating the conservation of diverse ecosystems across various spatial scales. Regions such as the tropical Andes face the imminent threat of biotic homogenization due to intensive livestock grazing, posing a significant risk to biodiversity. This study is focused on the sub-humid grasslands of northwestern Bolivia, within the the National Park Apolobamba. We surveyed a total of 105 plots distributed across seven sites, representing a natural gradient of grazing intensity. Within each site, the plots were organized into five clusters to explore the impact of environmental factors on plant diversity within and among communities. Our research reveals that local plant diversity, quantified by species richness and the inverse Simpson index, is predominantly shaped by soil pH. Notably, more acidic soil is associated with diminished diversity. Furthermore, our findings highlight that the dissimilarity in species composition among local communities may be linked to grazing intensity. This suggests that intensified grazing may have the potential to homogenize plant communities across the landscape. A concerning implication is the likelihood of communities becoming dominated by acquisitive species, leaving them more susceptible to the impacts of climate variability. The study underlines the necessity to analyze multiple facets of diversity for a comprehensive understanding of the environmental factors regulating and therefore to address potential drivers of diversity loss. To mitigate these threats, managers may consider adjusting livestock quantities and the spatial range used by grazers, aiming to sustain multiple aspects of plant diversity and prevent homogenization and degradation of grasslands in a changing world.

AB  - Riparian vegetation in the Okavango Delta has extensive economic, social and environmental benefits. However, despite its importance, it is threatened by changes in variation in hydrology, anthropogenic activities, and other environmental conditions. Some riparian vegetation communities may change rapidly in response to both long term and short term disturbances. Long term monitoring of riparian woodland vegetation can help reveal changes in these woodland species, enabling timeous management interventions. In this study we classified, mapped and conducted change detection analysis of the spatial extent of different communities of riparian woodland in the Okavango Delta. Woodland species were identified in the field and their percentage cover estimated. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis in PC-ORD was used to classify woodland vegetation into four communities. These communities were Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana, Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis, Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum and Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe. Multi response permutation procedures (MRPP) was used to test if there was any significant difference in plant species composition between different vegetation communities. MRPP showed that communities varied significantly (p < 0.05) from each other in composition, which may be indicative of the prevailing environmental conditions in the Delta. Landsat data was used to produce land cover maps at 3 time-steps which were then used in the change detection analysis for riparian woodland vegetation. Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum areal extent increased from 1991 to 2019, whilst Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana decreased. The area covered by Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe and Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis was fluctuating over the study period. The results suggest that the Phoenix reclinata-Syzygium cordatum community is more susceptible to variations in hydrology whilst the Vachellia erioloba-Gymnosporia senegalensis community is more stable. The Croton megalobotrys-Hyphaene petersiana and Vachellia tortilis-Combretum imberbe communities are also susceptible to prevailing environmental conditions including the hydrology, soil nutrient status as well as the occurrence of elephants in large densities in the Delta and anthropogenic activities. This information will serve as baseline for monitoring of riparian woodland vegetation in the Okavango Delta.

AB  - Aboveground ecosystem structure moderates and even confers essential ecosystem functions. This includes an ecosystem's carbon dynamics, which are strongly influenced by its structure: for example, tropical savannas like those in central Kenya store substantial amounts of carbon in soil. Savannas' belowground allocation of carbon makes them important for global carbon sequestration, but difficult to monitor. However, the labile soil carbon pool is responsive to changes in ecosystem structure and is thus a good indicator of overall soil organic carbon dynamics. Kenya's savanna structure is controlled by belowground ecosystem engineers (termites), ambient weather conditions, and the aboveground engineering influences of large-bodied, mammalian consumers. As a result, climate change and biodiversity loss are likely to change savannas' aboveground structure. To predict likely outcomes of these threats on savanna soil carbon, it is critical to explore the relationships between labile soil carbon and ecosystem structure, local climate, and mammalian consumer community composition. In a large-scale, long-term herbivore exclosure experiment in central Kenya, we sampled labile carbon from surface soils at three distinct savanna structural elements: termite mounds, beneath tree canopies, and the grassland matrix. In one sampling year, we measured total extractable organic carbon (TEOC), total extractable nitrogen (TEN), and extractable microbial biomass for each sample. Across three sampling years with varying weather conditions, we measured rate of labile soil carbon mineralization. We quantified areal coverage of each structural element across herbivore community treatments to estimate pool sizes and mineralization dynamics at the plot scale. Concentrations and stocks of soil TEOC, TEN, and microbial biomass were driven by the structural element from which they were sampled (soils collected under tree canopies generally had the highest of each). Large-bodied herbivore community composition interacted variably with concentrations, stocks, and carbon mineralization, resulting in apparently compensatory effects of herbivore treatment and structural element with no net effects of large herbivore community composition on plot-scale labile carbon dynamics. We confirmed engineering of structural heterogeneity by consumers and identified distinct labile carbon dynamics in each structural element. However, carbon and nitrogen were also influenced by consumer community composition, indicating potentially compensatory interacting effects of herbivore treatment and structural element. These results suggest that one pathway by which consumers influence savanna carbon is by altering its structural heterogeneity and thus the heterogeneity of its plot-scale labile carbon.

AB  - There is a growing interest and investment in restoring riparian areas in the Pacific Northwest to protect biodiversity and water quality, and to restore quality habitat for threatened fish species. However, these management activities change vegetation conditions and potentially impact terrestrial species in these ecosystems. Our objective was to estimate associations between small mammals and 4 broad cover types-conifers, shrubs, grasses, and forbs-in riparian areas within the Blue Mountains of northeast Oregon, USA. We estimated abundances and spatial association for 10 small mammal species using a multispecies hierarchical abundance model and mark-recapture data collected on 36 sites from 2014 to 2017. We predicted that forest-associated species would be more abundant with greater conifer cover, that increases in shrub cover would favor most species, and that increases in grass and forb cover would favor grassland-associated species. Yellow-pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) were positively associated with conifer cover, while long-tailed voles (Microtus longicaudus) and montane voles (Microtus montanus) were negatively associated with conifer cover. Associations with shrub cover were positive for bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), and yellow-pine chipmunks, but negative for montane voles. Bushy-tailed woodrats and montane voles were negatively associated with grass cover. This study is the first to characterize the riparian small mammal communities in this region and provides insights on the effects of restoration activities on riparian ecosystems in dry interior forests and grasslands. We suggest that riparian plantings, a ubiquitous restoration practice, will increase the relative abundances for some, but not all, small mammal species. We also demonstrate use of a new multi-species abundance model that can be a powerful tool for analyzing mark-recapture data because it allowed us to extend the scope of our analysis to data poor species by pooling information with data rich species.

AB  - The climate-driven encroachment of shrubs into the Arctic is accompanied by shifts in soil fungal communities that could contribute to a net release of carbon from tundra soils. At the same time, arctic grazers are known to prevent the establishment of deciduous shrubs and, under certain conditions, promote the dominance of evergreen shrubs. As these different vegetation types associate with contrasting fungal communities, the belowground consequences of climate change could vary among grazing regimes. Yet, at present, the impact of grazing on soil fungal communities and their links to soil carbon have remained speculative. Here we tested how soil fungal community composition, diversity and function depend on tree vicinity and long-term reindeer grazing regime and assessed how the fungal communities relate to organic soil carbon stocks in an alpine treeline ecotone in Northern Scandinavia. We determined soil carbon stocks and characterized soil fungal communities directly underneath and >3 m away from mountain birches (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii) in two adjacent 55-year-old grazing regimes with or without summer grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus). We show that the area exposed to year-round grazing dominated by evergreen dwarf shrubs had higher soil C:N ratio, higher fungal abundance and lower fungal diversity compared with the area with only winter grazing and higher abundance of mountain birch. Although soil carbon stocks did not differ between the grazing regimes, stocks were positively associated with root-associated ascomycetes, typical to the year-round grazing regime, and negatively associated with free-living saprotrophs, typical to the winter grazing regime. These findings suggest that when grazers promote dominance of evergreen dwarf shrubs, they induce shifts in soil fungal communities that increase soil carbon sequestration in the long term. Thus, to predict climate-driven changes in soil carbon, grazer-induced shifts in vegetation and soil fungal communities need to be accounted for.

AB  - Many grassland ecosystems and their associated biodiversity depend on the interactions between fire and land-use, both of which are shaped by socioeconomic conditions. The Eurasian steppe biome, much of it situated in Kazakhstan, contains 10% of the world's remaining grasslands. The break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, widespread land abandonment and massive declines in wild and domestic ungulates led to biomass accumulation over millions of hectares. This rapid fuel increase made the steppes a global fire hotspot, with major changes in vegetation structure. Yet, the response of steppe biodiversity to these changes remains unexplored. We utilized a unique bird abundance dataset covering the entire Kazakh steppe and semi-desert regions together with the MODIS burned area product. We modeled the response of bird species richness and abundance as a function of fire disturbance variables-fire extent, cumulative burned area, fire frequency-at varying grazing intensity. Bird species richness was impacted negatively by large fire extent, cumulative burned area, and high fire frequency in moderately grazed and ungrazed steppe. Similarly, overall bird abundance was impacted negatively by large fire extent, cumulative burned area and higher fire frequency in the moderately grazed steppe, ungrazed steppe, and ungrazed semi-deserts. At the species level, the effect of high fire disturbance was negative for more species than positive. There were considerable fire legacy effects, detectable for at least 8 years. We conclude that the increase in fire disturbance across the post-Soviet Eurasian steppe has led to strong declines in bird abundance and pronounced changes in community assembly. To gain back control over wildfires and prevent further biodiversity loss, restoration of wild herbivore populations and traditional domestic ungulate grazing systems seems much needed.

AB  - Endangered species, despite often living at low population densities, may undergo unexpected density-dependent feedbacks in the case of successful recovery or marked reduction in range. Because density-dependence dynamics can increase risk of extinction, these effects can hamper conservation efforts. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the largest population of the tamaraw Bubalus mindorensis, a critically endangered ungulate species endemic to Mindoro island, Philippines. The population is located within a <3000 ha area in Mounts Iglit-Baco Natural Park, with limited expansion possibilities. We took advantage of a 22 year time series of tamaraw counts to estimate annual population growth rate and possible density-dependence, accounting for sampling errors in the counts. The tamaraw population has been increasing at an average rate of +5% per year, as would be expected given its protected status by law. Population growth showed strong spatial structuring, with a population growth close to +10% in the core area of protection, and a reduction of abundance of -5% at the periphery of its range, inside the protected area. This range constriction is concerning because our best population dynamics model suggests significant negative density-dependence (Bayes factor = 0.9). The contraction of tamaraw range is likely caused by anthropogenic pressures forcing the species to live at relatively high densities in the core zone where protection is most effective, creating source-sink dynamics. Our study highlights the fact that, despite the continuous population growth over the last two decades, the long-term viability of the Mounts Iglit-Baco Natural Park tamaraw population remains uncertain.

AB  - Herbivory serves as a critical top-down mechanism within plant communities by regulating biodiversity, productivity, and ecosystem function. Although top-down impacts of mammalian herbivores have garnered significant fi cant attention in the literature, fewer studies have investigated the role of herbivorous reptiles, which can serve as crucial herbivores for some ecosystems, in regulating plant communities. In southeastern coastal plain longleaf pine forests of the United States, Gopher Tortoises ( Gopherus polyphemus) ) are a keystone species that may suppress plant productivity and promote local diversity within hyperdiverse understory plant communities. In January 2019, we established permanent tortoise exclusion plots with corresponding accessible control plots within an active Gopher Tortoise population at Splinter Hill Bog Preserve in southwestern Alabama. We measured the response of plant species diversity, composition, and productivity through a single growing season to quantify short-term impacts of tortoise exclusion on understory plant communities. We found that tortoise exclusion plots had 35% % more plant cover, with a 15% % reduction in plant richness, 6% % reduction in evenness, and 12% % reduction in Shannon's diversity, relative to control plots. Within a single growing season, tortoise exclusion explained 5% % of the variation within overall plant community composition. Our results provide clear evidence on the role of Gopher Tortoise herbivory for the maintenance of plant diversity within species-rich longleaf pine forests of the southeastern United States, even across a single growing season.

AB  - Island species play important roles in local ecosystems, but they are undergoing unprecedented rates of extinction from a variety of threats including emerging infectious disease, invasive species, and climate change. These threats are of particular concern for island species because island species often have limited genetic or geographic ability to escape these threats. Little is known about the long-term population trends of the Island Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma insularis), a species endemic to Santa Cruz Island in California's Channel Islands. We used a 20-year mark-resight dataset to describe long-term trends in Island Scrub-Jay adult population growth, survival, and recruitment, and to relate those trends to major drivers of island endemic extinctions (including disease, invasive species, and climate change). We used a variance components analysis to separate sampling and process variance and identified population declines of similar to 1.8% annually that were driven by a reduction in adult survival in the later years of the study. Although we found little evidence for impacts of disease and climate, we found some evidence that observed declines coincided with timing of an increasing wild turkey population but were not correlated with feral sheep or pig presence or eradication. We discuss these findings in the context of previous population estimates for this species and current management actions being considered to conserve the Island Scrub-Jay.

AB  - Vegetation structure is a crucial dimension of wildlife habitat, responsive to global changes in human activities and ecosystem processes. NASA's recent Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provides an exciting opportunity to explore how spaceborne waveform observations can improve our ability to measure wildlife habitat and advance animal ecology in the Anthropocene. We tested the utility of GEDI data in univariate occupancy models to estimate habitat use in a remote mountain system in central Idaho, USA. We collected data from 49 camera trap stations from two surveys in 2018-2019 and modeled the occupancy for each of seven mammal species representing different trophic levels and feeding strategies: American black bear (Ursus americanus), deer (Odocoileus hemionus), elk (Cervus canadensis), moose (Alces alces), coyote (Canis latrans), wolf (Canis lupus), and mountain lion (Puma concolor). We first derived structural diversity indices (richness, evenness, and divergence) of GEDI-derived canopy height, plant area index, and foliage height diversity to represent different dimensions of vegetation structure. This spatial aggregation is necessary due to gaps in GEDI footprints and parallels commonly used functional diversity metrics applied to biological communities that are calculated using trait probability densities. We measured these indices across three spatial scales that reflect different species movement and habitat selection patterns. We found the structural diversity indices of canopy height, foliage height diversity, and plant area index had the strongest effects on the occupancy of most mammals compared to two-dimensional (2D) variables (e.g. tree cover, normalized difference vegetation index). The spatial extent of these indices also influenced the strength of response, highlighting the importance of selecting a scale large enough to capture sufficient GEDI footprints but small enough to reflect site-level variance. Compared to 2D covariates, our results suggest that GEDI variables allow researchers to generate more detailed inference on the forms of habitat that wildlife use. We discuss the implications of these findings for habitat management and future wildlife research from local to global scales.

AB  - Large herbivores are particularly susceptible to changes in quantity and quality of forage resources, in turn constraining populations of large and threatened carnivores. Key prey species for Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica) and leopards (P. pardus orientalis), Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) have a spatial distribution which is greatly influenced by habitat quality across topographic regions. In this study, we used 138 camera-trap stations to record the abundance and distribution of Siberian roe deer in the mountains (n = 88) and valleys (n = 50) of the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park, and we examined the impact of overstory structure and understory food resources on the relative abundance index (RAI) of the deer. We use generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with negative binomial distributions, with the response variable of RAI of either of deer on the mountain or in the valley. We included canopy cover (CC), tree richness (TR) and basal area (BA) from overstory structure and mass of shrub layer (SM), mass of grasses and sedges (GM), forbs mass (FoM), ferns mass (FeM) and understory mass (UM) from understory food as fixed effects. We found that RAI of roe deer was significantly higher for the mountain than the valley. For the mountain, BA, TR and FoM were found to have a significant positive effect on roe deer, while CC showed a negative effect. In the valley, BA had a significant positive effect on roe deer, while SM showed a negative effect. Roe deer appeared to trade-off overstory structure with understory food resources, especially BA and FoM, which may lead them to prefer mountains over valleys in the national park. These findings will assist in understanding the distribution of roe deer populations in Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park, and may suggest more effective conservation and management strategies for the forest ecosystems of Northeast China.

AB  - Biodiversity loss and vast forest diebacks due to climate change-induced disturbances require adapted forest management strategies that reconcile economic interests and conservation. Tree species selection, including admixture of fast-growing and drought-tolerant non-native species to native forests, is an increasingly considered approach. However, we lack data on how such mixtures affect native forest biodiversity, especially for the sparsely researched major above-ground part of trees, the canopy. In 40 temperate forest plots in northwest Germany, we investigated how monocultures and admixtures of introduced fast-growing conifers (native Norway spruce planted outside its natural range and non-native Douglas fir) to native broadleaved European beech forests affect abundance, biomass, taxonomic and functional diversity and community composition of canopy beetles across trophic guilds. Diverse arthropod communities are vital contributors to forest health and resilience, and therefore valuable indicators to assess and evaluate forestry measures. Monospecific stands of non-native Douglas fir reduced canopy beetle abundance and diversity compared to native European beech, exceeding the negative effects of Norway spruce. These effects were more pronounced for herbivorous beetles, while they were less strong for predators. Beetle communities in monospecific Norway spruce stands had low functional richness. European beech and mixtures with non-native Douglas fir had high dissimilarity between local communities (turnover, i.e. beta diversity) and high total beetle diversity at landscape scale (gamma diversity). Mixtures generally mitigated the negative effects of introduced conifers, including shifts in species community composition compared to native European beech. Synthesis and applications: Monospecific stands of fast-growing non-native Douglas fir and native Norway spruce planted outside its natural occurrence showed undesirable effects such as low diversity and a shifted community composition of canopy beetles compared to native European beech. However, mixed stands mitigated negative effects and specifically admixed non-native Douglas fir did not reduce species turnover and landscape-scale beetle diversity. In line with recent studies on other forest taxa, we conclude that admixtures of introduced conifers to European beech forests, but not monospecific plantations, can potentially serve as a compromise between conservational and economic interests.

AB  - Silviculture methods such as clearcutting, shelterwood seed cutting, and selection system are used to manipulate the canopy and regenerate new cohorts in hardwood stands. Additionally, site preparation can be utilized to alter seedbed conditions with the aim to promote changes in species composition. However, limited seed availability and increased ungulate browsing may limit successful natural regeneration in some areas. Our objective was to investigate the influence of regeneration method, site preparation, deer exclusion, and direct seeding on the regeneration of a managed northern hardwood forest. Utilizing a randomized split-plot design with three splitting levels, we examined the effects of four different regeneration methods, two site preparation treatments, seed limitation and deer browsing on composition, compositional heterogeneity, and richness of regenerating tree species. We observed significant differences in the resulting species composition related to the regeneration and site preparation methods. Shelterwood seed cutting implemented with 60% and 30% residual canopy cover, along with scarification, increased species richness and species compositional heterogeneity. However, the combination of deer exclusion and direct seeding resulted in the highest species richness across all treatment combinations. Deer exclusion alone did not enhance richness or compositional heterogeneity, highlighting the impeding effect of limited seed availability. We found that direct seeding successfully altered species composition and increased species richness. Our results suggest that while the regeneration and site preparation methods can benefit natural tree regeneration, approaches that also address both seed limitations and deer browsing will be necessary to increase the tree species diversity in some cases.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted involving deer exclosures and planting of Quercus acutissima, a deciduous oak, to reveal forest recovery patterns and factors following clear-cutting at overcrowded conifer plantation sites. Sites were selected in a warm temperate region in western Japan, which is dominated by deciduous broad-leaved secondary forests and extensive conifer plantations. Thirteen years after clear-cutting in the study area, naturally regenerated stands were established with exclosures. The exclosures housed vegetation dominated by pioneer trees, such as Mallotus japonicus or Zanthoxylum ailanthoides. In contrast, naturally regenerated stands without exclosures had limited pioneer trees present. Vegetation dominated by pioneer shrubs (e.g. Aralia elata) was established in these stands. Reduced canopy height and total basal area were observed for vegetation outside the exclosures. In stands where Q. acutissima was planted immediately after clear-cutting, the vegetation that is dominated by this species in the canopy layer was established in both stands with and without exclosure. Most of tree species that emerged after clear-cutting across all stands were of the frugivore seed dispersal type. However, results from this study suggest that these frugivore seed dispersal type trees are more vulnerable to deer browsing than trees from the Fagaceae family. Natural forest recovery following plantation clear-cutting could be inhibited due to deer herbivory at relatively low deer density if a major source of tree regeneration in clear-cut plantations is non-Fagaceae trees.

AB  - Arthropod natural enemies (ANEs) play an indispensable role in maintaining the balance for plant communities that also significantly affects the ANE diversities not only by supporting herbivorous prey, but also by providing habitats and floral food resources. Studying the diversity of ANEs is thus vital to develop an understanding of sustainable pest control. Relationships of the vegetation diversity (including richness, coverage, and Shan-non-Wiener diversity) with associated arthropod aphidophagous natural enemies (AANEs) and their groups under Pinus tabuliformis of different distances were analyzed by non-metric multidimensional scaling (metaMDS). Our results indicated that the vegetation richness affects AANEs at a small scale, while the vegetation structure affects it at a large scale. The richness and abundance of AANEs and the abundance of green lacewings (GLs) and aphid parasitoids (APs) were positively related to neighboring tree richness. But the richness of AANEs and aphidophagous ladybirds (ALs) were negatively associated with nearby tree coverage, as well as AANE richness with close-up shrub coverage, while the abundance of AANEs, ALs, and GLs possessed a negative and hump-shaped relationship with nearby tree coverage, as well as the abundance of AANEs and GLs with close-up shrub coverage. When tree and shrub layers each had approximately half coverage within a vegetation struc-ture, the richness and abundance of AANEs were highest. Similarly, the richness and abundance of AANEs were positively related to neighboring blooming plant richness. However, the richness of AANEs and ALs, and the abundance of AANEs, AL, GL, and APs had a positive association either with the coverage or with the Shan-non-Wiener diversity of close-up blooming plants. Half coverage of the tree and shrub layer combined with higher diversities (richness, coverage, and Shannon-Wiener diversity) of blooming plants resulted in low aphid density. The results provide a basis for effectively improving AANE diversity.

AB  - Moose (Alces alces) and woodland caribou (Ranger tarandus caribou) are the 2 large prey species for wolves (Canis lupus) in the Nearctic boreal forest in North America. Caribou have declined, with widespread anthropogenic disturbance as the ultimate cause and wolf predation as the proximal cause. To conserve caribou the government of Alberta, Canada initiated a wolf control program to reduce predation rates on caribou populations and contribute to caribou population recovery. Predators play an important role in shaping the structure and function of ecosystems through top-down forces. We hypothesized that the strongest factors influencing moose occurrences would reflect changes in predation risk before and after the onset of wolf control. We weighed evidence for competing hypothesis by deploying cameras across a highly industrialized landscape in Alberta for 3 years after wolf control (2017-2020), capitalizing on 3 years of existing data before the onset of wolf control (2011-2014). We created generalized linear models representing competing hypotheses about moose response to natural and anthropogenic landscape features before and after wolf control, examining support for each in an information-theoretic framework. Prior to wolf control, the model containing landscape features providing security cover was best-supported, but this was scale-dependent. After wolf control, the model containing landscape features that offer increased forage opportunities was best-supported. Unexpectedly, the direction of effect was often opposite to predictions, with moose avoiding some features thought to provide security and forage. We demonstrate that lethal predator control affects the spatial distribution of its primary prey species but in ways we do not fully comprehend, highlighting the need for a better understanding of community dynamics following wolf control.

AB  - Dust produced from mining has the potential to reduce plant cover, alter plant communities, and increase metal concentrations in vegetation-changes that may affect the amount, type, and quality of forage for barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus). We quantified dust deposition from Diavik Diamond Mine (Northwest Territories, Canada) and investigated the changes on forage quality, type, and quantity for caribou. From 2002 to 2016, dust deposition was measured, and vegetation cover and richness were assessed in permanent plots established adjacent to the mine and in reference areas 1-6 km from the mine. Lichen was collected from areas up to 100 km from the mine to determine metal concentrations. Dust deposition rapidly decreased within 4 km of the mine. Plant communities adjacent to the mine (within 500 m) had disproportionately increased cover of vascular plants and decreased bryophyte and lichen cover. Lichen sampled within 4 km from the mine had greater metal concentrations than those sampled farther afield. Concentrations of Al in lichen collected within 40 km of the mine exceeded safe exposure limits for consumption, assuming lichen comprised 100% of caribou diet. We conclude that dust deposition from mining is altering adjacent vegetation communities but that such changes to forage are unlikely to cause negative effects to caribou due to reduced lichen intake in summer and autumn, their migratory nature, and avoidance of mine-influenced areas. However, minimization and reclamation of mine-related disturbances will be important for maintaining sufficient quality forage and available habitat or space in caribou ranges.

AB  - Re-establishing extirpated wildlife-or "rewilding "-is touted as a way to restore biodiversity and ecosystem processes, but we lack real-world examples of this process, particularly in Southeast Asia. Here, we use a decade of aggregated camera trap data, N-mixture occupancy models, and input from local wildlife experts to describe the unassisted recolonization of two native large herbivores in Singapore. Sambar deer (Rusa unicolor) escaped from captivity (in private or public zoos) in the 1970s and contemporary camera trap data show they have only colonized nearby forest fragments and their abundance remains low. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa), in contrast, naturally recolonized by swimming from Malaysia in the 1990s and have rapidly expanded their range and abundance across Singapore. While wild pigs have not recolonized all viable green spaces yet, their trajectory indicates they soon will. We also note that a third ungulate, the muntjac deer (Muntiacus muntjak), was captured in camera trapping in 2014 and 2015 but was never recorded afterward despite increased sampling effort, and thus we do not focus on their presumably unsuccessful recolonization. The divergent rewilding trajectories between sambar deer and wild pigs suggest different conservation outcomes and management requirements. Sambar deer may restore lost plant-animal interactions such as herbivory and seed dispersal without requiring significant management. Wild pigs, in contrast, have reached high numbers rapidly and may require active management to avoid hyperabundance and negative ecological impacts in regions, such as Singapore that lack both hunting and large predators.

AB  - Although global change can reshape ecosystems by triggering cascading effects on food webs, indirect interactions remain largely overlooked. Climate- and land-use-induced changes in landscape cause shifts in vegetation composition, which affect entire food webs. We used simulations of forest dynamics and movements of interacting species, parameterized by empirical observations, to predict the outcomes of global change on a large-mammal food web in the boreal forest. We demonstrate that climate- and land-use-induced changes in forest landscapes exacerbate asymmetrical apparent competition between moose and threatened caribou populations through wolf predation. Although increased prey mortalities came from both behavioral and numerical responses, indirect effects from numerical responses had an overwhelming effect. The increase in caribou mortalities was exacerbated by the cumulating effects of land use over the short term and climate change impacts over the long term, with higher impact of land use. Indirect trophic interactions will be key to understanding community dynamics under global change.

AB  - African elephants (Loxodonta africana) play a significant role in the modification of their habitat, foremost by decreasing woody vegetation cover and density. Little is known regarding the effects of elephant habitat disturbance (EHD) on medium-to-large mammal and bird communities. While the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) predicts species richness and diversity will be maximised in areas of moderate EHD, high levels of EHD could result in habitat degradation and negatively impact certain wildlife communities. To examine this relationship, we compared mammal and avian community assemblages, richness, and diversity across differing severities (low, medium, high) of elephant disturbed habitats (woodland, shrubland, and mixed wood/shrubland) within Rukinga Wildlife Sanctuary (RWS) in south-eastern Kenya. From June-November 2022, we collected wildlife detection data via driving transects and surveyed EHD through observation of elephant tree damage. While EHD level did impact community assemblage, possibly through vegetation modification and/or increased habitat heterogeneity, EHD had no negative impacts on species richness and diversity in the three habitat types. In contrast to our IDH prediction, richness and diversity were highest in high EHD areas within shrubland habitat and showed no difference across EHD levels for the other two habitats. Overall, this study provides evidence that elephants in RWS are not disturbing habitats to an extent that negatively impacts sanctuary viability, and at least for shrub habitat appear to enhance it. Additionally, smaller wildlife habitats may be able to mitigate lasting elephant overpopulation damages through increased connectivity to other protected areas.

AB  - The emergence of novel ecosystems, characterized by shifts in species composition and interactions, abiotic conditions and altered ecosystem functioning, is a major and inevitable challenge to contemporary ecosystem management. This study examines the ecological implications of Trachycarpus fortunei, a non-native evergreen palm, currently involved in a biome shift from deciduous temperate forest to evergreen laurophyllous forest in the Southern European Alps. Specifically, we investigated the effects of T. fortunei encroachment in peri-urban forests on flying and ground-dwelling arthropod communities as well as on leaf-litter decomposition. We found that the presence of T. fortunei altered arthropod community composition, mostly by reducing the number of herbivore species. This effect was likely driven by the lower quality of palm leaves as a food source compared to deciduous, dicotyledonous tree leaves and by a lower plant richness in the herb and shrub layer. Furthermore, we observed higher rates of leaf-litter decomposition associated with increasing abundance of young palm trees, which was not explained by predictors commonly associated with litter decomposition (i.e., detritivore abundance, litter depth and air temperature). Hence, the slow decay of palm leaves appears to be counterbalanced by the favourable conditions for litter decomposition within dense palm stands. Overall, our findings indicate that high densities of the non-native palm species (T. fortunei) impacts herbivore arthropod communities in the Southern European Alps, providing first evidence of possible effects on ecosystem functioning of this ongoing biome shift. These outcomes are integral components of the broader process of laurophyllisation in the study region, a phenomenon linked to climate warming and land use change, encompassing both native and non-native species.

AB  - Coexistence mechanisms such as temporal niche partitioning among sympatric wildlife species may be impacted by continued human disturbance and invasive species. White-tailed deer expansion in North America, a product of landscape and climate change, may alter other species' diel activity and have implications for conservation of native species. We asked: 1) To what degree does invasive white-tailed deer temporal activity overlap with other ungulate species (mule deer and moose) in landscapes with high human disturbance, versus landscapes with low human disturbance? 2) To what degree does invasive white-tailed deer and predator activity (wolves, grizzly bears, and coyotes) overlap in landscapes with high human disturbance versus landscapes with low human disturbance? Using detection data from infrared remote cameras, we compared a high-disturbance (2019-2020) and a low-disturbance (2009-2010) landscape in the Canadian Rocky Mountains. We used activity pattern analysis to quantify temporal overlap between sympatric mammal species and white-tailed deer. We found that contrary to our hypotheses, sympatric ungulate species maintained activity and temporal overlap with white-tailed deer in both landscapes. Predators did not match the temporal activity of white-tailed deer in the highdisturbance landscape as closely as in the low-disturbance landscape. We conjecture ungulates may be prioritizing periods of optimal foraging or reducing predation risk rather than temporal niche partitioning from invasive-white-tailed deer. Predator species may be more sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance than ungulates and adjust their temporal activity in high-disturbance landscapes. Native ungulates' lack of diel activity adaptation to white-tailed deer invasions is an important piece of the behavioural puzzle about how western Nearctic systems change with anthropogenic disturbance and human-mediated range shifts.

AB  - Climate change in the Arctic is predicted to drastically alter carbon and nutrient pools, plant communities, and plant-animal interactions. We examined how four levels of long-term (16 years) nutrient addition in moist acidic tundra affected plant community structure and the abundance of Eriophorum vaginatum, the preferred forage for tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus). We also explored how simulated press and pulse herbivory for four years affected Eriophorum at these different nutrient levels. Shifts in plant community structure, reductions in species diversity and richness, and decreased Eriophorum abundance were pronounced at the highest levels of nutrient addition. Eriophorum abundance was negatively correlated with deciduous shrub abundance, likely caused by light limitation in fertilized plots. Added nutrients generally increased Eriophorum leaf length, but effects varied among years and simulated herbivory treatments. After being clipped once, Eriophorum leaves regrew in fertilized plots to the same length as leaves that had not been clipped, demonstrating recovery. Our results show how interannual variation in plant growth and animal activity might exacerbate or dampen responses over multiple years. Changes to plant community composition and plant-vole interactions associated with increased soil nutrients resulting from warming could have cascading impacts on arctic ecosystems and carbon cycling.

AB  - In ungulates, population abundance is mainly influenced by forage condition, predation pressure, competitor abundances, and human activities; however, information about the effect of the escape terrain on the population abundance is still scarce. Some ungulate species often use areas with abundant escape terrain despite the absence of predators, indicating that the ghosts of predators past continue to affect their spatial behavior, and population abundance of such ungulates may also be influenced by the escape terrain. We examined population abundance of the Japanese serow (Capricornis crispus) in Mt. Fuji and its surrounding mountains with the absence of predators, including both natural and human hunters, in relation to forage condition, vegetation, escape terrain (steep slopes), potential competitor (sika deer Cervus nippon), and non-invasive human activities. The population abundance (pellet group numbers) of serows was higher in coniferous forests than in broad-leaved forests, and in areas with abundant dwarf bamboos and where high fecal nitrogen content was detected, suggesting that forage availability of dwarf bamboo and coniferous trees as well as forage quality influenced their abundance. Conversely, sika deer abundance and human residences did not affect the population abundance of serows, suggesting that the potential competitor and the non-invasive human activity may not have had a direct effect on the serow abundances. Moreover, the population abundance of serow was higher in areas with abundant escape terrain, suggesting that the ghosts of predators past may affect their abundance. Population abundance of serows may be low in areas with scarce escape terrains because fewer individuals settle in environments with minimal escape terrain.

AB  - Environmental factors can influence ecological networks, but these effects are poorly understood in the realm of the phylogeny of host-parasitoid interactions. Especially, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the ways that biotic factors, including plant species richness, overall community phylogenetic and functional composition of consumers, and abiotic factors such as microclimate, determine host-parasitoid network structure and host-parasitoid community dynamics. To address this, we leveraged a 5-year dataset of trap-nesting bees and wasps and their parasitoids collected in a highly controlled, large-scale subtropical tree biodiversity experiment. We tested for effects of tree species richness, tree phylogenetic, and functional diversity, and species and phylogenetic composition on species and phylogenetic diversity of both host and parasitoid communities and the composition of their interaction networks. We show that multiple components of tree diversity and canopy cover impacted both, species and phylogenetic composition of hosts and parasitoids. Generally, phylogenetic associations between hosts and parasitoids reflected nonrandomly structured interactions between phylogenetic trees of hosts and parasitoids. Further, host-parasitoid network structure was influenced by tree species richness, tree phylogenetic diversity, and canopy cover. Our study indicates that the composition of higher trophic levels and corresponding interaction networks are determined by plant diversity and canopy cover, especially via trophic links in species-rich ecosystems.

AB  - AimsIn the past few decades, a large number of forest vegetation restoration projects have been implemented in the mountain ecosystems of the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. Nevertheless, the impact of forest vegetation restoration on soil multifunctionality and biodiversity remains uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the effects of forest vegetation restoration on the soil multifunctionality and biodiversity.MethodsIn this study, Hippophae rhamnoides plantation and abandoned grassland reconstructed from abandoned farmland in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau were selected as the research objects. The differences of soil ecological function, herbaceous biomass and biodiversity were studied, and the community composition and network complexity of soil microbial diversity were analyzed. The relationship between soil characteristics and soil microbial species abundance and functional abundance was explored, and the biological and abiotic factors affecting soil multifunctionality were revealed.ResultsThe findings indicated that the Hippophae rhamnoides plantation greatly enhanced the soil ecological function, and increased the biodiversity and biomass of herbaceous plants in comparison to abandoned grassland. The Hippophae rhamnoides plantation altered the soil microbial community structure and composition, exhibiting greater complexity in the soil microbial network compared to the abandoned grassland. Soil properties significantly affected the species abundance and functional abundance of soil microorganisms. Biodiversity (vegetation diversity, bacterial diversity and fungal diversity) and soil water content (SWC) had positive effects on soil multifunctionality, while soil pH had negative effects.ConclusionsThe findings of the study revealed the effects of different vegetation restoration measures on ecosystem function, soil microbial community composition, and network complexity.

AB  - The construction of vehicular roads likely affects the distribution of natural resources. Although the effects of roads on different ecosystem aspects have been extensively studied, studies in arid and, particularly, in hyper-arid ecosystems are scarce. In drylands, where water is the main limiting factor, the effect of roads on the redistribution of water may have strong subsequent effects on the ecosystem, especially when roads cross natural water flow paths. To fill this knowledge gap, we studied the effects of a road that runs across a slope on the distribution of plants and animals in a hyper-arid environment. Changes in shrub cover, below and above the road, were quantified by remote sensing and image classification, while plant-associated arthropods were vacuum-sampled from shrub canopies and from open (inter-shrub) areas. We found that the spatial distribution of shrubs, a vital resource facilitating many other organisms, was affected by the road, with an increase in the shrub cover immediately above the road and a decrease below it. Arthropod abundance generally followed shrub cover, but the exact pattern depended on the specific group sampled. While some arthropod groups (e.g., aphids, parasitic wasps and barklice) thrived under the disturbed conditions above the road, other arthropod groups (e.g., mites and true bugs) were less abundant in the disturbed patches. Our results highlight the strong effects of human-made structures on the distribution of flora and fauna in arid ecosystems.

AB  - Landscape management can influence the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the terrestrial gastropods that host known parasites of managed species of ungulates. Multiple taxa of terrestrial gastropods are important intermediate hosts in the lifecycle of the parasitic nematode Parelaphostrongylus tenuis, for which white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are definitive hosts. Moose (Alces alces) become infected with P. tenuis when they incidentally ingest gastropod intermediate hosts, leading to morbidity and mortality. Populations of moose in Minnesota have declined and P. tenuis infection has been identified as a leading cause of mortality. We inves-tigated the role of forest management disturbance on the terrestrial gastropod community, and specifically known intermediate host species of P. tenuis, on the Grand Portage Indian Reservation in northeastern Minnesota, USA, where moose are an important subsistence species to the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. Field crews surveyed gastropods through timed searches of soil and litter, and opportunistic collections from browse and pellets of white-tailed deer and moose. We digested all identified gastropods to determine prevalence of P. tenuis infection. We examined gastropod community responses to management and forest cover type using multivariate regressions. We additionally used regressions to examine total gastropod richness and abundance, as well as P. tenuis intermediate host responses to cover type, soil moisture class, canopy cover, treatment, and years since treatment. Digestions detected no infected gastropods from the 621 identified specimens. Gastropod community assemblages differed with recent understory treatment, but no other predictors. Total gastropod abundance, richness, and host abundance (liberal definition, including Deroceras spp.) were lower in sites treated within the last five years. For known intermediate host taxa, we observed species-specific responses to forestry treatments through time. Specifically, Deroceras spp. recolonized sites post-treatment (0-30 years), Discus cronkhitei were higher in abundance immediately following treatment, and the Succinea ovalis group, along with pooled intermediate hosts, displayed no discernable patterns. Our results underscore the complexity of P. tenuis lifecycles and transmission dynamics to moose, the importance of management disturbance and disturbance frequency in regulating gastropod populations, and the potential of forest management treatments to reduce P. tenuis infection in moose.

AB  - Range shifts and changes in dominance of species in communities are among the major predicted impacts of climate change on ecosystems, supported by numerous modeling studies. While climate is changing particularly rapidly in the Arctic, little observational data is available to document predicted changes in the composition of communities, in particular from the large Russian tundra areas. Small rodents are a key component of tundra ecosystems implementing important ecological functions both as herbivores and as main prey for a whole guild of predators. Here we document changes over 60 years in occurrence of nine species of small rodents along a latitudinal gradient spanning from the forest-tundra ecotone to the high Arctic tundra on Yamal Peninsula. All data were obtained using a single method: snap-trapping. In general, the occurrence of lemmings, specialized arctic endemics, decreased in the southern parts of the peninsula, whereas the occurrence of voles, representing boreal or wide-spread species, increased and expanded northwards. The occurrence of Siberian lemmings (Lemmus sibiricus) in particular declined over the whole latitudinal gradient and possibly disappeared from the southernmost zones, whereas collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx torquatus) declined significantly only in the forest tundra. The strongest increase was observed in the tundra zones for narrow-headed voles (Lasiopodomys gregalis), a wide-spread species inhabiting meadows and riparian habitats, and Middendorff's voles (Alexandromys middendorffii), a primarily low Arctic species inhabiting waterlogged tundra. Both species also expanded their distribution range northwards during the last two decades. The observed changes might be due to the effect of several drivers of environmental change occurring in concert: climate warming both in winter and in summer, and increased human activity notably related to intensive reindeer herding and industrial development.

AB  - Plants and phytophagous insects make up the highest terrestrial diversity on the planet, forming complex interspecific interaction networks. Interaction networks are an important tool to understand how ecological interactions shape plant-herbivore assemblages. In the present study, we tested the hypotheses that the plant species richness and vegetation structure (vegetation cover and vegetation height) (i) drive the richness and abundance of herbivorous insects and (ii) determines topological patterns (connectance, specialization and modularity) of plant-herbivore networks. We sampled ten different areas in the Neotropical savannas to assess those hypotheses and constructed plant-herbivore interaction matrices using species composition data. Plant-herbivore interaction networks comprised 298 plants of 60 species, 421 insects distributed in 96 morphospe-cies, and totalizing 218 interactions. We found that plant species richness positively influenced the species richness of herbivorous insects, whereas average vegetation height negatively affected the species richness of herbivorous insects. The abundance of herbivorous insects was negatively affected by plant species richness, and by vegetation height. Species richness and structure of plant communities also significantly affected network topological parameters. Network connectance was negatively influenced by plant richness and positively affected by vegetation cover. Besides, plant species richness positively influenced network modularity, whereas vegetation height negatively affected network modularity. However, the plant community diversity and vegetation structure did not affect network specialization. Our results show that both plant community diversity and vegetation structure in Neotropical savannas drive the structure of plant-herbivore interaction networks. Considering the current high rates of removal of native vegetation in Brazilian savannas, our findings indicate that the preserving this ecosystem is crucial for maintaining ecosystem services through plant-herbivore inter-action networks.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations have recovered to about 30 million animals in the United States, but land cover has changed during the interval of recovery. To address the relationship between deer densities and current land cover at regional scales, I applied random forests and extreme gradient boosting classifiers to model low and high deer density classes, at two different thresholds (5.8 and 11.6 deer/km(2)), and land classes in three regions during approximately 2003. For low and high deer density classes divided at 5.8 deer/km(2), deciduous broadleaf forest overall was the most influential and positive variable in the central east and central regions and crop and pasture were the most influential and negative variables in the southeast region. Deer density increased with area of deciduous and mixed forests, woody wetlands, and shrub in all regions. Deer density decreased with area of crop, developed open space, and developed low and medium residential density in all regions. For density classes divided at 11.6 deer/km(2), deer density had the strongest relationship with woody wetlands in the central east region, mixed and deciduous forest in the southeast region, and woody wetlands and herbaceous vegetation in the central region. Deer density increased with deciduous and mixed forests, woody wetlands, and shrub in all regions. Conversely, deer density decreased with herbaceous vegetation, crop, and developed low residential densities in all regions. Therefore, at regional scales, deer overall occurred at greater densities in forests and woody wetlands and lower densities in agricultural and residential development, which did not appear to support more deer. Deer preference for forests does result in damage to forest products, but alternatively, some may consider that deer provide important socioeconomic and ecological services by reducing number of small trees, particularly in the absence of other disturbances that historically controlled tree biomass.

AB  - Semi-natural grasslands are biodiverse ecosystems that support many threatened species, but they require management interventions to maintain their habitat characteristics. Although many semi-natural calcareous grasslands historically were grazed, mowing is often used as a substitute disturbance when livestock access is not feasible. Mowing may have different effects on vegetation than grazing, but it is unclear if these differences cause changes in animal diversity or grasslands' ability to support endangered species. We studied carabid beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages in semi-natural calcareous grasslands in southern Germany managed with either different intensities of grazing or by mowing. There were no differences in overall activity density, richness, or functional trait diversity of carabid beetles between management methods, but mowing reduced threatened species richness and their proportions in the assemblages. Grazing intensity, measured by livestock faeces density, had little effect on carabid assemblages. The benefits of grazing for threatened species were most apparent in small sites, indicating that using grazing management to conserve endangered beetle species may be particularly important where habitat area is limited, even though these are the sites most likely to use mowing management.

AB  - In recent decades, grazing by wild and domestic ungulates has become a strategy for conservation management to restore or maintain open landscapes. One of the species playing an increasing role in ecological restoration is the European bison - the largest terrestrial mammal in Europe. We studied the impact of this large herbivore and other ungulates (moose, red deer, and roe deer) on tree encroachment in open habitats in the Bialowieza Primeval Forest (Poland). On 30 study plots located in meadows, we measured crown volume and the density of woody vegetation and monitored visitation and behavior of ungulates with the use of camera traps. The mean visitation rate to meadows by European bison was 0.11 ind./day/plot, and 0.22 ind./day/plot by other ungulates. The duration of foraging was significantly higher in European bison (55.8 s) than in other ungulates (16.3 s). The density of woody vegetation on meadows varied from 13 to 6213 ind./ha and the crown volume from 0.6 to 1145 m(3)/ha. We found that increased visitation by European bison resulted in a significant reduction in the density and volume of woody vegetation in meadows. The reducing effect on woody vegetation was over eight times higher in frequently visited plots when compared to unvisited plots - the density of woody vegetation decreased from 879 to 101 saplings/ha, while the crown volume declined from 295 to 35 m(3)/ha. In addition, the density of woody vegetation was related to the level of meadow openness. Less open (smaller) meadows had a significantly higher density of woody vegetation than meadows characterized by high openness. Combined visitation by other ungulates did not affect either the volume or density of woody vegetation. The most plausible mechanism of observed patterns can be a remarkably higher foraging activity in meadows by bison in comparison to other ungulates. As a consequence, European bison, being adapted to open habitats, can effectively reduce the growth of tree seedlings and limit tree encroachment at the initial stages of forest succession. Thus, populations of this wild herbivore can play a role in the restoration or maintenance of open habitats and woody pastures that serve as an important foraging ground for bison in suboptimal forests, where populations of these herbivores were restored.

AB  - Land-use and land-cover change associated with agriculture is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. In heavily modified agricultural landscapes, grazing lands may be the only areas that can provide essential resources for native grassland species. Management decisions, such as choice of livestock species, affect the extent to which grazing lands provide suitable habitat for native species such as pollinators. Our study compared how sheep versus cattle herbivory affected floral resources and butterfly abundance across low-diversity, former Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) pastures managed with patch-burn grazing. Across all years (2017-2019), flowering species richness and abundance were significantly higher in cattle pastures than sheep pastures. On average, we recorded 6.9 flowering species/transect in cattle pastures and 3.8 flowering species/transect in sheep pastures. The average floral abundance per transect was 1278 stems/transect in cattle pastures and 116 stems/transect in pastures grazed by sheep. Similarly, we observed higher butterfly species richness, diversity, and abundance in cattle than in sheep pastures. In cattle pastures, we observed an average of 75 butterflies and 6.75 species per transect, compared with an average of 52 butterflies and 3.37 species per transect in sheep pastures. However, the butterfly community composition did not significantly differ between grazing treatments likely because agricultural-tolerant, habitat generalists comprised the majority of the butterfly community. Five generalist butterflies comprised 92.3% of observations; Colias philodice was the most abundant (61% of observations). Speyeria idalia and Danaus plexippus, two butterflies of conservation concern, comprised less than 0.5% of butterfly observations. Our results, which are among the first attempt quantifying butterfly use of post-CRP fields grazed by livestock, show that increased precipitation and cattle grazing promoted higher forb abundance and richness. However, additional interventions may be needed to enhance floral resources to sustain and improve pollinator diversity in these landscapes.

AB  - Wild animals can adapt to their environments under natural selection pressure. Sympatric species with similar niches compete and achieve coexistence through habitat separation. Using the line transect method from July to September 2019, we examined summer habitat use and niche overlap between Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus) and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) in the Taihang mountains surrounding Beijing, China. We found that Chinese goral preferred habitats with higher elevation, tree density, vegetation, cover, and a number of stumps. In contrast, tree diameter at breast height, number of fallen wood, and dry grass cover in habitats of Chinese goral were significantly lower than those of Siberian roe deer. It used shrub habitats with moderate to poor shelter from the winds, while Siberian roe deer used both tree and shrub habitats with good hiding cover and good shelter from the winds. Siberian roe deer were more likely to occur in habitats far from human communities. The two species showed marked niche overlap (Pianka's index = 0.869). To reduce competition and coexist in the same region, both species were separated mainly in spatial and trophic niches. Therefore, maintaining valuable shrub habitats in higher elevations and tree and shrub habitats far from human settlements will facilitate the coexistence of the two ungulates.

AB  - Using data from the BEF-China tree diversity experiment, the authors demonstrate that the diversity of arthropods is higher in plots with higher tree diversity and that the suppression of herbivores by enemy arthropods could be a potential mechanism through which higher tree diversity promotes productivity.
   Forests sustain 80% of terrestrial biodiversity and provide essential ecosystem services. Biodiversity experiments have demonstrated that plant diversity correlates with both primary productivity and higher trophic diversity. However, whether higher trophic diversity can mediate the effects of plant diversity on productivity remains unclear. Here, using 5 years of data on aboveground herbivorous, predatory and parasitoid arthropods along with tree growth data within a large-scale forest biodiversity experiment in southeast China, we provide evidence of multidirectional enhancement among the diversity of trees and higher trophic groups and tree productivity. We show that the effects of experimentally increased tree species richness were consistently positive for species richness and abundance of herbivores, predators and parasitoids. Richness effects decreased as trophic levels increased for species richness and abundance of all trophic groups. Multitrophic species richness and abundance of arthropods were important mediators of plant diversity effects on tree productivity, suggesting that optimizing forest management for increased carbon capture can be more effective when the diversity of higher trophic groups is promoted in concert with that of trees.

AB  - While the direct effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) on vegetation have been intensively studied, less is known about the indirect and interactive effects of herbivory on lower trophic levels, such as soil microbes and their processing of carbon pools. We explored how carbon dynamics shift with release from over-browsing by white-tailed deer in two mature stands of oak and hemlock trees. We measured soil carbon pools (for example, soil organic matter, carbon stocks, litter biomass, and litter stabilization) and fluxes (for example, soil respiration, methane uptake, microbial substrate use, and litter decomposition) using a spatially balanced survey design inside and outside two 24-year-old deer exclosures, one in each forest stand. Soil carbon pools were higher inside the exclosures than in deer-browsed plots in both forest stands, but the effect of deer herbivory on fine-scale spatial patterning of soil carbon pools and mean carbon fluxes varied by forest type. Release from deer herbivory in the oak stand increased the patchiness of soil pools and led to higher litter decomposition, soil respiration, and methane uptake rates. Release from deer herbivory in the hemlock stand did not affect the spatial structure of soil pools, had little effect on methane uptake, and had negative effects on litter decomposition and soil respiration. These differences may be due in part to the interactive effects of two herbivores, deer and the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), that appear to be limiting regeneration and promoting the proliferation of monodominant hay-scented fern (Dennstaedtia punctilobula) in the hemlock-dominated stand. Our work suggests that future efforts consider multiple zoogeochemical stressors simultaneously, in addition to variation in environmental templates, to explain uncertainties in carbon pools and fluxes in temperate forested ecosystems.

AB  - Livestock browsing and trampling can deplete plant regeneration and thus drive natural ecosystems towards degradation. This phenomenon may be particularly true in tropical dry forests, which support extensive livestock herds feeding on native vegetation, but has rarely been experimentally addressed. Here we examine how browsing and trampling by exotic goats impacts seed bank and seedling survivorship of woody plant species in a Caatinga dry forest by performing a 4-year exclosure experiment. Soil seed bank and transplanted seedlings from four woody plants species were monitored through a year across 14 and 10 paired plots (free goat-access vs exclosure plots), respectively. Regardless of treatment, the soil seed bank was low in density 14 seeds/m(2) ( +/- 13, standard deviation) and taxonomically impoverished (24 species). Small to intermediate-sized seeds from dry fruits (75%) and abiotically dispersed species (65%) prevailed. The most common attractive structure was an elaiosome (33%), but pulp (14%) and aril (9.5%) were also recorded. 60% of the species presented some type of dormancy and 32% presented a pleurogram. 57% of the seeds were classified as forming a transient seed bank, while seasonally transient seeds accounted for 43% of the total seed bank. Seed bank attributes were not affected by goats, including proportion of viable seeds (25.85 & PLUSMN; 41.3 in exclosure plots vs 31.45 & PLUSMN; 42.49 in free-access plots) and diversity. However, seedling survival one year after transplantation was higher for the plant species in the exclosure plots (68.4%) as compared to the free-access plots (39%). Although there were no significant differences in seed bank, our results suggest that free-ranging goats in densities typical of the Caatinga region can impose elevated seedling mortality to the dominant woody dry forest species even considering a short period of time.

AB  - Fire is an important ecological disturbance that can reset ecosystems and initiate changes in plant community composition, ecosystem biogeochemistry, and primary productivity. As herbivores rely on primary producers for food, changes in vegetation may alter plant-herbivore interactions with important-but often unexplored-feedbacks to ecosystems. Here we examined the impact of post-fire changes in plant community composition and structure on habitat suitability and rodent herbivore activity in response to a large, severe, and unprecedented fire in northern Alaskan tundra. In moist acidic tundra where the fire occurred, tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) are the dominant herbivore and rely on the tussock forming sedge Eriophorum vaginatum for both food and nesting material. Tundra voles were 10 times more abundant at the burned site compared with nearby unburned tundra 7-12 years after the fire. Fire increased the habitat suitability for voles by increasing plant productivity and biomass, food quality, and cover through both taller vegetation and increased microtopography. As a result of elevated vole abundance, Eriophorum mortality caused by vole herbivory was two orders of magnitude higher than natural mortality and approached the magnitude of the mortality rate resulting directly from the fire. These findings suggest that post-fire increases in herbivore pressure on Eriophorum could, in turn, disrupt graminoid recovery and enhance shrub encroachment. Tundra state transitions from graminoid to shrub dominated are also evident following other disturbances and fertilization experiments, suggesting that as Arctic temperatures rise, greater available nutrients and increased frequencies of large-scale disturbances may also alter plant-animal interactions with cascading impacts on plant communities and ecosystem function.

AB  - 1. Invasive mammals exert pervasive effects on vegetation communities in island systems through several pathways, including by introducing novel disturbances. In Hawai'i, feral pigs pose a particular threat to endemic species that evolved in the absence of native ungulates. The effects of pig soil disturbance on understory vegetation are contingent on the distribution and density of disturbed patches and subsequent species responses influenced by traits conferring growth and reproductive strategies. However, little is known about how these traits influece native- non-native species turnover in response to pig disturbance, or how such disturbances affect trait-mediated responses to other environmental variables.2. Here we quantify the effects of leaf traits and dispersal attributes on species responses to pig soil disturbance at two spatial scales-0.5 m(2) patches embedded along 20 m transects within sites-across a gradient of pig density in a Hawaiian montane wet forest using Bayesian mixed models.3. Native and non-native species demonstrated divergent responses, with increasing presence and abundance of non-native species in the understory as soil disturbance within patches and sites increased. Dominant patterns in measured traits tracked the leaf economic spectrum (LES), with non-native species tending toward resource-acquisitive traits. Species with resource-acquisitive traits, regardless of identity, were favoured with disturbance and responded positively to light availability in disturbed sites. Models showed species primarily dispersed by wind were more prevalent in disturbed patches and sites than those dispersed by endozoochory, while seed mass had no effect.4. Our results suggest pig activity influences community composition and favours non-native species establishment, and these effects are mediated in part by traits conferring rapid resource acquisition. We also show that the extent of disturbance at the site-scale is relevant for the influence of leaf architecture on understory responses to light availability, demonstrating how the effects of disturbance are scale-dependent and can influence species sorting along independent environmental gradients.

AB  - The Pyrenean highlands hold the southernmost populations of some endemic and rare arvicoline species associated with grasslands. This area, as well as many other areas in the Mediterranean basin, has suffered from land abandonment due to socio-economic changes during the last decades. Those changes represented a reduction of the traditional livestock grazing by goats and sheep which naturally controlled the process of shrub encroachment. Today, maintenance of open habitats such as pasture grasslands needs to be performed by mechanical actions aimed at removing shrubs and woody vegetation. We document a case study on a plot sampled for five consecutive years (2017-2021) in which clear-cutting increased the cover of herbaceous vegetation by removing shrubs, potentially improving pasture quality. Also, changes in the small mammal community were detected, such as an increase in the species density and diversity (Shannon index) after clear-cutting, with the occurrence of typical grassland species (Microtus arvalis, M. lavernedii). Nonetheless, the effects were short-term (lasting two years), and then the community returned to the pre-treatment situation. Prior to intervention, the community was dominated by two generalist and widespread species (A. sylvaticus and C. russula), and the situation was similar two years after the intervention. Small increases in shrub cover produced relevant community changes by decreasing diversity and increasing dominance of the two most common species. These results suggested that shrub encroachment produced the banalization of small mammal communities dominated by generalist species.

AB  - The damage to trees that is caused by ungulate species is a natural result of their presence in ecosystems. High densities of ungulates may have a negative effect on biodiversity and the regeneration and survival of trees. The aim of this study was to identify the factors that affect the probability of the occurrence of damage in forest stands as a result of the presence of European bison (Bison bonasus). We collected data on the presence of European bison in given locations in winter and spring of 2020; this data also concerned damage to trees, forest stand characteristics, and densities of other ungulates.
   European bison was the most important debarking agent. Within the home range of the European bison, 344 forest stands were damaged, which represented 43.5% of all stands. The most frequent damage was bark stripping, 35.9%. The most important factors in terms of bark damage were canopy cover, dominating tree species, dominating tree age, and distance to a feeder. More debarking occurred in stands with open canopies, and coniferous species were more likely to be damaged than broadleaved species. Frequency of damage in forest stands with dominating Norway spruce was higher than 0.5, whereas for forest stands with silver fir and Scots pine it was over 0.4. Other coniferous species also presented a relatively high proportion of damage (0.38). The results of our study indicate a need for rational damage-prevention measures in the ranges of other free-living wisent populations that live in managed forests.

AB  - Grassy ecosystems cover >25% of the world's land surface area. The abundance of herbaceous vegetation in these systems directly impacts a variety of ecological processes, including carbon sequestration, regulation of water and nutrient cycling, and support of grazing wildlife and livestock. Efforts to quantify herbaceous biomass, however, are often limited by a trade-off between accuracy and spatial scale. Here, we describe a method for using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to estimate continuous aboveground biomass (AGB) at sub-meter resolutions over large (10-10 000 ha) spatial scales. Across two African savanna ecosystems, we compared field- and LiDAR-derived structural metrics-including measures of vegetation height and volume-with destructively harvested AGB by aligning our geospatial data with the location of harvested quadrats. Using this combination of approaches, we develop scaling equations to estimate spatially continuous herbaceous AGB over large areas. We demonstrate the utility of this method using a long-term, large herbivore exclosure experiment as a case study and comprehensively compare common field- and LiDAR-derived metrics for estimating herbaceous AGB. Our results indicate that UAV-borne LiDAR provides comparable accuracy to standard field methods but over considerably larger areas. Nearly every measure of vegetation structure we quantified using LiDAR provided estimates of AGB that were comparable in accuracy (R-2 > 0.6) to the suite of common field methods we evaluated. However, marked differences between our two sites indicate that, for applications where accurate estimation of absolute biomass is a priority, site-specific parameterization with destructive harvesting is necessary regardless of methodology. With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing data globally, our results indicate that many measures of herbaceous vegetation structure can be used to accurately compare AGB, even in the absence of complementary field data.

AB  - Context Ungulates have been introduced to many environments around the world. Some of these populations have become invasive, resulting in severe economic, social, and environmental impacts. In 1886, chital deer (Axis axis) were introduced to north Queensland, Australia, and the population has since grown and expanded.Aims To understand where chital deer are likely to occur in the future, we examined the relationship between chital deer abundance and environmental variables at two scales, namely, local and regional.Methods The local scale was surveyed using camera traps on a single property, and regional scale data were collected from a landholder survey of properties across the current distribution of chital deer in the region.Key results High predicted soil phosphorus was correlated with high relative abundance of chital deer at both the local and regional scales. In addition, at the local scale, higher predicted soil sodium content and normalised vegetation index (NDVI, 'greenness'), close proximity to homesteads and highways, and lower canopy cover and height were strongly correlated with increased chital deer abundance.Conclusions There were more chital in areas with high predicted soil phosphorus at both local and regional scales.Implications This study has the following two implications for management: (1) areas with high predicted soil phosphorous content had the highest relative abundance of deer at both scales, and should be the focus of control efforts, and (2) such areas are more vulnerable to future invasion of chital deer and should be monitored closely.

AB  - Goats browsing in woodlands, whether for livestock production goals or vegetation management (e.g., targeted grazing to control invasive plants), are at risk of meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) infection. Indeed, up to 25% incidence has been observed in goats employed in vegetation management. Infection, which occurs via the consumption of an infected gastropod intermediate host, is potentially deadly in goats. We experimentally tested whether co-grazing with waterfowl could reduce goats' exposure via waterfowl consumption of gastropods. Gastropods were sampled in a deciduous woodland before and after the addition of goats alone, goats and waterfowl, or a control with no animal addition. We found that goats browsing on their own increased the abundance of P. tenuis intermediate hosts; however, when goats co-grazed with waterfowl, these increases were not observed. Importantly, waterfowl did not significantly affect overall gastropod abundance, richness, or diversity. Thus, waterfowl co-grazing may effectively reduce goat contact with infectious gastropods without detrimentally affecting the gastropod community. While co-grazing goats with waterfowl may decrease their P. tenuis exposure risk, additional research is needed to confirm whether waterfowl can actually lower P. tenuis incidence.

AB  - The world's terrestrial biomes are broadly classified according to the dominant plant growth forms that define ecosystem structure and processes. Although the abundance and distribution of different plant growth forms can be strongly determined by factors such as climate and soil composition, large mammalian herbivores have a strong impact on plant communities, thus defaunation (the local or functional extinction of large animals) has the potential to alter the compositional structure of plant growth forms in natural ecosystems. Tropical rainforests sustain a high diversity of growth forms, including trees, palms, lianas, shrubs, herbs and bamboos, all of which play important ecosystem functions. Here, we experimentally evaluate how large mammalian herbivores affect the dominance, diversity and coexistence of these major tropical forest plant growth forms, by monitoring communities of saplings on the understorey in 43 paired exclusion plots in a long-term replicated exclusion experiment in the understorey of the Atlantic forest of Brazil. Over the course of 10 years large herbivore exclusion decreased diversity among growth forms, increased the absolute abundance of palms and trees (22% and 38% respectively) and increased the diversity of species within these two groups, to the detriment of other growth forms. Furthermore, all pairwise relationships between growth forms were positive on plots where herbivores had access, whereas several strong negative relationships emerged in plots where herbivores were excluded. This occurred despite strong background directional temporal trends affecting plant communities in both experimental treatments across the region. Synthesis. Our work indicates that the defaunation alters growth form dominance by favouring palms and trees while eroding diversity among growth forms and coexistence on a temporal scale. Large herbivore mammals promote diversity among growth forms, preventing the hyper-dominance of trees and palms, yet without supressing the diversity of species within growth forms. We argue that large herbivore mammals affect growth forms through several non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, including herbivory, seed dispersal and physical disturbance, as well as differential effects linked to the morphological and physiological adaptations of growth forms. We conclude that defaunation might lead to profound impacts on important ecosystem functions underpinned by growth form diversity, and result in vertical and horizontal structural simplification of tropical rainforests.

AB  - Axis deer Axis axis have been widely introduced to new geographic ranges, and in the United States, free-ranging axis deer have become well established in the Edwards Plateau ecoregion as well as other portions of Texas. However, no estimates of axis deer population density nor size have been conducted since 1994. It is hypothesized that axis deer on the Edwards Plateau are potentially competing with native white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus for food, space, and habitat resources, and causing damage to important riparian habitats. Our goal was to estimate regional densities of axis deer and white-tailed deer, and provide insight about the potential impacts axis deer may have on native wildlife and their habitats. Estimated using distance sampling techniques in 2018 and 2019, average axis deer density was 19.7 (95% CI: 14.1-25.6) axis deer/km2 compared with 23.0 (95% CI: 18.2-27.5) white-tailed deer/km2, and axis deer densities ranged from 16.9 to 171.0/km2 among eight different land cover types in Kimble County, Texas, with a county-wide estimate of 61,078 (95% CI: 30,407-100,369) axis deer. Axis deer densities were greatest in riparian land cover types, and they selected for two riparian land cover types and upland grasslands. Axis deer population estimates clearly indicate their population size has increased substantially since introduction to Texas in the 1930s. Population management of axis deer is warranted to limit impacts to native wildlife from potential habitat usurpation, or damage to riparian vegetation communities, soil, and water quality.

AB  - While the negative impacts of dam construction on downstream river stretches and riparian forests are well studied, the status of wildlife presence and persistence in upstream reservoir deltas is virtually unknown. We investigated the drivers of terrestrial mammal occupancy and persistence along riparian forests of Koyna reservoir in western India 55 years after its construction. We adopted a catchment-wide field design grounded in the river continuum concept and sampled different stream orders within the reservoir. Camera traps, nested in an occupancy modeling framework, were deployed across 72 riparian sites and replicated for four seasons across all stream types. We recorded a total of nineteen species of terrestrial mammals during the study period. Multi-season occupancy models revealed three key patterns of mammal persistence: (a) ungulates were more frequently photo-captured in riparian forests; gaur and wild pig had the highest proportions of the total sampled area (0.84 +/- 0.12 SE; 0.77 +/- 0.07 SE, respectively); (b) small-sized ungulates were more vulnerable to local extinction than large-bodied ungulates; extinction probability was highest for barking deer (0.59 +/- 0.07) and lowest for sambar (0.15 +/- 0.07); and (c) distance from stream played major roles in determining mammal detection. Riparian forests are fundamentally important to ecosystem functioning and biodiversity conservation, and using the data from this study, managers can plan to sustain high mammal persistence along riparian forests at Koyna reservoir or similar Indian reserves. Further, our robust sampling approach, grounded in the terrestrial-riverine continuum concept, can be applied globally to understand species assemblages, aiding in multi-landscape and wildlife management planning.

AB  - Ungulates have been shown to affect multiple aspects of ecosystem composition and functions, including species diversity and carbon storage. Specifically, they can impact below-ground carbon via both direct and indirect routes-the latter often occurring when ungulates alter plant diversity and/or plant functional traits. To date, the role of indirect routes has been poorly researched, particularly for omnivorous ungulates. In this study, we investigated both direct and indirect links between an omnivorous ungulate, the wild boar, and soil organic carbon. We estimated wild boar visit frequencies to different survey plots using camera traps, from which we recorded plant species and soil organic carbon. Weighted average structural equation models suggested wild boar presence was associated with plant communities with more resource-acquisitive traits, which in turn corresponded to lower soil organic carbon. However, no direct relationships between wild boar and soil organic carbon or plant species diversity were detected. This work provides, for the first time, empirical evidence on how boar benefit resource-acquisitive plants that can exploit disturbance and rapidly obtain resources to grow quickly, subsequently leading to decreases in soil organic carbon. Practical implication. As a single keystone ungulate species failed to improve both soil carbon storage and plant diversity, our results point towards the importance of securing functionally diverse ungulate communities for improving the contribution of trophic rewilding towards climate change mitigation efforts.

AB  - Our study monitored the changes in elephant numbers, distribution, and ecological impacts over a 50-year period. During this period, the free-ranging intermingled movements of wildlife and traditional subsistence pastoralists across the Amboseli ecosystem were disrupted by a national park, livestock ranches, farms, settlements, and changing lifestyles and economies. Elephants compressed into the national park by poaching and settlement turned woodlands to grassland and shrublands, and swamps into short grazing lawns, causing a reduction of plant and herbivore diversity and resilience to extreme events. The results echo the ecological findings of high-density elephant populations in protected areas across eastern and southern Africa. The impact has led to the view of elephants in parks as being incompatible with biodiversity and to population control measures. In contrast to Amboseli National Park, we found woody vegetation grew and plant diversity fell in areas abandoned by elephants. We therefore used naturalistic and exclosure experiments to determine the density-dependent response of vegetation to elephants. We found plant richness to peak at the park boundary where elephants and livestock jostled spatially, setting up a creative browsing-grazing tension that caused a patchwork of habitats and peak of plant richness. Prehistorical and historical literature reviews lend support to the Amboseli findings that elephants and people, the two dominant keystone species in the savannas, have been intimately entangled and coexisted prior to the global ivory trade and colonialism. The findings point to the need to view specific elephant populations in historical perspective and, as far as possible, create connectivity beyond protected areas to allow mobility on an ecosystem and landscape scale. The Amboseli study underscores the significance of space and mobility in the keystone role of elephants, and community-based conservation as a way to foster coexistence at an ecosystem and landscape scale. Space and mobility also alleviate the ecological disruption of compressed populations, and minimizes population management.

AB  - Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) is an invasive shrub introduced to the U.S. in the late 1800s for ornamental use. Since its introduction, it has spread throughout the eastern U.S., becoming especially problematic in urban and peri-urban forest fragments. Once introduced in an ecosystem, L. maackii establishes a dense thicket that restricts understory light and alters understory plant communities. This study monitored the flowering early spring floral community in forests with varying densities of L. maackii (high, low, and no-density) before and after L. maackii removal in Raven Run Nature Sanctuary, a natural area on the outskirts of Lexington, KY, U.S. In plots from which L. maackii was removed, we documented higher flowering spring flora abundance (102-125%), diversity (32%), and richness (47%) compared to plots from which L. maackii was not removed. While abundance did not vary with prior L. maackii density, diversity and richness were 40% and 53% higher, respectively, in plots with low prior L. maackii density than high prior L. maackii density. Finally, flowering plant assemblages were similar across prior L. maackii density (low vs. high) but differed with L. maackii removal treatment (removed vs. unremoved and no L. maackii vs. removed). Flowering spring plants quickly recover after L. maackii removal, but some residual effects of L. maackii continue to structure understory plant communities even after removal. Early removal of. L. maackii from invaded stands and continued management to prevent re-introduction are essential to support recovery of diverse understory plant communities in affected forests.

AB  - Seedling is a crucial stage in the growth and development of plants, and the expansion and persistence of plant populations can be achieved through seed regeneration. Sheep grazing, fertilization, light, soil moisture, vegetation diversity and biomass, and litter all have potential impacts on species regeneration. We measured vegetation diversity, annual net primary productivity (ANPP), litter, ground photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and soil moisture of alpine meadows under sheep grazing and nitrogen addition treatments, and studied their effects on the dicotyledonous seedling abundance and diversity using linear regression models (LMs) and structural equation models (SEMs). We found that sheep grazing reduced ANPP, increased vegetation diversity and PAR, and decreased soil moisture. Fertilization increased ANPP and litter, decreased vegetation diversity and PAR, but had no effect on soil moisture. Sheep grazing and fertilization both reduced the abundance of dicotyledonous seedlings, and simultaneously fertilization can reduce the diversity of dicotyledonous seedlings, while sheep grazing had no effect on the diversity of dicotyledonous seedlings. LMs showed that vegetation diversity, ANPP, and litter, rather than light and soil moisture, affected dicotyledonous seedling abundance and diversity. SEMs revealed that sheep grazing and fertilization indirectly influenced seedling regeneration through vegetation diversity rather than ANPP and litter. Our research will increase our understanding of the dicotyledonous plant regeneration process in alpine grasslands and facilitate the development of strategies for management and protection of alpine grassland.

AB  - Understanding the interacting role of climate and habitat in shaping wildlife population dynamics can help to reveal synergistic pathways that drive population resilience or decline across variable and changing environments. Moose (Alces alces) is a pan-boreal herbivore experiencing population declines across large portions of North America; however, the species has shown variable response to climate across its distribution. We investigated moose demographic response to climate and evaluated the interacting role of habitat across 36 years and along a biogeographic gradient in Ontario, Canada that has experienced decadal changes to climate and habitat quality. Moose density exhibited a nonlinear trend that initially increased and then decreased over the study timeframe and was negatively affected by regional and local patterns of winter severity and later frost onset. Recruitment exhibited a monotonic decline and was positively affected by spring heat and deciduous forest cover, while also exhibiting density-dependent effects. The negative response of moose density to winter severity was reduced in Wildlife Management Units (WMUs) with higher proportions of dense canopy cover, supporting expectations that this habitat type improves moose winter mobility and predator avoidance. The negative effect of later frost onset was greater in WMUs with more regenerating forest, and both variables are associated with higher exposure to parasites and predators. Further, density-dependent effects on recruitment were suppressed by warmer springs that support vegetation productivity and in WMUs with higher proportions of dense canopy cover that can provide concealment from predators. Our study illustrates the important role habitat conditions can have to mitigate, or exacerbate, climate-change effects for a wide-spread herbivore occupying variable environments by potentially altering pathways relevant to energetic balance, predation, and parasite transmission. In this system, moose occupying sparse or regenerating forests are more susceptible to adverse climatic effects and should be managed accordingly. (c) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - High densities of cattle (Bos taurus) and wild ungulates (Rocky Mountain elk, Cervus canadensis; mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus) have impacted the abundance and population dynamics of palatable woody species in forests of the interior Pacific Northwest, USA. As a result, large shrubs are functionally absent from some forest stands. Physical structures can provide safe sites for browsed species to persist within forests. We evaluated the role of coarse woody debris and conifer trees in protecting a common, yet heavily browsed species, serviceberry (Amelanchier alnifolia) from elk, deer and cattle. We measured height and architecture of individuals and the degree to which they were protected by coarse woody debris and unpalatable conifers in areas exposed to ungulates and in ungulate exclosures. Multiple linear regression and quantile regression were used to test for the effects of protection and foliar overlap on plant height. Results showed that increased protection and foliar overlap resulted in a lower proportion of shrubs exhibiting arrested architecture. Shrub height increased as foliar overlap and protection increased, with effects primarily restricted to high levels of protection (> 300 degrees surrounded by nearby conifer trees and/or coarse woody debris). Taller shrubs were most associated with intermediate levels of foliar overlap. Results support the hypothesis that understory structural elements can act as protective barriers. Forest management actions (e.g., prescribed fire, understory thinning) that reduce the prevalence of structures may unintentionally suppress browsed shrub species and contribute to the continued functional absence of tall deciduous species in dry conifer forests.

AB  - Background Animal communities have complex patterns of ecological segregation at different levels according to food resources, habitats, behavior, and activity patterns. Understanding these patterns among the community is essential for the conservation of the whole ecosystem. However, these networks are difficult to study nowadays, due to anthropic disturbances and local extinctions, making it difficult to conclude if segregation patterns are natural or human-induced. We studied ecological segregation in a community of large and mid-sized mammals in the Great Gobi Desert, a remote arid area free from recent extinctions and human disturbances. Activity patterns of 10 sympatric mammal species were monitored around 6 waterholes through camera-trapping over a two-year period, and analyzed them primarily through circular statistics. Results Complex patterns of spatial, seasonal, and daily segregation were found. Overlap in seasonal activity was detected in only 3 of the 45 possible pairs of species. Four species used the waterholes all-year-round, while others peaked their activity during different periods. The Bactrian camel showed continuous daily activity, the grey wolf had bimodal activity, and the argali and Siberian ibex were diurnal, while the others had nocturnal peaks during different hours. Daily and spatial overlap were both detected in only 6 of the 45 pairs. Only one species pair (snow leopard and Eurasian lynx) showed an overlap at two levels: seasonal and daily. Climate and moon phase significantly affected the activity of certain species. Conclusions Altogether, the results showed complex patterns of ecological segregation at different levels in the use of the key resource in arid environments: waterholes. These results are important for understanding the biology of these species under natural conditions, as well as potential changes in altered ecosystems, and may help to design conservation strategies.

AB  - Different conceptions of disturbance differ in the degree to which they appeal to mechanisms that are general and equivalent, or species-, functional group-, or interaction-specific. Some concepts of disturbance, for example, predict that soil disturbances and herbivory have identical impacts on species richness via identical mechanisms (reduction in biomass and in competition). An alternative hypothesis is that the specific traits of disturbance agents (small mammals) and plants differentially affect the richness or abundance of different plant groups. We tested these hypotheses on a degu (Octodon degus) colony in central Chile. We ask whether native and non-native forbs respond differently to degu bioturbation on runways versus herbivory on grazing lawns. We ask whether this can explain the increase in non-native plants on degu colonies. We found that biopedturbation did not explain the locations of non-native plants. We did not find direct evidence of grazing increasing non-native herbs either, but a grazing effect appears to be mediated by grass, which is the dominant cover. Further, we provide supplementary evidence to support our interpretation that a key mechanism of non-native spread is the formation of dry soil conditions on grazing lawns. Thus, ecosystem engineering (alteration of soil qualities) may be an outcome of disturbances, in which each interacts with specific plant traits, to create the observed pattern of non-native spread in the colony. Based on these results, we propose to extend Jentsch and White (Ecology, 100, 2019, e02734) concept of combined pulse/ disturbance events to the long-term process duality of ecosystem engineering/ disturbance.

AB  - In disturbance-adapted ecosystems, the removal of disturbance can lead to losses of diversity and sometimes irreversible changes in community composition. It is important to identify the thresholds at which these changes can occur, and to understand the reversibility of these shifts. We examined this question in a vernal pool ecosystem that evolved with low to moderate levels of grazing disturbance. In this system, it is not clear whether the negative effects of long-term grazing exclusion are reversible through grazing reintroduction. We compared adjacent vernal pool wetlands in annual Mediterranean grasslands under three grazing management strategies: continuously grazed (100+ years), long-term excluded (40+ years) and 2 years of reintroduced grazing. We also asked whether grazing treatments altered pool characteristics that are likely to influence plant community composition, and how these relationships changed with environmental conditions. Reintroducing grazing to vernal pools led to both increased diversity and native cover, but the effects on native cover were more immediate than on diversity. We identified several biotic and abiotic mechanisms related to this pattern, including changes to competitive dynamics that favour small statured native annuals and increases in hoofprint microdepressions that make soil moisture more available to plants. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that reintroduced grazing at moderate stocking rates can have significant effects on plant communities after just 2 years and can increase native cover more quickly than overall diversity. Our findings suggest that the negative effects of long-term grazing exclusion in vernal pools may be reversible, but that land managers interested in restoring diversity should plan to monitor beyond the first two years of grazing reintroduction.

AB  - A warming climate is driving the poleward expansion of tropical, subtropical, and temperate plant and animal distributions. These changes have and continue to lead to the colonization of novel organisms into areas beyond their historical ranges. While the full scope of ecological impacts remains unclear, these expansions could alter density-dependent interactions, habitat occupancy patterns, and food web dynamics- similar to exotic species impacts in invaded ecosystems. Seagrasses are habitats of particular interest, given their widespread distribution and ecosystem services. While multiple recent studies report on the effects of the return of larger tropical herbivores in seagrass beds in warming subtropical waters, less is known about the addition of mid-trophic level consumers. These consumers are often key determinants of energy and nutrient transfers from basal resources to higher order predators. Here, we discuss the potential impacts of these distribution changes on temperate and subtropical seagrass communities using information derived from invasive species studies. Notably, we outline several scenarios and generate predictions about how their establishment might occur and speculate on impacts of warmer water consumers as they move poleward. We also discuss potential confounding factors of detecting changes in these consumer distributions. Following the invasive species literature, we offer a framework for generating hypotheses and predicting effects from these range-expanding organisms. Given that climates are predicted to continue to warm into the future, thus facilitating additional species expansions, our goal is to guide future research efforts and provide information for rapid dissemination and utility for this growing subdiscipline of marine ecology.

AB  - Bioturbation is a process caused by animals that move particles and water in sediments. This influences gas and solute exchange, and organic matter concentrations through the sediment column. Bioturbators play an important role in biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning. To date, bioturbation research has focused on the invertebrate macrofauna present in the sediment. However, many larger marine animals (e.g. rays, sharks, whales) display foraging behaviours that disturb the sediment and thus potentially affect sediment biogeochemistry. We propose a categorization of vertebrate megafauna bioturbation based on their reworking behaviours, classifying them as 'pit creators', 'bulldozers', and 'trench diggers'. These categories underscore the diversity of impacts on sediment structure and biogeochemical processes. The need to investigate the topic comes from the limited knowledge surrounding the extent to which sediment biogeochemistry is influenced by megafauna activities. Additionally, the declining population of vertebrate megafauna due to climate change, overfishing, bycatch, and habitat loss and modification makes discerning the functional roles of these animals in the sediment a pressing issue. Understanding the ecological implications of megafauna bioturbation will be critical to support conservation strategies and protect marine ecosystems and the animals that shape them.

AB  - QuestionMammalian herbivory affects the structure and composition of plant communities, soil characteristics and intraspecific leaf traits. Understanding the effects of this type of herbivory is particularly relevant in grey dunes, a priority habitat type of the European Union Habitats Directive.LocationS & aacute;lvora island (NW Spain).MethodsVegetation surveys and sampling were carried out in a coastal grey-dune community, comparing the structure and composition of plant communities and soil characteristics in plots with herbivory exclusion and plots with herbivore activity, in autumn and spring. Changes in the specific leaf area (SLA), C/N ratio, delta 13C and delta 15N of two main plant species were also analysed.ResultsThe differentiation between treatments was low in autumn, in contrast to spring results, which demonstrated seasonal variation in the plant community and herbivore behaviour. Spring results showed lower above-ground dry mass in plots with herbivory due to defoliation, but greater richness and diversity, indicating that intermediate levels of disturbance reduced competition from dominant species. Herbivory treatments were different in terms of species composition, highlighting the positive effects of herbivory on the development of the threatened species Linaria arenaria. Soil temperature and moisture content were higher in herbivory plots because of the suppression of vegetation cover and the effect of trampling, respectively. No differences were detected in the chemical composition of the soil or the SLA, although the variability of these traits was greater in herbivory plots, indicating spatial heterogeneity generated by the activity of herbivores. No differences between treatments were obtained for % C and delta 13C, whereas herbivory plots showed lower values of N content and delta 15N as an adaptive response to herbivory pressure at the leaf and root level.ConclusionOur findings show that herbivory effects on plant communities vary by season - stronger in spring and weaker in autumn - emphasising the need for seasonal analysis and highlighting disturbance as a driver of spatial heterogeneity.

AB  - Hybridization can result in the transfer of adaptive genetic material from one species to another, known as adaptive introgression. Bottlenecked (and hence genetically depleted) species are expected to be particularly receptive to adaptive introgression, since introgression can introduce new or previously lost adaptive genetic variation. The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), which recently recovered from near extinction, is known to hybridize with the domestic goat (Capra aegagrus hircus), and signals of introgression previously found at the major histocompatibility complex were suggested to potentially be adaptive. Here, we combine two ancient whole genomes of Alpine ibex with 29 modern Alpine ibex genomes and 31 genomes representing six related Capra species to investigate the genome-wide patterns of introgression and confirm the potential relevance of immune loci. We identified low rates of admixture in modern Alpine ibex through various F statistics and screening for putative introgressed tracts. Further results based on demographic modelling were consistent with introgression to have occurred during the last 300 years, coinciding with the known species bottleneck, and that in each generation, 1-2 out of 100 Alpine ibex had a domestic goat parent. The putatively introgressed haplotypes were enriched at immune-related genes, where the adaptive value of alternative alleles may give individuals with otherwise depleted genetic diversity a selective advantage. While interbreeding with domestic species is a prevalent issue in species conservation, in this specific case, it resulted in putative adaptive introgression. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between hybridization, adaptive evolution, and the potential risks and benefits associated with anthropogenic influences on wild species.

AB  - Several sympatric deer species that utilize the same, limited resources during the lean season may compete for food resources and thus strongly affect forest regeneration and increase wildlife-forestry conflicts. Using fecal DNA metabarcoding, we studied winter diet compositions, food preferences, and dietary niche partitioning among moose, roe deer, and red deer in NE Poland during harsh (snowy) and mild winters to test the competition avoidance hypothesis. In coniferous and mixed forests, these three species exhibited browsing strategy, as their winter diets were dominated by a high proportion of woody browse (>99% of plant DNA sequences in moose, >90% in roe deer, and >79% in red deer fecal samples) and contained almost no grasses. Dietary richness per fecal sample was the lowest for moose (9.8), higher for roe deer (19.6), and the highest for red deer (26.3), as it was also composed of different forbs and ferns. The studied cervids were selective and strongly preferred Scots pine, Maleae (incl. rowan tree), Salix sp. and the ericaceous dwarf shrubs, and avoided Norway spruce, silver birch, oak, bramble, and alder buckthorn. During mild winters, increased browsing by roe deer and red deer on the ericaceous dwarf shrubs resulted in the overlap of their diets. When the snow cover depth exceeded 10 cm, these two deer species effectively partitioned their diets, in line with the hypothesis of competition avoidance for food resources. During harsh winter, however, the diets of roe deer and red deer overlapped to a larger extent with the moose 'conifer diet', resulting in possible competition for food. In effect, the joint browsing of native European deer species on young coniferous trees during harsh winter was larger than that during mild winters. The same could be the case in managed forests where available forage is usually scarce. These findings may have profound consequences for future forest and ungulate management under ongoing climate change.

AB  - Grazing disturbance affects an extensive area of the Monte desert (Argentina). Arthropods are the main faunistic component of the Monte and play key roles in ecosystem processes. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of grazing on the canopy arthropod assemblages that inhabit three representative shrub species of the southern Monte (Chuquiraga avellanedae, Schinus johnstonii and Larrea divaricata). Three sampling sites were established in three paddocks grazed by sheep and another three sites in a grazing exclosure. Five specimens of each shrub species were selected per site. Canopy arthropods were sampled using the beating method. The response of arthropod assemblages to grazing was found to vary among shrub species and between seasons. The assemblages associated with two shrub species (L. divaricata and C. avellanedae) were modified significantly by grazing. The most marked response was a general decrease in arthropod diversity in disturbed sites. The abundance of sap-sucking arthropods increased with grazing. These results could be related, in part, to differences in canopy architecture between grazed and ungrazed sites. This study contribute to understanding the ecological impacts of grazing on biological communities of the southern Monte and will aid in developing management strategies that improve regional biodiversity outcomes.

AB  - Agricultural intensification threatens biodiversity, requiring a shift to agroecological farming. Identifying locally specific management practices that can effectively enhance biodiversity can help guide farmland conservation efforts. We assess the effect of management practices and environmental variables on arthropod diversity under varying vineyard management regimes in a South African biosphere reserve. We also determine whether the implementation of these practices and their combined effect on arthropods differ between integrated and organic vineyards. Arthropod morphospecies richness and evenness were assessed for different taxonomic groups (spiders, beetles, and true bugs), in different positions in the crop (ground level, on cover crops, and on vine foliage) and for different feeding guilds (herbivores, detritivores, and predators). Percentage herbaceous vegetation cover had a consistent positive effect on morphospecies richness across taxa, microhabitats, and guilds. Other vegetation-related variables, such as volume of plant litter, plant species richness, and plant height positively influenced several of the biodiversity responses. We did not detect any negative effect of agrochemicals used in an integrated approach, or a strong effect of overall farming approach (organic vs. integrated) on the species richness or evenness of any of the focal taxa, sampled positions, or guilds. These results indicate that the maintenance of dense and diverse cover crops is a strategic way to enhance vineyard arthropod diversity where other management practices are already implemented sensitively. This highlights that minimal adjustment of management practices can greatly benefit farmland biodiversity conservation and is in keeping with the ethos of the concept of a biosphere reserve.

AB  - Most grazing lands in Mediterranean ecosystems that support extensive sheep farming systems are characterized by unfavorable edapho-climatic conditions, especially in semi-arid areas. Often, though, their use is far from sustainable, causing erosion and ecosystem degradation impacts. In this paper, we explore the use, productivity, and flora diversity of typical Mediterranean grazing lands in four farms at the Agra locality in the western part of Lesvos Island, Greece. For a period of two consecutive growing seasons (September to June), we recorded herbage biomass on 16 plots of grazing lands with three measurements per season of land cover and plant productivity (biomass) inside small exclosures (cages) protected from grazing. We recorded the species richness of herbaceous plant communities within and outside the cages at the end of every growing season, the period of maximum growth of herbaceous species. We also chemically analyzed the biomass for crude protein at the end of each season. Results show sizable productivity differences among pasture plots as well as seasons and an overall medium to high degree of productivity and species richness considering the relatively intensive grazing, with little differences over the different cages and the degree of grazing intensity. These results suggest that the "history" of the fields is important, as grazing lands that had been used for arable crops in the past, as well as those leveled and in favorable locations, were the most productive and diverse ones, while shallower soils and inclined grazing lands showed signs of overuse and degradation. Overall, though, these ecosystems showed a high degree of resilience despite their intensive use.

AB  - Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing plants such as Russian olive can significantly impact soil chemistry and invertebrate biodiversity in riparian ecosystems. Here, the effects of Russian olive on soil chemical properties and invertebrate communities in riparian zones of the southwestern United States were investigated. Russian olive stands were compared to native cottonwood stands and restoration sites by analyzing soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and moisture levels, and arthropod diversity and abundance. Sites where Russian olive is present led to a net increase in soil nitrogen, a decrease in soil phosphorus, and greater soil moisture compared to both native cottonwood stands and restoration sites. Native cottonwood stands showed lower soil N and higher P levels, as well as higher arthropod diversity. This increased diversity could be linked to the soil's nutrient stoichiometry, as there is a negative correlation between taxonomic diversity and the soil N:P ratio. Moreover, there was a greater abundance of detritivorous arthropods in Russian olive stands compared to native vegetation. Soil nitrate (NO3-) levels showed a strong positive correlation with detritivorous arthropod abundance (r2 = 0.98), but only a moderate correlation with herbivores (r2 = 0.38), and NO3- was unrelated to predator abundance (r2 = 0.01). These results suggest that Russian olive stands can alter soil chemistry in ways that disproportionately benefit detritivores, potentially disrupting the balance of arthropod communities and reducing overall biodiversity in riparian ecosystems. The study underscores the need for careful management of invasive, symbiotic N2-fixing plant species to preserve the ecological integrity of riparian habitats.

AB  - Many ecosystems are grazed by livestock or large, wild herbivores and exist as mosaics of different vegetation communities. Changing grazing could have an impact on heterogeneity as well as on composition. A long-term, large-scale grazing experiment that maintained existing low-intensity sheep grazing, tripled it, removed it and partially substituted sheep grazing by cattle grazing was set up on a mosaic of upland vegetation types. The impact of changing grazing regimes was assessed in terms of changes in temporal and spatial species and functional beta diversity. Removal of grazing had the highest impact on species replacement, whilst increased grazing was closest to maintaining the original species complement. Wet heath and Molina mire had the lowest turnover, but wet heath showed the highest changes in unidirectional abundance as it contained species capable of increasing in abundance in response to changing grazing intensity. Agrostis-Festuca and Nardus grasslands displayed the highest level of balanced species replacement reflecting their more dynamic vegetation. In functional terms, there was no clear separation of communities based on their grazing preference, all were relatively resistant to change but Nardus grassland was the most resistant to the removal of grazing. The increased offtake associated with increased grazing led to a degree of homogenisation as grazing tolerant species associated with preferred communities increased in the unpreferred ones. Decisions about grazing management of the uplands involve many trade-offs, and this study identified potential trade-offs between stability and homogenisation to add to existing ones on the biodiversity of different groups of species and on ecosystem services.

AB  - 1. Large mammalian herbivores are vital components of terrestrial ecosystems, influencing the plants they feed on, but also serving as ecosystem engineers that impact the occurrence and survival of many other organisms. Arthropods are the most abundant and diverse animal group on earth, filling all trophic levels in food webs and facilitating essential ecosystem services. However, the impacts of large herbivores on arthropod communities and the mechanisms via which these impacts are mediated are not fully understood.
   2. Here, we experimentally separated the mechanistic pathways whereby large herbivores affect arthropod food webs using a 24-year manipulative multi-site field experiment in the Netherlands. We analysed the abundance, biomass and community composition of arthropods in the plant canopy and on the soil surface, both in grazed sites or sites where large herbivores were excluded.
   3. We found that the presence of large herbivores resulted in considerable differences in vegetation properties and microclimate which influenced the abundance and biomass of arthropods to varying trophic levels. Large herbivore grazing enhanced the overall abundance and biomass of arthropod herbivores, pollinators, omnivores and soil-dwelling predators, but reduced that of detritivores, scavengers, parasitoids and canopy predators. Structural equation models revealed that different trophic groups are affected by grazing via different pathways. Specially, large herbivores facilitated herbivores via increasing plant quality and enhanced ground-dwelling predators via increasing plant diversity. In contrast, plant-dwelling predators were suppressed via decreased plant quantity, and parasitoids were mainly affected by changes in microclimate conditions.
   4. Synthesis. Our results show that large mammalian herbivores play a significant role in shaping grassland arthropod food webs, and that these impacts were independently mediated by multiple aspects of vegetation properties, that is, physical structure, plant diversity, standing crop biomass and leaf nutrient content. Arthropods of different trophic groups responded differently to the large herbivores, and these functional group-specific responses in turn may have strong cascading effects on numerous ecosystem services.

AB  - Reintroducing megafauna to their historic range is an effective strategy to halt their extinctions and restore ecosystems. Wild water buffalo (Bubalus arnee) is an endangered megaherbivore that is lost from 95% of its range. About 90% of its global population (less than 4000) resides within India, in two isolated populations: northeast and central India. The central Indian population is on the verge of extinction and warrants urgent conservation interventions. We assess the potential and provide a strategy for reintroducing buffaloes in Kanha National Park, India. Habitat suitability using the global occurrence of buffalo revealed low-lying grasslands with least human pressure found in Kanha (390 km2) to be suitable. Within this suitable range, we evaluated vegetation composition, forage biomass, and potential carrying capacity. Multidimensional ordination classified these suitable sites into moist and dry grassland clusters. Moist grasslands were found to better suit reintroduction due to lower grazing pressure, higher productivity, and availability of perennial water sources. Distinct matriarchal clades of swamp and river buffalo were observed. Within the river buffalo clade, Indian wild buffaloes formed a distinct cluster with close proximity between northeast and central Indian samples, suggesting northeast buffaloes could be sourced for a founding population in Kanha. Following IUCN guidelines, we discuss the reintroduction strategy that could sustain approximately 200 buffaloes in the area and subsequently expand to other suitable habitats in central India. If implemented as proposed, recovery of this lost ecosystem engineer will help to restore grasslands, and swamp habitats, as well as contribute to its global conservation efforts.

AB  - Questions have been raised about the application of conventional post-windthrow forest practices such as salvage logging, site preparation, and afforestation in response to the increase in wind disturbance caused by climate change. In particular, it is necessary to identify effective forest management practices that consider the pressure from deer browsing in forests in cold, snowy regions because the population of ungulates is expected to increase. The impacts of legacy destruction, i.e., the destruction of advance regeneration, microsites, and soil structure, caused by conventional post-windthrow practices have rarely been assessed separately from the impacts of subsequent deer browsing on forest regeneration or evaluated based on sufficiently long monitoring periods to assess vegetation succession. This lack of studies is one reason that alternative forest management practices to salvaging and planting have not been proposed. We conducted a field experiment at a large-scale windthrow site with a deer population to (1) assess the impact of legacy destruction and deer browsing on vegetation biomass and species composition after 15 years and (2) identify the effects of legacy retention. The study design allowed us to distinguish between and measure the impact of legacy destruction and that of subsequent deer browsing during a 15-year period. The results revealed the following: (1) Salvage logging and site preparation suppressed the development of biomass of shrub and tree layers in forested areas where harvest residues were piled up and shifted the plant communities in these areas to herbaceous plant communities. (2) Subsequent deer browsing suppressed the development of the biomass of shrub and tree layers throughout the forested site and shifted herbaceous communities to ruderal communities dominated by alien species; and 3. Compared with salvaging and planting, legacy retention enabled the windthrow sites to more quickly develop into a stand with characteristics similar to that of a mature, natural forest. Forest management practices that consider the presence of deer are necessary. We propose a policy shift from planting trees after salvaging to leaving downed trees to regenerate natural forests, unless there is concern about insect damage to the remaining forestry land in the vicinity.

AB  - Grassland bird responses to grazing and prescribed fire are species-specific and are primarily known from systems with cattle as the predominant grazer. There is less knowledge of how grazing by bison impacts grassland birds, especially in sites restored and reconstructed from row-crop agriculture. Working at a tallgrass prairie site consisting of restored and remnant prairie in the years following bison reintroduction and ongoing prescribed burning, we assessed overall species richness and the relative detection frequency of five focal species (Grasshopper Sparrow, Henslow's Sparrow, Dickcissel, Eastern Meadowlark, and Brown-headed Cowbird). We used stationary bioacoustics recorders to record the soundscape during the summer breeding season in areas with and without bison from 2016 to 2018. Species richness and the detection frequencies of our focal species were not influenced by bison disturbance. Grasshopper Sparrow and Dickcissel detection frequency increased slightly in response to prescribed fire, whereas Henslow's Sparrow detection frequency decreased. Time since sites were restored was a predominant factor that influenced the variation in detection frequency of Henslow's Sparrows and Eastern Meadowlarks, likely due to vegetation differences in restored versus remnant sites and each species' vegetation structure preferences. Brown-headed Cowbird detection frequency was unaffected by bison presence, prescribed fire, or time since restoration, but varied among sampling years. Our focal species showed no response to bison disturbance 4 y after the bison reintroduction. This suggests there could be a time-lag for a response or that these species will not respond to the bison reintroduction at this study site.

AB  - Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) evolved in grasslands with a diet composed of highly nutritious forbs. However, pronghorn habitat throughout North America has been lost to fragmentation and degradation. Additionally, the effects different cattle grazing regimes have on forb biomass, protein, and energy production for pronghorn are not well known in West Texas. We sampled forbs during the growing season in the months of September 2018 and 2019 to assess the effects of different cattle grazing regimes on forbs. We hypothesized rotational grazing would increase the nutritional quality of the forb community and overall forb production, compared to continuous grazing and no grazing. We randomly sampled pastures subject to continuous and rotational grazing, as well as ungrazed exclosures using 100, 96, and 64 1 m(2) plots, respectively. We collected all forbs in each plot and analyzed differences in nutritional composition and biomass production using redundancy analysis. We found that the effects of grazing varied by year. In wetter conditions, rotational grazing exhibited higher forb quality and biomass, while exclusion from grazing exhibited these results under drier conditions. The knowledge gained from this study helps resource professionals and landowners understand how cattle grazing affects forbs for pronghorn. This knowledge may be used to improve the suitability of pronghorn habitat through cattle grazing regimes. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Wildlife defaunation in tropical forests disrupts critical ecological functions such as predation, seed dispersal, and nutrient cycling. While exclusion experiments are commonly used to investigate the effects of wildlife loss on plant diversity and vegetation structure, their potential impact on broader ecosystem functions remains underexplored. Here we investigate how defaunation could affect ecosystem functions in the Amazon rainforest by quantifying the changes in the occurrence and frequency of behaviors exhibited by terrestrial mammals induced by experimental defaunation. Using camera traps, we recorded vertebrate behaviors across exclusion and control plots, categorizing them into feeding, excretion/defecation, bioturbation, and trampling. We then calculated weighted standardized indices, integrating behavior frequency and body mass, to assess the potential local impacts of vertebrates across plots. We found that all behaviors were drastically reduced (>95 % reduction) under severe defaunation conditions, primarily due to the absence of medium- and large-bodied mammals and birds. In defaunated plots, small mammals partially performed some behaviors, but they were unable to compensate for the loss of larger species. These results highlight the substantial reduction in critical vertebrate behaviors and suggest that such changes can significantly disrupt ecosystem functions in defaunated tropical forests.

AB  - Understanding multiple environmental drivers governing tropical organisms' distribution and ecological niches is crucial for predicting their responses to ongoing rapid deforestation. While macroclimatic effects via energy and water availability are well predicted, less is known about locally modulating factors such as canopy structure, light and edaphic conditions. Here we show that minimum temperatures and ambient humidity drive the abundance and richness of leaf-inhabiting epiphyllous bryophytes across 4-km elevation gradient on Mount Cameroon, West Africa, separating epiphyll-rich rainforests (0-2200 m a.s.l.) from epihyll-poor fire-driven afromontane savanna (2300-4000 m a.s.l.). However, local factors contribute more than half to the total abundance and richness variation, either directly (light) or indirectly (edaphic conditions) via their effects on host plant composition. The most abundant epiphyllous communities occur in vertically stratified upland rainforests between 600 and 1100 m elevation, where N-fixing tree legumes dominate. Their canopy is relatively sparse, due to nutrient-poor soils leached by high rainfall, leaving room for the development of diverse subcanopy tree and understory shrub and herb layers with epiphyll-rich communities. Vertically homogenous lowland rainforests on fertile soils below 500 m, with dense overstory and shaded and species-poor understory, have less developed epiphylls, as do seasonally dry montane forests between 2000 and 2300 m, or elephant fragmented forests between 1200 and 1600 m. We conclude that high temperature and humidity together with a vertically stratified canopy support epiphylls, whereas precipitation seasonality, disturbed vegetation with unstable microclimate, or dense, unstratified canopy discourage the development of epiphyllous communities. Our study illustrates that ecological niches of epiphyllous bryophytes are shaped by a complex interplay of multiple drivers, knowledge of which is essential for more realistic predictions of the impacts of current accelerated habitat loss on species distribution and diversity changes in the tropics.

AB  - Human-caused landscape disturbance is one of the major threats to large herbivores, globally. Across central British Columbia (BC), Canada, industrial forest harvesting has resulted in rapid change to forest structure and composition. Concurrent with the increase in forest harvesting, moose (Alces alces) populations across central BC have declined, some dramatically. We studied moose diet across three seasons in two regional study areas that represented a range of logging intensity and rate of apparent starvation of moose. We used microhistological analysis of pellets to identify the proportional consumption of major plant groups that were known forage for moose across the study areas, as well as the diversity of the diet of moose. We used regression models to test whether the composition and diversity of moose diet in two study areas were consistent with the Niche Expansion Hypothesis or the Niche Shrinkage Hypothesis. In areas of increased density and size of clearcuts, moose consumed fewer shrubs and fir trees and their diet was more diverse. Where application of herbicides was common, moose consumed fewer forbs and their diet was more diverse. Both responses were consistent with the Niche Expansion Hypothesis. In areas of increased disturbance by wildfire, moose consumed less fir and more shrubs. Our results suggest that landscape disturbance in the form of extensive and rapid forest harvesting can influence the composition and diversity of the diet of moose.

AB  - Biological invasions are a major threat to the terrestrial ecosystems of the sub-Antarctic islands. While non-native plants generally have negative impacts on native arthropods, few studies have investigated how both native and non-native arthropods and plants interact in the sub-Antarctic islands. This was the aim of our study, which was conducted on three islands of the Kerguelen archipelago. The design was based on the spatial proximity of areas dominated by non-native or native plant species. Trait-based indices were calculated to characterize the functional structure of plant communities, considering plant stature and leaf traits. Native and non-native vegetation had contrasting functional composition but their functional diversity was similar. The effects of the type of vegetation, native or non-native, and plant functional diversity on arthropods were tested. Native macro-arthropod richness and abundance were similar or higher in non-native vegetation, and benefited from greater plant functional diversity. Abundances of macro-herbivores, macro-decomposers and macro-predators were also similar or higher in non-native vegetation. Conversely, the abundances of micro-arthropods, Symphypleona springtails and Oribatida mites, were higher in native vegetation but we also found that plant functional diversity had a negative effect on Symphypleona. Our results suggest that non-native plants can affect micro-arthropods directly or indirectly, likely through their effects on abiotic factors. By affecting macro-arthropod abundances across different trophic groups and by depleting micro-arthropods, non-native plants can alter trophic interactions, functional balances and the functioning of whole ecosystem.

AB  - Improving the understanding of the causes and effects of anthropogenic hybridization is fundamental to ensure species conservation, particularly in the case of hybridization between wild species and their domestic relatives. Knowledge is missing for many species also because of a lack of appropriate tools for hybrid identification. Here, coupling genotype and phenotype analysis, we carried out an extensive investigation of ongoing hybridization in Alpine ibex Capra ibex, a mountain ungulate of conservation concern from a genetic perspective. By genotyping 63 diagnostic and 465 neutral SNPs, 20 suspected hybrids and 126 Alpine ibex without suspicious phenotype, representing 8 populations across a major part of the species distribution, we found evidence for ongoing hybridization between Alpine ibex and domestic goat. We identified different levels of hybridization including backcrosses into both Alpine ibex and domestic goat. Our results suggest a lack of reproductive barriers between the two species and good survival and reproductive success of the hybrids. Hybridization was locally intense, like a hybrid swarm, but not spread across the rest of the species distribution. Most of the hybrids were discovered in two locations in the north-west of Italy, while random sampling of individuals from different areas did not provide evidence of recent hybridization. Our method, based on amplicon sequencing of 63 diagnostic SNPs specifically developed for this purpose, allowed us to identify hybrids and backcrosses up to the fourth to fifth generations and was suitable for genetic samples of different quality, although with varying levels of certainty regarding the exact number of generations passed since hybridization. Based on the paired analysis of genotype and phenotype, we provide guidelines for the first identification of hybrids in the field and suggest a procedure for the reliable identification of hybrids.

AB  - Large herbivores are keystone species, so changes in their population abundance can have cascading effects on ecosystems. Over the last decades, many species of deer (Cervidae) have experienced unprecedented densities across many areas of the Northern Hemisphere, potentially leading to simplification of plant-pollinator communities, disruption of their interactions, and destabilization of ecological networks. Our study explores the impacts of increasing red deer (Cervus elaphus) densities on plant-pollinator networks.<br /> We describe, to our knowledge, the first large wild herbivore manipulative experiment with increasing densities, consisting of comparable hectare-scale enclosures in a Mediterranean ecosystem. We simulated two current scenarios of deer overabundance: high densities (>30 individuals km(-2)) and hyper densities (>90 individuals km(-2)). We compared these scenarios to an adjacent control exclosure (no deer). Deer herbivory reduced flower abundance of shrubs, as well as flowering plant and pollinator richness. Remaining plants and pollinators lost interactions, and some plants lost pollinator visitors. Network specialization and modularity decreased because modules (groups of strongly connected species) formed by herbs and specialist pollinators were gradually extirpated as deer density increased. This simplification increased network connectance and nestedness. Network robustness (a measure of stability) remained unaltered because the dominant plant, which attracted most pollinators, was unpalatable to deer.<br /> We conclude that, in overabundant deer scenarios: (1) impacts on plant-pollinator networks will increase with increasing deer density; (2) plant-pollinator networks will be eroded, especially if composed of palatable, rare plants, visited by specialist pollinators; but (3) plant-pollinator network stability will not be affected if dominant plants are generalists and unpalatable.

AB  - Livestock grazing dramatically impacts the belowground community in grasslands by altering resource input from plants, dung and urine return, and soil environments. However, the belowground response pattern as well as the alterations in soil resource input and environments remain uncertain along a grazing intensity gradient. Here, we examined the response pattern of the soil nematode community (abundance, diversity, structure and functions) to grazing intensity by performing a 5-year field manipulation experiment with four levels of yak grazing intensities in a Tibetan alpine meadow. Moderate grazing (i.e., 2 yak/ha) supported the highest abun-dances of all nematodes, plant feeders and omni-carnivores, and maintained the most closely interspecific in-teractions within the nematode community. Grazing intensity may affect the belowground community via compensatory growth of forages and bottom-up trophic effects from living roots to the soil micro-food web. Furthermore, moderate grazing increased the functional metabolic footprint index of the nematode community, activated the root energy channel, and maintained the balance between the bacterial and fungal channels, which can optimize soil nutrient cycling. The model averaging results showed that the response of the soil nematode community to grazing intensity was mainly related to the alteration of soil moisture, which also showed a hump -shaped response to increasing grazing intensity. These results indicate that the soil nematode community as well as the soil resource input and environments show a hump-shaped response to increasing yak grazing intensity. Our findings have strong implications in optimizing ecosystem structure and functions of grassland on Tibetan Plateau by managing grazing capacity.

AB  - Human activities, directly and indirectly, impact ecological engineering activities of subterranean rodents. As engineering activities of burrowing rodents are affected by, and reciprocally affect vegetation cover via feeding, burrowing and mound building, human influence such as settlements and livestock grazing, could have cascading effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes such as bioturbation. However, there is limited understanding of the relationship between human activities and burrowing rodents. The aim of this study was therefore to understand how human activities influence the ecological engineering activity of the giant root-rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus), a subterranean rodent species endemic to the Afroalpine ecosystem of the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. We collected data on human impact, burrowing activity and vegetation during February and March of 2021. Using path analysis, we tested (1) direct effects of human settlement on the patterns of livestock grazing intensity, (2) direct and indirect impacts of humans and livestock grazing intensity on the root-rat burrow density and (3) whether human settlement and livestock grazing influence the effects of giant root-rat burrow density on vegetation and vice versa. We found lower levels of livestock grazing intensity further from human settlement than in its proximity. We also found a significantly increased giant root-rat burrow density with increasing livestock grazing intensity. Seasonal settlement and livestock grazing intensity had an indirect negative and positive effect on giant root-rat burrow density, respectively, both via vegetation cover. Analysing the reciprocal effects of giant root-rat on vegetation, we found a significantly decreased vegetation cover with increasing density of giant root-rat burrows, and indirectly with increasing livestock grazing intensity via giant root-rat burrow density. Our results demonstrate that giant root-rats play a synanthropic engineering role that affects vegetation structure and ecosystem processes.

AB  - Badlands are peculiar geomorphological formations shaping landscapes of high ecological and cultural value. In the last decades, land reclamation for agricultural purposes and the cessation of traditional land use, such as sheep grazing, led to their decline in extent in many areas. To quantify the changes in badland-related plant communities, we resurveyed badland vegetation in a site of the Crete Senesi (Siena, central Italy) after 16 years (2006-2022), using 48 quasipermanent vegetation plots and by means of uni- and multivariate analysis of variance. We found an increase in the total vegetation cover of plant communities growing in former bare soil and sparsely vegetated areas, in line with an overall decrease in the extent of bare soil surfaces in the study area, which we highlighted through the analysis of multitemporal satellite images. Pioneer vegetation characterized by the endemic plant Artemisia caerulescens subsp. cretacea changed into ruderal annual grasslands, while former bare soils were colonized by such pioneer vegetation. In contrast, perennial grasslands remained stable. Grasslands with shrubs became more similar to perennial grasslands in species composition. Species richness increased in former bare soils, and using the total vegetation cover as a proxy for successional stages, we found that Shannon diversity and evenness peaked at about 90% of total cover. In all the stages of colonization, short distance dispersal species prevailed, both therophytes (Avena sterilis, Parapholis strigosa) and perennials (Artemisia caerulescens subsp. cretacea, Bromopsis erecta). Long distance dispersal species (Galatella linosyris) started colonizing at about 60% of total vegetation cover, and at high vegetation cover all the functional groups coexisted. Our results confirm that the badland landscapes of southern Tuscany and specialist plant diversity adapted to badlands are vanishing after a diminishing of active land management, suggesting the current ineffectiveness of the Natura 2000 network in their conservation.

AB  - Soil seed bank (SSB) determines essential ecological processes by maintaining species diversity and recovering damaged plant communities, and supports conservation of lost plant species. Nevertheless, the variation of SSBs, their densities, and composition changes when accompanied by wild boar disturbances are scarcely studied in sensitive habitats such as alpine grasslands. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of wild boar rooting on SSB characteristics. Five plant communities were selected and four disturbed patches in each community were recognized in alpine grassland, Albors Mountain Chain, Iran. SSB density, richness, diversity, evenness and similarity with aboveground vegetation were compared between disturbed and adjacent undisturbed patches. In total 80 soil cores in each community, 40 disturbed and 40 undisturbed were collected and transported to the greenhouse. The seedling emergence method was used to identify and quantify seeds from the germinable seed bank. The results showed that, totally, the SSB within disturbed patches was smaller than in undisturbed patches. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) rooting decreased SSB density, richness and diversity in all plant communities. We found that rooting homogenized SSBs in disturbed patches as indicated by the Pielou evenness index. The results suggested a deep alteration of the structure of seed banks by wild boar rooting, which in turn, vegetation recovery did not rely on SSBs after disturbances. In order to reduce wild boar rooting damage, a large reduction in wild boar abundance is suggested.

AB  - The area of semi-natural grasslands has decreased dramatically causing many grassland specialist species to persist in small habitat fragments. Furthermore, ecological communities once shaped by disturbances related to traditional agriculture now face the impacts of modern agriculture and urbanization. Many of the species have become endangered due to the combined effects of habitat destruction and degradation. We studied the responses of vascular plants and bryophytes to present and past connectivity in semi-natural grasslands, while accounting for the effects of local environmental conditions. We conducted vegetation surveys in 33 fragmented, unmanaged dry grasslands in Southwest Finland. A total of 191 vascular plant species and 60 bryophyte species were recorded. Higher vascular plant diversity was associated with higher historical connectivity, whereas bryophyte diversity declined with increasing current connectivity. Edaphic conditions, microclimate and disturbances were found to structure both vascular plant and bryophyte communities, but the responses to individual environmental variables were very different. The contrasting responses could be explained by the differences between the typical life-history strategies in vascular plants and bryophytes as well as resource competition between the two groups. These results highlight the need to consider different species groups when planning conservation measures. Vascular plant richness may best be conserved in connected grasslands whereas bryophyte richness in isolated ones. The results also indicated that trampling by humans could result in positive disturbance and to some extent help maintain richness of grassland specialist species.

AB  - Plant diversity affects multi-trophic communities, but in young regrowth forests, where forest insects are in the process of re-establishment, other biotic and also abiotic factors might be more important. We studied cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their natural enemies along an experimental tree diversity gradient in subtropical South-East China. We compared insect communities of experimental young forests with communities of established natural forests nearby the experiment and tested for direct and indirect effects of tree diversity, tree basal area (a proxy of tree biomass), canopy cover and microclimate on bee and wasp community composition, abundance and species richness. Finally, we tested if the trophic levels of bees, herbivore-hunting wasps, spider-hunting wasps and their natural enemies respond similarly. Forest bee and wasp community composition re-established towards communities of the natural forest with increasing tree biomass and canopy cover. These factors directly and indirectly, via microclimatic conditions, increased the abundance of bees, wasps and their natural enemies. While bee and wasp species richness increased with abundance and both were not related to tree diversity, abundance increased directly with canopy cover, mediated by tree biomass. Abundance of natural enemies increased with host (bee and wasp) abundance irrespective of their trophic position. In conclusion, although maximizing tree diversity is an important goal of reforestation and forest conservation, rapid closure of canopies is also important for re-establishing communities of forest bees, wasps and their natural enemies.

AB  - Due to their mutualistic partnership with trees, mycorrhizal fungi are often important components of soil microbial communities. Mortality of tree hosts can have dramatic effects on mycorrhizal populations, but how these shifts impact the remaining soil microbial community and ecosystem function remains poorly understood. Using a long-term oak girdling experiment at Black Rock Forest in New York, USA, we looked at changes in fungal community composition over 10 years following simulated large-scale oak mortality to understand the interactions between canopy tree composition, soil fungal diversity and forest function. We collected soil samples in treatment plots of 100% oak girdling (OG100), 50% oak girdling (OG50), non-oak girdling and a control without girdling. We sequenced the fungal community using the ITS1 forward and ITS2 reverse primers and classified the communities using the UNITE fungal reference and FUNguild databases. Fungal alpha diversity significantly increased by 32% and 17% in OG100 and OG50, respectively, compared to the control, largely driven by decreased ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) and increased saprophytic fungal abundance in OG100 and OG50. ECM showed a strong negative correlation with Archaeorhizomyetes (rho = -0.48) suggesting that these saprotrophic fungal taxa replaced ECM following the loss of oak trees. Girdling treatments, soil nitrogen, carbon: nitrogen ratios and soil pH explained over 20% of the soil fungal community variation. The removal of oaks led to a shift in the fungal community from ECM to more saprophytic fungi. Increases in soil pH with oak girdling, likely from tannic acid decreases from oak leaves, and the effect of pH on fungal diversity highlight the complex feedbacks and co-determined successional dynamics of the tree and fungal communities. Synthesis. The removal of a dominant plant species, such as oaks in the northeastern US, can have cascading effects on the soil microbial community composition. Changes in the fungi community following disturbance can have significant impacts on ecosystem functions and properties such as decomposition, soil respiration, biodiversity and nutrient cycling. Together, this work improves our understanding of these forests' vulnerability to pathogen pressure and the impact these disturbances have not just on the focal species but on the whole ecosystem.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Grazing, as the main land use of grasslands, is a key factor affecting the supply of ecosystem services1 (ESs) as well as the relationships between ESs. Using four grazing intensities, including control check, light grazing, moderate grazing, and heavy grazing, this paper quantified eight key ESs, including biodiversity, herbage intake, herbage quality (herbage crude protein content), climate regulation (soil organic carbon density), soil mineralization nitrogen, soil conservation (aboveground biomass), wind prevention and sand fixation (belowground biomass), and soil erosion prevention(litter biomass), in typical grassland areas of Inner Mongolia. Structural equation models were used to illustrate the impact of grazing on ESs through biodiversity, and the root mean square error was used to quantify the level of trade-offs for ES pairs. The results of this study indicated that grazing intensity (GI) significantly affected all ESs (p < 0.05), except for soil organic carbon density and soil mineralization nitrogen. As GI increased, provisioning services increased, while most regulating services decreased, and there was a general trade-off relationship between regulating services and other ones. In order to realize the maximum ESs benefit and the minimum trade-offs for ES pairs, the optimal grazing intensity for typical grasslands of Inner Mongolia should be between 170 (standard sheep units) SSU . d . hm(-2) . y(-1) and 340 SSU . d . hm(-2) . y(-1). The results of this study provide a decision-making foundation for grassland grazing management policies for the sustainable development of Inner Mongolian grasslands. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Iberian wild goats (Capra pyrenaica, also known as Iberian ibex, Spanish ibex, and Spanish wild goat) underwent strong genetic bottlenecks during the 19(th) and 20(th) centuries due to overhunting and habitat destruction. From the 1970s to 1990s, augmentation translocations were frequently carried out to restock Iberian wild goat populations (very often with hunting purposes), but they were not systematically planned or recorded. On the other hand, recent data suggest the occurrence of hybridization events between Iberian wild goats and domestic goats (Capra hircus). Augmentation translocations and interspecific hybridization might have contributed to increase the diversity of Iberian wild goats. With the aim of investigating this issue, we have genotyped 118 Iberian wild goats from Tortosa-Beceite, Sierra Nevada, Muela de Cortes, Gredos, Batuecas, and Ordesa and Monte Perdido by using the Goat SNP50 BeadChip (Illumina). The analysis of genotypic data indicated that Iberian wild goat populations are strongly differentiated and display low diversity. Only three Iberian wild goats out from 118 show genomic signatures of mixed ancestry, a result consistent with a scenario in which past augmentation translocations have had a limited impact on the diversity of Iberian wild goats. Besides, we have detected eight Iberian wild goats from Tortosa-Beceite with signs of domestic goat introgression. Although rare, hybridization with domestic goats could become a potential threat to the genetic integrity of Iberian wild goats; hence, measures should be taken to avoid the presence of uncontrolled herds of domestic or feral goats in mountainous areas inhabited by this iconic wild ungulate.

AB  - In order to establish the influence of grazing regime on soil fauna communities, a complex study was conducted on eight mountain grasslands in Romania. The grassland sites were grouped by management regime: ungrazed or intensely grazed by sheep. Eight environmental factors were measured, both abiotic (soil acidity, soil resistance at penetration, soil and air humidity, soil and air temperature, and soil electrical conductivity) and biotic (vegetation coverage). There was significant variability in the average values of these factors at the microhabitat level (between all grasslands investigated). Analysis of eighty soil samples allowed for the identification of sixteen soil fauna taxa, which constituted the database for statistical processing. The community status of these soil invertebrate faunas was mainly evaluated using three parameters: numerical abundance, taxa richness, and Shannon-Wiener index of diversity. Collembola and Oribatida were the most dominant taxa. The numerical abundance and taxa diversity recorded high values in ungrazed grasslands. Soil resistance at penetration, vegetation coverage, and soil pH influenced the numerical abundance of soil fauna communities significantly. Grassland management influenced the composition of soil invertebrates in both regimes, with Chilopoda, Staphylinidae, Diplopoda, and Enchytraeidae clearly preferring ungrazed ecosystems, whilst Mesostigmata was much commoner in grazed sites. The study revealed that correlations between the species composition of soil communities and environmental parameters under differing management regimes (ungrazed vs. grazed), demonstrated that these invertebrates can be used as bioindicators in such terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Herbivore grazing is an important determinant of plant community assemblages. Thus, it is essential to understand its impact to direct conservation efforts in regions where herbivores are managed. While the impacts of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) grazing on plant biodiversity and community composition in the Fennoscandian tundra are well studied, the impact of reindeer grazing on phylogenetic community structure is not. We used data from a multiyear quasi-experimental study in northern Fennoscandia to analyze the effect of reindeer grazing on plant community diversity including its phylogenetic structure. Our study design used a permanent fence constructed in the 1960s and temporary fences constructed along the permanent fence to expose plant communities to three different grazing regimes: light (almost never grazed), pulse (grazed every other year), and press (chronic grazing for over 40 years). Similar to previous studies on low productivity ecosystems in this region, the species richness and evenness of plant communities with pulse and press grazing did not differ from communities with light grazing. Also consistent with previous studies in this region, we observed a transition from shrub-dominated communities with light grazing to graminoid-dominated communities with pulse and press grazing. Interestingly, communities with pulse, but not press, grazing were more phylogenetically dispersed than communities with light grazing. If grazing pulses can increase the phylogenetic diversity of plant communities, our result suggests changes in reindeer management allowing for pulses of grazing to increase phylogenetic diversity of plant communities.

AB  - Small mammals are ubiquitous members of vertebrate communities that are sensitive to habitat change. In the Great Lakes region of North America, small mammal communities have changed rapidly, but experimental tests of potential mechanisms are lacking. Using a before-alter, control-treatment design, we quantified the response of small mammals to single-tree selection harvest in Laurentian hardwood forests of Wisconsin, United States. We documented changes in forest structure and small mammal abundance, species diversity, and community similarity from silvicultural treatment. Treatment reduced tree density and canopy cover and increased mean tree diameter, woody stern density, variation in woody stem density, and volume of coarse woody debris. Peromyscus and northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda) were dominant community members across treatments and years. White-footed mice (P. leucopus) outnumbered woodland deer mice (P. maniculatus gracilis) before treatment, but declined by almost fifty percent after treatment; deer mice and total rodent (i.e., Rodentia) abundances were unchanged. Small mammal species diversity increased twofold following treatment. Our experiment identified species-specific responses within Peromyscus to timber harvest: white-footed mice, the numerically dominant and generalist species, were most sensitive to habitat change, and their response produced cascading effects to small mammal community .structure. Future experiments should assess these small mammal responses in a multi-year framework and quantify their effects on the broader vertebrate community.

AB  - Understanding soil organic matter dynamics is essential for evaluation of the carbon (C) sequestration potential of soils, a critical factor in mitigating climate change. However, the dynamics of soil C processes under the canopy of extrafloral nectary (EFN) trees that are widely distributed in subtropical forests remain poorly explored, particularly in the context of declining tree diversity. In this study, we investigated EFN tree effects on the soil C and nitrogen (N) fractions in forest communities characterized by five levels of tree species richness (TSR, i.e. one-, two-, four-, eight- and 16-tree species). Emphasis was placed on the roles of the phyllosphere and soil functional fungal guilds associated with the target and neighbouring trees. The results revealed that the proportion of EFN trees negatively affected the C content of particulate organic matter (POM), the C/N ratios of the POM and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM), as well as the POM-to-MAOM ratio. The peak soil C/N ratios across all fractions, as well as the POM-to-MAOM ratio, shifted from four-tree species to eight-tree species under the canopy of EFN trees and their neighbouring non-EFN trees. The POM C/N ratio was directly associated with the alpha diversity of soil functional fungi and indirectly associated with the alpha diversity of functional fungi colonizing damaged leaves. In addition, the C/N ratios of the POM and MAOM, and the POM-to-MAOM ratio were potentially mediated by the complexity, stability and potential keystone taxa of fungal co-occurrence networks colonizing leaves and in the soil. The changes in microbial communities are likely driven by the interaction between EFN trees and herbivorous insects. Synthesis. These findings demonstrate a positive response of soil C sequestration under extrafloral nectary (EFN) tree canopies. By highlighting the significance of EFN tree-phyllosphere/soil fungi associations and their role in shaping the effect of tree species diversity, this study contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which above-ground-below-ground synergies govern soil C sequestration in a subtropical forest.

AB  - Recently classified as a unique species by the IUCN, African forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are critically endangered due to severe poaching. With limited knowledge about their ecological role due to the dense tropical forests they inhabit in central Africa, it is unclear how the Afrotropics are influenced by elephants. Although their role as seed dispersers is well known, they may also drive large-scale processes that determine forest structure through the creation of elephant trails and browsing the understory, allowing larger, carbon-dense trees to succeed. Multiple scales of lidar were collected by NASA in Lop & eacute; National Park, Gabon from 2015 to 2022. Utilizing two airborne lidar datasets in an African forest elephant stronghold, detailed canopy structural information was used in conjunction with elephant trail data to determine how forest structure varies on and off trails. Forest along elephant trails displayed different structural characteristics than forested areas off trails, with lower canopy height, canopy cover, and different vertical distribution of plant density. Less plant area density was found on trails at 1 m in height, while more vegetation was found at 12 m, compared to off trail locations. Trails in forest areas with previous logging history had lower plant area in the top of the canopy. Forest elephants can be considered as "logging light" ecosystem engineers, affecting canopy structure through browsing and movement. Both airborne lidar scales were able to capture elephant impact along trails, with the high-resolution discrete return lidar performing higher than waveform lidar.
   Using two scales of airborne lidar, we determined variation in canopy structure from African forest elephant trails. Elephant trails in Lope National Park, Gabon, displayed lower canopy height, canopy cover, and different vertical distribution of plant mass. As a critically endangered species, these findings point to forest elephants' importance as ecosystem engineers in the African tropics. image

AB  - Shrubs commonly shape the plant community in arid ecosystems such as deserts. Plant interactions between shrubs and the associated species can be both negative and positive, and direct and indirect. The importance of shrub effects on reproduction is also a key component of facilitation studies in deserts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that shrubs facilitate understory plant community composition and reproduction through both direct and indirect interactions mediated by the associated plant neighbourhood. Using the shrub species Larrea tri-dentata, we tested the effects of facilitation on understory plant density, floral density, and species richness in the Mojave Desert, California. We found that shrubs decreased the net community-wide plant assembly measures relative to open microsites including total density and species richness at the site tested. There was also evidence that shrubs directly decreased plant fitness by reducing floral density, but this effect depended on the species. The net density and diversity of the annual plant community also influenced plant and floral density under shrubs suggesting significant indirect effects between shrubs and all abundant annual plant species. While both direct and indirect interactions between shrubs and the annual plant community were species-specific, the effects of these interactions had greater impact on plant density than floral density measures. Annual plant density and to a lesser extent floral density are thus driven by both direct and indirect interactions with shrubs.

AB  - Browsing of wild ungulates can have profound effects on the structure and composition of forests. In the Swiss National Park, the density of wild ungulates including red deer (Cervus elaphus), ibex (Capra ibex), and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) is exceptionally high due to strict protection and the absence of large predators. We examined count data of larch (Larix decidua), cembra pine (Pinus cembra), spruce (Picea abies), upright mountain pine (Pinus mugo subsp. uncinata), and mountain ash (Sorbus aucuparia) of four sampling years between 1991 and 2021 and modelled how different topographic and location factors affected the probability of browsing on saplings of larch, cembra pine, and spruce. Despite the high density of wild ungulates, the numbers of saplings and young trees increased over the past 30 years. The probability of browsing on saplings was highest for larch at a height of 10 - 40 cm and increased with increasing elevation. In our study area, open grasslands are mainly located above the tree line, which might explain the positive correlation between elevation and the probability of browsing. Other factors like exposition and slope, available food resources and disturbance by humans did not have clear effects on the probability of browsing.

AB  - Questions: What is the role of native and domestic herbivores in native-alien vegetation changes in sub-Antarctic forests? Does herbivory suppression increase native while reducing alien species diversity?Location: Central-eastern Tierra del Fuego Island, Argentina.Methods: In four sites, we set up three different treatments: excluded grazing by livestock (cattle), by livestock and native (guanaco) herbivores, and grazed control plots in Nothofagus antarctica forests. We then monitored the dynamics of understorey native and alien plants (species richness, abundance) of dicots, monocots, and ferns over 6 years. Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to determine the effects of herbivore exclusion and time on species richness and abundance. In addition, we calculated the abundance rate of change to quantify temporal dynamics.Results: Overall species richness did not change in the exclusion plots, but native and alien abundances were affected by herbivory and time since exclusion. The abundance of native monocots changed after herbivore exclusion, increasing its dominance significantly inside exclusion plots. However, the cessation of herbivory did not reduce alien species in general. Only alien dicots significantly declined in the livestock exclusion treatment. Further, we found that the two dominant alien grass species (Holcus lanatus and Poa pratensis) respond differently to grazing exclusion, and their response was modulated by forest basal area.Conclusions: Our results indicate that cattle and guanaco grazing had variable effects on native and alien plants, and that herbivore exclusion has a substantially positive effect on native grasses. However, the magnitude of temporal changes was more significant for vegetation richness and abundance than the effect of exclusion treatments. Herbivore exclusions can initiate a rapid recovery of compositional attributes of native vegetation in N. antarctica forests grazed by livestock.

AB  - Competition for resources underlies the development of ecological community structure and function. Niche compression occurs when species reduce resource use due to competition, and niche complementarity posits resource competition should occur sequentially among habitat, time, and food. Within this context, interspecific predator competition can be influenced by prey characteristics and landscape attributes. We examined drivers of interspecific competition among carnivores using a database of North American ungulate cause-specific mortality published during 1970-2021. We used weighted logit-linked beta-binomial generalized linear mixed models to assess the influence of seven predator species, ungulate age class, and landscape characteristics (i.e., human footprint, terrain ruggedness, and forest cover) on ungulate predation mortality. We predicted that (1) predation by individual predator species would decrease with increasing predator species richness mediated by predator size, (2) landscape characteristics would mediate predation by individual predator species, and (3) juvenile ungulate predation would increase with increasing predator species richness. As predator species richness increased, the proportions of predation attributed to individual predator species decreased, but the overall proportion of ungulate mortality attributed to predation increased. Juvenile ungulates experienced greater predation mortality than adults, with smaller predators predating proportionally more juveniles than larger predators. Landscape metrics altered observed predation patterns among caribou (Rangifer tarandus), wherein predation corresponded to terrain ruggedness but not predator species richness, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), wherein predation increased with greater forest cover. We provide evidence for niche compression and complementarity using a top-down predator-centric approach by showing compression in prey resources and increased predation mortality with increasing predator species richness. However, landscape characteristics had limited effects on predator competition at large spatial extents, which counters niche complementarity. Collectively, our results support the importance of large predators to ecosystem structure and efforts to conserve and restore predator guilds.

AB  - The majority of the world's mammal biomass is domestic livestock. Intensive livestock grazing can negatively impact some elements of biodiversity. We quantified the effects of grazing management on bird occupancy over a 10-year period in patches of Australian endangered temperate woodland within paddocks subjected to one of three grazing regimes: continuous set stocking, rotational, and total livestock exclusion. Grazing may affect birds through altering resource availability, influencing vegetation structure, or affecting the occurrence of noisy miners (Manorina melanocephala), a native honeyeater that engages in interference competition with other birds. Using Bayesian generalized linear mixed models and multispecies occupancy modelling, we quantified relative and interactive effects on bird biodiversity of grazing, vegetation structure, and noisy miner occupancy. We found only muted grazing regime effects on woodland birds. However, many species responded to vegetation structure. Small invertivorous woodland birds responded positively to sapling abundance, and some (larger) species responded positively to the abundance of trees >50 cm. Furthermore, species richness increased with increased sapling abundance and trees >50 cm. The largest effects were associated with noisy miner occurrence, which drove reductions in small-bodied, invertivorous birds, effectively "swamping" the positive effects of vegetation attributes on these species.The profound impacts of noisy miners present challenges for bird conservation in woodland ecosystems, especially those subject to grazing. Management to reduce grazing pressure by domestic livestock may eventually help limit the impacts of the noisy miner, in part by facilitating natural regeneration of temperate woodlands to which small-bodied woodland birds respond positively.

AB  - Despite the large body of theory concerning multiple disturbances, relatively few attempts have been made to test the theoretical assumptions of how and if disturbances interact. Of particular importance is whether disturbance events are linked, as this can influence the probability and intensity of ecological change. Disturbances are linked when one disturbance event increases or decreases the likelihood or extent of another. To this end, we used two long-term, multi-disturbance experiments in northern Wisconsin to determine whether earthworm invasion is linked to canopy gap creation and white-tailed deer browsing. These three disturbances are common and influential within North American temperate forests, making any interactions among them particularly important to understand. We expected both deer and canopy gaps to favor invasive earthworms, particularly species that live close to or on the soil surface. However, we found only partial support of our hypotheses, as both deer exclosures and canopy gaps decreased earthworms in each experiment. Further, earthworm density increased the most over time in areas far from the gap center and in areas with deer present. Deer exclosures primarily decreased Aporrectodea and Lumbricus species, while gaps decreased Dendrobaena and Lumbricus species. Our findings show that earthworm invasion is linked to deer presence and gap-creating disturbances, which provides new insight in multiple disturbance theory, aboveground-belowground dynamics, and temperate forest management.

AB  - In grassland ecosystems, the occurrence and transmission of foliar fungal diseases are largely dependent on grazing by large herbivores. However, whether herbivores that have different body sizes differentially impact foliar fungal diseases remains largely unexplored. Thus, we conducted an 8-year grazing experiment in an alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China and tested how different types of livestock (sheep (Ovis aries), yak (Bos grunniens), or both)) affected foliar fungal diseases at the levels of both plant population and community. At the population level, grazing by a single species (yak or sheep) or mixed species (sheep and yak) significantly decreased the severity of eight leaf spot diseases. Similarly, at the community level, both single species (yak or sheep) and mixed grazing by both sheep and yak significantly decreased the community pathogen load. However, we did not find a significant difference in the community pathogen load among different types of livestock. These results suggest that grazing by large herbivores, independently of livestock type, consistently decreased the prevalence of foliar fungal diseases at both the plant population and community levels. We suggest that moderate grazing by sheep or yak is effective to control the occurrence of foliar fungal diseases in alpine grasslands. This study advances our knowledge of the interface between disease ecology, large herbivores, and grassland science.

AB  - Large, trees have survived for a long time, and their complex crown structure can serve as habitat for epiphytic plants. Canopy plants are not as well studied in the temperate zones as in the tropics, because many of them are accidental epiphytes, epiphytic individuals of normally terrestrial species. We hypothesized that the canopy can serve as a refuge for terrestrial species that have difficulty establishing on the ground (e.g., insufficient light, deer over-browsing), promoting and conserving forest species diversity. Terrestrial species may also vary in their ability to adapt to a wide range of canopy growth conditions. Here, we investigated canopy vascular plants hosted on a large Cercidiphyllum japonicum tree in a temperate old-growth forest, Japan. The canopy plant community was diverse comprising 39 vascular plant species (6 of which were threatened species), including 31 accidental epiphytes and 8 obligate epiphytes. We found at least 14 species could escape deer over-browsing by establishing in the canopy. Most accidental epiphytes were found on multiple and large reiterated trunks bifurcated from the main trunk as well as on large horizontal branches. Leaves of canopy plants had higher nitrogen concentration compared to those of plants on the ground, and higher water-use efficiency with increasing height was achieved by controlling transpirational water loss. Our results show one large tree crown can be defined as a local hotspot for current and future plant species diversity in a temperate old-growth forest, reinforcing its ecological value for conservation purposes.

AB  - Experimental studies across biomes demonstrate that herbivores can have significant effects on ecosystem functioning. Herbivore effects, however, can be highly variable with studies demonstrating positive, neutral or negative relationships between herbivore presence and different components of ecosystems. Mixed effects are especially likely in the soil, where herbivore effects are largely indirect mediated through effects on plants. We conducted a long-term experiment to disentangle the effects of non-native moose in boreal forests on plant communities, nutrient cycling, soil composition and soil organism communities. To explore the effect of moose on soils, we conduct separate analyses on the soil organic and mineral horizons. Our data come from 11 paired exclosure-control plots in eastern and central Newfoundland, Canada that provide insight into 22-25 years of moose herbivory. We fit piecewise structural equations models (SEM) to data for the organic and mineral soil horizons to test different pathways linking moose to above-ground and below-ground functioning. The SEMs revealed that moose exclusion had direct positive impacts on adult tree count and an indirect negative impact on shrub percent cover mediated by adult tree count. We detected no significant impact of moose on soil microbial C:N ratio or net nitrogen mineralization in the organic or mineral soil horizon. Soil temperature and moisture, however, was more than twice as variable in the presence (i.e. control) than absence (i.e. exclosure) of moose. Overall, we observed clear impacts of moose on above-ground forest components with limited indirect effects below-ground. Even after 22-25 years of exclusion, we did not find any evidence of moose impacts on soil microbial C:N ratio and net nitrogen mineralization. Our long-term study and mechanistic path analysis demonstrates that soils can be resilient to ungulate herbivore effects despite evidence of strong effects above-ground. Long-term studies and analyses such as this one are relatively rare yet critical for reconciling some of the context-dependency observed across studies of ungulates effects on ecosystem functions. Such studies may be particularly valuable in ecosystems with short growing seasons such as the boreal forest.1.2.3.4.5.

AB  - Barandabhar Corridor Forest (BCF), the biologically functional corridor, is surrounded by the large human settlements that exploit the corridor where large mammals such as tigers, leopards and their prey such as ungulates, primates, and rhinoceros occur. This study aimed to evaluate major determinants that affect the distribution of large mammals in BCF, Chitwan, Nepal that connects the biologically significant Chitwan National Park with the Mahabharat range. The status and distribution of large mammals along the habitat and disturbance gradients were determined by using 29 line transects (mean length = 4.59 +/- 0.38 km) that covered a linear distance of 133.13 km. The chital were the most abundant mammals (density per km(2) (D) = 8.9095 +/- 1.4570 and encounter rate per km (ER) = 1.49) followed by rhesus monkey (D = 38.896 +/- 16.013, ER = 0.28), wild boar (D = 14.814 +/- 3.57, ER = 0.62), northern red muntjac (D = 9.6566 +/- 2.9514, ER = 0.62) and sambar (D = 5.392 +/- 2.319, ER = 0.38). Similarly, the sign encounter rate of tiger and leopard was 0.435 and 0.503 respectively. Habitat types, human disturbances, and coverage of invasive and alien plant species (IAPs) played a key role in the distribution of large mammals. The occurrence of mammals was low nearer to the settlements and roads and coverage of IAPs and more nearer to the water resources. However, degradation of foraging grounds such as grasslands by succession and invasion of alien plant species added more threats to the survival of large mammals. Therefore, such a situation can be improved through the scientific management of forests and grasslands.

AB  - The survival of reindeer during winter, their period of greatest food stress, depends largely on the abundance and accessibility of forage in their pastures. In Northern Sweden, realized availability of forage is notably affected by snow conditions and the impacts of forestry. While these factors have been examined in isolation, their combined effect has, to the best of our knowledge to date, not been researched. In this study, vegetation surveys and analysis of snow conditions were undertaken in forest stands at various stages of recovery from clear-cutting. The variation in abundance and growth of understory species edible by reindeer, such as lichen, was noted as forests matured. The barrier effect of ice lenses in the snow was also measured in these stands. Lichen biomass was significantly affected by a combination of stand maturity, understory vegetation height, and lichen height. Soil disturbance from the processes of felling and competition in the vegetation communities recovering from this disturbance were identified as key drivers of change in lichen biomass. Overall, clear-cut forests had some of the greatest prevalence of ice lenses in the snow column, and forage availability at these sites was up to 61% less than in mature stands over 58 years in age. It is suggested that alternative silviculture methods are investigated for use in this reindeer herding region, as frequent clear-cutting and consequent reduction in the average forest stand age and maturity class may be detrimental to reindeer grazing, reducing both abundance of forage, and access to it during winter.

AB  - Structural diversity is an emerging dimension of biodiversity that accounts for size variations in organs among individuals in a community. Previous studies show significant effects of structural diversity on forest growth, but its effects on forest mortality are not known, particularly at a large scale. To address this knowledge gap, we quantified structural diversity using stem structural diversity (SSD) based on both tree diameter and height. We obtained U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data from over 2400 plots across southcentral U.S. forests that have suffered a recent drought. Using data from multiple sampling times, we calculated SSD and compared the relative importance of SSD, species diversity, functional diversity and other stand attributes in determining tree mortalities caused by fire, insects and diseases. We also used FIRETEC, a physics-based fire model, to test the effect of SSD on canopy consumption by fire. Our results showed that (1) SSD was positively associated with tree mortalities caused by all three disturbances; (2) species richness was negatively associated with insect- and disease-caused mortalities; (3) functional diversity was negatively associated with fire- and disease-caused mortalities and (4) more phylogenetically related species had more similar mortality rates by insect and disease but not fire. Moreover, the FIRETEC model showed increasing canopy consumption by fire in stands with greater SSD. Together, the different tree mortalities during drought associated with SSD more consistently than the other biodiversity metrics were evaluated. Synthesis. Our results suggest that SSD could be considered in modelling forest dynamics and planning management to sustain forest health under disturbances.

AB  - Invasion and expansion of non-native and native plants have altered vegetation structure in many terrestrial ecosystems. Small mammals influence multiple ecosystem processes through their roles as ecosystem engineers, predators, and prey, and changes to vegetation structure can affect habitat use, community composition, and predator-prey interactions for this assemblage of wildlife. In the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) shrublands of the western United States, invasion by non-native grasses and expansion of native conifer trees beyond their historical range has altered vegetation structure. These changes may potentially affect distributions and interactions of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), which are generalist omnivores, and Columbia Plateau pocket mice (Perognathus parvus), more specialized granivores. To assess the extent to which altered habitat affects small-mammal density, survival, and home-range size, we examined these aspects of small-mammal ecology along a gradient of cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) invasion and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) establishment in sagebrush shrublands in southwestern Idaho, USA. From 2017-2019, we used a spatially explicit mark-recapture design to examine attributes of small-mammal ecology along an invasion gradient. We did not find support for an effect of cheatgrass cover on density or survival of either species. Home-range size of deer mice was 2.3 times smaller in heavier cheatgrass cover (60%) compared to areas with little or no cheatgrass cover. Density of deer mice was highest (5 individuals/ha) in areas with 10% juniper cover and decreased with increasing juniper cover, whereas density of pocket mice was positively influenced by shrub cover. Survival of deer mice declined as juniper stem density increased. Conversely, survival of pocket mice increased with increasing juniper stem density. We found evidence for interspecific interactions between these 2 species, in the form of a density-dependent effect of deer mice on pocket mouse home-range size. Home-range size for pocket mice was 2 times smaller in areas with the highest estimated density of deer mice compared to areas with low densities of deer mice. Our data provides unique information about how small mammals in the sagebrush steppe are affected by expanding and invasive plant species and potential ways that habitat restoration efforts, in the form of conifer removal, may influence small mammals. Understanding the response of small mammals to conifer expansion or removal may shed light on the demographic and numerical responses of other wildlife associated with the sagebrush biome, including predators.

AB  - Invasive deer have undesirable impacts on native ecosystems. Culling is commonly used to reduce those impacts, but is expensive and sometimes controversial. It is therefore important to robustly assess how culling reduces the impacts of invasive deer.We conducted a Before-After Control-Impact (BACI) experiment to determine how culling affects the impacts of invasive sambar deer Cervus unicolor in an endangered alpine peatland ecosystem in south-eastern Australia. We established two blocks, each with four 4300-ha experimental units, in which two units were randomly assigned to a treatment of deer culling and the other two were non-treatment areas. Sambar deer relative abundance (faecal pellet count) and three impacts (ground degradation, pugging intensity and water turbidity) in three peatland features (peatlands, natural pools and sambar deer wallows) were surveyed before and after culling was implemented. We used four metrics to quantify the culling intensity in each treatment unit: treatment versus non-treatment, number of deer culled on each unit, deer culled within a 500-m buffer of impact monitoring sites and local probability of use by the cullers (1-ha grid). The effects of culling on deer abundance and impacts were estimated using Bayesian generalised linear mixed models.Our analysis revealed that the effect of culling differed between the two experimental blocks. In one block, culling reduced deer abundance and three impacts. In the other block, culling did not reduce deer abundance but reduced three impacts and increased two impacts. The effects of culling were generally stronger when culling was estimated using finer-scale (500-m) than coarser-scale (experimental unit) culling metrics.Synthesis and applications. Our study provides experimental evidence that culling invasive sambar deer reduces some of their undesirable impacts on endangered peatlands. That not all impacts were reduced by culling suggests that some effects of invasive species are slow to recover or require higher culling intensities to be reversed.

AB  - Interactions between species influence ecosystem functions and are sensitive to reintroductions. Our understanding of interactions between naturally co-occurring large herbivores, such as Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) that are now re-establishing throughout their range, and well-established native ungulates, is limited, despite the potential implications for riparian woodlands. Observations in Scotland indicate that roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) readily exploit the regenerative secondary shoots produced after tree felling by beaver. Our study, based in eastern Scotland, investigates the role of beaver herbivory in riparian woodland regeneration and asks whether deer are attracted to this novel resource because it is either a) more readily available, b) nutritionally superior, or c) morphologically more appealing than accessible browse on unfelled (standing) trees. We firstly quantified the secondary shoots available to browsing deer at different heights on felled and standing birch (Betula spp.) trees in twenty riparian woodland plots across five well-established beaver territories (occupancy ten years). Shoots from birch and willow (Salix spp.) trees with contrasting levels and combinations of beaver and deer browsing were then analysed for nutritional content (nitrogen and carbon) and morphological characteristics (number of buds and lateral branches). We found that 62% of beaver-felled trees produced secondary shoots available to browsing deer. Compared to standing trees, regenerating beaver-felled trees had 18% more secondary shoots. These shoots were significantly higher in nitrogen content (+13%), but similar in carbon content and concentrated closer to the ground. Our results show that beaver herbivory can promote riparian woodland regeneration and heterogeneity by creating a mosaic of mature and multi-stemmed coppiced trees. The addition of a common, readily available, and nutritious resource through beaver browsing could, however, also enhance habitat quality for browsing deer, with the potential to affect deer distribution and feeding habits.

AB  - Savannas are characterized by water scarcity and degradation, making them highly vulnerable to increased uncertainties in water availability resulting from climate change. This poses a significant threat to ecosystem services and rural livelihoods that depend on them. In addition, the lack of consensus among climate models on precipitation change makes it difficult for land managers to plan for the future. Therefore, Savanna rangeland management needs to develop strategies that can sustain Savanna resilience and avoid tipping points under an uncertain future climate. Our study aims to analyse the impacts of climate change and rangeland management on degradation in Savanna ecosystems of southern Africa, providing insights for the management of semi-arid Savannas under uncertain conditions worldwide. To achieve this, we simulated the effects of projected changes in temperature and precipitation, as predicted by 10 global climate models, on water resources and vegetation (cover, functional diversity, tipping points (transition from grass-dominated to shrub-dominated vegetation)). We simulated three different rangeland management options (herbivore communities dominated by grazers, by browser and by mixed feeders), each with low and high animal densities, using the ecohydrological model EcoHyD. Our results identified intensive grazing as the primary contributor to the increased risk of degradation in response to changing climatic conditions across all climate change scenarios. This degradation encompassed a reduction in available water for plant growth within the context of predicted climate change. It also entails a decline in the overall vegetation cover, the loss of functionally important plant species and the inefficient utilization of available water resources, leading to earlier tipping points. Synthesis and applications. Our findings underscore that, in the face of climate uncertainty, farmers' most effective strategy for securing their livelihoods and ecosystem stability is to integrate browsers and apply management of mixed herbivore communities. This management approach not only significantly delays or averts tipping points but also maintained greater plant functional diversity, fostering a more robust and resilient ecosystem that acts as a vital buffer against adverse climatic conditions.

AB  - 1. The dung seed bank (i.e. vegetation renewal) and greenhouse gas (GHG, e.g. carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), which contributing to global warming) emissions (i.e. materials circulation) are two of the most important ecological functions of livestock dung in grassland ecosystems. With decomposition of faeces, dung seedling density (e.g. increase) and GHG emission (e.g. decrease) changes proceeded simultaneously. Although these two processes have so far been studied in isolation, almost no studies have explored the effects of dung seedlings on GHG emissions.
   2. We collected the dung of three livestock species-yak, sheep and horse-during late April (i.e. early warm season) in an alpine meadow in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The livestock dung seedling composition and GHG fluxes were determined on Days 1, 6, 11, 16, 21, 26, 31, 37, 53 and 60 of germination, and we used frozen and ground faeces as the control group.
   3. The average seedling density of horse dung was significantly greater than that of yak and sheep. The GHG fluxes in the collected native dung samples were significantly greater than those of the dung controls, and the fluctuations in CO2, CH4 and N2O all showed a pattern of yak dung > horse dung > sheep dung. Over the course of the experiment, the GHG fluxes of both the experimental and control groups gradually decreased; however, the GHG emissions of the experimental group declined faster than those of the control group.
   4. There was a significant negative correlation between dung seedling density and GHG fluxes. Dung seedlings provide a reference for estimation of GHG emissions from livestock faeces.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our research has revealed the features of and interactions between two important ecological functions of livestock dung in the grazing system. Furthermore, dung seedlings could substantially affect GHG fluxes and emission rates of livestock dung patches. The contributions of dung seeds to GHG emissions should be considered when estimating global warming potential from grazing livestock on the QTP for the purposes of determining national and regional land use policies and compiling global GHG inventories.

AB  - Rich fossil deposits of the late Quaternary help us understand responses of biodiversity to global change and thus predict the future of ecosystems. Studies from the late Quaternary, however, are often limited taxonomically, geographically (often one site), and by their use of largely taxon-based metrics that do not inform about ecosystem-level consequences of biodiversity change. Here, we compare change in functional composition of small mammal communities at El Miron Cave (Spain) and Samwell Cave (California, USA) across the last 22 000 years, and examine their relationships with climate and vegetation. We find opposing temporal trends between the two locations. European small mammal communities occupied increasingly greater trait space, driven by increases in arboreal granivory and frugivory as ground-dwelling herbivory declined toward the late Holocene. North American communities occupied smaller trait space as ground-level foraging and insectivory increased and arboreal herbivory and mean body mass declined. Our results point to the importance of the interaction between climate change and vegetation shifts for explaining changes in small mammal functional diversity, through their synergistic impacts on individual traits. Specifically, increasing temperature across both continents likely led to increases in nocturnal activity and declines in assemblage mean body mass, while transition to mixed forest (El Miron) or open woodland (Samwell) resulted in increasing structural complexity of vegetation that potentially supported more diverse community-level dietary characteristics. These results demonstrate the ability of a trait-based approach to identify how environmental variables correlate with changes in community functional composition through time and gain insight into the potential consequences of environmental change for ecosystem functioning.

AB  - With the imminent danger of global climate change threatening the Earth?s biodiversity, the camel proved to be a unique animal with physiological features. These attributes of the camel instigate us to explore its genetic architecture. Pakistan boasts a camel population of about 20 different breeds and a total of one million head. However, till date, scarce genetic data is available on Pakistani camel?s genomics. In efforts to explore the genetics of the camel, we chose to study the Inteferon beta 1 (IFNI31) gene in in Mareecha camel and non-descript camel breeds in Pakistan. We amplified the IFNI31 gene through PCR, followed by sequencing. All sequences were aligned and edited through Codon Code aligner and finally a 364 bp portion was selected for further analysis. Dual peaks/heterozygous conditions were identified at positions c.36 (A/C), c.87 and c.225 (Y, T/C). The phylogenetic tree was constructed through MEGA 6.1 software package using the Neighbor Joining method with a bootstrap value of 1000. Finally, the dromedary camel sequences from Pakistan were compared with corresponding genetic sequences of other animal species available on NCBI including European bison, Indian bison, Tibetan antelope, wild yak, domestic goat, sheep, water buffalo and cattle for biological positioning of dromedary camel. The results reconfirmed the classical biological classification.

AB  - In the midst of an ongoing biodiversity crisis, much research has focused on species losses and their impacts on ecosystem functioning. The functional consequences (ecosystem response) of shifts in communities are shaped not only by changes in species richness, but also by compositional shifts that result from species losses and gains. Species differ in their contribution to ecosystem functioning, so species identity underlies the consequences of species losses and gains on ecosystem functions. Such research is critical to better predict the impact of disturbances on communities and ecosystems. We used the "Community Assembly and the Functioning of Ecosystems" (CAFE) approach, a modification of the Price equation to understand the functional consequences and relative effects of richness and composition changes in small nonvolant mammal and dung beetle communities as a result of two common disturbances in North American prairie restorations, prescribed fire and the reintroduction of large grazing mammals. Previous research in this system has shown dung beetles are critically important decomposers, while small mammals modulate much energy in prairie food webs. We found that dung beetle communities were more responsive to bison reintroduction and prescribed fires than small nonvolant mammals. Dung beetle richness increased after bison reintroduction, with higher dung beetle community biomass resulting from changes in remaining species (context-dependent component) rather than species turnover (richness components); prescribed fire caused a minor increase in dung beetle biomass for the same reason. For small mammals, bison reintroduction reduced energy transfer through the loss of species, while prescribed fire had little impact on either small mammal richness or energy transfer. The CAFE approach demonstrates how bison reintroduction controls small nonvolant mammal communities by increasing prairie food web complexity, and increases dung beetle populations with possible benefits for soil health through dung mineralization and soil bioturbation. Prescribed fires, however, have little effect on small mammals and dung beetles, suggesting a resilience to fire. These findings illustrate the key role of re-establishing historical disturbance regimes when restoring endangered prairie ecosystems and their ecological function.

AB  - Interspecific niche complementarity is a key mechanism posited to explain positive species richness-productivity relationships in plant communities. However, the exact nature of the niche dimensions that plant species partition remains poorly known. Species may partition abiotic resources that limit their growth, but species may also be specialized with respect to their set of biotic interactions with other trophic levels, in particular with enemies including pathogens and consumers. The lower host densities present in more species-diverse plant communities may therefore result in smaller populations of specialized enemies, and in a smaller associated negative feedback these enemies exert on plant productivity. To test whether such host density-dependent effects of enemies drive diversity-productivity relationships in young forest stands, we experimentally manipulated leaf fungal pathogens and insect herbivores in a large subtropical forest biodiversity-ecosystem functioning experiment in China (BEF-China). We found that fungicide spraying of tree canopies removed the positive tree-species richness-productivity relationship present in untreated control plots. The tree species that contributed the most to this effect were the ones with the highest fungicide-induced growth increase in monoculture. Insecticide application did not cause comparable effects. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that tree species diversity may not only promote productivity by interspecific resource-niche partitioning but also by trophic niche partitioning. Most likely, partitioning occurred with respect to enemies such as pathogenic fungi. Alternatively, similar effects on tree growth would have occurred if fungicide had eliminated positive effects of a higher diversity of beneficial fungi (e.g. mycorrhizal symbionts) that may have occurred in mixed tree species communities.

AB  - Movement patterns of lions (Panthera leo) reveal how they hunt large herbivores in heterogeneous landscapes such as the Kruger National Park in South Africa. Large herbivores are distributed differently on the landscape and therefore have different vulnerabilities as prey for lions. For instance, blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) occupy small grazing lawns at night but are difficult for lions to capture because open areas lack cover for stalking. African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) aggregate in large herds but are less available because these herds only intermittently enter the home ranges of individual lion prides. Unlike large herds of wildebeest and buffalo, plains zebra (Equus quagga) move widely in small herds while browsing greater kudus (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa) generally occur in lower densities. We used spatial data derived from GPS collars to investigate several hypotheses regarding the movements of three lion prides in response to their prey. We found that lions were most active and moved longer distances during nighttime than during daytime. Lions remained within their core home ranges on 87% of nights and wandered to the outlying areas of the home ranges every second night. Lions visited grazing lawns, that is, area of short grass, where wildebeest herds resided every second night, and moved toward the direction of buffalo herds within 2 km of vicinity. Lions spent more time near riverbanks that provided dense woody cover at night than expected but concentrated only weakly near sites with surface water where herbivores drank in the dry season. Our study contributes to understanding how lions vary their movements in response to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the relative availability and vulnerability of multiple prey species.

AB  - Savanna ecosystems provide resources supporting the livelihoods of millions of people globally. Ongoing exploitation through high livestock densities, among other factors, however, threatens these ecosystems. Shrub encroachment, a consequence of this exploitation, causes severe declines in fodder biomass for cattle. For example, in Namibia, this leads to losses of land productivity of up to 100%. Consequently, we must rethink land-use options to ensure sustainable utilization of savanna resources. In southern Africa, many landowners and custodians have switched to or included wildlife in their management systems, making it an excellent model region to study how changing herbivory affects ecosystems. The diversity of indigenous wildlife species is expected to promote efficient herbaceous layer utilization with browsing herbivores counteracting nondesirable woody plant encroachment. Nevertheless, surprisingly little research has been conducted on the ecological consequences of altering grazer-to-browser ratios. We developed a large-scale spatially explicit dynamic vegetation model including key hydrological and ecological processes, fire, and an herbivore algorithm that accounts for aggregated animal herds in a heterogeneous savanna landscape. We find that different ratios of wild herbivore feeding types greatly influence vegetation composition and dynamics. By dynamically computing plant biomass as a resource, our model estimates the occurrence of fodder biomass shortages, providing a valuable tool for land users. The model also reports the number of patches with low to medium tree functional cover (10-25%), indicating structural diversity with its implications for species richness, and is thus essential for nature conservation. We find that a herbivore species composition of approximately 40% browsers and 60% grazers is beneficial for plant structural and species diversity. Theoretically, therefore, the browse-graze ratio achieved through wildlife-based land-use can lead to more sustainability and resilience. The interplay between diverse herbivory, vegetation, rain, and fire complicates but also stabilizes the savanna rangeland ecosystem and may contribute to its long-term persistence.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Restoring forests has recently received considerable attention in the context of sequestering carbon and supporting biodiversity. Although considering alien species as a tool for natural forest restoration still remains controversial, harnessing alien species when they are already present in an ecosystem might result in overall benefits for nature and society. In this study we evaluated whether the presence of an alien tree species supports or hinders the establishment of naturally regenerating forests in Shiretoko National Park, Japan. In particular, we focused on Larix kaempferi, which is widely present yet non-native to the region, and examined how this alien species affects two factors influencing the success of restoration: wind disturbance and deer herbivory. We examined the following effects of L. kaempferi plantations on natural regeneration: (1) the windbreak function for protecting native tree growth and (2) the nursery function to promote the regeneration of native tree saplings and seedlings under high herbivory pressure. We assessed tree height and regeneration, using large-scale remotely sensed data and terrestrial inventory data in five major vegetation types. We found that L. kaempferi plantations can protect native species from predominant winds. Additionally, L. kaempferi canopy cover promoted abundance and species richness in understory saplings and seedlings compared to other vegetation types such as primary and secondary forests, even under excessive browsing pressure. No regenerating L. kaempferi individuals were observed during the field census, suggesting the species is likely not invasive in our study system. The positive relationship between alien tree species and the regeneration of native tree assemblages emphasizes that existing alien species have the potential to act as nurse plants. Our findings imply that the presence of alien species can contribute to natural forest restoration by improving the local environmental conditions for native species in the short-term. Given the multiple ecological and social needs in our changing world, careful consideration is required to evaluate the long-term consequences of alien species. Especially in ecosystems in which alien species have already established, using their positive functions rather than swiftly eradicating them from the landscape might be beneficial for long-term restoration goals. We conclude that managers need to be aware of the context-dependency of alien species to make restoration more effective.

AB  - In extreme environments, temperature and precipitation are often the main forces responsible for structuring ecological communities and species distributions. The role of biotic interactions is typically thought to be minimal. By clustering around rare and isolated features, like surface water, however, effects of herbivory by desert-dwelling wildlife can be amplified. Understanding how species interact in these environments is critical to safeguarding vulnerable or data-deficient species. We examined whether African elephants (Loxodonta africana), black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), and southern giraffe (Giraffa giraffa) modulate insectivorous bat communities around permanent waterholes in the Namib Desert. We estimated megaherbivore use of sites based on dung transects, summarized vegetation productivity from satellite measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index, and surveyed local bat communities acoustically. We used structural equation models to identify relationships among megaherbivores and bat species richness and dry- (November 2016-January 2017) and wet- (February-May 2017) season bat activity. Site-level megaherbivore use in the dry season was positively associated with bat activity-particularly that of open-air foragers-and species richness through indirect pathways. When resources were more abundant (wet season), however, these relationships were weakened. Our results indicate that biotic interactions contribute to species distributions in desert areas and suggest the conservation of megaherbivores in this ecosystem may indirectly benefit insectivorous bat abundance and diversity. Given that how misunderstood and understudied most bats are relative to other mammals, such findings suggest that managers pursue short-term solutions (e.g., community game guard programs, water-point protection near human settlements, and ecotourism) to indirectly promote bat conservation and that research includes megaherbivores' effects on biodiversity at other trophic levels.

AB  - We examine major reorganizations of the terrestrial ecosystem around Mono Lake, California during the last deglacial period from 16,000-9,000 cal yr BP using pollen, microcharcoal, and coprophilous fungal spores (Sporormiella) from a deep-water sediment core. The pollen results record the assemblage, decline, and replacement of a mixed wooded community of Sierran and Great Basin taxa with Alkali Sink and Sagebrush Steppe biomes around Mono Lake. In particular, the enigmatic presence of Sequoiadendron-type pollen and its extirpation during the early Holocene hint at substantial biogeographic reorganizations on the Sierran-Great Basin ecotone during deglaciation. Rapid regional hydroclimate changes produced structural alterations in pine-juniper woodlands facilitated by increases in wildfires at 14,800 cal yr BP, 13,900 cal yr BP, and 12,800 cal yr BP. The rapid canopy changes altered the availability of herbaceous understory plants, likely putting pressure on megafauna populations, which declined in a stepwise fashion at 15,000 cal yr BP and 12,700 cal yr BP before final extirpation from Mono Basin at 11,500 cal yr BP. However, wooded vegetation communities overall remained resistant to abrupt hydroclimate changes during the late Pleistocene; instead, they gradually declined and were replaced by Alkali Sink communities in the lowlands as temperature increased into the Early Holocene, and Mono Lake regressed.

AB  - The increasing deer population has significantly altered the forest ecosystems. Deer browsing affects not only plant species diversity and composition but also other organisms indirectly, along with soil properties. However, the effects of deer grazing on the soil microbial community and the underlying mechanisms have not been well understood. To assess these effects, we compared the understory environment and soil microbial community inside and outside fences at Mt. Shiraga, where severe soil environmental degradation has occurred due to sika deer grazing. We selected 20 Fagus trees inhabiting areas within and outside the fences with similar topological features. Eleven environmental variables and both soil prokaryotic and fungal communities were compared between samples inside and outside the fences. The area inside the fence had significantly higher dwarf bamboo density and soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, whereas soils outside the fences had higher pH and bulk density. The diversity index of the fungal community, in terms of the number of amplicon sequence variants, inside the fence was higher than that outside, whereas that of the prokaryotic community did not differ between fences. Both prokaryotic and fungal communities differed between inside and outside fences. The prokaryotic community changed with the soil C/N ratio, and the relative abundance of oligotrophic bacteria increased with decreasing soil C/N ratio. The fungal community also changed with soil pH and dwarf bamboo density, with the relative abundances of symbiotrophic fungi and ectomycorrhizae increasing with increasing soil pH. Comparative analyses between inside and outside fence samples might provide information on soil microbial community changes with the changes in soil properties after deer grazing.

AB  - In managed boreal forests, logging operations maintain high levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the ecosystem. The establishment of permanent anthropogenic linear features such as logging roads in the landscape may be a major factor in the predator-prey system. Logging roads may potentially improve the numerical and functional response of predators. Using camera traps, our objective was to explain according to local and landscape factors how the number of uses by wolves, black bears, lynx and moose, varies along different natural and anthropogenic linear features during the snow-free season. In western Quebec (Canada), the managed forest south of Val-d'Or encloses an isolated caribou population facing extinction that requires active restoration of their habitat. In this site, we used stratified random selection of gravel forest roads (n = 33), winter forest roads (n = 28) and riparian areas (n = 19) to compare their characteristics and number of uses by the four species. For wolves, black bears, and lynx, positive differences in lateral cover between the surroundings and the linear feature mainly explained their number of uses. Number of uses by wolves and lynx were positively related to use by their respective prey species (moose and snowshoe hare). Gray wolf use was also positively affected by distance to a higher forest road class and negatively affected by distance to the nearest urban area. Gravel forest roads had the highest number of uses by all species, as they showed greater positive differences in lateral cover as compared to the surroundings area due to their limited vegetation growth and by frequent maintenance activities. We recommend that restoration efforts aimed at forest road closures should target roads with a high value of difference in lateral cover, which is particularly the case in most gravel roads. Lower lateral cover on these linear feature as compared to their surroundings area favors the movement of predators and alternative prey. Our results thus suggest that investing in gravel roads restoration can benefit conservation efforts in caribou habitat.

AB  - 1. The relationship between biodiversity and multitrophic ecosystem functions (BEF) remains poorly studied in forests. There have been inconsistent reports regarding the significance of tree diversity effects on ecosystem functions, which may be better understood by considering critical biotic interactions of trees.
   2. This study investigates the role of tree-mycorrhizal associations that may shape forest BEF relationships across multiple ecosystem functions. We used a field experiment (MyDiv) that comprises 10 deciduous tree species associated with either arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) or ectomycorrhizal (EcM) fungi to create gradients in species richness (1, 2, 4 species) and different mycorrhizal communities (only AM-species [AM fungi associated tree species] or EcM-species [EcM fungi associated tree species], or a combination of both). We investigated the effects of tree species richness and mycorrhizal types on crucial multitrophic ecosystem functions (foliage damage, predation [using artificial caterpillars] and soil fauna feeding activity [similar to 0-10 cm]) and assessed how these effects were mediated by stand characteristics.
   3. Overall, we found that tree species richness and mycorrhizal types strongly affected multitrophic ecosystem functions. Compared to monocultures, 4-species mixtures with both mycorrhizal types experienced significantly lower foliage damage. The mixtures of EcM-species supported significantly higher predation (i.e. a greater proportion of artificial caterpillars being attacked), and this effect strengthened with tree species richness. The effects of tree species richness on soil fauna feeding activity were negative across all mycorrhizal types in the lower soil layer. Moreover, we showed that tree diversity effects were mediated by above-ground tree biomass, vertical structural complexity and leaf quality, with the dominating mechanisms largely depending on the mycorrhizal types.
   4. Synthesis. Tree species richness affected multitrophic ecosystem functioning by (1) directly decreasing the proportion of foliage damage in the communities with both mycorrhizal types, where AM-species benefited from mixing with EcM-species, and (2) increasing predation rates via changes in the vertical structural complexity in mixtures of EcM-species. Our results highlight the importance of considering mycorrhizal types for managing well-functioning mixed-species forests and contribute to broadening the mechanistic understanding of the context-dependent BEF relationships in forests.

AB  - The Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) is a widely distributed ungulate in northeast China. Due to a series of human disturbance activities such as large-scale forest cutting, deforestation and reclamation, road construction in the past, the appearance and internal structure of forest vegetation in the habitat of Siberian roe have changed significantly. At the same time, Siberian roe population had a series of ecological adaptation responses in the face of such habitat changes. Therefore, two typical vegetation types with differences were selected in the Muling Forest, China. We used nutritional ecology and microbial metagenomic analysis techniques to compare the nutritional selection strategy and the structure and functional characteristics of faecal microbiota of Siberian roe groups in two vegetation types. The results showed that the alpha diversity of dietary and gut microbes of deer in Natural Forest was higher than that in Plantation Forest. However, the gut microbes of the Plantation Forest group contained more unique enzymes in the functional pathways of carbon metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids. This study suggests that habitat type is associated with plant community composition, and contributes to changes in the intake proportions of major macronutrients by altering the availability, quality, and composition of certain edible plants. Feeding behaviour may be an important regulatory factor of gut microbiota structure and function of deer. The metabolic function of gut microbiota to different nutrients may affect the microbial community structure. Therefore, our results suggest that the gut microbes of Siberian roe may have coevolved with their diets, and reflect the adaptability of deer populations to environmental changes (e.g., vegetation type). Our study provides new insights into how spatial heterogeneity affects nutrition and microecosystems by describing the interactions among the environment, diet, and symbiotic gut microbes in wild ungulates.

AB  - Rocket launches are such rare events that their impacts on the environment or biodiversity are almost never studied. Here we report on changes in local insect diversity in the immediate aftermath of a rocket launch conducted on June 25th, 2016 from the Wenchang Satellite Launch Center, southern China. Rocket fuel emissions and disturbance associated with rocket launches may negatively influence local insect biodiversity. We compared insect community structure before and after the rocket launch in two different tropical tree plantations near the launch site. We studied insect species richness (total species numbers) and abundances (total individuals.
   of all species) using insect net and mercury lamp trapping in a total of six 20 & times; 20 m2 plots distributed three each in a mixed plantation of coconut (Cocos nucifera) with 10 native tree species, and a pure coconut plantation. Comparing insect species richness and abundances, we found that species richness and abundances were overall greater in the mixed species plantation compared to the coconut monoculture. We also found that species richness and abundance were overall lower after the launch event. However, there was no significant difference in the response of the two plantations, either in richness or abundance, to the launch disturbance. Therefore, the negative effect appeared indiscriminate with respect to plantation type, and the greater plant diversity or insect diversity in the mixed plantation did not protect against this disturbance. Therefore, the general impact of rocket launching disturbance may be similar to catastrophic disturbances (e.g., typhoons) that cause widespread mortality irrespective of species.

AB  - Timber harvest can have spatially and temporally varying effects on wildlife populations. To explore the response of Sitka black-tailed deer ( Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis ) to commercial forestry we performed habitat selection analyses (HSAs) based on data across 3 spatial scales (step selection, home range, and study area) and 4 seasons in relation to logging-related covariates (logged areas and roads) and LiDAR-derived vegetation metrics (canopy and understory cover).We deployed global positioning system (GPS) collars on 61 female deer in a coastal temperate rainforest (Prince of Wales Island, Alaska, USA). Deer response to young ( <30 year) and old ( >= 30) logged stands was equivocal across seasons and scales, though there was a tendency for deer to avoid older logged areas at the home range scale. However, both within and outside of logged stands, deer avoided areas of greater canopy cover and selected areas with more understory. Deer selected areas near logging roads that were open to vehicle traffic and were neutral towards closed roads. Although there was variation in individual deer habitat selection patterns, the overall population response was generally consistent across seasons and scales. Our results suggest that forest structure rather than logging status was more influential to deer habitat selection and that deer responded to road status (open or closed to vehicle traffic). Forest management activities (timber harvest and restoration) that promote understory and reduce canopy cover may increase habitat selected by deer.

AB  - Conservation decision-making often relies on species' distribution changes in response to anthropogenic disturbances but overlook their temporal responses. Filling the knowledge gap on the temporal shifts as elusive responses of wild animals to human activity is important because this may provide information for more proactive conservation planning. In this study, we used camera traps in a field survey technique to investigate the trade-offs between spatial and temporal responses of a mammal community to major human activities in Qinling Mountains, China. We focused on five most abundant mammalian species including giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), takin (Budorcas taxicolor), wild boar (Sus scrofa), tufted deer (Elaphodus cephalophus), and Chinese goral (Naemorhedus griseus), and examined the drivers of, and the trade-offs between the change of their spatial distributions and daily activity patterns in response to anthropogenic disturbances. We found that in response to human interferences, giant panda and takin mainly changed their distributions, while wild boar, tufted deer and Chinese goral altered their daily activity patterns, indicating the elusive responses of the latter species under anthropogenic stressors. In addition, anthropogenic stressors such as farming and tourism have more profound impacts on mammal communities than previously revealed by species distribution modeling only. For nature reserves that aim to conserve multiple species simultaneously, a more flexible, adaptive management framework is thus needed to capture the trade-offs between multiple species' spatial and temporal responses to anthropogenic disturbance.

AB  - Seamounts are thought to function as hotspots of megafauna diversity due to their topology and environmental characteristics. However, assessments of megafauna communities inhabiting seamounts, including diversity and density, are scarce. In this study, we provide megafauna diversity and density estimates for a recently discovered, not yet characterized seamount region (Boetius seamounts) west of Cape Verde (N17 degrees 16 ', W29 degrees 26 '). We investigated the distribution of epibenthic megafauna over a large depth gradient from the seamount's summit at 1400 m down to 3200 m water depth and provided qualitative and quantitative analyses based on quantified video data. In utilizing an ocean floor observation system (OFOS), calibrated videos were taken as a horizontal transect from the north-eastern flank of the seamount, differentiating between an upper, coral-rich region (-1354/-2358 m) and a deeper, sponge-rich region (-2358/-3218 m). Taxa were morphologically distinguished, and their diversity and densities were estimated and related to substrate types. Both the upper and deeper seamount region hosted unique communities with significantly higher megafauna richness at the seamount's summit. Megafauna densities differed significantly between the upper (0.297 +/- 0.167 Ind./m2) and deeper community (0.112 +/- 0.114 Ind./m). The seamount showed a vertical zonation with dense aggregations of deep-sea corals dominating the seamount's upper region and colonies of the glass sponges Poliopogon amadou dominating the deeper region. The results are discussed in light of detected substrate preferences and co-occurrence of species and are compared with findings from other Atlantic seamounts.

AB  - 1. Many savannas are experiencing increased cover of trees and shrubs, resulting in reduced herbaceous productivity, shifts in savanna functional structure and potential reductions in ecotourism. Clearing woody plants has been suggested as an effective management strategy to mitigate these effects and restore these systems to an open state with higher rates of grass production and herbivory. This study investigated the effectiveness of repeated shrub clearing as a tool to mitigate bush encroachment in a semi-arid savanna in southern Africa. 2. We present data from a 7-year experiment in the Mthimkhulu Game Reserve bordering Kruger National Park, South Africa. Colophospermum mopane stems and resprouting shoots were basally cut 2-3 times per year (2015-2022) in three pairs of treatment and control plots of 60 x 60 m. We monitored changes in soil moisture, grass biomass and herbivore activity via dung counts. We assessed C. mopane physiological responses to repeated cutting using non-structural carbohydrates and stable water isotopes to infer changes to energy storage and functional rooting depth, respectively. 3. The cleared treatment had higher soil moisture and grass biomass than the control treatment. Dung counts showed impala and buffalo visited the cleared treatment more frequently than the control treatment. 4. Repeated cutting had limited effects on C. mopane survival in the first 2-3 years after initial clearing, but 80% of individuals were dead after 7 years. Repeatedly cut C. mopane had lower belowground starch concentrations and used water from shallower soil depths than C. mopane in control plots. 5. Synthesis and applications. Repeated cutting increased soil moisture availability and grass biomass, and attracted charismatic grazing herbivores. While more costly than once-off clearing methods, this practice created more employment opportunities for a neighbouring rural community. Transforming portions of the ecosystem to a grass-dominated state may increase ecotourism potential through improved game viewing in open systems.

AB  - Ununiform, excessive, and prolonged understory vegetation feeding by overpopulated ungulates (over-browsing) leads to heterogeneous stand structural alterations at the landscape level. However, it is not yet clear how changes in various types of stand structural alterations affect total carbon (C) stocks in forest ecosystems as the sum of aboveground C stocks (AGC) and belowground C stocks (BGC). We aimed to fill this gap in a cool temperate broadleaf-conifer mixed forest in southern Kyushu, Japan, where over-browsing of sika deer has occurred since 1980. Four replicate survey plots were established in four stand types, namely, stands with presence of understory vegetation (PU), stands with no understory vegetation (NU), stands dominated by unpalatable shrubs (SR), and stands with canopy gap areas with a lack of regeneration (CG). Using PU as a baseline, alterations in stand structure (e.g., stem density) and C stocks were evaluated for each stand type. We measured C stocks of overstory trees (height > 2 m), understory vegetation, leaf litter, fine woody debris (FWD), and coarse woody debris (CWD) as AGC. C stocks of fine roots, coarse roots, and soil organic matter (SOM) at 0-30 cm depths were measured as BGC. We also separated overstory trees according to the palatability of the deer diet. The alteration from PU to NU did not reduce AGC, BGC, or total C stocks. The alteration from PU to SR and CG was found to potentially reduce total C stocks and AGC by up to 49% and 59%, respectively. These reductions in SR and CG were mainly driven by the decreased C stock of palatable overstory trees. There were dense unpalatable shrubs in SR and large amounts of CWD in CG. However, neither was sufficient to offset the loss of palatable overstory trees in SR and CG. We also found a reduction in the C stock of leaf litter and SOM at 0-10 cm depth in NU, SR, and CG. These reductions were likely caused by reduced litterfall and increased soil erosion, implying future reductions in BGC. Our results suggest that stand structure conservation is a key guideline for C stock retention when implementing forest management strategies to prevent over-browsing. The failure to conserve palatable juvenile trees could lead to a lack of more palatable overstory trees in the future, causing irreversible changes in AGC and BGC.

AB  - Site occupancy models, accounting for imperfect detection and the influence of anthropogenic and ecological covariates, can indicate the status of species populations. They may thus be useful for exploring the suitability of landscapes such as biological corridors, to ensure population dispersal and connectivity. Using occupancy probability models of its principal prey species, we make inferences on landscape connectivity for the movement of the tiger Panthera tigris between protected areas in Bhutan. We used camera-trap data to assess the probability of site occupancy (psi) of the sambar Rusa unicolor, wild boar Sus scrofa and barking deer Muntiacus muntjak in biological corridor no. 8, which connects two national parks in central Bhutan. At least one prey species was recorded at 17 out of 26 trapping locations. The probability of site occupancy was highest for the barking deer (psi = 0.52 +/- SE 0.09) followed by sambar (psi = 0.49 +/- SE 0.03) and wild boar (psi = 0.45 +/- SE 0.07). All three species had higher occupancy probability at lower altitudes. Sambar occupancy was greater farther from settlements and on steeper and/or south-facing slopes. Barking deer also had higher occupancy on south-facing slopes, and wild boar occurred mainly close to rivers. Our findings suggest that this biological corridor could facilitate dispersal of tigers. Protecting prey species, and minimizing anthropogenic disturbance and habitat fragmentation, are vital for tiger dispersal and thus functional connectivity amongst populations in this area.

AB  - Carcass utilization by scavengers is crucial for ecosystem dynamics, influencing energy transfer and nutrient cycling. Through the provision of unconsumed carcasses, the return of wolves (Canis lupus) to European ecosystems can trigger complex cascading effects on scavenger communities. Here, we investigate the scavenging dynamics of mammalian species in a prey-rich Mediterranean coastal area close to a large city where wolves have recently returned. Using camera traps, we monitored the scavenging activity on fallow deer (Dama dama) carcasses preyed upon by wolves over a five-year period following the predator's return. We developed models to assess how competition between red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), wild boars (Sus scrofa), and wolves evolved over time, focusing on their carcass use, direct interactions, and spatiotemporal associations. Wolves exhibited consumption of only minor portions of prey and a negligible reuse of carcasses, while foxes and wild boars engaged in indirect competition for access to this emerging trophic niche. We found a notable temporal change in scavenging activity over the monitoring period, with wild boars progressively emerging as the primary scavenger and providing a substantial removal of carcass biomass. Our findings suggest that wild boars can assume a prominent scavenging role in environments where carcass availability is both abundant and predictable. This study underscores the importance of understanding scavenger temporal dynamics in the context of apex predator recolonization and highlights the need for further research to explore the long-term impacts of these interactions on community structure and ecosystem services as wolf populations continue to expand across Europe.

AB  - Livestock presence impacts plant biodiversity (species richness) in grassland ecosystems, yet extent and direction of grazing impacts on biodiversity vary greatly across inter-annual periods. In this study, an 8-year (2014-2021) grazing gradient experiment with sheep was conducted in a semi-arid grassland to investigate the impact of grazing under different precipitation variability on biodiversity. The results suggest no direct impact of grazing on species richness in semi-arid Stipa grassland. However, increased grazing indirectly enhanced species richness by elevating community dominance (increasing the sheltering effect of Stipa grass). Importantly, intensified grazing also regulates excessive community biomass resulting from increased inter-annual wetness (SPEI), amplifying the positive influence of annual humidity index on species richness. Lastly, we emphasize that, in water-constrained grassland ecosystems, intra-annual precipitation variability (PCI) was the most crucial factor driving species richness. Therefore, the water-heat synchrony during the growing season may alleviate physiological constraints on plants, significantly enhancing species richness as a result of multifactorial interactions. Our study provides strong evidence for how to regulate grazing intensity to increase biodiversity under future variable climate patterns. We suggest adapting grazing intensity according to local climate variability to achieve grassland biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Herbivory by wild and domestic ungulates can influence tree recruitment and understory forest communities throughout the world. Herbivore-driven declines in tree recruitment have been observed for quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), a foundation species whose health and management is recognized as a critical priority throughout much of its range. Livestock fencing is commonly used to promote aspen regeneration, but its effectiveness is rarely assessed, especially across large spatial scales. Using a livestock-reduction experiment, we evaluated the effects of ungulate herbivory on aspen in the Great Basin and southern Cascades, an expansive and environmentally heterogeneous region where aspen faces the interacting threats of climate change, conifer encroachment, and herbivory. We found that livestock fencing only reduced the intensity of herbivore browsing on aspen when wild ungulate abundance was low and did not increase stem densities of aspen recruits. Contrary to expectations, wild ungulate abundance was a strong driver of browsing intensity on juvenile aspen within fenced, but not unfenced, aspen stands, and when the abundance of these herbivores was high, browsing intensity in fenced stands exceeded that in unfenced stands. The density of aspen recruits decreased with browsing intensity on juvenile aspen and with the density of both adult aspen and conifers, suggesting that both herbivory and intra- and interspecific competition are important drivers of recruitment. Fire history was also an important driver of recruitment, with stands that burned 10-20 years ago having the greatest density of aspen recruits. Finally, in the stand understory, we found that livestock fencing decreased forb cover, increased shrub species richness, and increased the cover of exotic annual grasses, a group dominated by Bromus tectorum. This latter finding suggests that livestock fencing may not be appropriate in areas where controlling the spread of this invader is a priority. In sum, our findings indicate that aspen recruitment is limited by browsing by both wild and domestic ungulates, is mediated by competition with neighboring trees and fire history, and will require management actions beyond livestock fencing, as this approach does not control browsing by wild ungulates.

AB  - Urbanisation changes natural ecosystems and vegetation to urban green spaces, and causes insect communities to experience novel challenges for survival. New evidence suggests that urban green spaces, no matter how small, can provide meaningful habitats for insects. Information on design and management of small gardens (<6 m(2)) in dense urban areas is still scarce. In particular, it is hardly known which garden designs provide most benefits to insects. We surveyed 65 small urban fa & ccedil;ade gardens (mu=1.7m(2)) in Amsterdam and The Hague in The Netherlands and measured various garden attributes that are expected to be relevant for general, flower-visiting and herbivorous insect species richness and diversity. Plant coverage and richness were the strongest predictors of insect biodiversity and species richness. We found no support for associations with native plants or garden size. Synthesis and applications: To strengthen insect biodiversity in the urban environment, we recommend future design of urban green spaces to focus on maximising coverage and richness of vegetation. Although there are advantages to using native species, we acknowledge that garden owners often prefer exotic species. Some of these can also affect insect diversity and abundances positively.

AB  - There is mounting evidence that top-down control by natural enemies helps maintain plant diversity in natural ecosystems. Previous work has concentrated on either forest trees or grassland herbs. Our knowledge of how natural enemies affect herb diversity in forests is limited. We used fungicides and insecticide to experimentally examine the effects of fungi and insects on herb abundance and diversity at the community-wide scale and within groups of species with certain traits. We also assessed how the effects of fungi and insects on herb assemblages were modified by neighbouring tree diversity and composition in an old-growth temperate forest. We found that fungicides increased overall herb abundance by 7% while decreasing herb diversity by 5%. This effect of fungicides on both herb abundance and diversity weakened with the increase of neighbouring tree diversity. Insecticide did not affect either herb abundance or diversity noticeably, except in areas dominated by deciduous trees where insecticide application reduced herb diversity. Fungicides and insecticide decreased the diversity of relatively less defended species (i.e. thin-leaved and non-clonal) but had no effect on the diversity of herbs with stronger defensive traits (i.e. thick-leaved and clonal). Fungicides increased the abundance of non-mycorrhizal (NM) species but not arbuscular-mycorrhizal (AM) species, although the effect of fungicides on herb diversity was unrelated to species' mycorrhizal association. Insecticide had stronger effects on the abundance and diversity of NM species than AM species. Synthesis. We conclude that fungi and insect herbivores are critical to regulating herb abundance and diversity in this temperate forest, with their effects dependent on species' traits and neighbouring tree diversity and composition. Our results highlight the importance of top-down control of understory herb communities by natural enemies in temperate forests, advancing our understanding of the processes shaping plant diversity in natural ecosystems.

AB  - We evaluated patterns of herbivory and predation/scavenging by a small mammal, the arctic ground squirrel (Urocitellus parryii), as an indicator of biological diversity, vegetation structure, and ecological integrity on two contrasting islands in the vast and remote Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. Using DNA metabarcoding techniques, we assessed the taxonomic composition of vertebrates, vascular plants, and bryophytes at family and growth form levels in arctic ground squirrel fecal samples collected on the ecologically intact island of Chowiet, which supports diverse seabird and vegetation communities, and the degraded island of Chirikof, which has incurred centuries of disturbance from introduced arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) and cattle (Bos taurus taurus). We also evaluated whether fecal samples collected across the growing season (May-August) could act as indicators of herbivore-plant phenology. We did not detect any vertebrate taxa, however, observed herbivory patterns closely matched known differences in island plant diversity based on independent surveys. Diets from the ecologically intact island exhibited higher taxonomic richness, greater evenness, and higher shrub content than the ecologically degraded island, which is a grass- and forb-dominated ecosystem. On Chowiet Island, diets changed seasonally, likely in response to changing availability, nutritional quality, and toxin content associated with primary production. Small mammal diet served as an effective indicator of plant diversity, vegetation structure, and ecological integrity when compared against known composition and status of these remote island ecosystems. Non-invasive fecal sampling and dietary analyses using genetic techniques may provide a useful strategy for monitoring biological diversity, particularly in remote areas where widespread intensive sampling is unfeasible.

AB  - Annual variation in phenology can have profound effects on the behavior of animals. As climate change advances spring phenology in ecosystems around the globe, it is becoming increasingly important to understand how animals respond to variation in the timing of seasonal events and how their responses may shift in the future. We investigated the influence of spring phenology on the behavior of migratory, barren-ground caribou (Rangifer tarandus), a species that has evolved to cope with short Arctic summers. Specifically, we examined the effect of spring snow melt and vegetation growth on the current and potential future space-use patterns of the Porcupine Caribou Herd (PCH), which exhibits large, inter-annual shifts in their calving and post-calving distributions across the U.S.-Canadian border. We quantified PCH selection for snow melt and vegetation phenology using machine learning models, determined how selection resulted in annual shifts in space-use, and then projected future distributions based on climate-driven phenology models. Caribou exhibited strong, scale-dependent selection for both snow melt and vegetation growth. During the calving season, caribou selected areas at finer scales where the snow had melted and vegetation was greening, but within broader landscapes that were still brown or snow covered. During the post-calving season, they selected vegetation with intermediate biomass expected to have high forage quality. Annual variation in spring phenology predicted major shifts in PCH space-use. In years with early spring phenology, PCH predominately used habitat in Alaska, while in years with late phenology, they spent more time in Yukon. Future climate conditions were projected to advance spring phenology, shifting PCH calving and post-calving distributions further west into Alaska. Our results demonstrate that caribou selection for habitat in specific phenological stages drive dramatic shifts in annual space-use patterns, and will likely affect future distributions, underscoring the importance of maintaining sufficient suitable habitat to allow for behavioral plasticity.

AB  - Understanding the impact of anthropogenic structures on wildlife is essential for balancing ecosystem services. This study explored the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances, particularly wind farms, on South Korean Forest ecosystems using spatial occupancy models and camera trap survey data. We examined the occupancy probability of mammals (roe deer, water deer, and wild boar) around wind farms and identified the influencing factors. The results revealed that roe deer exhibited the highest occupancy probability (0.936), water deer exhibited the lowest (0.503), and wild boar exhibited intermediate values (0.657). For roe deer, the occupancy probability increased with distance from the wind turbine, whereas a high canopy height had a negative impact. Water deer showed a positive correlation with decreasing distance to agricultural land and increasing distance to residential land. Canopy height also contributed positively. Similarly, wild boar displayed a positive association with increased canopy height. Analyzing the impact of wind farm construction time, water deer exhibited a decrease in occupancy probability with more recent construction, whereas wild boars showed the opposite trend. The predicted occupancy probability indicated that roe deer and water deer had the lowest probability near the recently built wind farms, whereas wild boar had the highest probability. The findings of this study contribute to an ecologically informed conservation approach alongside the expansion of wind energy infrastructure.

AB  - Predators of similar size often compete over prey. In semi-arid ecosystems where water is a limiting resource, prey availability can be affected by water distribution, which further increases resource competition and exacerbate conflict among predators. This can have implications for carnivore dietary competition. Hence, we evaluated the dynamics of food resource competition between African wild dogs and four competing predators (cheetahs, leopards, lions and spotted hyaenas) in different seasons and across areas with different waterhole densities in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We used the frequency of occurrence of prey items found in predators' scats to analyse diet composition, overlap and prey preference. For most predators, kudu was most frequently consumed and preferred. Low and medium water-dependent prey (medium and small-sized) were mostly consumed by wild dogs, leopards and cheetahs. Wild dog diet overlap was high with all predators, particularly with hyaenas and lions. There were no seasonal differences in the predators diet. The diet overlap of wild dogs with lions was highest in the low waterhole density area, and wild dog diet composition did not differ significantly from the diet of lions and hyaenas. In the low waterhole density area, wild dogs and hyaenas broadened their niche breadth, and predators diet had a higher proportion of low water-dependent prey. A low density of waterholes increased food resource competition. However, high density of waterholes, where there is more prey availability, can increase the aggregation and density of predators, and hence, increase the risks involved in interspecific competition on wild dogs. To reduce food resource competition on wild dogs, we propose to conserve larger-bodied prey that are less dependent on water (e.g. kudu, reedbuck, eland and gemsbok). As the use of water pumping is common practice, we propose maintaining water management heterogeneity where prey which is less dependent on water can also thrive.
   We evaluated the dynamics of food resource competition between African wild dogs and four competing predators (cheetahs, leopards, lions and spotted hyaenas) across areas with different waterhole densities (maximum, high and low) in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. We propose to conserve larger-bodied prey not much dependent on water (e.g. kudu) by keeping their populations stable. We emphasise maintaining water management heterogeneity.image

AB  - Scavenging mammals and vultures can exploit and deplete carcasses much faster than other birds and invertebrates. Vultures are strongly influenced by habitat type, e.g. tree cover, since they rely on their eyesight to detect carcasses. It remains unclear whether and how facultative scavengers - both other birds and mammals - are influenced by tree cover and how that affect carcass decomposition time, which in turn affects biodiversity and ecological processes, including the cycle of energy and nutrients. We studied whether the carcass detection and consumption, hence carcass decomposition speed, by facultative avian and mammalian scavengers varies with tree cover in areas without vultures. Fresh mammal carcasses were placed in different landscapes across the Netherlands at locations that widely varied in tree cover. Camera traps were used to record carcass exploitation by facultative avian and mammalian scavengers and to estimate carcass decomposition time. We found that carcass detection and consumption by birds, wild boar, and other mammals varied between locations. Carcass decomposition speed indeed increased with carcass detection and exploitation by mammals, especially by wild boar. However, this variation was not related to tree cover. We conclude that tree cover is not a major determinant of carcass exploitation by facultative scavengers in areas without obligate scavengers and large carnivores.

AB  - Coastal wetlands are crucial habitats for waterbirds, and saltmarsh vegetation provides breeding habitats for bird species. However, studies on the effects of saltmarsh vegetation degradation and reconstruction on bird diversity are limited. In Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve, a Ramsar wetland, the reintroduced Pe`re David's deer, Elaphurus davidianus, severely degrades native vegetation. Thus, the natural reserve has implemented vegetation restoration through artificial planting to promote the growth of native flora. To elucidate the impact of active vegetation restoration on the avian community, we conducted bird surveys in active restoration areas and nonintervention areas during the breeding seasons from 2022 to 2023. The results indicated that there was no significant difference in the species diversity of bird communities between the active restoration areas and the nonintervention areas; however, there were significant differences in the functional and phylogenetic diversity of bird communities. Landscape analysis based on indices and correlation testing revealed a significant correlation between habitat heterogeneity at the landscape level and the functional diversity of bird communities. A random forest model identifies landscape area and cohesion as important influencing factors. Our results highlight that in the context of plant degradation caused by Pe`re David's deer in coastal wetlands, active vegetation restoration and the control of deer populations are conducive to enhancing avian diversity.

AB  - As wildlife becomes more isolated in human-dominated and rapidly changing environments, species conservation requires investment in landscape connectivity. Identifying stepping stones (discrete areas of suitable habitat that facilitate the movement of dispersing individuals) can help meet connectivity goals. We report the occurrence of the snow leopard Panthera uncia in Ikh Nart Nature Reserve, Mongolia, over 250 km from the nearest known population, one of the easternmost records for the species. Ikh Nart Nature Reserve lies within a region considered highly resistant to movement but harbours high densities of argali sheep Ovis ammon and Siberian ibexes Capra sibirica, both important prey items for snow leopards. This occurrence reveals a new distribution record for the species, the capacity of the species to move across low-quality environments, the value of investment in community conservation and collaborative park management, and the role of remote protected areas such as Ikh Nart Nature Reserve as stepping stones for facilitating population expansion and broader connectivity to other potentially suitable but unoccupied areas.

AB  - Horizontal structure of natural plant communities attracted the attention of researchers for a long time, while the problem of horizontal structure of urban park plantations was not studied sufficiently. Species richness of different tiers of park plantation in the large industrial city of Dnipro (Ukraine) was revealed in this study. Also features of variation in the structure of plant communities at different spatial levels were revealed, the influence of park plantation canopy on the understory and herbaceous layer of the park. There were 30 plant species in the tree layer of the park plantation. The most common species were Robinia pseudoacacia L., Acer platanoides L., A. negundo L., Gleditsia triacanthos L., Aesculus hippocastanum L., Populus carolinensis Moench. The variance-to-mean ratio revealed that 13 tree species were randomly distributed throughout the park, and 14 species were aggregated. The number of occurrences of a given tree species per site and variance-to-mean ratio were positively correlated. The numerous tree species showed a tendency of aggregated distribution within the park. Sixteen plant species were found in the understory. Among them, the most abundant species were Acer platanoides L., A. negundo L., A. pseudoplatanus L., Sambucus nigra L., Robinia pseudoacacia L. Eight species were found to be randomly distributed over the park area, and eight species showed an aggregate distribution. The number of species encountered in the understory and variance-to-mean ratio were positively correlated. In the herbaceous stand, 99 plant species were found, of which Chelidonium majus L., Viola odorata L., Impatiens parviflora DC., Parthenocissus quinquefolia (L.) Planch., Geum urbanum L. predominated. The variance-to-mean ratio of all species was significantly less than unity, indicating regular spatial distribution. The values of alpha- and gamma-diversity of the plant community in separate layers are very different. The highest gamma diversity was found for the herbaceous stand, while the diversity of the tree stand and understory was significantly lower. Alpha biodiversity of the tree stand and the understory did not practically differ. Beta diversity values between the layers are very close, and beta diversity is practically equal for tree stand and herbaceous layer. Thus, we can assume that the mechanisms of species turnover for the plant communities of different layers are determined by the common causes. The spatial broad-scale component was able to explain 8.2% of community variation, the medium-scale component was able to explain 4.2% of community variation, and the fine-scale component was able to explain 0.7% of community variation. The understory is the most sensitive to the environmental factors, the herbaceous stand is somewhat less sensitive, and the tree stand is the least sensitive to the environmental factors. The environmental factors in this study are represented by a set of variables. The spatial variation of the stand is predominantly influenced by the factors of trophicity and moisture of the edaphotope. These same factors also act on the herbaceous stand and understory, but along with them are included the environmental variables, which are determined by the architectonics of the crown space and thus the light regime, which is regulated by the tree stand. It is important to note that the variation of the communities of the different layers of the park plantation is subject to spatial patterns. The herbaceous and understory variation is more spatially structured than the tree stand variation.
   The spatial patterns can arise as a result of the influence of spatially structured environmental factors and as a result of factors of a neutral nature. The latter aspect of variation is best described by the pure spatial component of community variation.

AB  - Managed forest ecosystems are a fundamental pillar to the conservation of biodiversity. However, whether and how stand-scale management interventions can support biodiversity and associated ecosystem functions is yet unclear. Here we focused on the group of European insectivore bats, which are important top-down predators of herbivorous insects and guard forests against insect pests. Using a full factorial experimental design, which included canopy gap creation and deadwood enrichment, we assessed whether and how species richness, relative abundance and behavior of bats and their functional groups differ due to experimental treatment and quantitative environmental metrics of the stand, assessed by ground surveys and airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. Gap creation increased bat species richness and relative abundance of bats, while increased deadwood volume and understory vegetation, correlated with higher bat activity and foraging activity. Gap creation however mainly increased the abundance of rather generalist fast flying open and edge foraging bats while more specialized narrow space foragers, remained under canopy cover resulting in distinct local assemblages between experimental treatments. Species relative abundances hereby correlated with quantitative environmental metrics, reflecting ecological constraints of functional groups, but also species- specific resource requirements. Our results emphasize the importance of managed forests for bats and highlight that very small local management interventions already have distinct effects on different aspects of bat occurrence and behavioral patterns. Bat friendly forests, should thus include different areas of structural heterogeneity and increased deadwood retention to support the conservation of a diverse bat assemblage within forested landscapes.

AB  - Ungulate herbivory might induce different effects on the diversity and growth of trees and shrubs. The density, distribution, and the species of ungulates as well as plant communities' composition and other factors determine whether ungulate herbivory promotes or limits plants' diversity and growth. The impacts of ungulates on woody plants are commonly surveyed with exclosure-control approaches. In practice, such surveys frequently only cover short periods of time, addressing immediate management needs. Long-term surveys, documenting lasting effects of ungulate herbivory, are highly needed, but still rare. However, the general transferability of outcomes of long-term surveys might be limited due to different disturbing factors. This study addresses two basic aspects of long-term monitoring in mountainous forests, based on a unique 30-year data set: (1) Possible long-term effects of herbivores on forest vegetation (e.g., species/structural diversity of woody plants) and (2) potential differences between short-term and long-term surveys in terms of height growth patterns. In our study, diversity of woody plant species showed great variability with no significant impact of ungulate herbivory. The presence of ungulates had a significantly negative effect on the vertical structural diversity and growth of trees. Due to the slower growth on control plots, it took trees longer to reach a 160 cm height-threshold with their terminal shoots than on exclosure plots. Our long-term control-exclosure data set indicated that long-term survey data indeed might differ from growth patterns represented by short-term surveys. This can be induced by several factors, like site-specific growth patterns of trees, occurrences of natural abiotic disturbances that influence the functional life of exclosures, and others.

AB  - Extensively managed grasslands are globally recognized for their high biodiversity value. Over the past century, a continuous loss and degradation of grassland habitats has been observed across Europe that is mainly attrib-utable to agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Particularly insects have suffered from the loss of grassland habitats due to land-use change and the decrease in habitat quality, either due to an increase in livestock density, higher mowing frequency, and an increase in nitrogen fertilization, or by abandonment. However, only a few studies have used nationwide datasets to analyse the effects of land cover and land-use intensity on insects. It further remains largely unexplored how these effects are modulated by species traits, i. e. habitat specialisation and mobility. Using nationwide butterfly data originating from the German Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, we investigated the effect of three indicators related to land cover and agricultural land-use intensity on species richness as well as trait composition of butterfly communities. Based on agricultural census data at the municipality scale, we calculated the share of permanent grasslands (measure of habitat availability), the total livestock density (proxy for organic fertilization) and the livestock density of domestic herbivores (proxy for management intensity in grasslands) within a 2 km buffer surrounding each butterfly transect. To analyse the relationships between butterflies and indicators of land cover and land-use intensity, we applied generalised linear mixed effect models. We found a negative relationship between butterfly species richness and the livestock density of domestic herbivores. Further, the ratio of butterfly generalist to specialist species shifted towards generalists and the size of butterflies increased with higher herbivore livestock density, indicating a shift in communities towards mobile habitat generalists. Our results are in accordance with previous studies carried out across smaller geographic extents, highlighting the importance of low herbivore livestock densities to halt the loss of pollinating insects and safeguard biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in agricultural land-scapes. We here demonstrate that indicators based on livestock distribution data at the municipality scale can provide insights into processes and spatial diversity patterns of butterflies at the national level. Further, we highlight potentials and limitations of using agricultural census data to quantify and assess effects of land cover and land-use intensity on butterflies, and make recommendations for further research needs.

AB  - Aim: Seasonal migrations, such as those of ungulates, are particularly threatened by habitat transformations and fragmentation, climate and other environmental changes caused by anthropogenic activities. Mountain ungulate migrations are neglected because they are relatively short, although traversing heterogeneous altitudinal gradients particularly exposed to anthropogenic threats. Detecting migration routes of these species and understanding their drivers are therefore of primary importance to predict connectivity and preserve ecosystem functions and services. The populations of Alpine ibex Capra ibex have all been reintroduced from the last remnant source population. Despite a general increase in abundance and overall distribution range, ibex populations are mostly disconnected but display intra-population migrations. Therefore, its conservation is strictly linked to the interplay between external threats and related behavioural responses, including space use and migration. Location: Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland. Methods: By using 337 migratory tracks from 425 GPS-collared individuals from 15 Alpine ibex populations distributed across their entire range, we (i) identified the environmental drivers of movement corridors in both spring and autumn and (ii) compared the ability of a connectivity modelling algorithm to predict migratory movements between seasonal ranges of the 15 populations, using either population-specific or multipopulation datasets, and three validation procedures. Results: Steep, south-facing, snow-free slopes were selected while high elevation changes were avoided. This revealed the importance of favourable resources and an attempt to limit energy expenditures and perceived predation risk. The abilities of the modelling methods we compared to predict migratory connectivity from the results of those movement analyses were similar. Main Conclusions: The trade-off between energy expenditure, food and cover was the major driver of migration routes and was overall consistent among populations. Based on these findings, we provided useful connectivity models to inform conservation of Alpine ibex and its habitats, and a framework for future research investigating connectivity in migratory species.

AB  - Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are declining across much of their distribution in Canada in response to habitat alteration, leading to unsustainable predation, particularly by wolves (Canis lupus). Habitat alteration can benefit the primary prey species of wolves (moose [Alces alces] and deer [Odocoileus spp.]) by creating early seral conditions that contain more of their preferred food types. This increase in primary prey populations results in elevated wolf abundance and heightened predation pressure on caribou. In response to the elevated wolf populations and the risks to caribou, managers have reduced wolf abundance in key areas. Ecological theory suggests that reducing wolf abundance would release moose from the top-down effects of wolf predation, potentially allowing moose populations to grow. Elevated moose abundance thus has the potential to cause wolf populations to rebound quickly each year following reductions, suggesting a possible link between moose abundance and the number of wolves killed for caribou conservation. To test this idea we used a unique management situation in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, where lethal wolf removals were annually conducted across specific southern mountain caribou population ranges and, in some places, moose populations were concurrently reduced via liberalized hunting. We used indices of moose abundance and wolf removal data to test the hypothesis that reducing moose populations to a historical abundance target by hunting leads to fewer wolves killed for caribou conservation. After controlling for habitat quality, wolves removed per km(2) was 3.2 times lower in areas with reduced moose density (x<overline> = 1.55 wolves/1,000 km(2) +/- 0.33 [SE]) than in those without reduced moose density (x<overline> = 5.02 wolves/1,000 km(2) +/- 0.52). However, the average number of wolves removed per year decreased under both conditions. After 9 years, there was a 35% reduction in the predicted difference in the annual removal between areas with and without moose reduction. Our results suggest that policies that do not reduce or stabilize moose abundance will result in the removal of more wolves to increase caribou abundance. Like wolf reductions, moose reductions can also be controversial and affect local harvesters. Thus, understanding the consequences of actions that support caribou recovery is essential to supporting evidence-based policy discussions.

AB  - Fire and herbivory are important natural disturbances in grassy biomes. Both drivers are likely to influence belowground microbial communities but no studies have unravelled the long-term impact of both fire and herbivory on bacterial and fungal communities. We hypothesized that soil bacterial communities change through disturbance-induced shifts in soil properties (e.g. pH, nutrients) while soil fungal communities change through vegetation modification (biomass and species composition). To test these ideas, we characterised soil physicochemical properties (pH, acidity, C, N, P and exchangeable cations content, texture, bulk density, moisture), plant species richness and biomass, microbial biomass and bacterial and fungal community composition and diversity (using 16S and ITS rRNA amplicon sequencing, respectively) in six long-term (18 to 70 years) ecological research sites in South African savanna and grassland ecosystems. We found that fire and herbivory regimes profoundly modified soil physico-chemical properties, plant species richness and standing biomass. In all sites, an increase in woody biomass (ranging from 12 to 50%) was observed when natural disturbances were excluded. The intensity and direction of changes in soil properties were highly dependent on the topo-pedo-climatic context. Overall, fire and herbivory shaped bacterial and fungal communities through distinct driving forces: edaphic properties (including Mg, pH, Ca) for bacteria, and vegetation (herbaceous biomass and woody cover) for fungi. Fire and herbivory explained on average 7.5 and 9.8% of the fungal community variability, respectively, compared to 6.0 and 5.6% for bacteria. The relatively small changes in microbial communities due to natural disturbance is in stark contrast to dramatic vegetation and edaphic changes and suggests that soil microbial communities, having evolved with disturbance, are resistant to change. This represents both a buffer to short-term anthropogenicinduced changes and a restoration challenge in the face of long-term changes.

AB  - Subsistence hunting, or "country food," on traditional territories is essential for numerous Indigenous Peoples who face food insecurity. For many First Nations of Canada, subsistence hunting is also inextricably linked to traditional conservation practices, as hunting is an important way of engaging with nature. In Canada's boreal forest, large game such as moose (Alces alces) is a primary source of protein. However, resource extraction-including forestry and oil and gas-has shifted large game distributions and affected the availability and abundance of food resources. Here, the Indigenous authors designed the study and processed remote camera trap data, then sought out Western scientists to generate generalized linear models to evaluate moose habitat use and spatial-numerical responses to possible stressors in north-central Alberta, including fire, harvest, oil and gas extraction, and other disturbances. Together, through the coproduction of knowledge, we examined the effects of human-caused stressors on moose habitat use by sex and age class. The proportion of various land cover types and human land use for resource extraction was important in moose habitat use. Notably, male, female, and young moose all used habitat differently and at different spatial scales. However, young moose (with their mothers) strongly selected natural forest disturbances such as burned areas but avoided human-created disturbances such as petroleum exploration "seismic" lines. Female moose with young attempts to maximize forage opportunities do not use human-disturbed forests in the same ways they use naturally disturbed areas. Our findings, in the context of Indigenous interpretation from remote cameras and community insights, have linked human disturbance to declines in moose densities and displacement from traditional hunting grounds. Evaluating and predicting shifts in large game distributions is critical to supporting Indigenous food security and sovereignty and identifying where industries operating on First Nations lands can better engage responsibly with First Nations.

AB  - Forest fires in the southern Rocky Mountains are changing due to climate warming and increased fuel loads. Landscape-scale stand-replacement fires create extensive treeless swaths without regenerative seed sources, leading to long-term conversion of coniferous forest to montane meadows and chaparral. Small mammal wildlife responds to these abrupt habitat changes, influencing post-fire succession via trophic interactions (herbivory, granivory, insectivory, and fungivory) and soil disturbance (burrowing, foraging, and seed caching). We examined the effects of the 2011 high-severity Las Conchas wildfire on post-fire small mammal and vegetation successional changes in northern New Mexico's mixed conifer and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. We sampled forest stand composition and herbaceous vegetation immediately after the fire, then sampled herbaceous vegetation and small mammals each spring and autumn for 3 years (2012-2014) on replicated burned and unburned stands. We recorded 15 small mammal species (11 rodents, one rabbit, and three shrews). Herbaceous vegetation cover increased from 10% to 12% on burned sites in 2011 to 91% in 2014, with no observed conifer regeneration. Small mammals exhibited lower species richness on burned mixed conifer sites than on unburned sites, but species richness was only slightly lower on burned ponderosa pine sites than on unburned sites. Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) abundances were comparable between burned and unburned sites, but two species of chipmunks (Neotamias minimus, Neotamias quadrivitattus), woodrats (Neotoma spp.), red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), three species of shrews (Sorex spp.), and mountain cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus nuttallii) were rare or absent in burned forests. Golden-mantled ground squirrels (Callospermophilus lateralis) were more abundant on burned mixed conifer sites than on unburned sites, and voles (Microtus) colonized the burned sites within 3 years (Microtus montanus in 2013, Microtus longicaudus in 2014). Rodent demographic data indicated that mixed sex and age classes were present for the more abundant species, including reproductively active adult females; the exception was M. longicaudus in burned ponderosa pine forests, which had only male adults and subadults. Vole colonization occurred after burned sites attained 80%-90% herbaceous cover. Given the lack of conifer regeneration, we anticipate that the small mammal community will retain its composition of meadow-grassland species for the foreseeable future.

AB  - Changes in ecosystems resulting from anthropause caused by Covid-19 relate to both abiotic and biotic factors which have both a positive or negative effect on wildlife. The lockdown was manifested by reduced air and water pollution, lower mortality of animals on the roads, an increase in animals' body condition and reproduction success. On the other hand, the closures lead to an increase in the populations of invasive species or poaching. We studied the behavioural reaction of natural, desert-dwelling Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana) on the appearance of a new element in the environment - the facial-masks. We hypothesized that the mask would trigger a response expressed through differences in the vigilance towards a potentially new threat. We applied the flight initiation distance (FID) technique to check the reaction at the approach of a human with a facial-mask and without it. The average FID was 8.8 m and was longer when the observer was wearing a mask (10.7 m) as compared to trials without the mask (6.9 m). Our study indicates that wildlife, even if habituated to human silhouette at a distance, appear to notice unusual accessories when up-close and respond by increased vigilance and what may affect their overall fitness.

AB  - Conservation is increasingly focused on preventing losses in species' populations before they occur. Tracking changes in demographic parameters that can impact a population's resilience in response to drivers of global change can support early conservation efforts. We assessed trends in population productivity (late summer juveniles per 100 females) relative to drivers of global change in 40 pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) herds across sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe in Wyoming. Pronghorn are an iconic rangeland species that have been exposed to increasing levels of anthropogenic, climatic, and land -use change. Using data collected across the state of Wyoming, we (1) assessed long-term trends in population productivity, (2) identified patterns in large-scale drivers of global change (i.e., climate, land cover change) across pronghorn habitat, and (3) determined the relationship between drivers of global change and population productivity over a 35 -year (1984-2019) period. While Wyoming hosts some of the most abundant populations of pronghorn in North America that have been largely stable in recent years, we found many herds are experiencing long-term declines in productivity. Long-term declines in productivity were associated with increases in oil and gas development and woody encroachment. Although increasing across almost all herd units, woody vegetation cover remains at low levels, suggesting that pre-emptive management may help to prevent losses in pronghorn populations.

AB  - Previous attempts to address the presence of interspecific competition between domestic livestock and wild ungulates have focused largely on habitat or dietary overlaps. Although overlaps in habitat or diet create opportunities for competition to occur between species, competition only results from such overlap if it affects one or both species negatively. Less attention has been afforded to possible behavioural modifications induced in wildlife by competition with domestic livestock. Here, we investigated the effects of the presence of livestock on feeding behaviour of guanaco (Lama guanicoe) in southern Patagonia, using focal sampling of individuals during foraging bouts, with instantaneous scan samples to estimate group behavioural budgets. We recorded guanaco bite and step rates, used as proxies of foraging intake and selectivity, from four different study sites over eight consecutive seasons. We also estimated sheep and guanaco densities per site, along with vegetation biomass availability. As in other ungulates, bite rates of guanaco appear to be highly flexible and generally increased with vegetation biomass availability. However, as sheep densities and thus additional grazing pressure increased, guanaco foraging strategy compensated by increasing bite rates when foraging vegetation was scarce, indicating further likelihood of competition. Additionally, scan samples indicated that the probability of guanaco feeding occurring at any one time was higher in areas shared with domestic sheep compared to national parks, suggesting guanaco have to focus more on feeding than other behaviours when sheep are present.

AB  - Bats provide important pest suppression services with economic value to cocoa farmers, yet the impact of cocoa farm management on bat diversity metrics is still poorly understood. This is especially important if we consider that Afrotropical cocoa farms supply 68 % of the world's chocolate market, with expected increases in production in the forthcoming decades. In this study, we investigated for the first time how bat abundance, richness and diversity varied between African cocoa farms with different levels of shade tree cover, shade tree communities and cocoa characteristics. We found that shade tree cover and shade tree height were the main drivers associated with an increase of Shannon diversity, and abundance and richness of insectivores. Frugivorous and nectarivorous bats were positively associated with the presence of planted shade trees, but richness varied with the size of shade trees. The insectivorous Hipposideros fuliginosus was only present in high shade farms, being captured 51 times only in this shade system, while the frugivorous Myonycteris angolensis was associated with low shade farms. Our findings show that indeed not all farms are created equal, with high shade farms with large, tall forest shade trees (i.e., containing key plant resources) having richer bat communities. Therefore, policymakers seeking to conserve wildlife within cocoa farming systems should adopt cocoa management systems like those mentioned above and promote a combination of forest and planted shade trees to be able support a rich community of insectivorous, frugivorous and nectarivorous bats and maintain their associated ecosystems services.

AB  - Non-native earthworms can alter ecosystems by modifying soil structure, depredating seeds and seedlings, and consuming soil organic matter, yet the initial responses of plant communities to earthworm invasions remain poorly understood. We assessed the effect of non-native earthworms on seedling survival during germination and after establishment using six native and six non-native plant species grown from seed in single- and multi-species experimental mesocosms. We examined the extent to which earthworms (1) influenced seedling survival, (2) selectively depredated native versus non-native plants, (3) impacted establishment based on seed size and/or root morphology, and (4) shaped community assembly. The effect of earthworms on seedling survival varied temporally and among species but inconsistently with respect to species origin. Differences in seed/seedling survival translated to changes in community assembly. Earthworms tended to reduce species abundance, richness, evenness, and diversity in multi-species mesocosms and led to the divergence of communities by treatment. In general, species with large seeds and fibrous roots dominated communities with earthworms present, whereas species with small seeds and taproots only persisted in multi-species mesocosms without earthworms. Our findings suggest that earthworms act as ecological filters in the early stages of invasion to shape community composition based on plant morphological traits.

AB  - Questions: Oceanic islands are global hotspots of endemism and evolutionary radiations but many have been severely degraded by human activities and biological invasions. We evaluated the pace and direction of the natural recovery of ecosystems over 77 years across a subtropical oceanic archipelago including islands of various size, elevation, histories of human settlement and deforestation, and invasions by non-native plants and mammals. This information is essential to guide the ecological restoration of the archipelago. Location: Forest vegetation on nine of the Ogasawara Islands in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. Methods: We first digitized historical vegetation data of the Ogasawara Islands collected during field surveys in 1935. Then, after checking their species compositions, we integrated past and present plant community types. Finally, we identified the landscape-scale changes in forest vegetation by comparing vegetation maps from 1935, 1979 and 2012. Results: Over 77 years, the vegetation trajectories of each island varied depending on the introduction of invasive alien species and the remaining proportion of native forest, the latter of which had a strong influence on the recoverability of native forest. Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of the history of invasive species introductions and the remaining proportion of native forest-both of which reflect the intensity of anthropogenic disturbance-in determining the degree of human intervention needed for restoration on oceanic islands.

AB  - Pinus spp. ( pine) forests are common throughout the southeastern US, and many of these forests are managed to improve habitat for Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) and Meleagris gallopavo (Wild Turkey). Previous studies have investigated the influence of forest management on deer and turkey habitat, but several aspects of understory vegetation response to management are not well understood. We measured understory composition and structure, overstory basal area, and deer-forage availability at 8 sites in summer 2020. Previous history of dormant-season fire increased grass and decreased vine coverage, but forb and understory tree coverage were not influenced. Vegetation providing visual obstruction for turkey nesting and deer fawning was correlated with increased coverage of semiwoody and woody plants. Forb coverage averaged 14% and was positively correlated with deer nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) using a 14% protein constraint. Conversely, NCC with a 6% protein constraint correlated with shrub and vine coverage. Sunlight available to the understory was most strongly influenced by hardwood overstory and midstory trees. Our results indicate that understory composition strongly influences forage and cover and that pine stands that are not intensively managed generally provided limited resources for deer and turkeys.

AB  - In Argentina, the expansion of soybean production has forced the relocation of cattle to marginal sites for agriculture, such as the wetlands of the Parana River floodplain, constituting a threat to the vegetation of these ecosystems. In this context, the aims of this study were (1) to assess the effect of different resting/grazing periods on the composition, richness, diversity and dominance of functional groups of wetlands vegetation assemblages and (2) to analyze the influence of cattle exclusion on these parameters. For these purposes, three wetlands subjected to rotational grazing management included in different paddocks with different resting and grazing periods were selected. Exclosures were established in upland and lowland zones. Samples of vegetation cover were collected in these zones with quadrats of 4m(2). Our results demonstrated that vegetation parameters did not differ as grazing and resting time period differed. Both the wetland with short resting/long grazing period as well as the wetland with long resting/short grazing period had lower diversity and richness in comparison with the wetland without cattle grazing. Grazing exclusion favoured the survival of species in upland zones, increasing total richness and diversity and the development of unpalatable non-forage and shrub/subshrub species. Exclosures would be beneficial to the ecological condition of the vegetation of the wetlands, allowing grazing-sensitive species to recover from grazing and trampling.

AB  - Alpine ecosystems harbor remarkably diverse and distinct plant communities that are characteristically limited to harsh, and cold climatic conditions. As a result of thermal limitation to species occurrence, mountainous ecosystems are considered to be particularly sensitive to climate change. Our understanding of the impact of climate change is mainly based on vascular plants however, whereas cryptogams (i.e., lichens and bryophytes) are generally neglected or simply considered as one functional group. Here we aimed to improve our understanding of the drivers underlying temporal changes in vegetation of alpine ecosystems. To this end, we repeatedly surveyed the vegetation on four mountain summits along an elevational gradient in northern Sweden spanning a 19-year period. Our results show that the vascular plant communities remained relatively stable throughout the study period, despite fluctuations in terms of ground cover and species richness of shrubs and graminoids. In contrast, both lichens and bryophytes substantially decreased in cover and diversity, leading to alterations in community composition that were unrelated to vascular plant cover. Thermophilization of the vascular plant community was found only on the two intermediate summits. Our findings are only partially consistent with (long-term) climate-change impacts, and we argue that local non-climatic drivers such as herbivory might offset vegetation responses to warming. Hence, we underline the importance of considering local non-climatic drivers when evaluating temporal vegetation change in biologically complex systems.

AB  - Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems is a serious global issue. Stream nitrate concentrations at the University of Tokyo Chichibu Forest have increased since 2000 after the opening of the new highway in 1998. Nitrogen oxide emissions from automobile exhausts were the most likely source of increased nitrate input in the forest ecosystem. Around the area, the sika deer Cervus nippon Temminck population has greatly increased since around 2000 and intensively browsed the understory vegetation. We hypothesized that the degradation of the understory vegetation caused by the deer overpopulation was one of the causes of increased nitrate output. Monthly observations were carried out from April to October 2013 to investigate the understory vegetation at the heights of 0-30 and 100-150 cm above the ground inside (without deer) and outside (with deer) of a deer exclusion fence. Plant taxa and % coverage of each taxon at each layer were recorded. The in vivo nitrate reductase activity (NRA) (approximate to nitrate assimilation rate) was determined for each plant taxa each month. Compared to inside the fence, the understory vegetation outside was poor with smaller % coverage and less diverse community structure, and was occupied by unpalatable plant taxa that were uncommon or absent inside the fence. Contrary to our expectation, the phylogenetic diversity of the community assemblage outside the fence showed greater evenness (less clustering) than inside. The NRA peaked in early in the season or late in the season. In contrast to a previous report, no significant difference in the NRA was found between woody and herbaceous plants. Although the difference was no more than that of vegetation coverage, the estimated community-level NRA inside the fence was 5.6 times higher than that of the outside. The difference was greatest early in the season. These results support our hypothesis.

AB  - Aim Biodiversity drives the delivery of multiple ecosystem functions related to carbon and nutrient cycling (ecosystem multifunctionality, EMF), and biodiversity and ecosystem functioning are strongly threatened by intensive grazing in grasslands. However, it remains unclear how biodiversity regulates EMF changes in response to intensive grazing. Location Global. Time period From 1992 to 2018. Major taxa studied Grassland. Methods Here, we conducted a global synthesis using 373 paired observations from 90 published studies to address the responses of plant diversity, EMF and their relationships to grazing disturbance depending on grazing intensity, livestock type, grazing duration, and climatic aridity. Results Our results showed that EMF significantly decreased with increasing grazing intensity, but the negative EMF response was alleviated at high levels of plant diversity. The grazing-induced changes in EMF increased linearly with the changes in plant diversity, with the slopes increasing by 78.9% from light to heavy grazing. In addition, the grazing-induced decrease of EMF was stronger with longer grazing duration and more arid climates. Structural equation models suggested that grazing intensity reduced EMF largely via decreasing plant diversity, whereas upsizing livestock type promoted EMF by increasing plant diversity. Main conclusions This study highlights the key role of biodiversity in mediating EMF in response to intensifying grazing disturbance. We call for conservation of biodiversity to maintain grassland multifunctionality and services.

AB  - Although the diversity (-35 species) and worldwide distribution of goats (Ruminantia, Bovidae, Caprinae) are significant, studies on the diversity of symbiont ciliates in these mammals are scarce in comparison to other ruminants. The present work is a review and checklist of species based on taxonomic, morphologic, and ecologic studies of rumen ciliate protozoa in goats, presenting geographic distribution and hosts, as well as estimating the macroevolutionary relationships of the species observed in the studies. To that end, all of the available literature on databases was reviewed, the schematic drawings were made based on information present in the original description of the taxa, and the phylogenetic relationships were inferred based on Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses. According to our review, 72 species and 14 genera of ciliates have been associated with goats. Through the analysis of the association between ciliate genera and caprine hosts, it was shown that ciliates are more associated with domestic animals (Capra hircus-14 genera) than wild ones (Rupicapra rupicapra-six genera, Capra ibex-one genus, Capra pyrenaica-one genus). Thirteen countries were identified in the distribution map as having had reports of ciliate species associated with goats. The interaction networks of ciliates and their hosts showed that the species of ciliates associated with goats also occur in other herbivore mammal species. The recovered phylogenetic hypotheses show that the ciliate species in goats form a non-monophyletic group with maximum and minimum ages of similar to 8.2My and similar to 2.4My. We have also found that a large portion of the studies on the diversity of ciliates in goats does not employ all necessary techniques in an integrative way, despite it being essential for detailed descriptions and better knowledge of this fraction of biodiversity.

AB  - Understanding interactions between wild ungulates and livestock is critical for the conservation and management of rangelands. Sympatric animals use a diversity of strategies such as differential use of space or time to avoid interspecific interactions, especially competition and conflict. This study investigated the seasonal (summer and winter) spatial and temporal interaction of three wild ungulates; Tibetan argali, kiang, and blue sheep with livestock (sheep and goat) using camera trap data collected between 2020 and 2022 in different seasons (14,340 camera trap days and 234 locations). Blue sheep and livestock show the highest level of temporal overlap in summer and winter as both are diurnal irrespective of the season. The highest spatial overlap is observed between kiang and livestock in summer and winter. In the summer, kiang shows multiple activity peaks throughout the day as well as night i.e. cathemeral activity, possibly a strategy to avoid competition with livestock by using the same space actively and repetitively but for shorter periods. This allows them to access forage and water as needed. A significant avoidance of livestock by argali in terms of space use was observed. Based on our analysis, we argue that avoidance behavior by argali is a survival strategy in response to anthropogenic pressure and hunting in the past. The spatio-temporal coordination at a finer scale facilitates coexistence in our study area, which allows ungulates and livestock to exploit resources more effectively in the study area. The findings of this multi-scale spatio-temporal analysis provide insights into habitat preferences of wild ungulates and livestock and species-specific behaviour to avoid competition. These insights are critical to develop robust strategies and policies to conserve biodiversity while also supporting the livelihood of local communities in a multi-use landscape.

AB  - Endemic to India and Nepal, the swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii) is crucial for restoring and sustaining populations of top predators like tigers. Despite recent signs of species recovery in protected areas, the species remains vulnerable to extinction due to increasing anthropogenic activities. Information on factors influencing the occurrence of swamp deer is essential to formulate suitable management plans that can help to maintain their viable population and protect their habitats. We recorded swamp deer presence via direct sightings and indirect signs (pellets and footprints) through line transect surveys. Two ecological drivers i.e., habitat variables and disturbance variables that included eleven predictor variables were measured in the field where swamp deer was present ("used plots") and absent ("habitat availability plot"). Binary logistic regression was used to analyze the factors associated with the probability of detecting the swamp deer. The model's outcomes showed that an increase in road/path/fireline distance and settlement distance, mixed forest habitat, and depth of leaf litter were positively correlated with the probability of locating swamp deer, while the other significant predictor variables (canopy cover, distance from water source, and presence of predator) had inverse relationships. In summary, our study has provided crucial insights into the factors influencing the presence of swamp deer in their habitat. These findings are useful for local governments and protected area authorities by providing fine-scale field-based scientific information, that can benefit swamp deer and its habitat. We also recommend similar studies in species range locations considering other influencing factors such as season, climate, interaction with other herbivore species, and predators that might affect the habitat use of swamp deer.

AB  - Since ecological systems often experience multiple disturbances, understanding changes in important ecological interactions, such as plant-herbivore interactions, may require studies capable of disentangling the unique and interactive effects of multiple forms of disturbance. For example, understanding how mammalian herbivores affect plant communities may require understanding how widespread past disturbances, such as agricultural land use, interact with contemporary disturbances, such as prescribed fire. We tested if past agricultural land use and contemporary fire regime modified the effects of mammalian herbivory on focal plant communities by measuring the richness of plant species preferred by deer at 26 longleaf pine woodlands containing paired open and largemammal exclusion plots. Land-use history significantly affected the community composition of deer-preferred species, and focal species were 8.19 times more likely to be present in post-agricultural sites than nonagricultural sites. Large-mammal herbivory only affected plant species richness in woodlands with low fire frequencies wherein focal species were on average 2.23 times more likely to be present in exclusion plots than open plots. These results suggest that past and present disturbances can mediate contemporary plant-animal interactions and may explain spatial patterns in the intensity of large-mammal herbivory. Our findings also suggest that common management practices, such as use of prescribed burns, may indirectly promote plant species richness by reducing deer herbivory.

AB  - The Pleistocene -Holocene transition reveals a short and abrupt climatic sequence from the warming conditions of the Greenland Interstadial-1 (GI -1), followed by the Greenland stadial-1 (GS -1) cooling and the continuous warming during the Greenlandian Stage, which flourished new ecological habitats, and therefore, demography and cultural dynamics among hunter -gatherers. Particularly at extreme latitudes and altitudes, these changes had a significant impact on human habitats like in the Southeastern Italian Alps. This region was continuously inhabited during this chronological span, even during the harshest periods, the Late Epigravettian at the late Pleistocene, followed by Sauveterrian groups during the Early Holocene. Stable isotope analyses of ibex (Capra ibex) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) were carried out on bones with evidence of human manipulation from four mid -mountain archaeological sites in Italy (Dalmeri, Cogola, Cornafessa shelters, Ernesto cave). Results show that animals changed their niches to adapt to the ecological changes, almost always maintaining a separation of ecological niches. Combining the results with other environmental proxies, we reconstruct the animal habitats, and sharpen the ultimate understanding of how this geological transition impacted on the environment humans had to face. Hence, at the end of GI -1, ibex was grazing in an ecological niche characterised by open and wet conditions. In the dryer GS -1, red deer also experienced cold conditions, as ibex, while late Epigravettians were exploiting diverse habitats to cope with severe climatic conditions. After the beginning of the Greenlandian, warming and moisture caused a visible change in ibex and red deer habitats. Unlike Epigravettians, Sauveterrians who inhabited the mid -mountain of Trentino exploited a more restricted ecological range because of an ameliorated condition.

AB  - 1. Plant diversity has been found to increase herbivore diversity, including abundance, species richness and phylogenetic diversity. However, it is yet to be established at which spatial scale these effects are strongest, because host finding and community assembly may be shaped by host diversity both in local habitat patches and at larger scales. 2. Using arthropod herbivore data collected from a large biodiversity and ecosystem function experiment in China (BEF-China), we analysed how habitat patch (individual study plots) and larger-scale (surrounding study plots) tree diversity relates to species richness, abundance, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity of herbivore assemblages on focal plants. 3. Tree diversity of both the focal habitat patch and larger-scale patch neighbourhood affected herbivore diversity patterns and host plant selection, with the effect being greater for the former. Furthermore, focal and neighbouring trees that are phylogenetically related were found more likely to share similar herbivores. 4. Synthesis. By focusing on tree diversity effects of both the local habitat patch and wider patch neighbourhoods, our findings highlight the importance of considering additional scales to give a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying herbivore community structure and diversity patterns in species-rich forests.

AB  - Biodiversity underpins grassland ecological functions and productive capacities. By studying the mechanisms for the maintenance of species diversity in animal communities, we can provide important theoretical guidance for the optimization of grazing management and biodiversity protection. The typical grassland of Xilingol in Inner Mongolia, China, was used as the experimental area, and a grazing intensity experiment was set up. This consisted of four gradient levels that were grazed by sheep, which were available for continuous monitoring, namely control standard sheep unit center dot day center dot hectare-1 center dot year-1 (CK, 0 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2y-1), light grazing (LG, 170 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2 center dot y-1), moderate grazing (MG, 340 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2 center dot y-1), and high grazing (HG, 510 SSU center dot d center dot hm-2 center dot y-1). Nine consecutive years of multi-indicator monitoring of vegetation was carried out from 2014-2022, using monitoring data coupled with time series and inter-annual climatic (relative moisture index, RMI) fluctuations. This was done to analyze the impacts of disturbances, such as grazing use and climatic fluctuations, on the diversity of species and above-ground productivity of the community, thereby exploring the relationship between diversity and productivity, and provide possible explanations for the emergence of a range of ecological responses. The statistical analysis methods used were One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), general linear regression and mixed-effects models. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) The grassland in the experimental area under CK had the highest diversity and productivity and the ecosystem was better able to buffer the negative impacts of climatic drought. Furthermore, the effect of climate on productivity and diversity weakened as the intensity of grazing increased. (2) LG to MG had a constant diversity. (3) Grazing utilization changed the relationship between community species diversity and aboveground productivity by releasing spatial community resources, altering the structure of plant communities, weakening competitive exclusion, and strengthening complementary effects. However, under all of the conditions there is a brief stage in the time series when diversity is stimulated to increase, and the higher the grazing intensity, the earlier this occurs.

AB  - Context Large-scale natural disturbances are crucial drivers of ecosystem function and composition for many forested ecosystems. In the last century, the prevalence of anthropogenic disturbances has increased across Canada's boreal forest. Habitat disturbance from timber harvest and wildfire is linked to declines of boreal species, including woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Objectives We tested how disturbances influenced the recovery trajectory of ecological indicators of timber, biodiversity, and wildlife habitat through time following timber harvest and wildfire across the boreal forest of Alberta, Canada. MethodsDuring 2021 and 2022, we collected field data from 251 timber harvested and 264 burned stands (0-40 years since disturbance), as well as 256 older forest stands used by caribou (> 40 years since disturbance). Field data included metrics of stand attributes (e.g., basal area, stems per hectare), coarse woody debris (CWD), and abundance of forage for caribou, moose (Alces americanus), and bears (black bear: Ursus americanus, grizzly bear: Ursus arctos). Results Basal area of trees and stems per hectare recovered more quickly in timber harvest sites when compared to wildfire sites, but as time since disturbance increased there were no differences in these attributes among timber harvest, wildfire, and caribou use sites. CWD was greatest in recently burned sites, but declined over time to be similar in quantity as in harvested stands and older forest stands. Terrestrial lichens, important forage for caribou, were most abundant in the older caribou use sites, whereas forage for moose and bears, including shrubs, was most abundant in younger timber harvest and wildfire sites. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that timber harvesting may result in a quicker development of timber volume when compared to wildfire. However, this anthropogenic disturbance is less advantageous for the development of caribou habitat.

AB  - Climate warming is severely affecting high-latitude regions. In the Arctic tundra, it may lead to enhanced soil nutrient availability and interact with simultaneous changes in grazing pressure. It is presently unknown how these concurrently occurring global change drivers affect the root-associated fungal communities, particularly mycorrhizal fungi, and whether changes coincide with shifts in plant mycorrhizal types. We investigated changes in root-associated fungal communities and mycorrhizal types of the plant community in a 10-yr factorial experiment with warming, fertilisation and grazing exclusion in a Finnish tundra grassland. The strongest determinant of the root-associated fungal community was fertilisation, which consistently increased potential plant pathogen abundance and had contrasting effects on the different mycorrhizal fungal types, contingent on other treatments. Plant mycorrhizal types went through pronounced shifts, with warming favouring ecto- and ericoid mycorrhiza but not under fertilisation and grazing exclusion. Combination of all treatments resulted in dominance by arbuscular mycorrhizal plants. However, shifts in plant mycorrhizal types vs fungi were mostly but not always aligned in their magnitude and direction. Our results show that our ability to predict shifts in symbiotic and antagonistic fungal communities depend on simultaneous consideration of multiple global change factors that jointly alter plant and fungal communities.

AB  - Experimental results from a multi-year exclosure study (2009-2015) demonstrate strong effects of geese on plant cover and species diversity in an urban, restored tidal freshwater wetland. Access by geese inhibited plant establishment and suppressed plant diversity, particularly of annual plant species. Our experimental results demonstrate that the protection of newly restored tidal freshwater wetlands from geese is a make-or-break management activity that will determine the composition and long-term persistence of vegetation at the site. The causal herbivore, in this case, was resident, non-migratory Canada geese (Branta canadensis), which have increased dramatically over the last several decades and had high population densities throughout the study period. These findings suggest that management activities to reduce the population sizes of non-migratory goose populations will support greater wetland plant diversity.

AB  - In northern hardwood forests, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) impact both tree regeneration and groundlayer composition, leading to a dominance of American beech (Fagus grandifolia), an unpalatable species, as well as a reduction of preferred groundlayer species. Deer become especially problematic in areas with beech bark disease, such as at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. We analyzed datasets from Sleeping Bear Dunes, collected in 2009 and 2018, to assess vegetation change in three management units: a mainland unit with a long history of deer occupancy, and two islands, one with high deer pressure and one with no known history of permanent deer presence. For each unit, we tested for change in species richness and mean coefficient of conservatism. We also examined the groundlayer, testing for change in indices of abundance and size of preferred and avoided species. Finally, we compared regeneration of palatable and unpalatable tree species. We found increased nonnative species richness, decreased number and abundance of preferred herbaceous species, as well as decreased height of a preferred species. We also detected increased sapling density of beech while that of palatable species declined. Our data provide further evidence of the impacts of white-tailed deer on the forest understory. Management goals should focus on maintaining deer densities at or below 5 deer km(-2) in order to promote growth of the full suite of herbaceous species typical of the region and habitat and to allow adequate regeneration of the overstory.

AB  - Multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora [MPR]) is an invasive, nonnative plant that has invaded many temperate forests across the eastern United States, often outcompeting native plants for sunlight and other resources. Herbicides can control MFR, but they can also reduce nontarget plant species and threaten aquatic ecosystems. In a black cherry-red maple forest in the Erie National Wildlife Refuge in Pennsylvania, the US Fish and Wildlife Service introduced prescribed goat-browsing as an exploratory control method. In four treatments, browsed, browsed/herbicide, cut/herbicide, and an unmanaged reference, we evaluated preliminary effects of these treatments on MFR and non-MFR herbaceous vegetation. For MFR, the browsed treatment had 56% lower leaf/stem mass ratios and 35% shorter stem lengths than the reference; the leaf/stem ratio in the cut/herbicide treatment was 55% lower than the reference. Stem density was not reduced because goats did not kill the MFR plants in this first year of treatment. The herbicide treatment had fewer non-MFR plants than the reference treatment. Light levels at ground level did not differ among the treatments. Overall, 33% of trees in the browsed treatment were affected by the goats, with 9% being completely girdled; red maple and ironwood were the most commonly browsed species. Preliminary results suggest that goats can be an effective control for MFR, however long-term success will be best evaluated after consecutive treatment seasons. Goats may increase tree mortality and shift tree species composition in stands dominated by trees with high browsing rates, but effects on diverse stands may be less pronounced.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of animal population decline is a key focus of conservation biologists. Anthropogenic activities such as hunting have long been established as potentially detrimental to a population's persistence. However, environmental perturbations such as increased temperature variability, exacerbated by climate change, can also have important effects on animal populations. Animals can respond to these challenges by adjusting both their behavior and physiology. We measured fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) of common impala (Aepyceros melampus) and greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), both currently in stable populations, to examine effects of hunting, forage availability, daily variability in temperature and group size on their physiological stress response. The study was conducted across two adjacent protected areas, (i) one non-hunted area (Ruaha National Park; RNP) and (ii) one area used for trophy hunting (Rungwa Game Reserve; RGR). Both impala and kudu had significantly higher FGM levels in the area that allows hunting, while FGM levels decreased with increasing forage availability and increasing daily temperature. Moreover, impala (but not kudu) had lower FGM levels with larger group sizes. Our results indicate that the management regime can significantly alter the physiological state of wild ungulate populations. We also highlight the importance of considering the combined effects of anthropogenic, environmental and social contexts when studying the stress response of wild populations. Our results emphasize the value of protected areas and continued monitoring of hunting quota in order to maintain ungulate populations that are less vulnerable to population declines.

AB  - Arthropods serve as complex linkages between plants and higher-level predators in Arctic ecosystems and provide key ecosystem services such as pollination and nutrient cycling. Arctic plant communities are changing as tall woody shrubs expand onto tundra, but potential effects on arthropod abundance and food web structure remain unclear. Changes in vegetation structure can alter the physical habitat, thermal environment, and food available to arthropods, thereby having the potential to induce cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. We evaluated relationships between the abundance, biomass, and community composition of arthropods and the cover of several shrub taxa across tundra-shrub gradients in northwestern Alaska. While previous research had found a general positive association between arthropod biomass and shrub cover, we found heterogeneity in this relationship with finer-scale examination of (1) shrub taxa, (2) arthropod taxa, and (3) arthropod guilds. Abundance and biomass of arthropods showed strong, positive associations with the amount of cover of willow (Salix spp.) but were not significantly influenced by shrub birch (Betula spp.) or ericaceous (Ericaceae) vegetation. Significant shifts in arthropod community composition were also associated with willows. Among trophic groups of arthropods, herbivores and pollinators were most positively associated with willow cover. Due to geographical variation in both dominant shrub taxa and their rates of expansion, effects on arthropod communities are likely to be heterogeneous across the Arctic. Taken together, our results suggest that shrub expansion could increase food availability for higher-level insectivores and shift Arctic food web structure.

AB  - Introduction Small herbivores are important biological factors affecting plant productivity and species richness in the grassland ecosystem of the Tibetan Plateau. However, the response of different grassland types to the disturbance of the "endemic species" plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) remains unclear.Methods In this study, two representative grassland types, alpine meadow and alpine steppe, were taken as research objects to compare the effects of pika disturbance on vegetation structure and function indicators, and to explore the disturbance response threshold of these ecosystems.Results The results showed that the alpine steppe was more sensitive to pika disturbance, with significant decreases in biomass, vegetation height, and coverage even at low disturbance levels. In contrast, alpine meadows exhibited greater resilience, maintaining higher productivity and species diversity under moderate disturbance conditions. Notably, the functional index of alpine meadow peaked under moderate disturbance, while alpine steppe rapidly transitioned to a degraded state. These differences highlight the varying disturbance thresholds between the two grassland types.Discussion This study highlights the vulnerability of alpine grassland ecosystems to pika disturbance and provides a strong scientific basis for designing effective grassland management and ecological restoration strategies.

AB  - Herbivory by barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) alters the vegetation cover and reduces ecosystem productivity in high-Arctic peatlands, limiting the carbon sink strength of these ecosystems. Here we investigate how herbivory-induced vegetation changes affect the activities of peat soil microbiota using metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and targeted metabolomics in a comparison of fenced exclosures and nearby grazed sites. Our results show that a different vegetation with a high proportion of vascular plants developed due to reduced herbivory, resulting in a larger and more diverse input of polysaccharides to the soil at exclosed study sites. This coincided with higher sugar and amino acid concentrations in the soil at this site as well as the establishment of a more abundant and active microbiota, including saprotrophic fungi with broad substrate ranges, like Helotiales (Ascomycota) and Agaricales (Basidiomycota). A detailed description of fungal transcriptional profiles revealed higher gene expression for cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin and chitin degradation at herbivory-exclosed sites. Furthermore, we observed an increase in the number of genes and transcripts for predatory eukaryotes such as Entomobryomorpha (Arthropoda). We conclude that in the absence of herbivory, the development of a vascular vegetation alters the soil polysaccharide composition and supports larger and more active populations of fungi and predatory eukaryotes.

AB  - Prairie dogs are a keystone species that provide ecosystem services in endangered grasslands in North America. They have been extirpated throughout their range due to sylvatic plague, habitat fragmentation, lethal control, and drought. There are competing drivers of biodiversity between herbivorous rodents and drought in semi-arid grasslands. Therefore, prairie dogs may be unable to provide the ecosystem services needed for grasslands during periods of drought. We sought to determine the impact of prairie dog herbivory on biodiversity in a semi-arid shortgrass prairie by using a paired design to compare active colonies with extirpated colonies. Abundance, richness, and diversity were measured in vegetation, arthropods, herptiles, birds, and small mammals during a drought year and the following year. We found that drought reduced vegetation and bird abundance, vegetation richness and diversity, and diversity in arthropods and birds. We did not find a difference between colonies and extirpated colonies. Our results indicate that the ecosystem services provided by prairie dogs, e.g., improving biodiversity, did not occur at detectable levels during periods of drought in semi-arid grasslands. Given the sharp decline of prairie dogs, the ecosystem services provided by prairie dogs will continue to plummet as climate change increases the frequency of droughts in the Front Range.

AB  - An understanding of how terrestrial mammalian predators use their environment is critical for the development of effective management and monitoring. Mammalian predators often use anthropogenic linear features-such as roads, fencelines, and infrastructure corridors-to increase movement efficiency and prey encounter rates. However, there has been little investigation into how predators use more subtle linear features such as game trails (i.e., well-trodden paths created by megaherbivores). This is despite native and exotic megaherbivores being abundant across many of Earth's most intact landscapes and conservation areas. We investigated how the two largest terrestrial mammalian predators in northern Australian savannas-the dingo (Canis familiaris, introduced ca. 4000 years ago) and cat (Felis catus, introduced ca. 200 years ago)-use game trails created by exotic megaherbivores (Asian water buffalo Bubalus bubalis and horse Equus caballus). We deployed two camera traps at 52 sites, with one camera positioned on a game trail and another in undisturbed vegetation < 60 m away. We compared the activity of predators on game trails to adjacent undisturbed vegetation and explored how trail use varied with vegetation structure and prey activity. Dingoes and cats were 34 times and 6 times more likely to be detected on game trails than in adjacent vegetation, respectively, suggesting these predators preferentially use game trails. We speculate that the extensive network of game trails created by exotic megaherbivores across northern Australia's vast savannas has potentially facilitated terrestrial mammalian predator movement at very large scales. Controlling exotic megaherbivores may, therefore, provide a means of disrupting the activity of dingoes and cats, thereby benefiting predation-susceptible native species. However, further research is needed to understand the ecological implications of game trails in Australian savannas and other habitat types.

AB  - Host species heterogeneity can drive parasite dynamics through variation in host competency as well as host abundance. We explored how elk (Cervus canadensis) with apparent subclinical infestations of winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) may be a cryptic reservoir and drive winter tick dynamics, impacting moose (Alces alces) populations. We found that winter tick infestation loads did not vary remarkably between both host species and winter ticks sourced from elk and moose produced similar numbers of larvae which activated within 5 days of each other. We also found similar larval densities in habitats predominately used by elk, moose, and both host species. Our analysis of 2793 informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed genetic differentiation among tick populations that were only similar to 75 km apart, but fewer differences among ticks from elk or moose in the same locality, suggesting sharing of winter ticks across host species. Despite the clinical signs of high winter tick infestations being most apparent on moose, elk may be critical drivers of winter tick population dynamics and indirectly compete with moose in areas where they outnumber moose populations, a common characteristic of ungulate communities in western North America. Management interventions aimed at addressing winter tick issues on moose may wish to consider the movement patterns and abundance of cryptic reservoirs like elk.

AB  - Riparian ecosystems provide critical habitat for many species, yet assessment of vegetation condition at local scales is difficult to measure when considering large areas over long time periods. We present a framework to map and monitor two deciduous cover types, upland and riparian, occupying a small fraction of an expansive, mountainous landscape in north-central Wyoming. Initially, we developed broad-scale predictions of predominant woody vegetation types by integrating Landsat data into species distribution models and combining subsequent outputs into a synthesis map. Then, we evaluated a 35-year Landsat time series (1985-2019) using the Mann-Kendall test to identify significant trends in the condition of upland and riparian deciduous vegetation and assessed the rate and direction of change using the Theil-Sen estimator. Finally, we used plot level data to assess the utility of the framework to detect bottom-up controls (ungulate browse pressure and management actions) on vegetation condition. The synthesis map had an overall correct classification rate of 87% and field data indicated deciduous vegetation within 45 m of coniferous forest faces increased pressure of conifer expansion. The trend assessment identified consistent patterns operating at the landscape scale across both upland and riparian deciduous vegetation; a predominant greening trend was observed for 12 years followed by a 9-year browning trend, before switching back to a greening trend for the last 13 years of the study. Our results indicate trends are driven by the climate of the measurement period at the landscape scale. Although we did not find conclusive evidence to establish a strong link between browse pressure and satellite data, we highlight examples where prevailing trends can be overridden by local disturbance or management intervention. This framework is transferable to other understudied riparian environments throughout western North America to provide insight on ecohydrological processes and assess global and local stressors across broad spatiotemporal scales.

AB  - Examining multiple niche relationships, such as habitat use and activity patterns, between sympatric species contributes to an understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence and competition. Sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838) and Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus (Temminck, 1836)) often show different habitat use, and diversity in vegetation and topography seems to facilitate their coexistence. Conversely, their habitat use may overlap in areas with low-diversity habitats; however, this remains unstudied. Moreover, whether they spatiotemporally avoid each other to reduce direct interference is unclear. We examined the fine-scale patterns of habitat use and activity of deer and serows in the subalpine forests of Mount Fuji, which have low-diversity habitats, using camera trapping data over 3 years. Deer and serow habitat niches largely overlapped, especially in summer (92%-94%) and autumn (89%-91%), suggesting that low-diversity habitats facilitate overlapping habitat use. Both species selected areas frequently used by the other during spring to autumn and their temporal niches largely overlapped, especially in summer (88%) and autumn (83%), suggesting that they do not spatiotemporally avoid each other (i.e., there is no direct interference). Rapid range expansion of deer into these subalpine habitats may exclude native serows through resource exploitative competition rather than interference competition.

AB  - Rising global temperatures and changing landscape conditions have led to widespread mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks in western North America. Pine beetle management is typically implemented to mitigate economic losses, but its effects on wildlife, particularly ecologically important species like caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and moose (Alces alces), warrant greater attention. We assessed the effects of early-stage pine beetle infestation, timber harvest, and fire on habitat selection by caribou (boreal and central mountain designatable units) and moose in west-central Alberta, Canada. Using global positioning system (GPS) collar data collected 3-5 years after infestation, we developed resource selection functions and functional response models. Caribou exhibited seasonally variable responses, generally avoiding pine beetle-affected areas in winter but selecting them in summer. They also avoided harvested and burned areas, though this avoidance depended on overall disturbance levels within their ranges. Moose displayed sex-specific responses to pine beetle infestations and associated management: females avoided pine beetle-affected areas but selected burned sites year-round, while males showed the opposite pattern. These findings suggest that pine beetle disturbances may negatively affect caribou and female moose winter habitat availability while simultaneously enhancing conditions for male moose. Further research is needed to disentangle the individual and cumulative effects of pine beetle management actions versus general timber harvests and wildfires, as these disturbances may be compounding rather than acting in isolation.

AB  - The temperate Kashmir Himalaya, regardless of its simple representation as a giant temperate forest, exhibits remarkable vegetation dissimilarity being inadequately perceived. We explored the species diversity and taxonomic composition of herbaceous stratum in 147 plots over 36.75 ha of temperate Kashmir Himalayan landscape, describing three heterogeneous forest types, viz., low-level blue pine (BP), mixed-conifer (MC), and subalpine (SA) forests. Regression and constrained ordination (canonical correspondence analysis) analyses are used to quantify the relevance of environmental variables in governing herbaceous species composition and diversity. Landscape-level richness of 245 species ranging from 113 species in BP forest to 173 species in SA forest is documented. Mixed conifer forest manifested maximal species richness and Whittaker-beta score among the forest types. With an aggregate of 42 species, Asteraceae attributed the optimum species richness accompanied by Poaceae (19 spp.), Lamiaceae (16 spp.), and so on, besides 22 monotypic families. Fragaria nubicola proclaims the dominant species, while Trifolium pratens, Pimpinella diversifolia and Impatiens brachycentra represent the most significant indicator species in BP, MC and SA forests. The consequence of elevation gradient on species richness across the landscape proclaims a significant unimodal paradigm (p = 0.005) ascribed to environmental stress at both elevational extremes. Latitude and precipitation proved as influencing ecological gradients underpinning the distribution of species composition in BP forest. However, in MC and SA forests, geographic location and precipitation and elevation and precipitation are highly associated with CCA-1 axis. To optimize biodiversity protection, conservation efforts must take forest scale variations in flora into consideration.

AB  - Rangelands provide ecosystem services that are economically and ecologically critical for humans. Globally, invasion of exotic grasses drives loss of biodiversity and resilience of rangelands. In South Texas, buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris syn. Pennisetum ciliare [L.] Link), a C4 perennial grass, was brought from Africa for range improvement as early as the 1930s. Buffelgrass generally increases forage biomass for livestock yet reduces habitat suitability for wildlife. Interest in controlling buffelgrass has increased due to its negative impacts on iconic wildlife, such as whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus, Zimmermann 1780) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus, Linnaeus 1758). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a targeted grazing strategy that used buffelgrass and plant community phenology as indicators to determine the timing of cattle movement. On two private ranches in different ecoregions, we tracked targeted grazing versus light grazing in native-dominated and buffelgrass-dominated plant communities across variable precipitation through five growing seasons. We measured the effects of grazing type, plant community type, and precipitation on buffelgrass cover, native plant species richness, foliar cover, and Shannon diversity. Targeted grazing had a strong impact on diversity, increasing 0.37 +/- 0.07 from a mean of H =1.29 under the targeted grazing management. Conversely, buffelgrass cover was negatively correlated with Shannon diversity, decreasing it by 0.075 +/- 0.03 for every 10% increase in buffelgrass cover from a mean of H=1.29. Despite a variability in precipitation across seasons and years (93-455 mm), targeted grazing improved species richness and cover of native plants throughout the study. Our findings suggest that targeted grazing shows promise as an adaptive grazing strategy that reduces the impact of buffelgrass across highly variable precipitation. In unpredictable environments, management techniques that improve the resilience of plant communities through preserving biodiversity are critical. (C) 2020 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - The bottom-up effect of producers and the top-down effect of predators are well-known factors shaping community assembly and ecosystem functioning through trophic interactions. Communities differing in their functional composition may induce ecological effects with varying directions and intensities, but previous studies in highly diverse ecosystems have struggled with reliably quantifying these interactions at the community level. We used spider gut-content metabarcoding in a subtropical tree diversity experiment to examine the impact of multiple diversity components of both trees and spiders on prey diversity and the network structure of predator-prey interactions. Our findings reveal that prey richness and spider-prey network structure are simultaneously driven by the bottom-up effects of tree communities and the top-down effects of the spider communities. When categorized by hunting modes, the drivers of prey richness and network structure differed between spider guilds. Large phylogenetic and functional differences within web-building spider communities promoted coexistence, leading to increases in the utilized prey richness, generality, niche overlap and prey vulnerability. For hunting spiders, the effects of vertical tree structure complexity indicated restricted mobility but facilitated coexistence through increased shelter availability, and a concomitant reduction of prey richness and dietary breadth. Our study underscores the significance of integrating multiple diversity components and considering functional trait composition across trophic levels when analysing the ecological effects of generalist predators. Our findings enable a better understanding of how predator-prey interaction patterns may be altered under current environmental changes that result in biodiversity loss.

AB  - Butterflies and plant species are widely used as model systems in biodiversity and conservation research. However, little is known about spatial patterns of butterfly diversity linked to plant communities across coastal dune ecotones. We explored the relation between butterfly and vegetation diversity in a Mediterranean protected dune system in Central Italy. We sampled butterfly and plant communities on shifting and fixed dunes and investigated their distribution patterns by diversity indexes and Species Abundance Diversity models (SADs). We also computed species beta-diversity and analyzed the relation between butterfly communities and vegetation by correlation analyses. Cross-taxon congruence in species richness, composition and abundance was assessed using Mantel correlation tests. Both butterfly and plant diversity were higher on the fixed dunes than on the shifting dunes. In both communities, SADs were adequately described by the geometric series model, which is typical of harsh environments with simple communities dominated by few species. Among both butterflies and plants, we identified species found only on either the shifting or the fixed dunes. Correlation between plant and butterfly diversity was higher for entomophilous plant species than for the more abundant anemophilous ones. Our results indicate that both plant and butterfly communities respond to the sea-inland environmental gradient, forming distinct communities with specialized taxa. Our findings also provide evidence of the importance of butterfly-plant relations for preserving biological diversity and ecosystem functioning in Mediterranean coastal areas.

AB  - Green alder shrubs Alnus viridis increasingly overgrow European mountain pastures but hinder natural forest succession. This nitrogen-fixing, autochthonous invasive species has numerous negative effects including the loss of biodiversity and landscape aesthetic, eutrophication of soils and downstream waters, and greenhouse gas emission. Over centuries, A. viridis encroachment was impeded by grazing livestock, particularly goats. However, in modern agriculture, livestock numbers decreased on remote mountain pastures and goat farming became unprofitable. A grazing experiment tested if hardy breeds of the more economically attractive livestock species, cattle and sheep can replace goats as A. viridis antagonists. On a subalpine pasture heavily encroached by A. viridis, space use and debarking (bark foraging) by Dexter cattle, Engadine sheep and Pfauen goats were analysed using GPS tracking and vegetation mapping. Dexter cattle used space least evenly (Camargo evenness: cattle = 0.39; sheep = 0.52; and goats = 0.47) and preferred flat slopes and open pastures. They spent least time foraging in A. viridis stands (relative presence while foraging: cattle = 0.55; sheep = 0.76; and goats = 0.80). Dexter cattle did not debark any A. viridis, but damaged shrubs by trampling. Engadine sheep visited A. viridis stands nearly as often as goats, but preferred flat slopes, short vegetation and shrub edges more clearly than goats. This sheep breed debarked significantly more A. viridis branches (average 244 branches per paddock; 7.4% of all A. viridis branches) than goats (45; 0.8%). Goats preferred mountain-ash shrubs Sorbus aucuparia covering only 2% of the shrub layer. Synthesis and applications. Green alder shrubs, controlled by goats traditionally, overgrow valuable mountain pasture ecosystems today. Cattle, kept instead of goats, may slow down but not hinder shrub encroachment, because they avoid shrub stands and do not debark green alder. However, this study is the first to show that Engadine sheep are even better suited for green alder clearance than goats. Moreover, if management goals include forest re-establishment, Engadine sheep outperform goats, because they debark green alder (which hinders forest regeneration), but do not destroy elderberry-a valuable forest pioneer. Hardy breeds are an important tool to maintain biodiverse, open pastures, restore natural mountain forests and mitigate the negative environmental effects of shrub encroachment.

AB  - While dominant species are known to be important in ecosystem functioning and community assembly, biodiversity responses to the presence of dominant species can be highly variable. Dominant species can increase the importance of deterministic community assembly by competitively excluding species in a consistent way across local communities, resulting in low site-to-site variation in community composition (beta-diversity) and nonrandom community structure. In contrast, dominant species could increase the importance of stochastic community assembly by reducing the total number of individuals in local communities (community size), resulting in high beta-diversity and more random community structure. We tested these hypotheses in a large, temperate oak-hickory forest plot containing a locally dominant tree species, pawpaw (Asimina triloba; Annonaceae), an understory tree species that occurs in dense, clonal patches in forests throughout the east-central United States. We determined how the presence of pawpaw influences local species diversity, community size, and beta-diversity by measuring the abundance of all vascular plant species in 1 x 1-m plots both inside and outside pawpaw patches. To test whether the presence of pawpaw influences local assembly processes, we compared observed patterns of beta-diversity inside and outside patches to a null model in which communities were assembled at random with respect to species identity. We found lower local species diversity, lower community size, and higher observed beta-diversity inside pawpaw patches than outside pawpaw patches. Moreover, standardized effect sizes of beta-diversity from the null model were lower inside pawpaw patches than outside pawpaw patches, indicating more random species composition inside pawpaw patches. Together these results suggest that pawpaw increases the importance of stochastic relative to deterministic community assembly at local scales, likely by decreasing overall numbers of individuals and increasing random local extinctions inside patches. Our findings provide insights into the ecological processes by which locally dominant tree species shape the assembly and diversity of understory plant communities at different spatial scales.

AB  - In migratory tropical ecosystems governed by water availability, artificially altering water availability can affect herbivore distribution and movement. The Makgadikgadi Pans, Botswana, sustains approximately 10,000 blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) and 24,000 plains zebra (Equus quagga) migrating between a dry season range with permanent water and a rainy season range with productive grasses. Artificial water points (AWPs) have been created by pumping some natural waterholes in the rainy season range. We combined data from aerial surveys and from GPS collars on 20 and 12 zebra pre-and post-AWP installation, respectively, and on 17 wildebeest post-AWP, to test hypotheses relating to large-and small-scale movement patterns. Post-AWP, a higher proportion of wildebeest, but not zebra, were in the rainy season range during the dry season. Post-AWP zebra migration to their rainy season range occurred longer after rainfall cessation than pre-AWP, though this period was still shorter than that of wildebeest (one month compared to three). The effect of proximity to waterholes on probability of space use varied seasonally for both species and followed opposing trends, suggesting resource partitioning or competition effects. Both species visited AWPs more than natural waterholes, particularly wildebeest in the dry season. Wildebeest movement patterns were more likely to be disturbed by AWPs, which could cause the development of residency and reduce population resilience. Management interventions, such as AWPs, can affect species to different extents, so the responses of several species should be assessed to determine the level of disturbance to migratory ecosystem resilience and functioning.

AB  - 1. Large grazers modify vegetated ecosystems and are increasingly viewed as keystone species in trophic rewilding schemes. Yet, as their ecosystem influences are context-dependent, a crucial challenge is identifying where grazers sustain, versus undermine, important ecosystem properties and their resilience.
   2. Previous work in diverse European saltmarshes found that, despite changing plant and invertebrate community structure, grazers do not suppress below-ground properties, including soil organic carbon (SOC). We hypothesised that, in contrast, eastern US saltmarshes would be sensitive to large grazers as extensive areas are dominated by a single grass, Spartina alterniflora. We predicted that grazers would reduce above- and below-ground Spartina biomass, suppress invertebrate densities, shift soil texture and ultimately reduce SOC concentration.
   3. We tested our hypotheses using a replicated 51-month large grazer (horse) exclusion experiment in Georgia, coupled with observations of 14 long-term grazed sites, spanning similar to 1000 km of the eastern US coast.
   4. Grazer exclusion quickly led to increased Spartina height, cover and flowering, and increased snail density. Changes in vegetation structure were reflected in modified soil texture (reduced sand, increased clay) and elevated root biomass, yet we found no response of SOC. Large grazer exclusion also reduced drought-associated vegetation die-off.
   5. We also observed vegetation shifts in sites along the eastern US seaboard where grazing has occurred for hundreds of years. Unlike in the exclusion experiment, long-term grazing was associated with reduced SOC. A structural equation model implicated grazing by revealing reduced stem height as a key driver of reduced soil organic carbon.
   6. Synthesis: These results illustrate the context dependency of large grazer impacts on ecosystem properties in coastal wetlands. In contrast to well-studied European marshes, eastern US marshes are dominated and structured by a single foundational grass species resulting in vegetation and soil properties being more sensitive to grazing. Coastal systems characterised by a single foundation species might be inherently vulnerable to large grazers and lack resilience in the face of other disturbances, underlining that frameworks to explain and predict large grazer impacts must account for geographic variation in ecosystem structure.

AB  - Outdoor recreation is widespread, with uncertain effects on wildlife. The human shield hypothesis (HSH) suggests that recreation could have differential effects on predators and prey, with predator avoidance of humans creating a spatial refuge 'shielding' prey from people. The generality of the HSH remains to be tested across larger scales, wherein human shielding may prove generalizable, or diminish with variability in ecological contexts. We combined data from 446 camera traps and 79,279 sampling days across 10 landscapes spanning 15,840 km(2) in western Canada. We used hierarchical models to quantify the influence of recreation and landscape disturbance (roads, logging) on ungulate prey (moose, mule deer and elk) and carnivore (wolf, grizzly bear, cougar and black bear) site use. We found limited support for the HSH and strong responses to recreation at local but not larger spatial scales. Only mule deer showed positive but weak landscape-level responses to recreation. Elk were positively associated with local recreation while moose and mule deer responses were negative, contrary to HSH predictions. Mule deer showed a more complex interaction between recreation and land-use disturbance, with more negative responses to recreation at lower road density or higher logged areas. Contrary to HSH predictions, carnivores did not avoid recreation and grizzly bear site use was positively associated. We also tested the effects of roads and logging on temporal activity overlap between mule deer and recreation, expecting deer to minimize interaction with humans by partitioning time in areas subject to more habitat disturbance. However, temporal overlap between people and deer increased with road density. Our findings highlight the complex ecological patterns that emerge at macroecological scales. There is a need for expanded monitoring of human and wildlife use of recreation areas, particularly multi-scale and -species approaches to studying the interacting effects of recreation and land-use change on wildlife.

AB  - Populations of feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) in the western United States have increased during the past decade, consequently affecting co-occurring wildlife habitat. Feral horses may influence 2 native wildlife species, greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) through mechanisms of habitat alteration and competition. Wyoming, USA, contains the largest populations of pronghorn and sage-grouse of any state and also has the highest degree of range overlap between feral horses and these species. Consequently, the effects that horses may have on pronghorn and sage-grouse populations in Wyoming have implications at local, state, and population-wide levels. Managers need information concerning habitat selection and space use overlap among these species to develop appropriate management strategies; yet this information is absent for most feral horse management areas. To address this knowledge need, we attached global positioning system (GPS) transmitters to horses, pronghorn, and sage-grouse within the greater Bureau of Land Management-Adobe Town Herd Management Area in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado, USA, between 2017 and 2021 to evaluate habitat selection and space use of all species during 3 biologically relevant seasons: spring (Apr-Jun; sage-grouse breeding, nesting, and early-brood rearing; pronghorn late gestation and early parturition), summer (Jul-Oct; sage-grouse summer and late-brood rearing; pronghorn late parturition and breeding), and winter (Nov-Mar; non-breeding season). Feral horses selected flatter slopes and shorter mean shrub height across all seasons and were closer to water in spring and summer. Pronghorn habitat selection was similar to horses, but they also avoided oil and gas well pads year-round. During spring, sage-grouse selected greater herbaceous cover, flatter slopes, and areas farther from well pads. In summer, sage-grouse selected greater mean shrub height, flatter slopes, and were closer to water. In winter, sage-grouse selected flatter slopes and areas with greater vegetation production during the preceding summer. Our results indicate strong year-round overlap in space use between horses and pronghorn, whereas overlap between horses and sage-grouse is greatest during the summer in this region. Consequently, managers should recognize the potential for horses to influence habitat quality of pronghorn and sage-grouse in the region.

AB  - In nature conservation today, there is a global problem with the aggressive expansion of invasive plant species and the conservation of valuable grassland vegetation. Based on this, the following question has been formed: Is the domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) appropriate for managing various habitat types? How does grazing by water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) affect on grassland vegetation? This study was carried out in four areas of Hungary. One of the sample areas was in the Matra Mountains, on dry grassland areas where grazing had been applied for two, four and six years. The other sample areas were in the Zamolyi Basin, where wet fens with a high risk of Solidago gigantea and in a typic Pannonian dry grassland were investigated. In all areas, grazing was carried out with domestic water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). During the study, we carried out a coenological survey, examining the change of cover of plant species, their feed values and the biomass of the grassland. According to the results, both the number and cover of economically important grasses (from 28% to 34.6%) and legumes (from 3.4% to 25.4%) increased in Matra as well as the high proportion of shrubs (from 41.8% to 4.4%) shifted toward grassland species. In the areas of the Zamolyi Basin, invasive Solidago has been suppressed completely, the pasture has been converted completely (from 16% to 1%) and the dominant species has become Sesleria uliginosa. Thus, we have found that grazing with buffalo is suitable as a habitat management method in both dry grasslands and wet grasslands. Therefore, in addition to its effectiveness in the control of Solidago gigantea, grazing with buffalo is successful in both nature conservation and economic aspects of grassland vegetation.

AB  - Context. Of the six species of non-native deer present in Australia, the sambar deer is the largest and has been identified as a major threat to high-elevation peatlands in south-eastern Australia. However, little is known about sambar deer activity in high-elevation peatlands. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify sambar deer activity (including wallowing) seasonally and daily in response to biotic and abiotic variables, and how activity was impacted by ground-based shooting. Methods. To estimate sambar deer activity, camera traps were continuously deployed for 4 years in two similar to 4300-ha areas in Alpine National Park, Victoria, south-eastern Australia. One area was subject to management operations using ground-based shooting to target deer and the other was not. Monthly activity of sambar deer was modelled using biotic (woody vegetation cover), abiotic (snow depth, aspect, slope, distance to water, road and peatland) and management (treatment versus non-treatment) covariates. Additional camera traps were deployed to monitor sambar deer activity at wallows. Key results. Sambar deer activity decreased when snow depth increased (between July and September), and was highest in easterly and northerly aspects with dense woody vegetation close to high-elevation peatlands and roads. During our 4-year study, sambar deer activity decreased in the treatment area but increased in the non-treatment area. Sambar deer exhibited a crepuscular diel cycle, with greatest activity around sunset. Only male sambar deer were observed to wallow, with most wallowing occurring in the afternoon during October-June. Conclusions. Sambar deer utilised high-elevation peatlands during October-June. Daily activity was crepuscular and was greatest in dense tree cover close to roads. Ground-based shooting reduced sambar deer activity in and around high-elevation peatlands. Implications. Control operations targeting sambar deer at high elevations in south-eastern Australia should be conducted during October-June. Outside this period sambar deer appear to use lower-elevation habitats. The effectiveness of ground-based shooting could be improved by focusing this control action around sunset (when sambar deer are most active) and in places with dense vegetation close to roads and high-elevation peatlands.

AB  - Large mammals, such as hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus amphibius), can significantly alter the landscape, vegetation composition, and structure in savannas through their grazing habits and ecosystem engineering effects, especially around rivers. However, livestock grazing can strongly change these effects, as seen in the Kenyan Maasai Mara Ecosystem. In this region, the increasing intensity of livestock grazing along local rivers, resulting from the transition of Maasai pastoralists from a semi-nomadic lifestyle to one based on pastoral ranches near the Maasai Mara National Reserve, may alter the impact of hippo grazing on riparian vegetation. We investigated the differences in vegetation structure, plant species richness and composition between landscapes predominantly grazed by hippopotami and livestock. We studied 25 transects, each measuring 5 km and having 13 sampling plots of 10 x 10 m2 located at varying distances from rivers in the reserve (n = 16) and pastoral ranches (n = 9). We measured the height and estimated the percent cover of grasses, forbs, shrubs, and bare ground, as well as plant species composition and richness and grazing intensity. Our results show that the riverine areas were more intensely and homogeneously grazed in the pastoral ranches than in the reserve, and in the dry than in the wet season in both landscapes. In addition, grazing intensity decreased with distance from rivers in the reserve in both seasons, but only in the wet season in the pastoral ranches. The mean plant species richness was similar in both landscapes and decreased linearly with distance from rivers, but varied with grazing intensity due to differences in forb and shrub species. However, plant species composition differed significantly between the reserve and the pastoral ranches. Furthermore, species similarity indices declined with increasing distance from water. These results suggest that the effects of livestock and hippo grazing intensity on vegetation structure and spatial heterogeneity interact, and vary with landscape and season. While both hippopotamus and livestock grazing can modify riparian vegetation, livestock grazing impact on plant species composition, vegetation structure, and spatial heterogeneity appears to be more persistent, declining less rapidly with increasing distance from water. Consequently, hippo and livestock differentially impact landscape heterogeneity.

AB  - Species richness within a site (i.e., alpha diversity) and between sites (i.e., beta diversity) are important measurements of biodiversity utilized in wildlife research and management. However, novel occupancy modeling approaches, especially at large spatial scales and in conjunction with other analyses of biodiversity, remain scarce in studies of mammalian biodiversity across forested landscapes. We assessed alpha and beta diversity of mammals across a 16,058-km2 region of southern Illinois, USA, between January and April of the years 2008-2010. We deployed camera traps, measured habitat variables, applied hierarchical occupancy modeling and meta-analysis techniques to investigate alpha diversity, and used partial redundancy analyses and partial Mantel tests to investigate beta diversity. We collected 86,486 photographic captures of mammals. Alpha diversity values ranged from 3 to 10; models incorporating Simpson's diversity index of patch types, distance to major road, and agriculture clumpiness index were most supported. Forest proximity and percentage forest cover explained minor variation in beta diversity, and we found weak, positive correlations between beta diversity and percentage forest cover and forest proximity index. Mammalian biodiversity was strongly influenced by generalist species and highest with (1) moderate levels of habitat heterogeneity, (2) low to moderate levels of anthropogenic influence, and (3) nearby forest cover. Anthropogenic influences and the presence of agriculture appeared to increase species richness by providing novel food resources and additional habitat that generalist species could exploit while also being tolerant of any accompanying landscape fragmentation or disturbance. While dominated by generalist species, our local mammalian community had an affinity for forest cover, reinforcing the importance of forested habitat to these species in hardwood forest systems. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of hierarchical modeling approaches and the importance of examining biodiversity through varying measurements.

AB  - Climate change is among the greatest threats to biodiversity conservation worldwide. Understanding which species are vulnerable to climate change and in what ways is essential for adaptation planning and mitigation. We used the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to conduct a range-wide assessment of tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) - a California-endemic ungulate with low genetic diversity, occupying highly fragmented landscapes - to climate change. Using results from the CCVI, we tested the hypothesis that increasing connectivity among populations, by mitigating anthropogenic barriers to movement and dispersal, decreases vulnerability of tule elk to climate change. We compared CCVI scores given predicted conditions within current ranges with CCVI scores as if anthropogenic barriers were mitigated, with and without allowing elk to shift distributions up to 50 km to areas predicted to experience less warming, drying, or overall exposure to climate change (indicated by an interaction between warming and drying). Vulnerability of tule elk to climate change varied among populations; from most to least vulnerable rankings in the CCVI, 1 population was ranked extremely vulnerable, 1 was highly vulnerable, 12 were moderately vulnerable, and 4 were less vulnerable. Mitigating anthropogenic barriers alone did not have a significant effect on vulnerability to climate change compared to original CCVI estimates, nor did mitigation of anthropogenic barriers and shifts in distribution to areas expected to experience the least amount of warming. Mitigation of anthropogenic barriers coupled with elk shifting distributions to areas predicted to experience less drying than current ranges or less overall exposure to climate change significantly reduced climate change vulnerability. Our findings illustrate the need to prioritize increasing landscape connectivity for tule elk across California as part of climate change mitigation measures, but also may apply to non-migratory ungulates more generally, particularly where drying and warming are predicted to increase under climate change.

AB  - In mountains, current land-use changes are altering plant communities of semi-natural grasslands with potential cascading effects on associated herbivores. Besides vegetation changes, temperature is also a key driver of insect diversity, and in the European Alps is predicted to increase by 0.25 degrees C per decade. Understanding herbivore responses to temperature and plant composition changes in mountain environments is of increasing importance. Our study aims at investigating the response to temperature and plant diversity and composition of two key herbivore groups (orthopterans and leafhoppers) belonging to contrasting feeding guilds (chewers vs. sap-feeders). We hypothesized that orthopteran diversity would be driven by temperature while leafhoppers by plant community composition. We selected 15 dry calcareous grasslands ranging from 100 to 1330 m a.s.l. along two independent gradients of plant diversity and temperature. We sampled orthopteran and leafhopper species richness and abundance by sweep-netting. Consistent with their low feeding specialisation, orthopteran species richness and community composition were only driven by temperature. By contrast, leafhopper species richness was not affected by temperature nor by plant diversity but leafhopper community composition was strongly influenced by plant species composition. This response can be explained by the higher host feeding specialisation of many leafhopper species. Species rarity and mobility did not change the response of the diversity of both groups, but orthopteran abundance increased with temperature only for highly mobile species. Altogether, our results suggest that future responses of grassland herbivores to vegetation changes and temperature warming are highly variable and depend on the feeding strategy and specialisation of the focal herbivore group. Implications for insect conservation Leafhoppers emerged to be particularly sensitive to potential management or climate-induced change in vegetation composition, while orthopterans are expected to respond directly to temperature warming due to their relaxed association with plant community diversity and composition.

AB  - Questions Species defined as ecosystem engineers (e.g. elephant) are able to strongly shape their habitat. In African savannas, elephants have often been shown to reduce woody-plant abundance and diversity. However, recent studies highlight more complex elephant-induced effects on vegetation. Here, we assessed if long-term high elephant densities (>2 km(-2)) in a large open landscape resulted in the depletion of savanna woodland woody communities or if it led to a new alternative equilibrium. Location Woodland savanna of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe. Elephant densities at the study site have remained high for the past two decades (>2 km(-)(2)). Methods We measured long-term (>15 years) elephant utilisation of woody-plant communities and their effects on vegetation structure, species composition and functional traits (e.g. N leaf concentration, specific leaf area) in 12 vegetation plots. Results We observed opportunistic foraging behaviour by elephants with only a slight temporal shift in species composition, mainly explained by changes in rare species. Further, we did not observe any modification in mean functional trait values, overall height, and stem diameters of the woody-plant communities. However, we found differential changes in woody-plant abundance according to the height layer (decrease in the number of tall plants [>200 cm] and increase in the number of short plants [<50 cm]) and a strong reduction in crown diameter for plants in the 50-200 cm height class. Conclusion Our study strongly suggests that long-term high elephant densities have led to a stable state in savanna woodland vegetation in terms of plant community composition and their functional traits. However, high elephant densities did affect vegetation structure, which would have several important indirect effects on this ecosystem (e.g. predator-prey interactions). We hope that this study stimulates more work on the long-term effects of ecosystem engineers in large and open ecosystems.

AB  - Non-native crayfish are among the most widespread aquatic invasive species worldwide. High densities of crayfish in lakes can potentially cause complete loss of macrophytes through herbivory, physical destruction, shading by suspension of sediments and nutrient release facilitating phytoplankton, thus altering ecosystem state and functions. However, lower crayfish densities may affect different macrophyte species in different ways, thus altering competition between macrophyte species with different growth forms. We hypothesize that high crayfish densities can completely destroy submerged macrophyte communities and shift systems into more turbid conditions whereas low crayfish densities can promote low-growing macrophytes that compete with canopy-forming species. To test these hypotheses, we applied three different densities (2, 4, 8 crayfish m-2) of the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii and a control (no crayfish) to 36 mesocosms of monocultures and mixed stands of low-growing and canopy-forming submerged macrophytes for 60 days. We measured concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids, phytoplankton and periphyton and above- and belowground biomass of low-growing Vallisneria natans and canopy-forming Hydrilla verticillata. In addition, we conducted a meta-analysis of crayfish impacts on macrophytes to compare effect sizes between different crayfish densities. Using data from published studies, we derived the relationship between crayfish density and crayfish-induced reductions in macrophyte abundance. Our meta-analysis revealed a significant decline of macrophytes with increasing crayfish densities. In line with existing studies, high crayfish densities caused a strong loss of both low-growing and canopy-forming macrophytes and increased nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton biomass and suspended sediment, thus favouring an ecosystem shift to more turbid conditions. Low and medium crayfish densities reduced macrophyte biomass similarly for both species in monocultures. However, in mixed cultures, low crayfish densities (2 crayfish m-2) reduced the above- and belowground biomass of the canopy-forming H. verticillata more than that of low-growing V. natans, supporting our hypothesis. This support of low-growing macrophytes occurred despite a temporal facilitation of shading by increased periphyton biomass. Our results show that the impact of crayfish invasions on aquatic ecosystems is strongly dependent on their density. High densities facilitate the loss of macrophytes and increase the likelihood of ecosystem collapse into a turbid state. However, low densities can provide a competitive advantage to low-growing macrophytes that would otherwise be outcompeted by canopy-forming species. Although complete eradication is often impossible, management of invasive crayfish can target densities that have potentially positive effects on invaded ecosystems.

AB  - Compound effects of anthropogenic disturbances on wildlife emerge through a complex network of direct responses and species interactions. Land-use changes driven by energy and forestry industries are known to disrupt predator-prey dynamics in boreal ecosystems, yet how these disturbance effects propagate across mammal communities remains uncertain. Using structural equation modeling, we tested disturbance-mediated pathways governing the spatial structure of multipredator multiprey boreal mammal networks across a landscape-scale disturbance gradient within Canada's Athabasca oil sands region. Linear disturbances had pervasive direct effects, increasing site use for all focal species, except black bears and threatened caribou, in at least one landscape. Conversely, block (polygonal) disturbance effects were negative but less common. Indirect disturbance effects were widespread and mediated by caribou avoidance of wolves, tracking of primary prey by subordinate predators, and intraguild dependencies among predators and large prey. Context-dependent responses to linear disturbances were most common among prey and within the landscape with intermediate disturbance. Our research suggests that industrial disturbances directly affect a suite of boreal mammals by altering forage availability and movement, leading to indirect effects across a range of interacting predators and prey, including the keystone snowshoe hare. The complexity of network-level direct and indirect disturbance effects reinforces calls for increased investment in addressing habitat degradation as the root cause of threatened species declines and broader ecosystem change.

AB  - Grazing affects soil organic carbon (SOC) through plant removal, livestock trampling, and manure deposition. However, the impact of grazing on SOC is also influenced by multiple factors such as climate, soil properties, and management approaches. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms by which grazing intensity influences SOC density in grasslands remain incompletely understood. This study examines the effects of varying grazing intensities on SOC density (0-30 cm) dynamics in temperate grasslands of northern China using field surveys and experimental analyses in a typical steppe ecosystem of Inner Mongolia. Results show that moderate grazing (3.8 sheep units/ha/yr) led to substantial consumption of aboveground plant biomass. Relative to the ungrazed control (0 sheep units/ha/yr), aboveground plant biomass was reduced by 40.5%, 36.2%, and 50.6% in the years 2016, 2019, and 2020, respectively. Compensatory growth failed to fully offset biomass loss, and there were significant reductions in vegetation carbon storage and cover (p < 0.05). Reduced vegetation cover increased bare soil exposure and accelerated topsoil drying and erosion. This degradation promoted the downward migration of SOC from surface layers. Quantitative analysis revealed that moderate grazing significantly reduced surface soil (0-10 cm) organic carbon density by 13.4% compared to the ungrazed control while significantly increasing SOC density in the subsurface layer (10-30 cm). Increased precipitation could mitigate the SOC transfer and enhance overall SOC accumulation. However, it might negatively affect certain labile SOC fractions. Elucidating the mechanisms of SOC variation under different grazing intensities and precipitation regimes in semi-arid grasslands could improve our understanding of carbon dynamics in response to environmental stressors. These insights will aid in predicting how grazing systems influence grassland carbon cycling under global climate change.

AB  - Mammal diversity affects carbon concentration in Amazonian soils. It is known that some species traits determine carbon accumulation in organisms (e.g., size and longevity), and are also related to feeding strategies, thus linking species traits to the type of organic remains that are incorporated into the soil. Trait diversity in mammal assemblages - that is, its functional diversity - may therefore constitute another mechanism linking biodiversity to soil organic matter (SOM) accumulation. To address this hypothesis, we analyzed across 83 mammal assemblages in the Amazon biome (Guyana), the elemental (by ED-XRF and CNH analysis) and molecular (FTIR-ATR) composition of SOM of topsoils (401 samples) and trait diversity (functional richness, evenness, and divergence) for each mammal assemblage. Lower mammal functional richness but higher functional divergence were related to higher content of carbonyl and aliphatic SOM, potentially affecting SOM recalcitrance. Our results might allow the design of biodiversity management plans that consider the effect of mammal traits on carbon sequestration and accumulation in soils.

AB  - The subarctic forest tundra transition zone is one of the most vulnerable ecological regions worldwide and susceptible to climate change. Forest changes could lead to biodiversity losses when tundra areas become colonized. However, the impact of complex landscapes with barriers and channels for seed dispersal is highly understudied. Hence, we investigated potential tree above-ground biomass (AGB) change in mountainous central Chukotka (Siberia) with the individual-based spatially explicit vegetation model Larix vegetation simulator (LAVESI). In a climate sensitivity study, we simulate forest dynamics until 3000 CE for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with and without hypothetical cooling after 2300 CE to twentieth-century levels. The current state and spatiotemporal dynamics of tree AGB are validated against field and satellite-derived data. Our results suggest densification of existing tree stands and a lagged forest expansion depending on the distance to the current tree line (similar to 39 percent of the total study area, RCP 8.5) under all considered climate scenarios. In scenarios with cooling after 2300 CE, forests stopped expanding and then gradually retreated to their pre-twenty-first-century position (similar to 10 percent, RCP 8.5). However, forest remnants remain in the colonized area, leaving an imprint of forests in former tundra areas, which will likely have an adverse impact on tundra biodiversity.

AB  - We explore how the ground flora of a temperate woodland (Wytham Woods, southern England) changed in terms of species-richness, cover and biomass over five decades; what the drivers of change were; and possible future change as a consequence of the decline in Fraxinus excelsior as a canopy dominant. Vascular plants were recorded from 164 permanent, 10x10 m plots, distributed as a 141 m grid, in 1974, 1991, 1999, 2012, and 2018. Species presence and frequency/abundance in each plot were estimated and used to model biomass changes. Changes in species-richness, vegetation composition and structure were analysed. Stands opened out by thinning or which became denser through tree growth gained or lost species respectively, particularly non-woodland species. Deer pressure favoured the spread of Brachypodium sylvaticum and reduced Rubus fruticosus. No obvious impacts of climate change, eutrophication or of invasive species were detected in the plot records although other signs suggest these are starting to affect the flora. Just 12 out of 235 species contributed 47% of all species occurrences, 82% of the vegetation cover and 87% of the modelled biomass. We conclude that the ground flora is highly variable over decadal timescales, but the patterns of change observed differ according to the measures used (species richness, cover, biomass, etc). Site level drivers in the short-term swamped effects of slower acting regional/global drivers. Legacy effects were seen in the greater richness of specialists in the older woodland. While some impacts can be mitigated by management, others are largely beyond control at the site level.

AB  - Tree planting is at the forefront of the current environmental agenda to mitigate climate change and tackle the biodiversity crisis. In the United Kingdom (UK), tree planting has been a priority for more than a century and has helped increase woodland cover from a historic low of 5 per cent at the beginning of the 20th century to a current figure of 13 per cent. However, we still know relatively little about the long-term development of woodland creation sites (particularly of native woodlands) over ecologically realistic timescales. We surveyed a chronosequence of 133 temperatewoodland patches encompassing 106woodland creation sites (10-160 years old) and 27 mature 'ancient' woodlands (>250 years old), using a combination of field surveys and remote sensing techniques to quantify vegetation structural changes associated with woodland development. Woodland creation sites displayed similar vegetation development patterns to those described for other woodland systems, i.e. a gradual transition as woodlands undergo `stand initiation', `stem exclusion' and `understorey reinitiation' stages, and became more similar to `ancient' woodlands over time. Structural heterogeneity, average tree size and tree density were the attributes that varied the most among woodland developmental stages. In general, structural heterogeneity and average tree size increased with woodland age, whilst tree density decreased as would be expected. Younger sites in stand initiation were strongly dominated by short vegetation, stem exclusion sites by taller trees and older sites had a more even vegetation height distribution. There was a large degree of overlap between the vegetation characteristics of woodlands in understorey re-initiation stages and older ancient woodlands (partly driven by a lack of regeneration in the understorey); these results suggest that it takes between 80 and 160 years for woodland creation sites to develop certain vegetation attributes similar to those of mature ancient woodlands included in this study. Woodland management practices to create canopy gaps and reducing grazing/browsing pressure to promote natural regeneration are likely to accelerate this transition, increase the structural heterogeneity and biodiversity value ofwoodland creation sites and enable adaptation and resilience to climate change.

AB  - Canopy connectivity influences foraging, movement, and competition in arboreal ant communities. Understanding how canopy connectivity affects arboreal ant communities could inform the development of management practices that maximize services from known biocontrol agents. We experimentally manipulated connectivity between the crowns of large shade trees to investigate the effects of canopy connectivity on arboreal ant species richness and composition in a coffee agroecosystem. A linear mixed-effects analysis showed that the number of species observed at baits set in tree crowns increased significantly after the crowns had been connected with nylon ropes. Crowns that were connected increased in similarity of ant species composition, particularly between adjacent connected crowns. Connectivity may increase the number of species present in tree crowns by allowing ants to move and forage in the canopy while bypassing trunks with more aggressive, territorial species such as Azteca sericeasur. Because twig-nesting species in the upper canopy have been shown to act as biocontrol agents of herbivores, an increase in species richness in tree crowns could have positive implications for agricultural pest-control services.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - In predator-prey systems, interspecific interactions at the spatial and temporal scale may affect different components of the ecosystem. Despite a growing interest in the topic, little is known about these interactions in many regions, particularly in areas recently recolonized by apex predators, such as the Alps. Using a multidimensional approach, we assessed wolf-wild boar interactions in a recently recolonized protected area of the Western Alps (Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy) by combining camera trapping and wolf scat analyses. First, we quantified the importance of wild boar in the wolf diet by comparing two different periods (October 2018-September 2020 vs. October 2021-September 2022). Second, we evaluated prey selection in 2021-2022, when data on prey availability were collected. Then, we assessed spatiotemporal interactions between the wild boar and the wolf. Finally, we calculated combined spatiotemporal associations between the wolf and the wild boar in comparison to other ungulate prey. We found a remarkable increase in wild boar consumption between the two periods; roe deer and wild boar were consumed in proportion to their availability, while the chamois was positively selected and the red deer and the ibex were less consumed in relation to their availability. Although we found no negative association between wolf and wild boar detection rates, in winter the wild boar limited its temporal overlap with the predator by being less active in sites more frequently used by the wolf, suggesting some spatial modulation of a temporal antipredator response. Among ungulate species, the wild boar had the highest combined spatiotemporal association with the wolf, particularly in autumn-winter. Our results suggest complex interspecific interactions in alpine areas recently recolonized by the wolf.

AB  - The straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus) was amongst the largest herbivores once engineering the European landscape on a continental scale. In combination with the glacial-interglacial cycles of the Pleistocene, the species was an integral part of the control regimes that shaped European flora and fauna. With the human-facilitated extinction of the straight-tusked elephant, these landscape-forming processes were lost during the last Glacial-Interglacial cycle. Given today's climate, could straight-tusked elephants still be part of modern ecosystems in Europe? And if yes, where? Answers to these questions can support nature conservation in preserving species and ecosystems historically adapted to these lost control regimes. We reconstructed the realised niche of the straight-tusked elephant by allocating a novel compilation of fossil occurrences to either cold or warm stages, based on their assignment to Marine Isotope Stages. Further, we quantified the past potential distribution of the straight-tusked elephant since its extinction and its current potential distribution given the modern climate. Results show that the elephant could have persisted in the Mediterranean Basin until today and that modern climate across Central and Western Europe, excluding the Alps, as well as in the Mediterranean, is highly suitable for its occurrence. Our results show that, without human-induced extinctions, European fauna would comprise extinct megafauna, acting as ecosystem engineers on a continental scale. Local rewilding initiatives aim at restoring these lost processes, but potentially cannot achieve lasting ecological effects on comparable scales.

AB  - As many drivers of global environmental change accelerates, it is expected that there will be an acceleration of species composition and diversity change in plant communities. These processes can be detected through longterm resurvey studies using permanent plots that were established during the period preceding the climate change. We focused on temporal changes in Carpathian beech and mixed montane forests. Vegetation data from 77 historical plots established in 1958-1976 in beech-dominated mostly unmanaged mature forests of five mountain ranges resampled in 2005-2008 and 2019-2023 were analysed. The mean annual rates of vascularplant understorey properties were compared and tested to demonstrate the acceleration. The species richness and species pool remained unchanged, while the alpha diversity (H<acute accent>) and evenness significantly decreased during the first decades of the 21st century, in contrast to the second half of the 20th century. The herbaceous cover decreased already in the first resurvey period during the 20th century, and this trend continued in the latest decades without acceleration. Its average dropped from 57.7% at the time of the 1st sampling (1958-1976) to 34.5% at the time of the 3rd sampling (2019-2023) along with a slow opening of the tree canopy (from 85.0% to 75.1% cover). This process present in all mountain ranges, altitudes, and bedrock types was identified as a "forest floor denudation" of beech forests. The species composition significantly changed in both resurvey periods due to high species turnover. Its rate accelerated in the second period along with the taxonomic homogenization. The overall trend in the species-composition shift was identified as a transition of the montane beech-fir or mixed forests towards the submontane beech forests of lower altitudes and higher heat load. Nevertheless, the submontane forests themselves underwent the highest rates of change in species composition, while the mixed montane communities were more stable. The understorey changes and their acceleration were attributed to the effects of climate change (warming, occurrence of heat waves, droughts and vapour pressure deficit) which likely caused a decrease of herbaceous cover after 1.9 degrees C warming, and by rapidly increasing deer densities which could contribute to the species turnover. Changes of the vascular-plant understorey accelerated but did not change the overall character of Carpathian beech and mixed montane forests as the species turnover was realised within an existing species pool. However, if the current trends of anthropogenic drivers are not stopped and reversed, we can expect even a complete change of the Carpathian forest communities..

AB  - The Clarion Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ) in the northeast Pacific is a heterogeneous deep-sea environment, featuring abyssal plains as well as multiple seamounts and abyssal hills (bathymetric elevations) that harbour a highly diverse megabenthic fauna. Based on the analysis of seafloor photographic transects that were taken from elevated areas downslope into the abyssal plains in the eastern CCZ, a similar distribution of habitats was observed on five different bathymetric elevations including abyssal hills as well as the foothills of two seamounts. Rock outcrops occur at the summits, surrounded by an area with varying coverage and size of polymetallic nodules, which were divided into two different habitats characterized by large and small nodules, respectively, and followed by nodule-free sediments. Megafauna composition, density and diversity varies across these habitats. While density is the highest in areas with rock outcrops (1.4 individuals per m(2)), the biodiversity is the highest when regarding all of the habitats combined. Regarded individually, nodule-covered areas are the most diverse, whereas sediment areas without hard substratum, i.e. nodule free sediments, show the lowest biodiversity and the lowest density (0.2 individuals per m(2)). The multinomial species classification method (CLAM) shows that most of the observed megafauna morphotypes have to be regarded as rare. The large differences between the megafaunal communities at bathymetric elevations and the abyssal plain reported from previous studies might partly be explained by the multiplicity of habitats. This high heterogeneity can lead to a more diversified community at elevations, although most habitats can also be observed in the abyssal plain.

AB  - Kelp forests are recognized as biodiversity hotspots and ecosystem engineers, while the macroinvertebrates linked with their holdfasts serve as markers of pollution and ecological and environmental change. Notwithstanding the evident ecological and economic importance of this system, no research has been undertaken in South Africa to examine the macroinvertebrate community assemblage patterns within the Ecklonia radiata holdfast, nor the mechanisms driving the observed distribution patterns. This study identified and compared the assemblage patterns of holdfast-associated macroinvertebrates across several sites using univariate and multivariate approaches, and delineated physical factors influencing invertebrate community organization. The key findings indicated that abundance exhibited little variations among sites, with Dwesa presenting the highest average abundance and Kob-Inn the lowest. Mazeppa exhibited the greatest species richness, succeeded by Dwesa and Nqabara. Beta diversity measured 0.42, with turnover and nestedness contributing equally. Xhorha and Nqabara exhibited the largest local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) regarding turnover, whereas Mazeppa and Kob-Inn demonstrated the highest LCBD in terms of nestedness. Substantial clustering among sites was observed, with each site harbouring a distinct assemblage of macroinvertebrates. Species that discriminated the sites were Zeuxoides helleri, Cirolana venusticauda and Amphipholis squamata.

AB  - White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) hunting is an important economic activity associated with the management of forests and rangelands in the USA, with over $12.9 billion dollars of related annual expenditures. Reducing tree cover through thinning and prescribed fire both have the potential to increase the quantity and quality of deer forage. We evaluated the long-term impacts of eight different combinations of fire return intervals and tree harvest on forage productivity and protein content of the forage. Based on management regime, study units ranged from savanna to closed-canopy forest. Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of six functional groups (grass, panicum, forb, legume, woody, sedge) of understory vegetation was measured in October 2019 and 2020 using destructive sampling. Samples for foliar crude protein (CP) concentration were collected in spring, summer, and fall of 2020. Total understory ANPP ranged from 2.9 to 466.3 g m- 2 and was up to 566% greater in savanna systems maintained by frequent fire (return interval of three years or less) than in non-burned forest treatments. Annual burning resulted in ANPP dominated by herbaceous plants composed mostly of firetolerant grasses (e.g., Andropogon gerardii, Schizachyrium scoparium). Longer fire return intervals or no fire resulted in roughly equal ANPP from understory woody and herbaceous species. Crude protein concentrations were up to 45.7% greater in the woodland and forest units than in the savanna units for seven of the eleven species sampled. The greater CP in the forests was most noticeable in the summer when deer needs for quality forage are substantial. Increased protein concentrations of understory species in the forests, but greater ANPP in the savannas indicate that managing for a mix of savanna and woodland could be ideal for balancing forage quantity with increased forage protein.

AB  - Trophic rewilding aims to promote biodiverse self-sustaining ecosystems through the restoration of ecologically important taxa and the trophic interactions and cascades they propagate. How rewilding effects manifest across broad temporal scales will determine ecosystem states; however, our understanding of post-rewilding dynamics across longer time periods is limited. Here we show that the restoration of a megaherbivore, the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana), promotes landscape openness (i.e., various measures of vegetation composition/complexity) and modifies fauna habitat and that these effects continue to manifest up to 92 years after reintroduction. We conducted a space-for-time floristic survey and assessment of 17 habitat attributes (e.g., floristic diversity and cover, ground wood, tree hollows) across five comparable nature reserves in South African savannah, where elephants were reintroduced between 1927 and 2003, finding that elephant reintroduction time was positively correlated with landscape openness and some habitat attributes (e.g., large-sized tree hollows) but negatively associated with others (e.g., large-sized coarse woody debris). We then indexed elephant site occurrence between 2006 and 2018 using telemetry data and found positive associations between site occurrence and woody plant densities. Taken alongside the longer-term space-for-time survey, this suggests that elephants are attracted to dense vegetation in the short term and that this behavior increases landscape openness in the long term. Our results suggest that trophic rewilding with elephants helps promote a semi-open ecosystem structure of high importance for African biodiversity. More generally, our results suggest that megafauna restoration represents a promising tool to curb Earth's recent ecological losses and highlights the importance of considering long-term ecological responses when designing and managing rewilding projects.

AB  - Understanding the drivers that shape hunter behaviour and success can help guide management decisions regarding hunting. Although there has been work on the socioeconomic and environmental drivers of hunter effort, less quantitative analysis of the temporal patterns of wildlife harvest has been available. Yet, knowing when hunters are most active may be useful for distributing the spatiotemporal allotment of hunting opportunities where real or perceived issues of hunt quality (e.g. hunter congestion) or negative impacts to local people or target and non-target wildlife species are of concern. As a case study, we used generalized linear models to examine the effect of season, day of week (i.e. weekday versus weekends), and holidays on 26-28 years of harvest data for bison Bison bison, thinhorn sheep Ovis dalli, and moose Alces americanus in Yukon, Canada. These species are important in regional socioecological systems and highly prized by local hunters. For all three species, harvest was significantly greater on weekends than weekdays. Most of the harvest for thinhorn sheep occurred early in the season, consistent with an 'opening day' phenomenon, whereas that for moose and bison started slowly and increased throughout the season. For all three species harvest was not significantly influenced by holidays. Bison harvest, however, was influenced in relation to public school holidays, with harvest decreasing over the winter (Christmas) break and increasing over spring break in March. Differences between these three species are likely due to species-specific hunting strategies, the behaviour of each species, hunter competition, and seasonal climate. Identifying patterns in hunter effort and harvest can inform wildlife management decisions on permit allocation. However, our data indicate that species-specific patterns vary substantially, even in the same region, and need to be understood for proposed changes to the timing of hunting opportunities to be effective.

AB  - Soil erosion, which involves the degradation of the physical and chemical properties of soil, is a major threat to the soil environment. Although the effects of soil erosion on the physical or chemical properties of forests have been studied, little has been reported on the soil microbial community, which is likely to affect forest ecosystems. This study aimed to elucidate how the microbiome changed with the soil environment accompanying soil erosion in cool temperate mixed forests in Southern Japan, where soil erosion has been accelerated by the increased population of sika deer. We investigated the soil microbial communities of the different soil erosion intensities at three forest sites. In prokaryotic communities, diversity indices were increased with the sum of the height of exposed roots (SUMH), an index of soil erosion. In fungal communities, the relative abundances of plant pathogenic and wood saprotroph fungi were increased as SUMH increased and those of symbiotrophs and ectomycorrhizal fungi were increased with humus organic matter content, suggesting that the difficulties in establishing plants would be increased as soil erosion progressed because of the changes in the composition and function of fungal communities in eroded areas. Moreover, soil fungal communities had a more complex co-occurrence network than that of prokaryote, suggesting that the effects of soil erosion on fungal network is smaller than those on bacterial network. Changes in the soil environment induced by soil erosion altered the microbiomes in the deeper layers of the soil and had different effect on prokaryotes and fungi.

AB  - Declines in species diversity have been linked to shifting disturbance regimes and increases in ungulate herbivory. Successful forest regeneration depends on silvicultural methods that can address stand-specific recruitment limitations. This study revisits a long-term experimental gap study in a hemlock-hardwood forest. Our objective was to determine if the treatment effects of deer exclosures and gap size would alter regeneration trajectories. We examined cohort development using permanent plots and gap-wide surveys of likely gap-capture trees. After 18 years, deer herbivory was a strong filter for tree regeneration and appeared to pose an insurmountable bottleneck to the recruitment of some species. Overall, 90% of unprotected stems >0.5 to <= 2 m showed evidence of being browsed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman). Our results indicate that browse sensitive species were unable to recruit even in resource-rich gap environments. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis L.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britton) were particularly sensitive to herbivory and absent in heights >1 m outside exclosures. However, inside exclosures in larger gaps, yellow birch saplings often co-dominated the tallest cohorts and eastern hemlock was well established at heights >1 m. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) was the dominant tree species across all treatments and ironwood (Ostrya virginiana Mill.) was frequently among the tallest trees in gaps outside of deer exclosures. Gap size only impacted unprotected seedlings which suggests regeneration is more sensitive to gap size when deer are present. The installation of relatively small (similar to 3.5% of total gap area) deer exclosures, at year two post-harvest, provided opportunities for the recruitment of browse-sensitive species. Collectively, our results highlight the pervasive role of ungulates in structuring forest composition.

AB  - The fragmentation of free-flowing rivers (FFRs) through major infrastructure development remains a pivotal threat to global freshwater biodiversity. More than 3400 large hydropower dams (>1 MW) are either planned or under construction, posing threats to freshwater megafauna (i.e., freshwater animals that can reach 30 kg). Here, we investigate the global patterns of river connectivity within distribution ranges of freshwater megafauna and explore how these patterns could change in the future. We found that the susceptibility of freshwater megafauna to reduced river connectivity in different dimensions depends on their life history. Freshwater megafauna taxa with a short accumulated length or low percentage of FFRs in their distribution ranges are more likely to be threatened. On average, there is higher freshwater megafauna richness in FFRs with proposed dams than in rivers that would remain free-flowing in the future or that are already fragmented. If all the proposed dams were built, 94 (18.9%) out of 497 remaining FFRs >500 km that provide habitat for freshwater megafauna would lose their free-flowing status. Our results highlight the reduced connectivity of rivers currently inhabited by freshwater megafauna and the future intensification of river fragmentation in megafauna-rich basins. Research and conservation efforts, including life-history studies, identification of critical habitats, updates of IUCN Red List assessments, advanced communication of the potential impacts on ecosystem services and livelihoods of affected communities, and strategic siting, design, and operations of proposed dams are urgently needed to safeguard freshwater megafauna and overall freshwater biodiversity.

AB  - The identification of priority areas and conservation gaps in existing protected areas (PAs) is crucial for conservation of globally threatened species. However, understanding of conservation priorities is generally based on species richness and endemism, often overlooking evolutionary histories, species' functional roles, and the dynamics of all diversity indices relative to human impacts and future climate change. We analyzed the multiple diversity patterns of threatened ungulates in China at a 0.1 degrees resolution under current and future climate scenarios and developed a more comprehensive framework for identifying priority conservation areas. Gross domestic product (GDP), human footprint index (HFP), land use, and climate had the greatest effect on distributions of threatened ungulates. The different facets of biodiversity and their dynamics were inconsistently represented across high-priority conservation areas. Existing PAs poorly represented priority areas based on the 5% highest values for the diversity indices we considered. Coverage of priority areas by PAs ranged from 28.8% to 30.4% under the current scenario alone and under a combination of the current scenario and 2 future scenarios. Only 21.5-22.2% of priority areas in eastern China were covered by PAs under all the scenarios, whereas >91.8% of the areas were threatened by high levels of human impacts. We identified gaps in areas of high priority for conservation of threatened ungulates and PAs in urgent need of strengthening.

AB  - High densities of native and introduced deer hamper the regeneration of temperate forests worldwide. Sport hunting is often the sole means of deer control, but whether it can restore forest regeneration remains uncertain.We assessed the potential to restore forest regeneration using unrestricted sport hunting alongside commercial harvesting and government-funded culling of introduced sika deer (Cervus nippon) across a 594 km2 landscape in North Island, New Zealand. We used six decades of repeated measurements of forest regeneration and deer presence, alongside monitoring of tagged stems in a 20-year paired exclosure experiment, to determine whether deer control restored regeneration.In our exclosure experiment, mountain beech (Fuscospora cliffortioides) seedling and sapling density, growth and survival were variable but consistently higher when deer were excluded by fencing. Sapling counts in unfenced plots were approximate to 3-10 times lower after 60 years of deer control compared with unfenced plots, before sika colonisation and other mountain beech forests without sika deer. This result suggests canopy replacement remains at risk despite government-funded culling and encouragement of sport hunting.Individual-based demographic models show that mountain beech is unlikely to regenerate following canopy gap formation in our study landscape unless deer impacts are reduced from current levels. These demographic models predicted present-day forest regeneration far better than two widely used proxies of deer impact: plot-based counts of saplings and estimates of deer densities from faecal pellet counts.Synthesis and applications. Here, we show that intensive culling beyond that achievable by sport hunting is needed to reduce deer densities enough to assure canopy regeneration. These interventions will be necessary in the many places worldwide where sport hunting is being relied upon to protect forests but appears to be failing. Given the controversy associated with deer culling, and the need for clear evidence to justify its implementation, we suggest managers could strengthen the evidence base for their interventions by collecting data to build demographic models.

AB  - Aims: By analysing cattle-and sheep-grazed sand grasslands, we tested the following hypotheses: (i) livestock type has a stronger effect on the vegetation characteristics than grazing intensity; (ii) sheep grazing results in lower biomass and species and functional diversity than cattle grazing, regardless of intensity; and (iii) increased grazing intensity causes a shift of the trait composition in grasslands.
   Location: Sand grasslands in the Nyirseg region, East Hungary.
   Methods: We selected 26 sand grassland sites grazed by cattle or sheep and classified them into four intensity levels. Vegetation composition was surveyed in 2 m x 2 m plots. We harvested the above-ground biomass from 20 cm x 20 cm plots; then dried and sorted it to live biomass, litter, moss, and lichen. We compared Rao dissimilarity index, species richness, Shannon diversity, evenness, and the community-weighted means of nine vegetative and generative traits along a grazing intensity gradient. We calculated functional richness, evenness, and divergence for comparison.
   Results: We found that some diversity metrics and community-weighted means of most studied traits were significantly affected by grazing intensity. Several characteristics were also affected by the interaction of grazing intensity and livestock type, but none of the studied characteristics was affected by livestock type in itself. Increasing Rao dissimilarity index peaking at the fourth grazing intensity level was detected, but for other multitrait indices, no such changes were proven, except for functional divergence, which was the lowest at the first intensity level. Graminoid, forb, and litter biomass were significantly affected by intensity, but none of the biomass fractions was affected by livestock type.
   Conclusions: We suggest that for the management of sand grasslands, grazing intensity should be carefully adjusted, considering not only livestock units per hectare. For practical recommendations, well-defined, long-term experiments studying different livestock and habitat types along an intensity gradient would be essential.

AB  - Hydropower plants have been developed globally to provide renewable energy, increase water supply and help with flood control. Meanwhile, hydropower impacts on riverscape and aquatic species are widely documented. However, little attention has been paid to impacts on large semi-aquatic animals such as crocodylians, turtles, and otters, which are prone to environmental changes associated with hydropower development. We conducted a systematic mapping of evidence documented in the published literature and synthesised the effects of hydropower development on semi-aquatic megafauna (i.e., semi-aquatic animals with a reported maximum body mass >= 30 kg). We identified 68 relevant impact records from 30 studies, which demonstrated that hydropower plants profoundly altered the habitats of semi-aquatic megafauna and affected their interactions with humans and domestic animals. Hydropower plants posed adverse impacts on the distribution, fitness, movement, nutrition, and reproduction of semi-aquatic megafauna. Positive impacts, such as increased suitable habitats and available food resources associated with land cover change, were also observed in some instances. Our study reveals a considerable information gap on effects of hydropower development at the land-water interface and underscores the gaps in current assessments, such as the lack of monitoring schemes that compare the situations of semi- aquatic species before and after dam construction. It also emphasises priority regions for monitoring and conservation schemes, particularly in tropic regions that are experiencing rapid hydropower development. We highlight the need to incorporate hydropower impacts on semi-aquatic animals into planning and management of renewable energy infrastructure for better informed decisions on energy production and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Mountainous grasslands in South America, characterized by their high diversity, provide a wide range of contributions to people, including water regulation, soil erosion prevention, livestock feed provision, and preservation of cultural heritage. Prior research has highlighted the significant role of grazing in shaping the diversity and productivity of grassland ecosystems, especially in highly productive, eutrophic systems. In such environments, grazing has been demonstrated to restore grassland plant diversity by reducing primary productivity. However, it remains unclear whether these findings are applicable to South American mountainous grasslands, where plants are adapted to different environmental conditions. To address this uncertainty, we conducted a meta-analysis of experiments excluding livestock grazing to assess its impact on plant diversity and productivity across mountainous grasslands in South America. In alignment with studies in temperate grasslands, our findings indicated that herbivore exclusion resulted in increased aboveground biomass but reduced species richness and Shannon diversity. The effects of grazing exclusion became more pronounced with longer durations of exclusion; nevertheless, they remained resilient to various climatic conditions, including mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature, as well as the evolutionary history of grazing. In contrast to results observed in temperate grasslands, the reduction in species richness due to herbivore exclusion was not associated with increased aboveground biomass. This suggests that the processes governing (sub)tropical grassland plant diversity may differ from those in temperate grasslands. Consequently, further research is necessary to better understand the specific factors influencing plant diversity and productivity in South American montane grasslands and to elucidate the ecological implications of herbivore exclusion in these unique ecosystems.

AB  - Years of fire suppression, decreases in herbivores, and global climate change have led to shifts in savannas worldwide. Natural open vegetation such as grasslands and shrublands is increasing in wood density, but the effects for small mammals are not well understood. While most of the mammal studies from the Brazilian Cerrado are concentrated in the core area of this large Neotropical savanna, its southern portions are suffering from biome shifting through woody encroachment. Herein, we surveyed a small mammal community from the southeastern boundary of Cerrado (Santa Barbara Ecological Station) and evaluated the micro and macro environmental variables shaping community structure in order to investigate how the woody encroachment in the last 15 years may have influenced this assemblage. We recorded 17 species of marsupials and rodents along five distinct habitats in a gradient from grasslands to woodlands. Although richness was not affected by microhabitat variables, total and relative abundance varied according to habitat type and in relation to herbaceous, shrub, and tree density. Rodents such as Calomys tener and Clyomys laticeps were positively affected by increasing herb cover, Cerradomys scotti and Oligoryzomys nigripes by shrub cover, while the marsupial Didelphis albiventris had higher association with increasing tree cover. We detected an increase of 27.4% in vegetation density (EVI) between 2003 and 2018 in our study site, and this woody encroachment negatively affected the abundance of some small mammals. The open-area specialists Cryptonanus chacoensis and C. scotti had a decrease in abundance, while D. albiventris and O. nigripes were favored by woody encroachment. Our data suggest that woody encroachment is shifting community composition: small mammals often associated with grasslands and open savannas are likely to be negatively affected by woody encroachment; while species that rely on tree-covered habitats are likely to benefit from an increasing woody landscape. Therefore, forest-dwellers are gradually replacing open-vegetation inhabitants. Active management of open formations (e.g., with prescribed burning) may be needed to maintain Cerrado biodiversity, especially considering the open-area endemics.

AB  - Macrotermes termite mounds in the Kruger National Park occupy a significant part of the savanna landscapes, occurring at densities of up to 70 km-2 and often exceeding 10 m in width and 4 m in height. The mounds are usually devoid of trees, but have dense grass cover in wet years. As a result, these mounds form large patches of grassland amongst the wooded savanna. To our knowledge, it is not known why trees are largely excluded from the mounds. We analysed soil surface nutrient concentrations on and off mounds (0-2 cm deep, n = 80) to ascertain whether the availability of nutrients could be influencing competition between grasses and tree seedlings. The results showed that potential deficiencies in P, Ca, Cu, Zn and B in soils off the mounds are likely to be constraining plant growth. Notably, only B, with an average concentration of 0.19 mg kg-1, was likely to be limiting plant growth on the mounds. Notwithstanding likely interactions with herbivory and fire, we hypothesise that because grasses are far less susceptible to deficiencies of B than dicotyledonous trees, it is likely that grass competition with tree seedlings is considerably greater on mounds than off mounds.

AB  - In the context of global biodiversity loss and climate change, understanding how herbivores and fire shape plant-soil nutrient dynamics across vegetation types has become a global priority. In tropical Asia, the combined effects of herbivore assemblages, fire regimes, and plant community diversity on nutrients remain poorly understood. We investigated how herbivory and fire influence soil nutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and cation exchange capacity (CEC)) and plant nutrients (N, P, K), across five vegetation types-two forests (riverine, Shorea) and three grasslands (tall, short, grazing lawn) in Chitwan National Park, Nepal. Across 50 plots (400 m2 each), we quantified mammalian herbivory pressure using dung counts, fire frequency using satellite data, and analyzed 150 soil and 187 plant samples for nutrient concentrations. Herbivore dung and fire frequency varied markedly across habitats: herbivores were largely absent from tall grasslands while present in all other vegetation types, whereas fires were rare in short grassland and grazing lawns but frequent in tall grassland and forests. Overall, forests had higher soil and plant nutrient concentrations than grasslands. Soil N, K, and CEC increased with increasing dung counts across vegetation types, whereas plant K decreased with increasing dung counts only in Shorea forests and grazing lawns. Soil P and CEC increased, while plant N, P and K decreased with increasing fire frequency across vegetation types. For the two forest types, interactions between dung and fire counts decreased soil P, plant N and plant P in riverine forest but had no effect in Shorea forest. These findings highlight the additive and interactive impacts of herbivory and fire on nutrient cycling, emphasizing the need to manage disturbance regimes to sustain soil fertility, habitat quality, and biodiversity resilience in tropical landscapes.

AB  - Large herbivores play a key role in terrestrial ecosystems, and their populations alter the plant composition in many ecosystems. One example is deer, whose populations in the Northern Hemisphere have increased over the last decades. This has resulted in increased browsing pressure on saplings and, as a consequence, has hampered forest regeneration in some areas. Such herbivore-induced changes in the regeneration of forest stands have changed their composition and biodiversity. Although there is an established link between the deer population density and the level of damage caused by browsing, the question remains open: What is the effect of increasing deer density over years on the regeneration of palatable and less browsing-resistant tree species? In this study, we investigated the relationships between the regeneration dynamics of five tree species (European beech Fagus sylvatica, silver fir Abies alba, sycamore Acer pseudoplatanus, hornbeam Carpinus betulus, and oak Quercus spp.) and browsing pressure in two years with low and high red deer (Cervus elaphus) density and at similar roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) density. We set up experimental plots in Roztocze National Park (central-eastern Poland), a protected area where natural predators of deer are constantly present. In addition to deer density, we analysed parameters that may affect browsing intensity: height of saplings, forage availability (sapling density), sapling diversity and light intensity (canopy openness). We found that increasing red deer density significantly increased browsing on all tree species, with saplings taller than 50 cm being under the strongest pressure. Moreover, higher deer density altered deer forage selection - it increased their selection for unpalatable European beech and decreased for highly preferred sycamore. Additionally, more species-diverse patches and closed canopy attracted deer and increased the probability of browsing on saplings. Contrary to our predictions, sapling density decreased browsing intensity. The study confirms that high ungulate density has significant effects on tree recruitment and may alter tree species composition of the forest stand. We provide clear evidence that deer herbivory plays a crucial role in tree regeneration in top-down processes in natural ecosystems.

AB  - Invasive species are major drivers of ecosystem degradation globally. How invasive herbivore impacts differ from native herbivore impacts remains understudied. We examined the relationships between herbivore sign and vegetation height, foliage density, cover of forbs, weeds, bare ground, and soil compaction across environmental and herbivore activity gradients in the mainland Australian Alps. We detected native and exotic herbivore sign at 32.8% and 94.0% of sites, respectively. Total herbivore activity was primarily attributed to exotic herbivores and was associated with elevation and grassland type. Greater horse (exotic) activity was associated with lower vegetation height, lower foliage density, higher forb cover, and higher soil compaction. Greater rabbit and hare (exotic) activity was associated with lower vegetation height, lower foliage density, and a higher cover of bare ground. Greater total herbivore activity was associated with greater weed cover. Neither deer (exotic) nor kangaroo and wallaby (native) activity was related to response variables. We demonstrate that exotic herbivores dominate mammalian herbivory in these grasslands, which evolved without analogous hooved species. Given the restricted distribution and high endemism of these ecosystems, and associations between exotic herbivores and characteristics of degraded grasslands, we recommend landscape-scale exotic herbivore management, focusing on maintaining ground cover and vegetation structure.

AB  - Understanding whether invasive and native species compete for shared resources where they co-occur is essential for mitigating the negative impacts of invasive species on native ecosystems. Here, we examined how the presence and density of an invasive species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa), affect native white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter, deer) on the Savannah River Site, SC, USA. We examined potential changes in deer areas of use, temporal overlap, and occupancy to evaluate the effects of wild pig occurrence and density on deer space use, diel activity, and co-occurrence with wild pigs across 9 months during 2018 and 2019. Wild pig density had the strongest effect on deer space use in high- and moderate-use areas. Declines in deer space use in response to wild pig density were most pronounced in March and October 2018 and April 2019 for females, while male space use declined in response to wild pig density in October and December 2018. Both species were largely nocturnal with high overlap in diel activity across months. Deer occupancy responses to wild pig density varied across months, with negative responses in May and October 2018 and positive responses in July 2018 and April 2019. Deer and wild pigs co-occurred at 30%-59% of camera stations across months, with broadscale co-occurrence patterns being unaffected by changes in shared cover or wild pig occurrence. Overall, our results suggest that deer make fine-scale behavioral adjustments to avoid wild pigs, providing evidence that competition is likely occurring even where wild pig density is relatively low. Such fine-scale behavioral plasticity in deer appears to mitigate the costs of competition with wild pigs and may be a mechanism enabling long-term co-existence of deer and wild pigs. Our study provides novel insight on the complexities of spatiotemporal relationships between invasive wild pigs and native deer and suggests that the negative effects of interactions between deer and wild pigs may be more pronounced when deer life history needs are particularly demanding. In areas where eradication of invasive wild pigs may be impossible, maintaining low wild pig densities may help mitigate, but may not eliminate, the negative effects of wild pigs on deer.

AB  - Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) Vulnerable in the IUCN red list, and any population should be the subject of scientific attention. Both ungulates were monitored for a year in the Nador Mountains (western Algeria). This is the first record of aoudad in this part of Tiaret province. Both species are partly sympatric. However, the aoudad was sighted only in small numbers in the roughest valleys in the north. The gazelle population is larger, but with few juveniles. The future of these wild ungulates is therefore worrying, and new conservation measures are required, including protecting this area.

AB  - Stable isotopes are a powerful tool for reconstructing the past. However, environmental factors not previously considered can lead to misinterpretations. Our study presents a novel analysis of the feeding behavior of the megafauna that inhabited the Pilauco ecosystem in south-central Chile during the last glacial termination. We analyzed a suite of modern plant and animal samples from closed-canopy forests to establish an isotopic baseline with which to compare stable isotope results from fossil megafauna. Using the modern samples as a reference, the delta C-13 results from the Pilauco megafauna indicate feeding behaviors in forested areas. These results were then calibrated with dental calculus samples and coprolites, which suggest the coexistence of graze- and grass-dominated mixed-feeder diets. The delta N-15 values found in Pilauco megafauna are not consistent with modern reference data sets or with the low delta N-15 values of extinct proboscideans from other contemporaneous and nearby sites. Probably, the delta N-15 values of the Pilauco ecosystem were not primarily affected by climate, but rather by disturbance factors (e.g., grazing effect). Our results indicate that the Pilauco megafauna fed mainly on arboreal vegetation; however, non-isotopic proxies indicate that they were also eating open vegetation (e.g., herbs and grasses).

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the phytosociological data from four sample sites located in the Pannonian region. The study areas, ranging from 2.4 to 2.5 hectares, have been subjected to goat grazing and mowing for 24 years. N1: Nagyr & eacute;de, an overgrazed pasture with 24 goats; N2: Nagyr & eacute;de, a mown field; C1: Csokvaom & aacute;ny, a lightly grazed pasture with 12 goats; and meadow C2: Csokvaom & aacute;ny, a site that is both mown and grazed. Six phytosociological surveys were conducted randomly in each area. We also considered the conservation value, biomass production, and forage values. Phytosociological data were processed using hierarchical cluster analysis and the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. The overgrazed pasture (N1) exhibited the most degraded vegetation community, dominated by weeds and disturbance-tolerant species. The overgrazed (N1) pasture had a low forage value because of the different timing of treatments. Even in the lightly grazed pasture (C1), the proportion of species indicative of degradation was significant. The species composition of the areas indicated that the mown and subsequently grazed area (C2) had outstanding values. The species richness of C2 was twice that of the mown field (N2). Based on the present study, a combination of light grazing pressure and mowing is the most suitable approach for managing and economically utilizing these grasslands.

AB  - Gaur (Bos gaurus) is a globally vulnerable species with a decline of more than 80% of their global distribution in the past 100 years. Understanding the species distribution pattern and associated factors is essential for developing effective conservation strategies. We examined the effects of forest area, human detections, presence of tiger (Panthera tigris), presence of competing species like Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), and sambar deer (Rusa unicolor), and distance to water, on gaur occupancy in Parsa National Park (PNP), Nepal, using camera traps which were deployed at 67 locations from December 2022 to March 2023. We used single season single species occupancy modeling to estimate the relationship of selected covariates with gaur occupancy. We recorded a total of 54 gaur detections in our study. We found that gaur occupancy had a significant positive association with the distance to water bodies and was negatively associated with forest area and the presence of elephants; however, there was no significant association with number of humans detected, or the presence of tigers, or sambar deers. Gaur had greater detection probabilities in southcentral portions of PNP, i.e., flat plains and areas near the Chure region and the lowest detection probabilities in the eastern and western parts of PNP. These findings highlight the importance of considering eco-environmental factors in the management and conservation of gaur, particularly in human-dominated landscapes. We recommend further multi-seasonal studies to better understand the dynamic interactions between gaur, their environment, and other species, to inform effective conservation strategies.

AB  - Over recent years, rural abandonment and climate change have challenged grazed wooded landscapes in Mediterranean mountain regions. Fire hazard management procedures such as grazing, prescribed burning, or mechanical clearing must be adjusted to the new socioeconomic and environmental situation and according to the context and circumstances of each territory. This study contributes to adjusting vegetation management techniques in response to low grazing pressure by evaluating the combined effect of mechanical clearing and grazing on the structural and floristic dynamics of understory vegetation in the open-grazed Mediterranean oak forests of northern Portugal. To this end, three treatments were established: mechanical clearing with grazing, mechanical clearing without grazing, and grazing without clearing (the control). The floristic inventories were carried out using the point quadrat method, and the structure was evaluated using line transects. Herbaceous biomass was determined by destructive methods. This study shows that mechanical vegetation clearing effectively reduces phytovolume and, thus, fire hazards. However, for its effects to endure, it must be combined with subsequent grazing, which does not always occur. No consistent pattern was found in the floristic dynamics of the shrub-grassland mosaic (species richness and diversity) related to shrub-clearing or grazing over the short term (24 months).

AB  - Megaherbivores are experiencing a global extinction crisis before we fully understand their ecological functions. While the role of megaherbivores as ecosystem engineers-enhancing environmental structure complexity and facilitating seed dispersal-is well-documented, their influence on animal community assemblies remains less explored, especially in tropical forests. This knowledge gap is crucial for effective, functional-oriented conservation planning. Therefore, we investigated the association between Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) and mammalian community assemblages-from community to species level-in tropical forests of Southwest China, using long-term monitoring data from camera traps. Our results revealed that the presence of Asian elephants was associated with a more robust co-occurrence network within mammalian communities. Additionally, elephants were positively correlated with the abundance of mammal species, especially ungulates and primates. At the species level, while some mammals temporarily avoided Asian elephants, most retained their diel activity patterns, presumably because they were neither in a predator-prey relationship nor intense competitors. Our results show that Asian elephants not only affect vegetation but also are associated with a more robust mammalian community. Consequently, protecting elephants is a pivotal conservation action towards maintaining robust animal communities in Asian tropical forests.

AB  - Grassy vegetation is widely spread across Southeast Asia, yet very little data exists describing the diversity in these plant communities. Groundlayer diversity data is especially rare, with previous studies focussing on woody plants. Research in grassy ecosystems worldwide suggest that there are substantial differences in grassland community composition across climate aridity gradients, which are aligned with a switch from strong disturbance by fire in wetter sites to disturbance by mammalian herbivory in drier sites. The aim of this investigation was to record the groundlayer diversity of grasslands found in northern Sumatra Island, Indonesia, and to determine whether that diversity was structured fire and mammalian herbivory. We sampled ten 50 m x 50 m vegetation plots in grassy vegetation across an aridity gradient, with soil data and grazing pressure data collected on site, and climate and fire frequency data compiled from geographic resources. We classified all species according to two morphological characteristics that related to plant evolution under fire and herbivory, namely stem form and leaf placement. We recorded 89 groundlayer species across all plots, with an average of 29 species per plot. Our analysis confirmed that the strongest axis of community differentiation was with respect to the fire-grazing trade-off axis, which selected for specific adaptive stem and leaf placement morphologies. The groundlayer diversity of grasslands in northern Sumatra is closely related to other monsoonal regions of Southeast Asia, likely reflecting grassland connectivity during the last ice age. The abundance of disturbance-adapted species suggests appropriate use of fire and herbivory will be necessary to sustain these communities.

AB  - Herbivory is one of the important factors that influence spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in grasslands. In this study, we focused on plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) to investigate the effects of the presence of small semi-fossorial herbivores and their disturbance intensity on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in alpine meadows across three sites in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A random stratified paired sampling method was used to collect vegetation data, and plant species richness at both fine and coarse scales were used to estimate the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation. This study showed that the presence of plateau pikas led to higher spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in alpine meadows, which increased linearly as the disturbance intensities of plateau pikas increased. The findings of this study demonstrate that small semi-fossorial herbivores have an important impact on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation, and present a possible approach for estimating the effect of the presence of a small semi-fossorial herbivore and its disturbance intensity on the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in grasslands.

AB  - Recently, plant DNA analysis of feces has been successfully used to evaluate the food species composition of sika deer Cervus nippon. Here, we applied this method to Yaku-sika C. nippon yakushimae, which increased its population and had a great negative impact on understory vegetation in Yakushima Island. We identified food plants of C. nippon yakushimae by sequencing chloroplast DNA fragments (rbcL region) of plants remaining in feces collected in the field in April, June, August, and October 2018, using a next-generation sequencer. We collected feces from populations in two areas where populations have been managed by capture and three areas where those were not managed. The top two food plants in terms of the number of sequences determined were evergreen tall trees in all five areas. In addition to evergreen trees, understory herbaceous plants, including ferns, were included in the top 15 taxa in all areas. The diversity of food plants was higher in the managed areas than in the unmanaged areas. These results indicate that evergreen tall trees are the primary food plants of C. nippon yakushimae, but deer also forage on herbaceous plants as a side dish. Under this side dish effect, understory vegetation is reduced even under the high availability of food resources from tall trees. The high diversity of food plants in the managed areas suggested that understory plant diversity was restored when deer density was reduced by management.

AB  - Deer, both native and non-native, can damage forest ecosystems when occurring at high densities, impacting biodiversity and ecological functioning at multiple levels. The ecological drivers of forest damage and the roles of single and multiple co-occurring deer species are not well understood due to a scarcity of simultaneous high resolution multi-species deer distribution and forest damage data. Here, we aimed to disentangle the relationship between forest damage, forest characteristics and the roles deer play in damaging forest ecosystems. To achieve this, we integrated novel high resolution deer distribution data for multiple deer species (native and non-native) with forest inventory data collected in 1,681 sampling stations across Ireland to (i) understand environmental drivers of damage, and (ii) demonstrate the utility of this approach in providing predicted damage scenarios based on the relative abundance of different co-occurring deer species. We found that forest characteristics played a key role in the severity and type of damage risk that deer posed. All damage types were more prevalent in forests with greater tree densities where deer are more likely to find refuge from human disturbance. Bark stripping damage was more prevalent in mature forests with high tree diversity and ground level flora (e.g., bryophytes, herbs, and shrubs). Similarly, browsing damage was more prevalent in forests with greater tree richness but with understorey vegetation dominated by grass and ferns. Fraying damage was more common in mixed woodlands with understories dominated by bryophytes and grass. Crucially, we found that type and severity of forest damage were shaped by the interaction of multiple deer species occurring simultaneously, particularly at high densities, suggesting subtle inter-species competition and exclusion/partition dynamics that require further investigation to understand the ecological mechanism. Finally, we developed predicted damage scenarios to precisely predict where damage is likely to occur based on relative densities of two co-occurring deer species. We predicted high levels of damage in sika and/or red deer hotspots, matching areas of highly concentrated deer distributions. Our study highlights the ecological drivers of deer -caused forest damage, the role that co-occurring native and non-native deer species may play on forest damage within a large spatial scale and describes an approach that can be replicated in other countries with similar datasets. By combining reliable species distribution models with the national forest inventory data, we can now provide a useful tool for practitioners to help alleviate and mitigate forest damage and human wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Woody-plant encroachment is a global phenomenon that has been affecting the southwestern United States since the late 1800s. Drought, overgrazing, herbivory, and competition between grasses and shrub seedlings have been hypothesized as the main drivers of shrub establishment. However, there is limited knowledge about the interactions among these drivers. Using a rainfall manipulation system and various herbivore exclosures, we tested hypotheses about how precipitation (PPT), competition between grasses and shrub seedlings, and predation affect the germination and first-year survival of mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), a shrub that has encroached in Southern Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert grasslands. We found that mesquite germination and survival (1) increased with increasing PPT, then saturated at about the mean growing season PPT level, (2) that competition between grasses and shrub seedlings had no effect on either germination or survival, and (3) that herbivory by small mammals decreased seedling establishment and survival, while ant granivory showed no effect. In addition to its direct positive effect on survival, PPT had an indirect negative effect via increasing small mammal activity. Current models predict a decrease in PPT in the southwestern United States with increased frequency of extreme events. The non-linear nature of PPT effects on Mesquite recruitment suggests asymmetric responses, wherein drought has a relatively greater negative effect than the positive effect of wet years. Indirect effects of PPT, through its effects on small mammal abundance, highlight the importance of accounting for interactions between biotic and abiotic drivers of shrub encroachment. This study provides quantitative basis for developing tools that can inform effective shrub management strategies in grasslands and savannas.

AB  - The root causes of forest tree regeneration failure are difficult to resolve, although numerous studies show ungulate herbivory, soil conditions, and competition from undesirable vegetation as likely contributors. To better understand the relative importance of each issue, we conducted a 7-year manipulative experiment to assess the interactive effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) herbivory, soil acidity, and competing vegetation on tree regeneration in oak-hickory forests of central Pennsylvania, USA. Outcomes depended on initial tree seedling abundance, and all three factors had significant interactions. At low initial seedling abundance, fencing resulted in the greatest increase, but all treatments had a positive effect on seedling growth and abundance. At higher initial seedling abundance, abundance failed to recover 7 years after herbicide treatment and soil pH was an important predictor. When soil pH was >4.6 from lime application, seedling growth and abundance in unfenced controls with high initial abundance was comparable to the fenced-only treatment. Competing vegetation, assumed to be a symptom of excessive, long-term deer herbivory, does not seem to be the primary factor limiting tree regeneration in our study area. Ameliorating acid deposition warrants greater consideration as a management action because it could provide long-lasting benefits compared to short-term fence installations.

AB  - In the context of the biodiversity crisis, trophic rewilding became an important (but controversial) management practice to restore biological interactions and ecological processes. The success of this practice relies on the richness and abundance of other organisms, mainly invertebrates. In the Ibera wetlands of Argentina, a rewilding project reintroduced large herbivores locally extinct (the Tapir and Pampas deer, among others). Taking advantage of this project, we explored taxonomic and functional changes in dung beetle assemblages associated with replacing domestic livestock with native mammals. In five replicates, we sampled dung beetles with seven different baits, estimated temperature and grass eight and described landscape composition (forest and grassland cover). Through lineal and mixed models, NMDS and ANOSIM, we compared the taxonomic and functional dung beetle structure in both areas and explored the role of environmental variables. Trophic rewilding did not change dung beetle richness and the trophic structure of assemblages; however, it strongly modified the composition of species and their functional structure. Both areas shared 40 % of species. Species associated with cow dung (such as the exotic. D. gazella) became rare or disappeared in rewilded areas. Roller species dominated rewilded areas, whereas livestock areas exhibited a large abundance of burying species. The trophic rewilding changed dung beetle assemblages in the Iber ' a partially due to changes in the diversity of available dung but also on environmental conditions. Rewilding should include the medium and long-term evaluation of other taxa and ecological processes to quantify the conservation and functional value of species reintroduction.

AB  - The introduction of exotic herbivores to islands is one of the most harmful challenges to the conservation of insular biodiversity, causing the extinction or geographical reduction of many plant species worldwide and motivating conservation actions from environmental managers. Here, we evaluated the recovery of plant communities, specifically the endangered Medicago citrina, on a small islet close to Ibiza (Western Mediterranean Basin) after the complete eradication of introduced rabbits (fully eradicated in 2016). To evaluate the variation of plant richness and coverage, five permanent plots were installed in 2015 to record over five years. Additionally, an exhaustive census geolocating all M. citrina individuals was carried out in 2019. Total vegetation cover, plant richness and Shannon's diversity index significantly increased throughout the study period. We counted 2,322 M. citrina individuals over 15 cm tall and a large number of seedlings. Therefore, this population not only successfully recovered, but also established the largest population in the entire geographic distribution of this species. The demographic structure is dominated by young individuals and a few large individuals, and the distribution across the island is heterogeneous since the largest spots of individuals were located in ravines where air currents probably provided seeds from plants located in inaccessible cliffs. However, the appearance of the invasive insect Icerya purchasi now threats the population of M. citrina as it feeds on the tissues of adult plants and compromises its development and survival. This study proves the eradication of herbivores is the most efficient way to conserve vulnerable species.

AB  - Aim: Pre-degradation baseline conditions (references) provide crucial context for restoration actions. Here, we compare vegetation structure and its driving processes across the main pre-agricultural references discussed for temperate Europe: the Last Interglacial and the early-mid Holocene-before and after the arrival of Homo sapiens, respectively.
   Location: Temperate Europe.
   Time Period: The first similar to 4000-6000 years, excluding the initial early-successional phases, of the Last Interglacial (PAAZ III) and Holocene (8700-5700 BP).
   Major Taxa StudiedPlants.
   Methods: We use large datasets of pollen-based vegetation reconstructions (REVEALS) to compare open vegetation, light woodland and closed forest between the two periods. We use Random Forest modelling and downscaled climate data to assess whether climate-vegetation relations were consistent between periods, as expected if they reflected direct climatic effects on vegetation.
   Results: Open vegetation was slightly higher in the early-mid Holocene than in the Last Interglacial, averaging 20% versus 16% in paired grid cells, respectively. In contrast, light woodland cover was lower in the early-mid Holocene, with mean values of 49% compared to 57% in paired cells. The combined open vegetation and light woodland cover was high in both periods, averaging 73% in the Last Interglacial and 69% in the early-mid Holocene. Closed forest cover was similar across both periods (Holocene = 24%; Last Interglacial = 23%). Notably, openness -climate relations from the early-mid Holocene cannot predict open vegetation in the Last Interglacial.
   Main Conclusions: These findings suggest that vegetation in the early-mid Holocene and Last Interglacial was affected by persistent, substantial disturbances, which were not controlled by direct climate effects, and that the main drivers differed between the periods, with the rich megafauna of the Last Interglacial and Mesolithic people as the primary candidates. Our findings support that early-mid Holocene ecosystems were already strongly shaped by Homo sapiens and differed from earlier temperate ecosystems.

AB  - Seascape context is pivotal in shaping the abundance and diversity of fishes within coastal seascapes. However, pervasive human disturbances modify the composition of coastal seascapes, necessitating a thorough understanding of how these effects interact to influence ecosystems, which is critical for implementing effective conservation and management plans. In coastal ecosystems such as exposed rocky headlands and their abutting rocky reefs, these influences remain largely unquantified, thereby limiting effective management of this crucial coastal landform. We sampled fish assemblages around 12 rocky headlands across 300 km of coastline over two seasons (austral spring and winter) in eastern Australia with baited remote underwater video systems. We aimed to determine how seascape context, benthic habitat composition, exposure, and human disturbance shape fish community composition, and the abundance of harvested species, functional feeding groups and key indicator species around rocky headlands. Seascape context and human disturbance were important in shaping fish assemblages around rocky headlands. Sites that were less than 2.5 km from estuaries contained a greater species richness and a higher abundance of piscivores. Sites more than 0.9 km from urban land supported a greater species richness and a higher total fish abundance. Sites that had more than 2.5 km2 of reef nearby supported a greater species richness and herbivore abundance, while those with 2-3.5 km2 of reef nearby supported a higher abundance of omnivores and harvested fishes. In contrast, sites with less than 1 km2 of reef nearby supported a higher abundance of zoobenthivores. These results highlight the combined effects of human disturbance and seascape context on the abundance, diversity, and functional group composition of coastal fishes. Minimising the extent of urbanisation and prioritising the conservation of rocky headlands and their abutting reefs near estuaries with greater reef area, is, therefore, essential for maintaining biodiversity and fisheries productivity in coastal seascapes.

AB  - Coastal marine ecosystems are integral in providing numerous ecosystem functions and services. However, intense and chronic anthropogenic stressors often impact marine ecosystems surrounding highly urbanized, densely populated coastal megacities. The associated reduction of water quality and biodiversity of these ecosystems potentially erodes ecosystem functions and provision of services. While there is general consensus that greater biodiversity supports a multitude of ecosystem functions, evidence from marine ecosystems in real-world settings is lacking. In this study, we evaluated the influence of water quality on benthic and fish assemblages, as well as quantified six key ecosystem functions in coastal waters of Hong Kong. Hong Kong's marine ecosystems are marred with long-term damage that is directly linked with rapid economic growth and anthropogenic activities. We found that water quality significantly affected community composition and clustered assemblages into separate groups related to strength of impact: high impact sites were generally dominated by bivalves and small, opportunistic organisms such as damselfish (Pomacentrinae) and cardinalfish (Apogonidae); low impact sites were dominated by macroalgae, bryozoa, and commercially important piscivores such as groupers (Epinephelinae) and seabreams (Sparidae). Ecosystem function tests showed that low impact sites were much more productive than high impact sites, with 15-times greater macroalgal cover and 5-times higher fish biomass. On the other hand, herbivory and predation rates were context-dependent due to underlying biodiversity effects such as selection, complementarity, and competition. Eutrophication increased decomposition and reduced carbon sequestration, but excessive nutrient input could have suppressed decomposer activities via hypoxia. Therefore, we show that in high impact sites where top-down control is removed, resilient and opportunistic organisms such as cardinalfishes and sea urchins may expand to fulfill functional roles, effectively maintaining ecosystem functions such as predation and herbivory in degraded habitats. Contrary to general consensus, this study demonstrates the merit in conserving even highly impacted marine habitats due to their persistent ecosystem functionality despite chronic water quality issues and shifts in benthic and fish assemblages.

AB  - Rangeland simplification is a global threat to biodiversity. Historically, rangelands exhibited varied vegetation structure, which provided a diverse wildlife habitat. Vegetation heterogeneity resulted from interactions between topoedaphic (inherent heterogeneity) and disturbance factors (imposed heterogeneity). Until recently, these interactive sources of heterogeneity have been ignored in rangeland management and study. Under an emerging paradigm that embraces heterogeneity, contributions of disturbance and topoedaphic conditions to rangeland biodiversity remain largely unknown. Using the avian community, we assessed the effects of wetland area, ecological site, and topographic roughness (inherent heterogeneity) and four grazing strategies (imposed heterogeneity; patch-burn grazing with one or two seasons of fire, season-long grazing, and modified twice-over rotational grazing with variably stocked paddocks) on vegetation structure, avian diversity, avian community composition, and avian densities. The interaction between inherent and imposed heterogeneity influenced avian community composition but not species-specific densities. The effects of management on vegetation structural heterogeneity varied over years, though patch-burn management generated heterogeneity and temporal stability in vegetation structure compared to season-long grazing and modified twice-over rotational grazing. Patch-burn and season-long grazing pastures had higher diversity than modified twice-over rotational grazing. Community composition was sensitive to ecological site, topographic roughness, and wetland area, suggesting that both the fire-grazing interaction and inherent heterogeneity maintain biodiversity. Out of our six grassland obligate focal bird species, two responded to inherent heterogeneity, while three were most sensitive to imposed heterogeneity. One species, western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta), did not respond to either source of heterogeneity, potentially indicating responsiveness to factors outside our study, such as annual precipitation or heterogeneity at fine scales. Our results indicate that both inherent and imposed heterogeneity are important in shaping grassland bird abundance, diversity, and community composition and that conserving rangeland biodiversity in the future will require managing for greater imposed heterogeneity while embracing existing landscape variability.

AB  - Wildfires are among the most serious disturbances that affect forest biodiversity, damaging both flora and fauna. In some burned areas, vegetation recovery is a long and complex process that requires the support of restorative actions. This study evaluated changes in forest structural features after a fire that affect habitat suitability for Rhinocryptids, an endemic group of bird species that are indicators of biodiversity in the temperate forests of South America. The study area was the Malleco National Reserve, Chile, where the main ecosystems are temperate forests. Four species from the Rhinocryptidae family of birds were used as bioindicator species. This group of species is endemic to temperate forests in South America. After fires occurred in 2002 and 2015, affecting temperate forests dominated by several Nothofagus species, two field inventories were carried out in 2016 and 2018. These inventories recorded the presence of Rhinocryptids and some forests structural features. Differences between the two stages of forest regeneration were assessed using statistical tests (T-test and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) and a classification model was proposed to determine the presence of Rhinocryptidae species. The statistical analysis of forest structural features showed that the variables more relevant in the habitat recuperation are vertical stratification (p-value < 0.001) and understory cover (p-value = 0.053). The trained decision tree to predict the presence of Rhinocryptidae species had an accuracy of 65.22%. This model showed that the coexistence of more than one Rhinocryptidae species occurs when vertical stratification is not mono-stratified and the density is lower than 335 trees ha-1. Our results can help forest managers to consider forest structure as a suitable habitat for certain major wildlife species when implementing post-fire recovery plans.

AB  - Compound disturbances are anticipated to increase under global change, potentially resulting in unpredictable forest recovery dynamics, especially in managed forests where salvage logging is often routine, yet studies quantifying forest resilience to compound disturbances are still scarce. We investigated resilience to an ice storm event, followed by a spruce bark beetle outbreak and subsequent salvage logging in a temperate sub-montane forest landscape in Slovenia. The study landscape was characterized by a gradient in pre-disturbance proportion of spruce, an important species for the forest economy, ranging from mixed fir-beech-spruce forest to spruce monocultures. Given that the bark beetle only affected spruce, this gradient in spruce proportion provided an opportunity to investigate forest resilience across a severity gradient ranging from undamaged areas to complete canopy removal over patches of several hectares. We assessed multiple dimensions of resilience across this disturbance severity gradient, namely i) post-disturbance forest structural and species diversity, ii) radial growth of surviving trees, and iii) post-disturbance regeneration, including measurements made in deer exclosures. The results highlight the low resilience of spruce-dominated stands in terms of low structural and species diversity of the recovering forests, once spruce is removed due to disturbance. However, measures of post-disturbance structural diversity were higher in stands were spruce made up < 50 % of the tree composition. This result may help forest managers to plan how much spruce to maintain in mixture with species less vulnerable to climate change. We also showed that surviving canopy trees with damaged crowns can sustain high radial growth resilience, which calls into question the efficacy of immediate post-disturbance salvaging of damaged trees. Finally, we quantified the detrimental impact of ungulate browsing on the recruitment of post-disturbance regeneration, particularly for highly palatable species, which showed significantly lower aggregate height, a metric combining density and tree height, outside of deer exclosures. We stress the importance of actively controlling ungulate populations for successful post-disturbance recruitment of silviculturally important palatable species, such as silver fir and sycamore maple.

AB  - Relationships between climate, species composition, and species richness are of particular importance for understanding how boreal ecosystems will respond to ongoing climate change. This study aims to reconstruct changes in terrestrial vegetation composition and taxa richness during the glacial Late Pleistocene and the interglacial Holocene in the sparsely studied southeastern Yakutia (Siberia) by using pollen and sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) records. Pollen and sedaDNA metabarcoding data using the trnL g and h markers were obtained from a sediment core from Lake Bolshoe Toko. Both proxies were used to reconstruct the vegetation composition, while metabarcoding data were also used to investigate changes in plant taxa richness. The combination of pollen and sedaDNA approaches allows a robust estimation of regional and local past terrestrial vegetation composition around Bolshoe Toko during the last similar to 35,000 years. Both proxies suggest that during the Late Pleistocene, southeastern Siberia was covered by open steppe-tundra dominated by graminoids and forbs with patches of shrubs, confirming that steppe-tundra extended far south in Siberia. Both proxies show disturbance at the transition between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene suggesting a period with scarce vegetation, changes in the hydrochemical conditions in the lake, and in sedimentation rates. Both proxies document drastic changes in vegetation composition in the early Holocene with an increased number of trees and shrubs and the appearance of new tree taxa in the lake's vicinity. The sedaDNA method suggests that the Late Pleistocene steppe-tundra vegetation supported a higher number of terrestrial plant taxa than the forested Holocene. This could be explained, for example, by the "keystone herbivore" hypothesis, which suggests that Late Pleistocene megaherbivores were able to maintain a high plant diversity. This is discussed in the light of the data with the broadly accepted species-area hypothesis as steppe-tundra covered such an extensive area during the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - In southern Africa, climate change is increasing drought severity and duration. One way to mitigate drought-induced food shortages is supplementary feeding, but ungulate responses are largely unstudied. Here, we analyse similar to 250 h of video footage from camera traps at feeding stations in South Africa during a year when rainfall was similar to 50% of the decadal average. Feeding station usage was highly uneven: eland (Taurotragus oryx), greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), sable (Hippotragus niger) and white rhino (Ceratotherium simum) were over-represented relative to their local population; and impala (Aepyceros melampus), blesbok (Damascus dorxas phillipsi) and zebra (Equus quagga) were under-represented. In total, 81% of individuals at feeding stations fed (0%-90% for different species). Guarding behaviour was observed, especially by eland and kudu, potentially excluding other (smaller) species. Overall, 17% visits involving >= 2 individuals involved intraspecific aggression (highest for sable (40%) and eland (27%); low/absent otherwise); there were very few (n = 6) inter-specific encounters. Lucerne and teff hay were consumed more frequently than Boskos (pellets), which was favoured by non-target primates and ungulates showing guarding behaviour. As benefits of feeding are unequal, and can encourage guarding and intraspecific aggression, we suggest feeding should be done with caution, especially if the aim is to benefit specific species.

AB  - The simplification of forest structural complexity, caused by anthropogenic land-use practices, is one of the main threats to understory specialist birds. We examined the association of both single structural attributes and structural complexity, with the density of 4 understory bird species in the Global Biodiversity Hotspot '' Chilean Winter Rainfall-Valdivian Forests '' of South America. Between 2011 and 2013, we surveyed habitat attributes and conducted bird point counts in 505 plots in Andean temperate ecosystems in Chile. In each habitat plot, we measured understory density, volume of coarse woody debris (CWD), number of snags, diameter at breast height (DBH) of trees, and leaf litter depth. With these attributes, we developed an index of stand structural complexity (ISC). On average, old-growth forests had higher values for understory density, CWD volume, DBH, and litter depth than secondary forests and open fields, and thus greater values of ISC. The density of understory birds was positively correlated with the ISC for the Rhinocryptidae Pteroptochos tarnii, Scelorchilus rubecula, and Scytalopus magellanicus. We also found a positive association between understory density and litter depth, with the density of the Furnariidae Sylviorthorhynchus desmursii. However, this latter species showed a negative association with the density of snags. Our results suggest the utility of using an index of structural complexity, rather than single or even additive habitat attributes, for determining the density of understory specialist birds. We recommend that management plans should promote the retention of habitat attributes that contribute to the structural complexity of temperate forests of South America and beyond.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems are species-rich habitats that are rapidly declining globally posing serious concerns for biodiversity conservation. This situation is particularly relevant in agricultural areas in Europe. As traditional management practices and livestock grazing regimes ceased, rewilding could be a potential avenue to tackle current biodiversity declines. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year experiment where 12 horses were introduced in three 10-hectare enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). Horses were kept without supplementary feeding to mimic ecosystem functions of wild horses. We applied Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Models and a backward stepwise model selection procedure to elucidate factors that modulate insect richness induced by grazing. Our results show that plant species richness, the proportion of flowers and plant height play a significant role for butterfly and bumblebee richness, while the opposite effect was detected for grasshoppers. However, the effect on grasshoppers was counterbalanced by increased grasshopper species richness in habitats adjacent to horse latrines. Implications for insect conservation Rewilding with horses may offset current biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems. Horse grazing can however have different effects on diverse functional groups of insects. Application of integrative landscape scale approaches may be needed to elucidate the effects of rewilding for certain functional groups such as grasshoppers. With current biodiversity declines, up-scaling rewilding research and practice might be crucial to mitigate the pervasive effects on insects as their services and functions are critical for our existence.

AB  - Averting climate change-induced forest diebacks increasingly relies on tree species planted outside of their natural range and on the addition of non-native tree species to mixed-species forests. However, the consequences of such changes for associated biodiversity remain poorly understood, especially for the forest canopy as a largely understudied forest stratum. Here, we used flight interception traps and a metabarcoding approach to study the taxonomic and functional (trophic guilds) composition and taxon richness of canopy arthropods. We sampled 15 monospecific and mixed stands of native European beech, native Norway spruce-planted outside its natural range-and non-native Douglas fir in northwest Germany. We found that the diversity of arthropods was lower in non-native Douglas fir compared with native beech stands. Taxon richness of herbivores was reduced by both conifer species. Other functional guilds, however, were not affected by stand type. Arthropod composition differed strongly between native broadleaved beech and monospecific coniferous (native spruce or non-native Douglas fir) stands, with less pronounced differences between the native and non-native conifers. Beech-conifer mixtures consistently hosted intermediate arthropod diversity and community composition compared with the respective monospecific stands. Moreover, arthropod diversity had a positive relationship with the number of canopy microhabitats. Our study shows that considering arthropod taxa of multiple functional groups reveals the multifaceted impact of non-native tree species on forest canopy arthropod communities. Contrasting with previous studies that primarily focused on the forest floor, we found that native beech hosts a rich diversity of arthropods, compared with lower diversity and distinct communities in economically attractive, and especially in non-native, conifers with few canopy microhabitats. Broadleaf-conifer mixtures did not perform better than native beech stands, but mitigated the negative effects of conifers, making such mixtures a compromise to foster both forest-associated diversity and economic yield.

AB  - Anthropogenic habitat alteration and climate change are two well-known contributors to biodiversity loss through changes to species distribution and abundance; yet, disentangling the effects of these two factors is often hindered by their inherent confound across both space and time. We leveraged a contrast in habitat alteration associated with the jurisdictional boundary between two Canadian provinces to evaluate the relative effects of spatial variation in habitat alteration and climate on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) densities. White-tailed deer are an invading ungulate across much of North America, whose expansion into Canada's boreal forest is implicated in the decline of boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species listed as Threatened in Canada. We estimated white-tailed deer densities using 300 remote cameras across 12 replicated 50 km(2) landscapes over 5 years. White-tailed deer densities were significantly lower in areas where winter severity was higher. For example, predicted deer densities declined from 1.83 to 0.35 deer/km(2) when winter severity increased from the lowest value to the median value. There was a tendency for densities to increase with increasing habitat alteration; however, the magnitude of this effect was approximately half that of climate. Our findings suggest that climate is the primary driver of white-tailed deer populations; however, understanding the mechanisms underpinning this relationship requires further study of over-winter survival and fecundity. Long-term monitoring at the invasion front is needed to evaluate the drivers of abundance over time, particularly given the unpredictability of climate change and increasing prevalence of extreme weather events.

AB  - Understanding the factors regulating temporal variation in grassland annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) is dominated by studying the effects of climate, particularly water, in ungrazed grassland. However, the overwhelming majority of the Earth's grasslands are grazed by large herbivores, which have large effects on ANPP and interact with climate in unknown ways. Here, we analyzed an eight-year dataset of ANPP across a 26-year period that included widely variable climatic conditions and consumption rates by herds of elk (Cervus elaphus), bison (Bison bison), and pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) at 25 grassland sites in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We found that ANPP was primarily a positive function of consumption rate and secondarily affected by a nonlinear temperature effect, with ANPP declining in hot years. Water balance (WB, a measure of soil moisture available to plants) had no significant effect on ANPP. Examining the difference between grazed minus ungrazed (fenced) ANPP (i.e., grazer stimulation) at 13 grassland sites revealed that herbivores increased average ANPP by 20%, with variation across sites and years driven by the amount grazed, temperature, and interactions of temperature with local environment and WB. We found a surprising negative main effect of WB on ANPP stimulation, likely because grazing ameliorated moisture stress in dry years by reducing transpirational moisture loss. Our results demonstrate that Yellowstone grazers override the well-documented positive effect of moisture on grassland ANPP, which highlights the need to understand how together climate and herbivory regulate production in the world's other grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Increasing habitat fragmentation and disturbance threaten long-distance movements of ungulates. While the effects of impermeable barriers on ungulate migrations have been well researched, quantitative evidence for gradual, long-term changes of mobility remains rare.We investigated changes in movement behavior of Mongolian gazelle Procapra gutturosa using GPS tracking data collected from 62 gazelle individuals between 2007 and 2021. We quantified 16-day displacement distances as a metric for long-distance movements before using linear mixed models, generalized additive models and quantile regressions to assess how anthropogenic and environmental factors affected gazelle movement behavior.Long-distance 16-day movements decreased by 36 %, from 142 km in 2007 to 92 km in 2021. Changes in mobility were affected by increasing vehicle numbers in Mongolia, but could not be explained by concurrent changes in other environmental factors like temperature, precipitation or vegetation greenness. Gazelle movement decreased close to roads, and gazelles stayed further away from roads during the snow-free season, when traffic likely is most intense.Conserving landscape permeability is essential for maintaining populations of highly mobile species. Our study provides evidence for a gradual decline in gazelle mobility over fifteen years as a response to increasing anthropogenic impact. The transportation infrastructure permeating the Eastern Steppe does not pose physical barriers, yet our findings suggest that increasing traffic volume may create semipermeable barriers to gazelle movement. As human activity is increasing, interactions between ungulates and vehicle traffic need to be closely monitored to identify and mitigate semipermeable barrier effects before landscape permeability is severely altered.

AB  - The contraction of species range is one of the most significant symptoms of biodiversity loss worldwide. While anthropogenic activities and habitat alteration are major threats for several species, climate change should also be considered. For species at risk, differentiating the effects of human disturbances and climate change on past and current range transformations is an important step towards improved conservation strategies. We paired historical range maps with global atmospheric reanalyses from different sources to assess the potential effects of recent climate change on the observed northward contraction of the range of boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Quebec (Canada) since 1850. We quantified these effects by highlighting the discrepancies between different southern limits of the caribou's range (used as references) observed in the past and reconstitutions obtained through the hindcasting of the climate conditions within which caribou are currently found. Hindcasted southern limits moved similar to 105 km north over time under all reanalysis datasets, a trend drastically different from the similar to 620 km reported for observed southern limits since 1850. The differences in latitudinal shift through time between the observed and hindcasted southern limits of distribution suggest that caribou range recession should have been only 17% of what has been observed since 1850 if recent climate change had been the only disturbance driver. This relatively limited impact of climate reinforces the scientific consensus stating that caribou range recession in Quebec is mainly caused by anthropogenic drivers (i.e. logging, development of the road network, agriculture, urbanization) that have modified the structure and composition of the forest over the past 160 years, paving the way for habitat-mediated apparent competition and overharvesting. Our results also call for a reconsideration of past ranges in models aiming at projecting future distributions, especially for endangered species.

AB  - Tropical forests provide several ecosystem services and functions and support approximately two-thirds of the world's biodiversity but are seriously threatened by deforestation. Approaches to counteract this menace have revolved around afforestation with several or a single tree species. We thus investigated how plantation forests with either a single or several tree species influenced arthropod taxonomic and community composition using pitfall traps to sample selected groups of epigeal arthropods (Araneae, Coleoptera, Orthoptera and Hymenoptera) and with environmental variables assessed simultaneously. Our results revealed 54 taxonomic groups with significantly higher taxonomic richness, activity density, and diversity in the mixed stands than in the monoculture stands. The significant differences in community composition were mainly driven by families including Lycosidae, Formicidae, Staphylinidae, Scotylidae, Hydrophilidae, Gryllidae and Scarabaeidae and were explained by distinct habitat characteristics (canopy openness, litter depth, deadwood volume, and tree height). While the diverse tree communities and heterogeneous vegetation structure offered food and habitat resources for diverse arthropod groups, the allelopathic nature coupled with homogenous stand characteristics of the Tectona grandis stands in the monoculture suppressed the growth of understorey vegetation that could otherwise serve as food and habitat resources for arthropods, which might have led to limited activities and diversity of arthropods in the monoculture plantation stands. The findings thus highlight the need to promote mixed tree plantations in degraded tropical areas, especially when restoring biodiversity is the prime management focus.

AB  - The Buffalo National River is a scenic and ecologically significant resource located in the Ozark Plateau of Arkansas, USA. As a free-flowing and protected river, the Buffalo offers natural benefits to humanity (e.g., food production, carbon storage, recreation), known as ecosystem services. Using both market and survey data, we performed the first comprehensive valuation of the ecosystem services that the Buffalo National River provides to Arkansas residents. The total ecosystem services benefits in 2018 USD were valued at $20.5 million per year ($550/ha). Most of the value was concentrated in cultural services (i.e., recreation, aesthetics, cognitive development), which were responsible for over 70% of total value at $384/ha. Air quality regulation and the provisioning of water also made important contributions to the total, with values of $103/ha and $36/ha, respectively. Our study highlights the considerable economic value provided by the Buffalo National River in its current state. Recent economic activity, in particular intensive agriculture, has threatened these services and in the process created conflicts between different industries. These values are important to consider when making management and policy decisions that affect the region.

AB  - Livestock grazing is a globally important land use and has the potential to significantly influence plant community structure and ecosystem function, yet several critical knowledge gaps remain on the direction and magnitude of grazing impacts. Furthermore, much of our understanding of the long-term effects on plant community composition and structure are based on grazer exclusion experiments, which explicitly avoid characterizing effects along grazing intensity gradients. We sampled big sagebrush plant communities using 68 plots located along grazing intensity gradients to determine how grazing intensity influences multiple aspects of plant community structure over time. This was accomplished by sampling plant communities at different distances from 17 artificial watering sources, using distance from water and cow dung density as proxies for grazing intensity at individual plots. Total vegetation cover and total grass cover were negatively related to grazing intensity, and cover of annual forbs, exotic cover, and exotic richness were positively related to grazing intensity. In contrast, species richness and composition, bunchgrass biomass, shrub density and size, percentage cover of bare ground, litter, and biological soil crusts did not vary along our grazing intensity gradients, in spite of our expectations to the contrary. Our results suggest that the effects of livestock grazing over multiple decades (mean = 46 years) in our sites are relatively small, especially for native perennial species, and that the big sagebrush plant communities we sampled are somewhat resistant to livestock grazing. Collectively, our findings are consistent with existing evidence that indicates the stability of the big sagebrush plant functional type composition under current grazing management regimes.

AB  - Irruption of herbivore populations due to the extirpation of predators has led to dramatic changes in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Herbivores compete with other species for their primary source of nutrition, plant biomass. Such competition is typically considered to occur between species in closely related clades and functional groups but could also occur with detritivores that consume senescent plant biomass. In this study, we tested predictions that in ecosystems where herbivores are not regulated by predators, their indirect impacts on dead vegetation increase with primary productivity and extend to termites that feed on senescent vegetation. We compared dead vegetation cover and termite activity in herbivore exclosures and associated grazed plots at three locations situated along a rainfall gradient in arid Australia where kangaroo populations have irrupted. Dead vegetation cover and termite activity increased with rainfall in ungrazed plots but showed a negligible response to rainfall in grazed plots. Our results suggest that grazing can disrupt the flow of energy to detritivores and decouple the relationship between termite activity and primary productivity. Such disruption could have far-reaching impacts on arid ecosystems because many organisms sit within "brown food webs" that are sustained by energy derived from the decomposition of senescent plant tissues.

AB  - Adaptive governance of areas set aside for future protection of biodiversity, sustainable production, and recreation requires knowledge about whether and how effects of area protection are modulated by climate change and redistribution of species. To investigate this, we compare biodiversity of plants (assessed using vegetation plots) and arthropods (collected with Malaise traps, analyzed using metabarcoding) and productivity (tree growth, determined using dendrochronology) in protected and non-protected oak ( Quercus spp.) forests along a latitudinal gradient (55.6 degrees N- 60.8 degrees N) in Sweden. We also compare historical, recent and projected future climate in the region. In contrast to established global latitudinal diversity gradients, species richness of plants and arthropods increased northwards, possibly reflecting recent climate-induced community redistributions, but neither was higher in protected than in non-protected areas, nor associated with contemporary ground temperature. Species composition of arthropods also did not differ between protected and non-protected areas. Arthropod biomass increased with latitude, suggesting that the magnitude of cascading effects mediated via their roles as pollinators, herbivores, and prey for other trophic levels, varies geographically and will change with a moving climate. Annual growth rate of oaks (an ecosystem service in the form of biomass increase and carbon sequestration) was independent of latitude and did not differ between protected and non-protected areas. Our findings question the efficacy of contemporary designation and management of protected oak forests, and emphasize that development and implementation of modified climate smart conservation strategies is needed to safeguard ecosystem functioning, biodiversity, and recreational values of protected forest areas against future challenges.

AB  - The population of Soay sheep on the island of Hirta in the Outer Hebrides has been the subject of continuous study for more than 35 years. This paper focuses on the botanical aspects of the plant-herbivore interaction, showing how the vegetation affects and is affected by the sheep. Grazing impacts on biomass and spatial structure varied across plant communities, with Holcus/Agrostis grasslands affected most and Wet Heath least, consistent with the hypothesis that herbivore impacts are proportional to plant productivity. Within plant communities, the negative relationships between sheep numbers and plant abundance (sward height, gap/tussock cover and biomass) were significant in March but not significant in August, as expected if sheep numbers are limited by food supply in winter. In most species, flower stem density declined with increasing sheep numbers. There were no examples where unpalatable plants showed increased flowering (e.g. from competitor release under selective grazing). Plant production in temporary grazing exclosures (above-ground net primary production) was greatest in Holcus/Agrostis grassland (12.6 t ha(-1) dry matter year(-1)), lower in Nardus grassland (5.1 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and least in Plantago sward (1.3 t ha(-1) year(-1)) associated with differences in historical nutrient supply and microclimate. The net effect of grazing on plant species richness was positive: A few highly palatable species were excluded, but small-scale coexistence of grazing-tolerant species was enhanced by defoliation. The Soay sheep population fluctuated from 908 (in 1988) to 2,208 (in 2009), increasing by an average of 39 extra animals per year over the period 1985-2011. Between 2011 and 2020, the population fluctuated less widely and showed no trend. Population change (ln(N(t + 1)/N(t))) was inversely density dependent but positively correlated with plant production in Holcus/Agrostis grassland which increased during the study. This plant-herbivore interaction is highly resilient, and though some species (Festuca rubra and Ranunculus acris) declined in the Holcus/Agrostis grassland, there was no significant upward trend in the abundance of unpalatable plant species. Synthesis. Implications for future studies and analyses of plant-herbivore data. Concentrating on estimating primary productivity and herbivore offtake, rather than simply measuring change in plant biomass, is likely to provide greatly improved explanatory power for understanding herbivore population dynamics.

AB  - We assessed the effect of rangeland abandonment on dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity in an African semi-desert region. Dung beetles were sampled on farms that were abandoned either over 10 years ago, abandoned one year ago, or not abandoned. We sampled from tree dominant landscape features including dry riverbeds, flatlands, and hills. We hypothesised that rangeland abandonment would decrease dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity, also testing whether this pattern holds true across the dominant landscape features. Preference experiments revealed that all dung beetle species preferred dung resources other than sheep dung. Contrary to expectations, dung beetle biodiversity and functional richness was higher on abandoned rangelands. The landscape features that were particularly significant in sustaining high dung beetle diversity and functional diversity in this ecosystem were the flatlands and dry riverbeds, the main corridors of movement of animals. We speculate that rangeland abandonment improved conditions for most dung beetle species, due to decreased pressures on remaining native mammal populations. Despite this, larger species that need greater dung resources for development became rare after abandonment. Reintroductions of native mammals should therefore be encouraged to promote dung beetle biodiversity and functional diversity in this semi-desert ecosystem.

AB  - California sage scrub (CSS) is an endangered, shrub-dominated, southern California ecosystem type threatened by increasing fire frequencies and conversion to non-native grasslands. As CSS harbors a rich endemic flora and fauna and is critical for maintaining key ecosystem services; significant attention has been focused on understanding how many key factors (N-deposition, drought, and competition with non-natives) influence post-fire CSS recovery. Unfortunately, few studies have examined the role of herbivores. For five years, we investigated the influence of herbivores on post-fire CSS succession by annually surveying plant assemblages in control (herbivores allowed access) and experimental (herbivore excluded) plots at the Bernard Field Station following a fire in May 2017. We found that herbivores reduce the cover of both invasive grasses and native shrubs, and negatively impact Artemisia californica survivorship. Consequently, post-fire plant restoration efforts should not discount the effects of herbivores. While native forb cover was elevated in plots that permitted herbivores, plots near the fire edge experienced increased herbivory pressure and lower cover of most plants. Despite modifications in plant assemblages, we did not observe differences in soil microbe abundances, fungi assemblage structure, or nutrient concentrations. We suggest that restoration practitioners consider caging 'shrub regeneration' areas to facilitate post-fire CSS recovery.

AB  - The use of mixed forests and non-native tree species have the potential to mitigate climate change impacts and enhance biodiversity. However, little is known about how forest composition and environmental factors affect each step of natural regeneration in mixed forests, especially in mixtures with non-native trees. Here we investigated how forest composition affected European beech seed survival (through seed tracking), seed sprouting (via field germination experiments), and seedling survival (monthly seedling monitoring) in pure beech forests and in admixtures with Norway spruce and the introduced Douglas-fir in a mast and non-mast year of beech. We also assessed how biotic and abiotic factors (small mammal abundance, ungulate access, seed production, seed burial, canopy cover, distance to nearest adult tree, seedling aggregation, understory density, browsing damage, and soil properties) affected these regeneration dynamics. Seed survival was negatively affected by the presence of conifers and mouse abundance. Seed germination was influenced by whether seeds were buried or not. Seedling survival increased in Douglas-fir admixtures, and in forests with higher soil quality. Browsing damage and ungulate access diminished seedling survival. Seed production had the greatest influence on absolute number of seedlings. Forest composition and environmental factors had distinct impacts on regeneration of beech depending on its ontogenetic stage. Here, we provide evidence supporting the notion that Douglas-fir is not impairing the regeneration of native trees in mixed forests. In fact, mixtures with Douglas-fir benefited the survival of beech seedlings, likely due to better soil properties and less damage from herbivores on these stands.

AB  - Conservation areas encompassing elevation gradients are biodiversity hotspots because they contain a wide range of habitat types in a relatively small space. Studies of biodiversity patterns along elevation gradients, mostly on small mammal or bird species, have documented a peak in diversity at mid elevations. Here, we report on a field study of medium and large mammals to examine the impact of elevation, habitat type, and gross primary productivity on community structure. Species richness was observed using a camera trap transect with 219 sites situated across different habitat types from 2329 to 4657 m above the sea level on the western slope of Mt Kenya, the second highest mountain in Africa. We found that the lowest elevation natural habitats had the highest species richness and relative abundance and that both metrics decreased steadily as elevation increased, paralleling changes in gross primary productivity, and supporting the energy richness hypothesis. We found no evidence for the mid-domain effect on species diversity. The lowest elevation degraded Agro-Forestry lands adjacent to the National Park had high activity of domestic animals and reduced diversity and abundance of native species. The biggest difference in community structure was between protected and unprotected areas, followed by more subtle stepwise differences between habitats at different elevations. Large carnivore species remained relatively consistent but dominant herbivore species shifted along the elevation gradient. There was some habitat specialization and turnover in species, such that the elevation gradient predicts a high diversity of species, demonstrating the high conservation return for protecting mountain ecosystems for biodiversity conservation.
   Our study intensively surveyed the western slope of Mt Kenya using a camera trap array covering a 2300 m elevation gradient with 219 sites. We found that relative abundance and species richness decreased as gross primary productivity deceased and elevation increased.image

AB  - The impacts of conflict on nature are devastatingly adverse but differ widely in different socio-economic-political regimes. Armed conflict often facilitates illegal plunder and unsustainable use of natural resources. We studied the response of mammals in Ripu (605.27 sq.km, westernmost part of Manas Tiger Reserve) Reserved Forest (RF) in Assam, India that suffers prolonged anthropogenic pressures due to armed conflict instigated by social unrest. We used standard single-season occupancy models using sign survey to assess factors affecting the space use of mammals. Our study revealed that Ripu RF has a high proportion of area occupied by prey species of large carnivores. Asian elephant, barking deer, and wild pig occupied most of the habitat, whereas gaur, sambar and spotted deer restricted themselves to selected patches. The probability of a site being occupied by the majority of ungulates declines with an increase in anthropogenic activities, including distance to human settlement (measure of prolonged disturbance) and an increase in the proportion of secondary degraded forest. Common leopard was found to be positively associated with prey occupancy and increase in semievergreen and moist-mixed deciduous forest. Our ground efforts to strengthen community patrolling and operational execution of various alternative livelihoods has helped to improve the economic condition of patrolling staff. Strategic implementation of law enforcement could support dispersal of tigers from Phibsoo Wildlife Sanctuary (Bhutan), potentially linked to the larger tiger and elephant landscape far west (Buxa Tiger Reserve in West Bengal) in the Terai region of India. Various community-based conservation initiatives and strategies with sustained support from various agencies, including national, international, and local bodies, is required to restore this critical habitat.

AB  - In the Sierra de Guadarrama National Park (central Spain), the population of Iberian wild goat, also known as Spanish ibex (Capra pyrenaica) has grown strongly since its reintroduction three decades ago. The plant community is now under heavy browsing pressure due to this high population. A study of the presence of moss on rocks was used herein as the basis for the design of an indicator, named impact on mosses (im), to describe the environmental pressure exerted by the Iberian wild goat in terms of moss removal. Granite and gneiss zones at medium altitudes with continental Mediterranean climate are the most suitable areas for successful application of the indicator. The hypotheses to test are: (1) the indicator will discriminate between areas with different wild goat pressure levels, (2) wild goat pressure will explain a high proportion of moss loss variance, and (3) the im indicator will be useful to establish a mathematical model between wild goat pressure and moss loss. The proposed indicator was analyzed using both statistical and data science techniques. The results support the mentioned hypotheses. Specifically, statistically significant differences were found regarding the impact on mosses between areas with different levels of Iberian wild goat pressure. Thus, a high proportion of the variance was associated with wild goat pressure (80% for high-pressure areas, 56% for low-pressure areas). A modified parabolic function was fit to express the relationship between Iberian wild goat pressure and impact on mosses. In conclusion, the im indicator was shown to be a useful tool to assess pressure due to Iberian wild goat. Therefore, im can help assess and manage Iberian wild goat populations and determine their sustainable levels.

AB  - Translocation of animals for conservation has a long history of successes and failures since humans began intervening with species distributions in the early part of the 20th century. Effects of translocations on other species occupying the area of introduction are rarely considered in species management plans. We hypothesized that the introduction of a large-bodied ungulate, Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus canadensis nelsoni), would cause a shift in the spatial distribution and winter habitat selection of a smaller-bodied ungulate, Rocky Mountain mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus hemionus), already occupying the study area in northeastern Nevada. We examined mule deer survey locations during an 8-year time interval from 1993 to 2001 to test hypotheses related to potential competition with or displacement of mule deer following introduction of elk in 1997. We used geospatial statistics to quantify changes in seasonal distributions of mule deer and a resource selection function (RSF) framework to model changes in selection of resources by mule deer before and after elk were translocated into our study area. Our results indicated that mule deer exhibited a shift in their core distribution by approximately 5.72 km after the introduction of elk. Mule deer changed their use of habitat by selecting shallower slopes, more north-facing aspects, and areas farther from the elk release site, where most of the elk congregated. Mule deer selected habitats with more pinyon-juniper tree cover and mixed shrublands prior to the elk translocation, indicating a potential tradeoff in thermal cover and forage quality. This research is one of the few empirical studies to describe competitive interactions between elk and mule deer on a shared winter range in North America. Implications of this research have importance for managers concerned with restoring communities to their native conditions especially where the potential for competition with non-indigenous species or other competing species with similar niche requirements exists.

AB  - Large vertebrates are rarely considered important drivers of conspecific negative density-dependent mortality (CNDD) in plants because they are generalist consumers. However, disturbances like trampling and nesting also cause plant mortality, and their impact on plant diversity depends on the spatial overlap between wildlife habitat preferences and plant species composition. We studied the impact of native wildlife on a hyperdiverse tree community in Malaysia. Pigs (Sus scrofa) are abnormally abundant at the site due to food subsidies in nearby farmland and they construct birthing nests using hundreds of tree saplings. We tagged 34 950 tree saplings in a 25 ha plot during an initial census and assessed the source mortality by recovering tree tags from pig nests (n = 1672 pig-induced deaths). At the stand scale, pigs nested in flat dry habitats, and at the local neighbourhood scale, they nested within clumps of saplings, both of which are intuitive for safe and efficient nest building. At the stand scale, flat dry habitats contained higher sapling densities and higher proportions of common species, so pig nesting increased the weighted average species evenness across habitats. At the neighbourhood scale, pig-induced sapling mortality was associated with higher heterospecific and especially conspecific sapling densities. Tree species have clumped distributions due to dispersal limitation and habitat filtering, so pig disturbances in sapling clumps indirectly caused CNDD. As a result, Pielou species evenness in 400 m(2) quadrats increased 105% more in areas with pig-induced deaths than areas without disturbances. Wildlife induced CNDD and this supported tree species evenness, but they also drove a 62% decline in sapling densities from 1996 to 2010, which is unsustainable. We suspect pig nesting is an important feature shaping tree composition throughout the region.

AB  - Recovering habitat is a central objective for conserving species imperiled by habitat alteration. Yet, determining when habitat is recovered is challenging. For terrestrial wildlife, habitat recovery often focuses on regenerating vegetation, but vegetation changes may provide limited insight as to whether and when habitat is recovered. To be effective as a conservation action, habitat recovery should be linked to demographic responses of the focal species. Moreover, we suggest that habitat recovery be linked to changes in the strength of mechanisms driving population decline. Here, we illustrate such a framework using boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), which are threatened by altered predator-prey dynamics stemming from habitat alteration. Monitoring habitat recovery is challenging for boreal caribou because demographic effects may take decades to manifest and the spatial scale for demographic monitoring is larger than typical disturbance features or restoration projects. To address these challenges, we propose a continuum of habitat recovery where interim, multi-scale indicators are linked to primary mechanisms underlying caribou population declines. Because habitat recovery varies geographically, indicators may need to be refined on a regional basis. Developing stronger inferences on recovery indicators will require adaptive management, where habitat recovery is implemented over larger spatial extents and longer timeframes.

AB  - Temperate forest plant diversity is declining despite increasing conservation efforts. The closed forest paradigm, emphasizing dense, continuous canopy cover, dominates current forest management strategies. However, this approach may overlook the historical role of large herbivores in maintaining semi-open forest conditions. Here we analyse the light and herbivory preferences of 917 native temperate forest plant species across central and western Europe, comparing these preferences with light availability in untouched closed-canopy forests and pasture woodlands. Plant species are 0.1-10 Myr old, with phylogenetic conservatism in habitat affinities (niche optima); thus, their distribution reflects long-term environmental states. We found that most temperate forest plants favour heterogeneous, semi-open-canopy conditions associated with high large-herbivore impacts, rather than uniform closed-canopy environments. On the basis of Red List criteria, high-affinity forest plants associated with higher herbivory and lower herbaceous biomass face higher extinction risk, indicating that low large-herbivore densities drive extinctions in present-day forests. These results align with palaeoecological evidence and high biodiversity in modern open woodlands, suggesting that closed-canopy dominance is a recent consequence of human-driven herbivore loss. Recognizing the role of large herbivores in maintaining semi-open vegetation offers new insights for biodiversity conservation and challenges the suitability of closed-canopy models in forest management.

AB  - Dung beetles are a functionally important group of species, and the effects of large wild herbivores on these species are not well understood. Management of wild herbivores could, therefore, have considerable consequences for dung beetle assemblages and the ecosystem services they provide. Here, we analysed how species richness, biomass, abundance, and composition of dung beetle assemblages were affected by different dung availability as a consequence of different red deer (Cervus elaphus) densities under field conditions. This was done in spring and autumn over four independent study regions in Central Europe where red deer are the most important providers of dung in forests. Our results show that forest sites with high dung availability support higher species richness of dung beetles than sites with low availability. This effect is independent of season and could be explained by the different colonisation patterns of beetle species which vary in their competitiveness. As aggregated dung resources increase opportunities for low-competitive species, those species establish small populations and do not necessarily increase the abundance of the whole assemblage. Our results show that the current policies to limit deer populations also limit higher levels of species diversity of this functionally important arthropod taxon. We highlight the importance of hunting-free areas for the conservation of insect diversity associated with large herbivores. In strictly protected areas with low herbivore densities we suggest to reduce control of ungulate numbers to provide sufficient resources for maintaining dung beetle diversity.

AB  - Forests within and adjacent to cities are important habitats for native species and provide vital ecosystem ser-vices to cities and their residents. Herbaceous plants represent over 80% of all plant species in these forests, yet little is known about the long-term effects of management and landscape context on the understory of suburban forests. In this study, we used a 30-year dataset to fill this knowledge gap and evaluate the effect of prescribed burns on native forest herbs in suburban forest preserves of DuPage County, Illinois, USA. We also evaluated how the amount and configuration of forest habitat at multiple spatial scales affects native herb richness, gains, and losses in these forests over 30 years. We found that forests managed with prescribed burns increased in native herb richness over time, while unburned forests did not. Managed forests now have more native herb species than unburned forests. We also found that habitat amount in the surrounding landscape, but not the configu-ration of that habitat, had a positive effect on native herb richness and species gains over 30 years. Overall, we conclude that prescribed burns are effective in maintaining native forest herb richness in suburban forests. However, additional management actions such as seed augmentation may be required in areas with little sur-rounding forest herb habitat, as both overall richness and species gains over time are reduced in isolated forests.

AB  - Although ecological impacts of overabundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are well documented in eastern North America, few studies have evaluated the long-term effects of adaptive deer population suppression after a period of overabundance. We examined vegetation community changes over a period of 30 years (1992-2021) on the Long Point Peninsula, Ontario, Canada following a >85% reduction of a previously overabundant white-tailed deer population. We documented a significant increase in species diversity and shifts in the species composition of understory plants and woody vegetation. We then evaluated several hypotheses to explain these patterns. Our results provide support for the all-you-can-browse hypothesis, in which the abundance of woody stems above the browse layer did not increase within the first 3 years of sampling but, consistent within an expected period of recruitment, increased by >1,500% from 1995-2021. We also found support for both the lawn maintenance hypothesis, with a significant decline in the proportional abundance of non-preferred species relative to preferred species, and for the seed bank hypothesis, with native species accounting for nearly 80% of new species observed over the sampling period. We conclude that the effective, long-term management and continued suppression of an previously overabundant white-tailed deer population can lead to increased vegetation community heterogeneity and diversity, which is likely one of the most important steps for the regeneration of woody stems and native vegetation communities.

AB  - Road networks cause degradation by mean of disturbances that can alter the biodiversity and the functioning of the Caatinga ecosystems. We tested the hypotheses that (i) Caatinga vegetation near roads is less taxonomically, functionally and phylogenetically diverse, (ii) phylogenetically and functionally more clustered than vegetation further from roads, (iii) plant traits associated with herbivory deterrence are conserved within the phylogenetic lineages, and (iv) Caatinga vegetation near roads selects for disturbance-related traits. We sampled herbaceous and woody component of vegetation in four plots near roads and four plots further from roads to test these hypotheses. Sampled species were classified according to their resprouting capacity, nitrogen fixation, succulence/spines, urticancy/toxicity, lifeform, endozoochory, maximum height and maximum diameter, before we calculated the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities. Species richness, taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities were lower in plots close to the roads, confirming roads as sources of disturbances. The phylogenetic structure of the Caatinga vegetation near roads was clustered, indicating environmental filtering by herbivory as the main pervasive disturbance in Caatinga ecosystems, since traits related to herbivory deterrence were conserved within phylogenetic lineages and were filtered in near roads. Thus, roads should be considered conduits of degradation causing taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional impoverishment of Caatinga vegetation.

AB  - In semi-arid environments characterized by erratic rainfall and scattered primary production, migratory movements are a key survival strategy of large herbivores to track resources over vast areas. Veterinary Cordon Fences (VCFs), intended to reduce wildlife-livestock disease transmission, fragment large parts of southern Africa and have limited the movements of large wild mammals for over 60 years. Consequently, wildlife-fence interactions are frequent and often result in perforations of the fence, mainly caused by elephants. Yet, we lack knowledge about at which times fences act as barriers, how fences directly alter the energy expenditure of native herbivores, and what the consequences of impermeability are. We studied 2-year ungulate movements in three common antelopes (springbok, kudu, eland) across a perforated part of Namibia's VCF separating a wildlife reserve and Etosha National Park using GPS telemetry, accelerometer measurements, and satellite imagery. We identified 2905 fence interaction events which we used to evaluate critical times of encounters and direct fence effects on energy expenditure. Using vegetation type-specific greenness dynamics, we quantified what animals gained in terms of high quality food resources from crossing the VCF. Our results show that the perforation of the VCF sustains herbivore-vegetation interactions in the savanna with its scattered resources. Fence permeability led to peaks in crossing numbers during the first flush of woody plants before the rain started. Kudu and eland often showed increased energy expenditure when crossing the fence. Energy expenditure was lowered during the frequent interactions of ungulates standing at the fence. We found no alteration of energy expenditure when springbok immediately found and crossed fence breaches. Our results indicate that constantly open gaps did not affect energy expenditure, while gaps with obstacles increased motion. Closing gaps may have confused ungulates and modified their intended movements. White browsing, sedentary kudu's use of space was less affected by the VCF; migratory, mixed-feeding springbok, and eland benefited from gaps by gaining forage quality and quantity after crossing. This highlights the importance of access to vast areas to allow ungulates to track vital vegetation patches.

AB  - Livestock grazing can alter biodiversity and ecosystem functions. However, how long-term and continuous grazing intensity affect belowground biodiversity remains unclear, especially for soil microbial diversity. Here, through a well-controlled 5-year field experiment in a Tibetan alpine meadow, the responses of soil bacterial and fungal communities to yak grazing intensity were examined. Our results showed that grazing intensity signifi-cantly changed soil bacterial and fungal community compositions, rather than microbial alpha-diversity. The co-occurrence network analysis indicated that both soil bacterial and fungal network complexity gradually decreased with increasing grazing intensities. Meanwhile, soil C/N ratio, soil moisture, dissolved organic ni-trogen (DON), NH4+-N, and aboveground biomass (AGB) were related to soil bacterial community, and AGB, NO3-- N, NH4+-N, and DON and were associated with soil fungal community. Taken together, our manipulative experiment provides empirical evidence that grazing intensity-induced alterations of aboveground vegetation and nitrogen availability primarily trigger the shift of soil microbial community and structure. These results can support grassland management and ecological restoration in alpine ecosystems.

AB  - Based on an analysis of both original and literature material on the nutrition of horses and bison, a possible cause of the "extinction" of steppe bison in Eurasia and of native horses in North America 10-12 thousand years ago is estimated. Horses and bison, both differing in the morphology and functioning of the digestive system, are similar in the composition of consumed plants and nutrition parameters, this causing forage competition when grazing together on common pastures. At the turn of the Pleistocene and Holocene in Eurasia, the change of dry and cold Pleistocene tundra steppe to snowy Holocene steppes with snow-covered food inaccessible to bison could have led to the disappearance of steppe bison forms (Bison priscus) in Eurasia. Horses that successfully forage from under the snow by digging with their hooves survived into the Holocene period and inhabited the steppe and desert plains of Eurasia. In North America, the appearance of the steppe bison (B. bison bison) at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene (13-12 thousand years ago) could have led to competition with native horses. The well-known Holocene extinction of horses at the same time (about 12 thousand years ago) allows us to recognize competition with bison as a possible cause of the extinction of native horses in North America. Bison's two forms, steppe and forest ones, survived into the Holocene epoch and actively spread across the North American continent.

AB  - The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber Linnaeus, 1758) can be considered a hydrological ecosystem engineer as it shapes environmental characteristics through its building activities and feeding behaviour. Even if several studies have so far reported beaver impact on multi-taxon biodiversity and forest regeneration, there is a lack of research on forest stand structure evolution following beaver direct activity on trees. This represents a pivotal topic for predicting restoration outcomes and reccommending sound silvicultural and management practices to maintain specific forest conditions. Specifically, the study aims at investigating forest stand structure and tree species diversity changes considering river variability, distance from the riverbank and beaver's gnawing activity intensity. The Eurasian beaver is only recently recolonising the three analysed Mediterranean rivers, but stand structure seems to be already significantly impacted by the species. The number of trees was reduced, increasing mean diameter at breast height at stand level, as most of the youngest and/or smaller trees are entirely cut down. Strongest structural variations can be detected in intensively impacted stands and in the forest portions closer to the riverbank. The absence of a significant effect on most of the diversity indices is likely due to the initially homogeneous composition of the tree layer in each stand and to the limited variety of beaver's diet within the sites. Future resprouting of secondary tree shoots, as well as beaver gnawing activity changes in intensity over time and space, can further produce variations in structural parameters and woody species diversity in the medium- and long-term period. Therefore, it will be crucial to further monitor the long-term effects, as structural shifts can produce significant effects on riparian ecosystem functions.

AB  - Aims Soil processes in arid ecosystems are strongly controlled by resource scarcity. Grazing intensification can induce changes in ecosystem processes through multiple pathways, adding new constraints to those of local conditions. We focus on grazing-induced changes in litter traits and soil environment that may affect litter decomposition and N dynamics in temperate grass-shrub steppes. Methods We performed three litterbag decomposition experiments to evaluate: i) the effect of litter traits in a common garden (ex situ), ii) the effect of soil environment using a foreign common litter substrate (in situ), and iii) the interactive effects of litter traits and soil environment (grazed vs. exclosure communities, reciprocal transplants in situ). Field experiments were replicated in three blocks with paired plots under a long-term exclosure (> 25 years) and under year-round sheep grazing. Local litter included mixtures of species of grasses and shrubs, separately. Results Grazing exclusion did not alter litter decomposition rates, either through changes in litter traits or in soil environment. Nevertheless, N released during grass litter decomposition was 286% higher in exclosures than in grazing communities. The difference was associated to changes in litter C:N ratio. The effects were maintained when results were integrated to the entire litter community. Conclusion Our study suggests that litter decomposition rates in arid steppes are strongly controlled by local drivers. Ungulate grazing does not have an important influence on litter mass loss, but it can exert a strong control on N flux during decomposition, by changing grass litter traits.

AB  - Free-ranging yak grazing is a regime specially adapted to high-elevation environments across the Pan-Tibetan Highlands, yet its impacts on alpine birds remain poorly understood. The Chinese Monal (Lophophorus lhuysii) is a rare pheasant species that serves as a representative and umbrella species for alpine meadow ecosystems in the mountains of Southwest China, and has long been regarded as threatened by free-ranging yaks. However, the actual impacts and specific mechanisms through which yak grazing influences Chinese Monal have not been empirically tested. Here, we conducted infrared camera monitoring in alpine meadows within the Wolong National Nature Reserve, Sichuan, China, from 2019 to 2022. We analyzed the effects of free-ranging yaks on habitat occupancy, activity pattern, and population density of the Chinese Monal using multispecies occupancy models, kernel density estimations, avoidance attraction ratios, and random encounter models. We found that interactions with yaks affect monal habitat occupancy in conjunction with other ecological factors. Specifically, the presence of yaks alters monals' occupancy responses to variations in grass cover and elevation, causing monals to use habitats with lower grass cover and elevation more frequently. Additionally, the activity patterns of the Chinese Monal and yaks are significantly different, and the presence of yaks significantly prolongs the time until monals re-occupy the same habitats. As an outcome of the cumulative effects of spatial and temporal avoidance, the population density of the Chinese Monal negatively correlated with increasing grazing intensity. This study provides the first empirical evidence of the negative impacts of free-ranging yaks on the Chinese Monal and elucidates the underlying mechanisms, highlighting great risks to conservation of this vulnerable species. Our findings inform the optimization of grazing management that balances production with conservation. Strict control over yak numbers and grazing areas in critical habitats for Chinese Monal and other threatened species could be a feasible compromise to mitigate these pressures.

AB  - Global change is threatening the integrity of forest ecosystems worldwide, amplifying the need for resilience-based management to ensure their conservation and sustain the services they provide. Yet, current efforts are still limited by the lack of implementation of clear frameworks for operationalizing resilience in decision-making processes. To overcome this limitation, we aim to identify reliable and effective drivers of forest resilience, considering their synergies and trade-offs. From a comprehensive review of 342 scientific articles addressing resilience in forests globally, we identified factors shaping forest resilience. We recognized them into two categories that influence forest responses to disturbances: resilience predictors, which can be modified through management, and codrivers, which are measurable but largely unmanageable (e.g., climate). We then performed network analyses based on predictors and codrivers underlying forest resilience. In total, we recognized 5332 such relationships linking predictors or codrivers with forest attributes resilience. Our findings support the central role of biodiversity, with mixed, non-planted, or functionally diverse forests promoting resilience across all contexts and biomes. While management also enhanced resilience, the success of specific interventions was highly context-dependent, suggesting that its application requires a careful analysis of trade-offs. Specifically, practices like cutting and prescribed burning generally enhanced resilience in terms of tree growth, plant diversity, landscape vegetation cover, and stand structure. In contrast, pest and herbivore control reduced the resilience of plant taxonomic diversity while offering only minimal gains for other variables. Even long-term restoration projects showed clear trade-offs in the resilience of different forest attributes, highlighting the need for careful consideration of these effects in practical management decisions. Overall, we emphasize that a reduced number of predictors can be used to effectively promote forest resilience across most attributes. Particularly, enhancing biodiversity and implementing targeted management strategies when biodiversity is impoverished emerge as powerful tools to promote forest resilience.

AB  - Aims: This study assessed changes in woody vegetation cover, richness, diversity, and species composition in Gonarezhou National Park (GNP) between 2010 and 2023, focusing on the impacts of fire and elephants. Analyses were conducted for the entire park and its main vegetation types and ecoregions. Location: GNP is located in southern Zimbabwe, bordering Mozambique, covering approximately 5000 km2. Methods: In 2010, 313 sampling areas were surveyed, and a resurvey was conducted in 2022/2023 using a plotless method. For each area, woody species cover was recorded in four height classes. Indices for total woody cover, species richness, diversity (Shannon), and evenness (Pielou) were calculated for both surveys across the park, ecoregions, and vegetation types. Differences between surveys were analyzed with paired t-tests. Species composition changes were analyzed using NMDS and PERMANOVA, while the effects of fire frequency, slope, and distance from rivers on species composition were tested with a mixed linear model. The change in dominant species occurrence was also examined. Results: Species richness significantly declined, with no changes in woody vegetation cover, diversity, or evenness, except in the alluvial ecoregion, where diversity decreased. Changes across height layers revealed increased richness and diversity in the < 1 m layer and declines in the 1-3 m and 3-5 m layers. Species composition changes were significant across ecoregions and influenced by fire frequency. A decrease in dominant tree species was observed, varying by species' resilience to current pressures. Conclusions: GNP is undergoing simplification in woody vegetation, likely due to the combined effects of elephants and fire. This is leading to shrubbier vegetation and changes in species composition, particularly in trees. To prevent further degradation, actions must be implemented, such as the use of individual protection systems from debarking, the development of a fire management system, and the creation of ecological corridors in the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Conservation Area to facilitate the movement of elephants.

AB  - Rangelands are increasingly being affected by climatic variations, fragmentation and changes in livestock management practices. Along with resource competition between livestock and wildlife, disease transmission has implications for people and wildlife in these shared landscapes. We worked with two pastoral communities in the Western Indian Himalayas: the migratory Kinnauras that travel to the Trans-Himalayan Pin valley in summer and the resident herders of Pin Valley. Asiatic ibex (Capra sibirica) is the predominant wild herbivore in Pin. The pastures in Pin are grazed by both livestock (migratory and resident) and ibex, with the potential for disease transmission. We investigate the effects of herding practices on livestock health and disease transmission, while focusing on gastro-intestinal nematodes (GINs) as they can spread by sharing pasture between wild and domestic ungulates. Surveys were carried out between June and August 2019, the period when migratory Kinnauras, local herders and Asiatic Ibex are found in Pin Valley. We found that the Kinnaura flocks share pasture with ibex during their time in Pin, exhibiting significantly higher endo-parasite burdens than sedentary livestock, and the Kinnaura flocks are increasing in number. This suggests GIN cross-transmission is possible, as GINs have low host specificity and a free-living, environmental stage that is trophically acquired. As local (sedentary) sheep and goats rarely share pasture with ibex, have low endo-parasite burdens and are few in number, they are unlikely to transmit parasites to ibex. However, increasingly large local stock numbers may be contributing to pasture degradation which could cause nutritional stress and resource competition, exacerbating GIN impacts. We also find evidence for transhumance persisting, in spite of signs of pasture degradation that are seemingly affecting livestock productivity and potentially disease transmission. It is critical that proactive measures are taken, like participatory disease management with the Kinnauras, to align livelihoods with wildlife and rangeland conservation.

AB  - 1. Biodiversity is an important component of natural ecosystems, with higher species richness often correlating with an increase in ecosystem productivity. Yet, this relationship varies substantially across environments, typically becoming less pronounced at high levels of species richness. However, species richness alone cannot reflect all important properties of a community, including community evenness, which may mediate the relationship between biodiversity and productivity. If the evenness of a community correlates negatively with richness across forests globally, then a greater number of species may not always increase overall diversity and productivity of the system. Theoretical work and local empirical studies have shown that the effect of evenness on ecosystem functioning may be especially strong at high richness levels, yet the consistency of this remains untested at a global scale.2. Here, we used a dataset of forests from across the globe, which includes composition, biomass accumulation and net primary productivity, to explore whether productivity correlates with community evenness and richness in a way that evenness appears to buffer the effect of richness. Specifically, we evaluated whether low levels of evenness in speciose communities correlate with the attenuation of the richness-productivity relationship.3. We found that tree species richness and evenness are negatively correlated across forests globally, with highly speciose forests typically comprising a few dominant and many rare species. Furthermore, we found that the correlation between diversity and productivity changes with evenness: at low richness, uneven communities are more productive, while at high richness, even communities are more productive.4. Synthesis. Collectively, these results demonstrate that evenness is an integral component of the relationship between biodiversity and productivity, and that the attenuating effect of richness on forest productivity might be partly explained by low evenness in speciose communities. Productivity generally increases with species richness, until reduced evenness limits the overall increases in community diversity. Our research suggests that evenness is a fundamental component of biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships, and is of critical importance for guiding conservation and sustainable ecosystem management decisions.

AB  - Dung beetles provide essential ecosystem services and serve as biodiversity indicators. Despite their importance, no studies have assessed their role in Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine) forests. We assessed dung beetle diversity and abundance in a pristine Longleaf Pine forest in southwest Georgia, USA, by collecting beetles with pitfall traps in sites that excluded mammalian mesopredators as well as unfenced control sites. We collected 22 dung beetle taxa in total over a 24-month period and found higher beetle abundance and species richness in exclosure sites, though they showed no preference for dung source (i. e., Odocoileus virginianus [White- tailed Deer], Lynx rufus [Bobcat], Canis latrans [Coyote]). Melanocanthon bispinatus was the most abundant species (49.6% of total beetles). Results provide insight into the interactions of dung beetles and predators in Longleaf Pine ecosystems.

AB  - Native and introduced deer populations have expanded on many continents and are now considered primary drivers of ecosystem degradation. Large herbivore management can be controversial, requiring appropriate tools to gauge impacts and guide management decisions. While many different protocols have been proposed to measure deer impacts to vegetation, few have been experimentally validated to assess whether they respond reliably to changes in deer browse intensity. Here we used a network of large (2 ha) long-term deer exclosures in New York State to assess utility and reliability of AVID (Assessing Vegetation Impacts of Deer), the Ten-Tallest, and Twig-Age protocols to capture changes in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) browse intensity. We also assessed whether three herbaceous species: blue-stemmed goldenrod (Solidago caesia), white wood aster (Eurybia divaricata), and zigzag goldenrod (Solidago flexicaulis) could expand upon a red oak (Quercus rubra) Sentinel protocol. Finally, we evaluated whether these four protocols adhered to criteria defined for ecological indicator selection. AVID, Ten-Tallest, and Twig-Age protocols rely on existing vegetation to measure deer browse intensity, which limited their ability to adhere to basic sampling principles and be standardized across different forest types, especially in areas with little vegetation remaining in browse height. The Ten-Tallest protocol did not consis-tently detect differences in deer browse intensity, calling into question its scientific validity. The Sentinel pro-tocol utilizes propagated and planted species, which standardizes impact assessments across sites and captures annual changes in deer browse intensity. Sentinel met nearly all criteria required to function as a reliable deer browse indicator. Validation and selection of additional sentinel species is necessary to build out a portfolio of regionally relevant species that can gauge deer browse intensity across vegetation and habitat types. Of the herbaceous species evaluated, S. caesia showed promise as a new sentinel species, but further evaluations are necessary. Evidence-based deer management will require scientifically rigorous and validated impact monitoring approaches and metrics. We caution against adopting protocols that have not been thoroughly vetted to avoid misguided deer management and policy.

AB  - Livestock overgrazing and climate change have been identified as the primary causes of grassland degeneration and biodiversity decline, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. To gain a better understanding of this, we con-ducted a meta-analysis of 91 local or regional field studies from 26 countries across all inhabited continents. Using con-cise statistical analyses, we assessed five theoretical hypotheses for grazing intensity, grazing history, grazing animal type, productivity, and climate, and decomposed the individual contributions of each factor in regulating multiple components of grassland biodiversity. After controlling for confounding effects, we found that: no significant linear or binomial pattern for the effect-size of grassland biodiversity as grazing intensity increased; the effect-size of pro-ducer richness was relatively lower (negative biodiversity response) in grasslands with a short grazing history, grazed by large livestock, high productivity, or high climate suitability; additionally, significant difference for the effect-size of consumer richness was only detected across grazing animal groups; and the effect-size of consumer abundance, and decomposer abundance all displayed significant differences with respect to grazing characters, grassland productivity, and climate suitability. Besides, results of hierarchical variance partitioning suggested that the total and individual contribution of predictors varied across biome components and diversity measurements. Specifically, grassland pro-ductivity acted as a key factor in driving producer richness. The findings presented here collectively suggest that the response of grassland biodiversity to livestock grazing, productivity, and climate varies across different components of the biome and measurements of diversity.

AB  - For threatened marine megafauna, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis), sound conservation planning should aim to ensure demographic and ecological persistence of populations. One method to address this challenge is through ecosystem-based conservation planning (ECP) based on threatened marine megafauna distribution, biodiversity richness, and ecosystem functionality. ECP exercises for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin in Chinese and adjacent northern Vietnamese waters were conducted based on the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin distribution, Hill-2 biodiversity index, and marine net primary productivity. Habitat protection priorities were scored using the program MARXAN and were used to identify special areas for conservation (SACs) for the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin. To ensure the minimal risk of local extinction, the SACs enclosed a total of 26,858 km(2) of waters, accounting for 49.9% of core habitats of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and 24.3% of the IUCN Red List species in the study region. To enclose 30% of biodiversity richness and ecosystem functionality, a total of 40,179 km(2) SACs was required. In the context of threatened marine megafauna conservation, megafauna distribution can be used to highlight focal areas, while information on biodiversity richness and ecosystem functionality should be factored in. Using surrogates with different ecological niches would be a better tactic to ensure sufficient protection coverage by minimizing the omission bias. The conservation of threatened marine megafauna in coastal and estuarine waters shares similar objectives with global marine biodiversity conservation. The challenges to conduct ECP exercises come from data scarcity and poor data quality in representing distributions of biodiversity features. A certified open-access database that shares survey effort, occurrence, population density, and habitat mapping at national and local scales is recommended. Such a result requires national planning, investment, and policing.

AB  - Rapidly changing climate at high latitudes has triggered a search for bellwethers of ecological change there. If the initial signs of change can be identified, perhaps we can predict where these changes will lead. Large-bodied, terrestrial herbivores are potential candidates for bellwether taxa because of the key roles they play in some ecological communities. Here, we assembled historical, archaeological, and paleontological records of moose (Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)) from the western Arctic and subarctic. The results showed that rather than having recently invaded tundra regions in response to post Little Ice Age warming, moose have inhabited river corridors several hundred kilometres north of the closed, boreal forest since they first colonized North America across the Bering Land Bridge ca. 14 000 years ago. The combination of high mobility, fluctuationprone metapopulations, and reliance on early successional vegetation makes changes in the northern range limits of moose undependable bellwethers for other biotic responses to changing climate. The history of moose at high latitudes illustrates how understanding what happened in prehistory is useful for correctly assigning significance and cause to present-day ecological changes.

AB  - The Arctic wolf (Canis lupus arctos) is a predator of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), Arctic hares (Lepus arcticus), and endangered Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) in the Canadian High Arctic. Although Arctic wolves potentially affect the dynamics of muskoxen and Peary caribou populations, knowledge about their abundance, distribution, and predation patterns is limited. Inuit and Inuvialuit communities value these species for sociocultural and subsistence reasons, and community members are concerned about how interactions among these species and their environment may change in a warming, unpredictable Arctic. We conducted a study from 2014-2018 of wolves in the rolling tundra of central Ellesmere Island (Fosheim Peninsula) and eastern Axel Heiberg Island. This area supported relatively high densities of muskoxen and Arctic hares, and previously supported Peary caribou, although caribou were mostly absent in the area during our study. We deployed global positioning system (GPS) radio-collars on 10 adult wolves in 6 packs on Ellesmere and Axel Heiberg islands to describe wolf density and predation patterns. Wolves were neither nomadic nor migratory; they remained on territories year-round, with summer densities of 2.5-8.0 adult wolves/1,000 km2 and 3.7-10.4 wolves/1,000 km2 including pups. Based on a ground search of 312 of 868 location clusters over a 340-day period, wolves in a focal study pack killed approximately 0.12 muskoxen/day, equivalent to a predation rate of 5.5-17.0% of the estimated muskox population (older than 10 months old). This predation rate is likely sustainable given that calves and yearlings rather than reproductive adults comprised most documented kills, and that muskox populations can increase at rates up to 20%. The kill rate for this pack also implied a biomass intake deficit of 0.82-1.63 kg/wolf/day that could have been offset by each wolf consuming 115-228 Arctic hares annually. The decline of Peary caribou in the study area precluded any assessment of wolf predation influences on their population, but annual telemetry data confirming the year-round presence of a wolf-ungulate-hare system with relatively high wolf densities suggests that apparent competition could present a challenge to Peary caribou recovery efforts.

AB  - Endozoochorous seed dispersal by ungulates has received increased attention. However, ungulates' daily visitation patterns and fruit consumption of the fleshly fruits of invasive alien plants (IAPs) are poorly documented. Using camera trapping, we documented wild southern African ungulates interactions with three freshly-fruited IAPs, i.e. lantana (Lantana camara), bugweed (Solanum mauritianum) and cochineal prickly-pear (Opuntia monacantha) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We determined the community of potential ungulate seed dispersers of the IAPs, the daily IAP interaction patterns and quantified relative fruit consumption by ungulates. The level of IAP fruit consumption was significantly different among ungulate species and IAPs and varied with time of day. Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa), bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), impala (Aepyceros melampus), nyala (T. angasii) and greater kudu (T. strepsiceros) showed the highest relative fruit consumption rate, respectively, while the lowest was for blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), and zebra (Equus quagga). Impala and greater kudu were recorded interacting with the IAPs from 24h00-06h00, giraffe and nyala from 06h00-12h00, and bushbuck from 18h00-06h00. Overall, L. camara was visited mostly during the diurnal-afternoon; however, O. monacantha during the nocturnal-morning and S. mauritianum during the nocturnal-night. The main ungulates potentially dispersing L. camara were giraffe and bushbuck. Impala and greater kudu were the main potential dispersal vectors for O. monacantha. Our study showed that camera trapping is useful for determining the interactions between ungulates and IAPs, which is crucial for understanding their potential contribution to the dispersal dynamics of IAPs in African savannas.

AB  - Natural habitats in South America have been intensively used and modified, including their conversion to exotic tree plantations, impacting the terrestrial fauna communities. Carnivores play an important role in the functioning of ecosystems as apex predators. Landscape characteristics and resource availability determine the composition and abundance of co-occurring carnivores. We hypothesized that the diversity and relative abundance of native carnivores varied in relation to the different vegetation macrohabitats. We predicted that native forests support a higher diversity and abundance of native carnivores compared to exotic plantations. Between 1 March 2021 and 31 March 2022, we estimated the species' richness, composition, and relative abundance of terrestrial native carnivores in three different landscapes of the Coast Range in central Chile: (a) monoculture plantation of the exotic Pinus radiata (MP); (b) Mediterranean coastal thorn forest (TF); and (c) Mediterranean coastal sclerophyllous forest (SF). We monitored an area of 1000 ha in each landscape, installing 10 camera traps (total of 30 camera traps). We used a monitoring transect with unbaited camera traps separated by 1 km, with a total photo-trapping effort of 10,046 camera days. The classification, organization, and analysis of camera trap data were conducted using CameraSweet software. The total number of independent native carnivore species events (photos separated > 60 min) recorded in each landscape were 1564 in SF, 1412 in TF, and 775 in MP. Carnivore richness and composition were not significantly different in all three landscapes. We detected five native carnivore species. Relative abundance by species was significantly higher in SF compared to MP for Leopardus guigna, Conepatus chinga, and Galictis cuja and also significantly higher in TF compared to MP for L. guigna. Our results suggest that the native vegetation cover must be preserved to maintain viable and abundant native carnivore populations, crucially relevant in the highly impacted and human-dominated global biodiversity hotspot of Central Chile. This study contributes to informing evidence-based decision-making and conservation strategies at the landscape level to mitigate biodiversity loss.

AB  - Linear features are increasing worldwide and, in many jurisdictions, their decommissioning has been identified as a way to restore wildlife habitat. Few studies have assessed restoration practices on forest roads, yet they are the main linear disturbance throughout most circumboreal forests. In boreal forests of eastern Canada, such knowledge would be especially valuable for the conservation of boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). We assessed the short-term establishment of vegetation following four treatments applied across 40 km of forest roads, along a restoration gradient involving additive treatments (i.e. each successive treatment included the treatments prior): closing the road to traffic, decompacting the soil, planting black spruce trees, and adding enriched soil. We linked lateral cover (a proxy of movement obstruction for wildlife) and the occurrence and abundance of plant species to road treatments and environmental covariates. Vegetation establishment 3-4 years after decommissioning was mostly influenced by treatments but also by road width and stand composition in the vicinity of roads. The combination of closing, decompacting, and planting was the most effective treatment to establish regeneration that would lead to suitable caribou habitat as it reduced food availability for moose and bears (i.e. lower presence of herbaceous species, fruit-bearing shrubs, and deciduous trees). It also reduced the presence of plants competing with spruce, such as ericaceous shrubs. Our results suggest that the decommissioning of forest roads could benefit caribou, provided it is performed at a sufficiently broad scale, and accompanied by other habitat restoration and protection practices.

AB  - The spatial aggregation of species pairs often increases with the ecological similarity of the species involved. However, the way in which environmental conditions and anthropogenic activity affect the relationship between spatial aggregation and ecological similarity remains unknown despite the potential for spatial associations to affect species interactions, ecosystem function, and extinction risk. Given that human disturbance has been shown to both increase and decrease spatial associations among species pairs, ecological similarity may have a role in mediating these patterns. Here, we test the influences of habitat diversity, primary productivity, human population density, and species' ecological similarity based on functional traits (i.e., functional trait similarity) on spatial associations among tropical forest mammals. Large mammals are highly sensitive to anthropogenic change and therefore susceptible to changes in interspecific spatial associations. Using two-species occupancy models and camera trap data, we quantified the spatial overlap of 1216 species pairs from 13 tropical forest protected areas around the world. We found that the association between ecological similarity and interspecific species associations depended on surrounding human density. Specifically, aggregation of ecologically similar species was more than an order of magnitude stronger in landscapes with the highest human density compared to those with the lowest human density, even though all populations occurred within protected areas. Human-induced changes in interspecific spatial associations have been shown to alter top-down control by predators, increase disease transmission and increase local extinction rates. Our results indicate that anthropogenic effects on the distribution of wildlife within protected areas are already occurring and that impacts on species interactions, ecosystem functions, and extinction risk warrant further investigation.

AB  - Herbivory can have strong impacts on greenhouse gas fluxes in high-latitude ecosystems. For example, in the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta in western Alaska, migratory goose grazing affects the magnitude of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes. However, the underlying drivers of this relationship are unclear, as few studies systematically tease apart the processes by which herbivores influences soil biogeochemistry. To examine these mechanisms in detail, we conducted a laboratory incubation experiment to quantify changes in greenhouse gas fluxes in response to three parameters altered by herbivores in situ: temperature, soil moisture content, and nutrient inputs. These treatments were applied to soils collected in grazing lawns and nearby ungrazed habitat, allowing us to assess how variation in microbial community structure influenced observed responses. We found pronounced differences in both fungal and prokaryotic community composition between grazed and ungrazed areas. In the laboratory incubation experiment, CO2 and CH4 fluxes increased with temperature, soil moisture, and goose fecal addition, suggesting that grazing-related changes in the soil abiotic environment may enhance soil C losses. Yet, these abiotic drivers were insufficient to explain variation in fluxes between soils with and without prior grazing. Differences in trace gas fluxes between grazed and ungrazed areas may result both from herbivore-induced shifts in abiotic parameters and grazing-related alterations in microbial community structure. Our findings suggest that relationships among herbivores and soil microbial communities could mediate carbon-climate feedbacks in rapidly changing high-latitude ecosystems.

AB  - The main paradigm for protection of biodiversity, focusing on maintaining or restoring conditions where humans leave no or little impact, risks overlooking anthropogenic landscapes harboring a rich native biodiversity. An example is northern European agricultural landscapes with traditionally managed semi-natural grasslands harboring an exceptional local richness of many taxa, such as plants, fungi and insects. During the last century these grasslands have declined by more than 95%, i.e. in the same magnitude as other, internationally more recognized declines of natural habitats. In this study, data from the Swedish Red List was used to calculate tentative extinction rates for vascular plants, insects (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera) and fungi, given a scenario where such landscapes would vanish. Conservative estimates suggest that abandonment of traditional management in these landscapes would result in elevated extinction rates in all these taxa, between two and three orders of magnitude higher than global background extinction rates. It is suggested that the species richness in these landscapes reflects a species pool from Pleistocene herbivore-structured environments, which, after the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna, was rescued by the introduction of pre-historic agriculture. Maintaining traditionally managed agricultural landscapes is of paramount importance to prevent species loss. There is no inherent conflict between preservation of anthropogenic landscapes and remaining 'wild' areas, but valuating also anthropogenic landscapes is essential for biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Arctic tundra vegetation is affected by rapid climatic change and fluctuating herbivore population sizes. Broad-billed geese, after their arrival in spring, feed intensively on belowground rhizomes, thereby disturbing soil, mosses, and vascular plant vegetation. Understanding of how springtime snowmelt patterns drive goose behavior is thus key to better predict the state of Arctic tundra ecosystems. Here, we analyzed how snowmelt progression affected springtime habitat selection and vegetation disturbance by pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) in Svalbard during 2019. Our analysis, based on GPS telemetry data and field observations of geese, plot-based assessments of signs of vegetation disturbance, and drone and satellite images, covered two spatial scales (fine scale: extent 0.3 km2, resolution 5 cm; valley scale: extent 30 km2, resolution 10 m). We show that pink-footed goose habitat selection and signs of vegetation disturbance were correlated during the spring pre-breeding period; disturbances were most prevalent in the moss tundra vegetation class and areas free from snow early in the season. The results were consistent across the spatial scales and methods (GPS telemetry and field observations). We estimated that 23.4% of moss tundra and 11.2% of dwarf-shrub heath vegetation in the valley showed signs of disturbance by pink-footed geese during the study period. This study demonstrates that aerial imagery and telemetry can provide data to detect disturbance hotspots caused by pink-footed geese. Our study provides empirical evidence to general notions about implications of climate change and snow season changes that include increased variability in precipitation.

AB  - Most forests are impacted by humans and are at the center of numerous species extinctions. Wilderness areas (i.e., areas with little or no human influence) are essential to limit biodiversity loss and are expected to have the most intact natural communities. The southern Yungas are neotropical mountain forests affected by unsustainable human activities that may pose a risk for many species. We used camera trap data, multispecies occupancy models, and regional human footprint index to assess the occupancy of medium- and large-sized mammal assemblage in wilderness areas and the effect of human influence variables in the southern Yungas forests of Salta and Jujuy provinces, Argentina. The occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage, red-brocket deer (Mazama rufa), tapeti (Sylvilagus paraguensis), crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and tayra (Eira barbara) was higher in wilderness areas than in areas with human influence. When one human influence variable of the human footprint index was analyzed at a time, greater distance from hamlets (i.e., small, isolated human houses) resulted in higher occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage, jaguar (Panthera onca), crab-eating fox, and lowland tapir. Distance to transformed areas had no significant effect on occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage, a positive effect on lowland tapir, and a negative effect on grey-brocket deer (Subulo gouazoubira). Distance to roads did not affect the occupancy probability of the mammal assemblage or species. Wilderness areas in the southern Yungas contribute substantially to the conservation of medium- and large-sized mammal assemblage and should be prioritized in conservation strategies.

AB  - The primary utilization strategy for meadow grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is livestock grazing. This practice is considered as one of the major drivers of plant-associated bacterial community construction and changes in soil properties. The species of Kobresia humilis is considered as the most dominant one in grasslands. However, how different grazing practices affect the phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacterial communities of K. humilis is unknown. To address this issue, the effects of the grazing enclosure (GE), single-species grazing (YG and SG, representing yak only and sheep only, respectively), and different ratios of grazing (ratio of yak to sheep is 1:2, 1:4, and 1:6, represented by MG1:2, MG1:4, and MG1:6, respectively) on the dominant plant of K. humilis, it's phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacteria, and soil properties were investigated using artificially controlled grazing and grazing enclosure. Our data showed that grazing enclosure enhanced vegetation coverage, and rhizosphere bacterial richness and diversity, while reduced plant number and bacterial network stability of K. humilis. The NO3  -N, K+, and Cl  concentrations were lower under grazing compared to GE. SG reduced theconcentration of NH4+-N, TN, K+, and Na+ compared to YG. Moderate grazing intensity had a lower relative abundance of the r-strategists (Bacteroidota and Gammaproteobacteria) with higher bacterial network stability. Yak and sheep grazing showed reversed impacts on the bacterial network stability between the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of K. humilis. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteriota were identified in the molecular ecological network analysis as keystone taxa in the phyllosphere and rhizosphere networks, respectively, under all treatments. This study explained why sheep grazing has more adverse effects on grazing-tolerant grass species, K. humilis, than yak grazing, and will contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of different grazing practices and grazing enclosure on alpine grassland ecosystems on the QTP.

AB  - Invasive species have established populations around the world and, in the process, characteristics of their realized environmental niches have changed. Because of their popularity as a source of game, deer have been introduced to, and become invasive in, many different environments around the world. As such, deer should provide a good model system in which to test environmental niche shifts. Using the current distributions of the six deer species present in Australia, we quantified shifts in their environmental niches that occurred since introduction; we determined the differences in suitable habitat between their international (native and invaded) and their Australian ranges. Given knowledge of their Australian habitat use, we then modeled the present distribution of deer in Australia to assess habitat suitability, in an attempt to predict future deer distributions. We show that the Australian niches of hog (Axis porcinus), fallow (Dama dama), red (Cervus elaphus), rusa (C. timorensis), and sambar deer (C. unicolor), but not chital deer (A. axis), were different to their international ranges. When we quantified the potential range of these six species in Australia, chital, hog, and rusa deer had the largest areas of suitable habitat outside their presently occupied habitat. The other three species had already expanded outside the ranges that we predicted as suitable. Here, we demonstrate that deer have undergone significant environmental niche shifts following introduction into Australia, and these shifts are important for predicting the future spread of these invasive species. It is important to note that current Australian and international environmental niches did not necessarily predict range expansions, thus wildlife managers should treat these analyses as conservative estimates.

AB  - Climate change will lead to more frequent and more severe fires in some areas of boreal forests, affecting the distribution and availability of late-successional forest communities. These forest communities help to protect globally significant carbon reserves beneath permafrost layers and provide habitat for many animal species, including forest-dwelling caribou. Many caribou populations are declining, yet the mechanisms by which changing fire regimes could affect caribou declines are poorly understood. We analyzed resource selection of 686 GPS-collared female caribou from three ecotypes and 15 populations in a similar to 600,000 km(2) region of northwest Canada and eastern Alaska. These populations span a wide gradient of fire frequency but experience low levels of human-caused habitat disturbance. We used a mixed-effects modeling framework to characterize caribou resource selection in response to burns at different seasons and spatiotemporal scales, and to test for functional responses in resource selection to burn availability. We also tested mechanisms driving observed selection patterns using burn severity and lichen cover data. Caribou avoided burns more strongly during winter relative to summer and at larger spatiotemporal scales relative to smaller scales. During the winter, caribou consistently avoided burns at both spatiotemporal scales as burn availability increased, indicating little evidence of a functional response. However, they decreased their avoidance of burns during summer as burn availability increased. Burn availability explained more variation in caribou selection for burns than ecotype. Within burns, caribou strongly avoided severely burned areas in winter, and this avoidance lasted nearly 30 years after a fire. Caribou within burns also selected higher cover of terrestrial lichen (an important caribou food source). We found a negative relationship between burn severity and lichen cover, confirming that caribou avoidance of burns was consistent with lower lichen abundance. Consistent winter avoidance of burns and severely burned areas suggests that caribou will experience increasing winter habitat loss as fire frequency and severity increase. Our results highlight the potential for climate-induced alteration of natural disturbance regimes to affect boreal biodiversity through habitat loss. We suggest that management strategies prioritizing protection of core winter range habitat with lower burn probabilities would provide important climate-change refugia for caribou.

AB  - QuestionsSalt marshes are highly productive coastal ecosystems that, like other coastal wetlands, play a key role in climate change mitigation due to their efficiency in sequestering and storing atmospheric carbon (C). This ability is partly explained by the low decomposition rates of organic matter that is buried in their sediments. However, given that decomposition dynamics are temperature-dependent, escalating temperatures potentially threaten salt marsh C sequestration capacity. The question addressed in this study is whether increasing temperature affects salt marsh detritus decomposition rates not only directly but also indirectly by affecting plant community composition. LocationWe performed a field manipulative experiment in a Southwestern Atlantic salt marsh in the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina. MethodsWe increased temperature using open-top chambers (OTCs). At the end of a 3-year experiment, we estimated plant species cover at each plot and estimated litter decomposition rates with a litterbag approach using a standardized substrate (i.e., Spartina litter) and a community-based substrate. ResultsResults show that the use of OTCs raised the temperature in warming treatments by 1.05 degrees C on average. After 3 years of experiment, the plant community structure under warming was characterized by increased dominance of Spartina densiflora, which produces a less labile detritus. Warming reduced the decomposition of community-based litter by 50% to levels similar to those of the standardized Spartina litter. ConclusionsOur results show that warming is likely to have significant consequences on salt marsh plant community structure, increasing the biomass of the dominant species and driving more recalcitrant litter production, which could slow decomposition dynamics. Despite only covering 0.3% of the land surface, salt marshes are important C reservoirs; thus, the contrasting dynamics of warming on salt marsh decomposition should be considered when assessing the broader effects of global change.

In Portugal, Eucalyptus plantations are the most common use of forested land, presenting the largest coverage of Eucalyptus globulus in Europe. Although it is established that this landscape can affect biodiversity patterns, it is not clear what its role in shaping small mammals' body condition is. Here, we tested the effect of Eucalyptus plantations on small mammals' body condition, together with vegetation structure, weather, predators/competitors' abundance, and parasites' prevalence, using the Scaled Mass Index (SMI) as a surrogate. Capture of small mammals took place in 11 study areas in central Portugal from 2019 to 2022. The drivers' influence was tested using structural equation models (SEM). The response of body condition to Eucalyptus is species-specific, with Crocidura russula displaying better individual condition in native habitats (i.e., there was an indirect negative effect of Eucalyptus plantations). The overall model suggested that deer abundance, precipitation, and forest integrity promoted higher body condition levels, while wild boar abundance had an adverse effect. The management of these plantations must ensure the integrity of the remnants of native patches and control of highly abundant competitors (e.g., wild boar) to maintain a healthy and functional small mammal community.

AB  - The islands of the Aegean Sea are areas of high biodiversity and endemism and harbor globally important seabird communities. Resident seabirds breed on offshore islands, where they often form strong nesting colonies. Breeding seabirds are important determinants of an island's ecosystem function while also being exposed to a plethora of human activities. Understanding how anthropogenic activities impact such populations is not just essential for seabird conservation but is also critically important for the management of small insular ecosystems and the native species communities they support. We quantify the effect of human activities on the size and locations of Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) colonies from the Cyclades and Sporades archipelagos. We gathered data on variables suspected to influence seabird colonies, including physical islet characteristics, resource availability, and type and extent of human disturbance. Analyses were conducted on the local (islet) and on the regional (island cluster) levels to identify proximate and ultimate factors shaping the breeding population sizes of resident colonies. On the local level, we identify a clear negative effect of the presence of invasive rats on gull nesting density. Similarly, the presence of feral grazing mammals such as goats and rabbits has negative impacts on gull populations, an effect that appears to be primarily mediated through nest disturbance. Access to landfills and fishing vessels both had positive impacts on gull nesting density. Our results suggest approaches to managing Yellow-legged Gull populations in the Mediterranean Basin by taking into consideration the roles of introduced mammals, fishing activities, and open-air landfills on seabirds in the region.

AB  - The non -consumptive effects of predator -prey interactions are well-known for their ability to impact ecosystem structure and function. As anthropogenic pressures increase worldwide, it is essential to understand how they influence the non -consumptive effects of predator -prey interactions. Two anthropogenic activities that occur worldwide, hunting and livestock grazing, are known to impact the activity and space use of individual species. However, their effects on predator -prey interactions remain less understood. We evaluated how cattle and human hunting activities influenced the spatial and temporal overlap of five predator (black bear [Ursus americanus], bobcat [Lynx rufus], cougar [Puma concolor], coyote [Canis latrans], and gray wolf [C. lupus]) and four ungulate prey species (elk [Cervus canadensis], moose [Alces alces], mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus], and white-tailed deer [O. virginianus]) in Washington, USA, from 2018 - 2020. We used data from a large-scale camera trap study to test our hypotheses that anthropogenic activities influence spatiotemporal overlap of predators and prey depending on whether they avoid disturbance and risk or are attracted to potential food subsidies. We found cattle and hunter activity influenced species -specific occurrence and activity patterns but had more limited effects on predator -prey overlap. Namely, mesopredators and deer were generally more likely to use areas with cattle activity whereas cougars avoided cattle in the absence of wild prey. Predators and moose used areas with greater hunter activity, possibly creating a human shield for other ungulates where hunter activity was lower. Finally, most species moderately shifted their daily activity patterns in response to cattle and hunter activity. The resulting spatiotemporal patterns were only partially consistent with our expectations owing to the diverse and nuanced responses of predators and prey to cattle and hunter activity. Anthropogenic activities may help reduce predation risk under certain circumstances but do not necessarily create a human shield, underscoring the importance of considering anthropogenic effects on predator -prey interactions.

AB  - The Cyclades Islands (Aegean Sea, Greece) are part of the Mediterranean Basin biodiversity hotspot and harbor a plethora of endemic species. Plant communities on the smaller islands in this region have largely evolved in the absence of herbivory and frequently lack antiherbivore defenses. This study evaluates the short- and long-term effects of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), an herbivore that has been released on numerous islands in the region, by comparing islands that 1. have historically been rabbit-free (ungrazed); 2. are currently grazed by rabbits, and 3. have previously been grazed, but are now rabbit-free. Ecological impacts of rabbits on the Aegean Islands were investigated by assessing the abundance, composition, and diversity of plant and arthropod communities as well as soil characteristics. Our results indicate that ungrazed islands have more arthropod species, more specialized or endemic plant species, and less exposed soil than currently grazed islands. While ungrazed islands did not necessarily possess higher total plant species richness, they did harbor significantly more small-island endemic taxa relative to presently grazed islands. This study indicates that native plant communities on Mediterranean islets are not adapted to the presence of this introduced species and that the practice of intentionally releasing rabbits on islands has significant and lasting negative ecological impacts, especially on small islands. While a complete recovery of post-rabbit was not evident over the time span of our research, both arthropod and plant data indicate that partial recovery is possible once rabbits have been removed.

AB  - Cervids living in high latitudes have evolved to thrive in ecosystems that experience dramatic seasonal changes. Understanding these seasonal adaptations is important for reconstructing cervid life histories, ecosystem dynamics, and responses in the distant and not-so-distant past to changing seasonality caused by climate change. Cervid antlers provide a rare opportunity for insight into faunal seasonal ecology, as they are grown and shed each year. Stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen measured directly from antlers have the potential to provide seasonal dietary data for individuals. If the isotopic signals in bone and antler are controlled by the same metabolic processes, then the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of collagen (delta C-13(Coll) and delta N-15(Coll)) from incrementally grown antler tissue provide time-constrained dietary signals from the spring and summer growth season. Bone, by comparison, provides an average signal over several years. The amino acid (glutamate and phenylalanine) delta N-15 in antlers from modern captive caribou showed similar trophic discrimination factors to earlier results for other collagenous tissues (bone, tooth dentin, and cementum). Hence, growth rate was not the primary control on the stable isotope composition of antler collagen. We applied this knowledge to assess seasonal shifts in Quaternary fossils of three Cervidae species: elk (Cervus elaphus), moose (Alces alces), and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Paired antler-bone delta C-13(Coll) and delta N-15(Coll) from the same individual were used to identify differences between summer and annual diet and ecology. Intra-antler isotopic variability from serially sampled antlers was used to examine seasonal dietary shifts and specialization.

AB  - Seed dispersal mediated by frugivores is a key ecological function that is being disrupted worldwide due to defaunation. Nevertheless, we know little about the impacts of frugivore loss on seed dispersal function, as most studies focus on forest ecosystems and/or use plant-disperser interactions as a proxy for seed dispersal success. The Brazilian Cerrado is a tropical savanna and a biodiversity hotspot that has lost nearly half of its vegetation cover in the last decades and faces a large defaunation rate. To understand the impacts of defaunation on the seed dispersal of Cerrado, we sampled plant-frugivore interactions in five sites and assessed seed dispersal effectiveness of each interaction. Using a network approach, we simulated frugivore extinctions and population declines to evaluate the plant community response in terms of structural (remaining plant species) and functional (remaining seed dispersal effectiveness) robustness. We found that defaunation drove sharper losses in functional, compared to structural robustness. Sharper declines in functional robustness occurred when large frugivores were extinct first, and slower declines happened when specialists were extinct first, compared to a random extinction scenario. Declines in species abundances drove more losses in robustness compared to decreases in species richness. Results indicate that function can be lost before species are extinct, and that structural robustness may underestimate losses in seed dispersal. Furthermore, it suggests an important role of large-bodied and generalist frugivore species. Finally, we reinforce the need to maintain not only frugivore species, but also effective frugivore populations to conserve seed dispersal in the Cerrado.

AB  - Changes in soil carbon (C) sequestration in grassland ecosystems have important impacts on the global C cycle. As such, it is important that researchers better understand the underlying mechanisms affecting soil C. Increasing evidence has shown that atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition can cause dramatic changes in grassland soil C. It remains unclear whether herbivore grazing, a primary means to manage and utilize grassland resources, can regulate the effects of N deposition on soil C, and whether these effects are dependent on plant community diversity. Here, we examined the joint effects of herbivore grazing and N-addition on soil organic C (SOC) stocks in two types of communities with low and high plant diversity respectively. Our results showed that the effects of N-addition and its combination with herbivore grazing on grassland SOC were inconsistent in the two types of communities. In the low-diversity community, N-addition greatly decreased SOC stocks, while grazing significantly increased it. Additionally, the grazing-induced increase in soil C stocks in the presence of N-addition was so great that it completely counteracted the significant decline in SOC induced by N-addition. However, in the high-diversity community, we observed no effects of N-addition on SOC and grazing increased SOC only in the absence of N-addition and had no significant effect in the presence of N-addition. Synthesis and applications. Our study suggests that increased N deposition can trigger a remarkable reduction in soil C sequestration in grasslands with low plant diversity, but that herbivore grazing can offset this decline, which may help to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions caused by atmospheric N deposition. As a result, we suggest that moderate herbivore grazing should be considered as an effective grassland management measure for maintaining and improving grassland soil C sequestration as the increasing global changes such as elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide, N deposition and biodiversity losses threat.

AB  - Globally, large mammals are in decline. Biological traits including low population densities and longer generation times make them particularly susceptible. Their losses can have wide-ranging ecological consequences, including dramatic reductions in total heterotrophic energy use. To determine the key drivers of variation in energy use, we calculated daily rates of energy flow across the globe for 241 ecological communities, encompassing 441 large mammal species, using camera trap inventories. These were scaled up from individual metabolic rates and compared with various climate, anthropogenic, geographic, and species richness variables using three analytical methods: model selection, spatial autoregression, and a multiple regression method that completely removes multicollinearity known as least -squares orthogonalization. Community energy use is significantly lower in the Neotropics and Australasia than in the Afrotropics and Eurasia. This pattern mirrors the spatial distribution of megafaunal extinction intensity during the Late Pleistocene. Rates not being greatly reduced in the Nearctic is a notable exception to this pattern, and is likely due to the high abundances of certain species not present in the other highly -impacted realms. There are also strong negative correlations between community per -gram rates of energy flow and species richness, indicating that megafauna persist mainly in more speciose communities. The strong geographic differences that dominate energy use patterns indicate that past mammal extinctions are the ultimate cause of modern energetic variation in large mammal communities. If so, then ongoing losses of large mammals will greatly impact community and ecosystem functioning.

AB  - There is growing evidence that land-use management practices such as livestock grazing can strongly impact the local diversity, functioning, and stability of grassland communities. However, whether these impacts depend on environmental condition and propagate to larger spatial scales remains unclear. Using an 8-year grassland exclosure experiment conducted at nine sites in the Tibetan Plateau covering a large precipitation gradient, we found that herbivore exclusion increased the temporal stability of alpine grassland biomass production at both the local and larger (site) spatial scales. Higher local community stability was attributed to greater stability of dominant species, whereas higher stability at the larger scale was linked to higher spatial asynchrony of productivity among local communities. Additionally, sites with higher mean annual precipitation had lower dominant species stability and lower grassland stability at both the spatial scales considered. Our study provides novel evidence that livestock grazing can impair grassland stability across spatial scales and climatic gradients.

AB  - The regeneration niche of many plant species involves spatially and temporally unpredictable disturbances, called recruitment windows of opportunity. However, even species with clear dispersal adaptations such as fleshy berries may not successfully reach such elusive regeneration microsites. Ericaceous, berry-producing species in the northern hemisphere demonstrate this dispersal limitation. They are said to display a reproductive paradox owing to their lack of regeneration in apparently suitable microsites despite considerable investment in producing large quantities of berries. Cadavers generate vegetation-denuded and nutrient-rich disturbances termed cadaver decomposition islands (CDIs). Cadavers attract facultative scavengers with considerable capacity for endozoochorous seed dispersal. We hypothesize that CDIs facilitate recruitment in berry-producing ericaceous species due to endozoochorous dispersal directed toward favorable microsites with low competition. We examined seedling establishment within a permanent, semi-regular 10 x 10 m grid across an ungulate mass die-off on the Hardangervidda plateau in southeastern Norway. Competing models regarding the relative importance of factors governing recruitment were evaluated, specifically cadaver location (elevated seed rain) and microsite conditions (competition). We found that CDIs did facilitate seedling establishment, as cadaver density was the best predictor of seedling distribution. Other important factors governing seedling establishment such as percentage cover of soil and vascular plants alone were inadequate to explain seedling establishment. Synthesis: This study provides a novel understanding of sexual reproduction in species with cryptic generative reproduction. The directed nature of endozoochorous dispersal combined with long-distance dispersal abilities of medium to large vertebrate scavengers toward cadavers allows plants to exploit the advantageous but ephemeral resource provided by CDIs.

AB  - Cumulatively, the effects of resource extraction and climate change have the potential to cause an unprecedented change to the ecosystems and livelihoods of Indigenous communities in Canada's northern regions. Maintaining environmental and community values in the presence of such change will require a comprehensive understanding of potential long-term risks and opportunities to prevent or mitigate risks at the regional level. However, assessing the cumulative impact and benefits of the multiple disturbances at the regional level is complex due to the interaction of numerous drivers, values, actors, assessment scales, planning, and decision-making processes. We develop an integrated risk and cumulative effects (CE) management methodology to inform regional assessment by combining conceptual modelling through bowtie analysis and quantitative scenario analysis using ALCES Online (AO) simulation. We applied the framework using a case example in the Ring of Fire region of northern Ontario, Canada, to assess the CE of climate change, land use change, and wildlife harvest on the moose (Alces alces)-wolf (Canis lupus)-caribou (Rangifer tarandus) prey-predator system. The bowtie risk analysis provided a mechanism to define the management problem by identifying threats that contribute to risk, associated consequences, and specific management strategies that could be pursued under legislative frameworks and changes to maintain the sustainable dynamics of the moose-wolf-caribou system (MWC). The AO simulation of different levels of development and moose harvest, as well a baseline scenario that excluded climate change and development, allowed for a comprehensive examination of the complex processes driving the social-ecological system. The scenario analysis suggests that moose harvest can promote balance in the MWC system but only if applied in a sophisticated manner that limits moose harvest in areas with high road density, increases moose harvest in more remote regions susceptible to moose population expansion with climate change, and prioritizes Indigenous moose harvest to ensure a sustainable supply of moose for subsistence harvest. The case example shows how conceptual and quantitative modelling can provide the strategic perspective required for regional assessment.

AB  - Shifts in animal husbandry and landscape use have significantly changed ungulate grazing effects on ecosystem functioning. These changes are now the subject of extensive research with respect to plant and soil communities, but the results of these studies are highly varied and context dependent. The objective of this study is to address contextual variation by holding all sampling methods and analytical approaches constant and analyse the effect of the feral goat (Capra hircus) population of Mallorca Island, Spain, on soil physical, chemical and biological characteristics across five controlled sites. Specifically, vegetation cover and soil properties in fenced plots excluded from ungulates were compared with adjacent grazed plots in five independent mountain areas of Mallorca. Soil microbial activity measured as Community-Level Physiological Profiles (CLPP) using EcoPlate (TM) increased when ungulates were excluded. However, all other physical and chemical measures of the soils did not vary significantly when we considered ungulate exclusion across all plots, and this may be caused by a soil community that is simply robust to the effects of the herbivores. Or, it may be due to the high heterogeneity that was detected among pair plots comparisons within each of the five sites. Indeed, we find more variability within a site than among our independent sites leading us to hypothesize that grazing does influence biogeochemical cycles, but it does it by increasing variability of the system in general. Our well-controlled multilevel meta analysis confirms the notion that ungulate effects are highly context dependent, and soil heterogeneity makes resolving clear patterns very challenging. Apparently, context persistently drives the soil response more than the grazing itself, and this is seen even at very small scales.

AB  - We use a simple model of coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles in terrestrial ecosystems to examine how "explicitly representing grazers" vs. "having grazer effects implicitly aggregated in with other biogeochemical processes in the model" alters predicted responses to elevated carbon dioxide and warming. The aggregated approach can affect model predictions because grazer-mediated processes can respond differently to changes in climate compared with the processes with which they are typically aggregated. We use small-mammal grazers in a tundra as an example and find that the typical three-to-four-year cycling frequency is too fast for the effects of cycle peaks and troughs to be fully manifested in the ecosystem biogeochemistry. We conclude that implicitly aggregating the effects of small-mammal grazers with other processes results in an underestimation of ecosystem response to climate change, relative to estimations in which the grazer effects are explicitly represented. The magnitude of this underestimation increases with grazer density. We therefore recommend that grazing effects be incorporated explicitly when applying models of ecosystem response to global change.

AB  - In eastern Beringia (unglaciated Alaska and western Yukon), the Pleistocene-Holocene transition was characterised by rapid changes in plant, insect and mammal communities as the mammoth steppe ecosystem was replaced, first by shrub tundra and later boreal forest. These changes indicate a transition from well drained terrain with deep active layers to wetter, cooler soils, to which steppe-tundra vege-tation was poorly adapted. The nature and precise timing of these events is not well resolved, particularly in central Yukon where regional climate may have been strongly affected by the retreating Cordilleran-Laurentide ice sheet complex. Resolving this uncertainty is not only important for understanding past ecosystems, but also provides a long-term perspective for contemporary environmental change and shrub expansion that affects large areas of northern high-latitudes today. Here, we report chronology (41 radiocarbon dates), stratigraphy, pore-ice d2H/d18O measurements, pollen data, megafauna remains and fossil insect assemblages from a permafrost-preserved loessal sequence in central Yukon, named Lucky Lady. The site spans the interval from ca. 17,000 to 8000 cal yr BP (calibrated years before C.E. 1950) and records the Pleistocene-Holocene transition in exceptional resolution. Full glacial environments (ca. 16,500 cal yr BP) supported elements of steppe-tundra vegetation and an insect fauna dominated by Connatichela artemisiae -an endemic weevil indicating warm soil temperatures. The collapse of the mammoth steppe ecosystem began with slowing of loess accumulation and development of paleosol ca. 13,480 cal yr BP. At this time, C. artemisiae remains become infrequent and Artemisia pollen decline to be replaced by Cyperaceae (ca. 13,220), before mesic, shrub taxa (likely dwarf Betula and Salix) becomes dominant ca. 13,210 cal yr BP. The establishment of shrub tundra is associated with rapid changes in d2H/ d18O measurements, suggesting that ecological turnover coincided with a shift in atmospheric conditions and moisture availability. Finally, boreal vegetation communities became established ca. 10,680 cal yr BP. The replacement of steppe-tundra vegetation in central Yukon lagged other areas of eastern Beringia by as much as 1000 years and coincided with rapid deglaciation during the Bolling-Allerod time-period (14,600-12,90 0 cal yr BP). Turnover in insect and vegetation communities took place in ca. 40 years as shrub tundra became dominant. This rapid turnover has parallels with contemporary Arctic greening and re-emphasises the sensitivity of high-latitude environments to climate change.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Erosion of soil by water is facilitated by both diffusive and fluvial processes. Here we examine three different soil redistribution processes operating at very different spatial and temporal scales in the monsoonal tropics of northern Australia. The first process, rainsplash, operates across the entire catchment. This process, while subject to annual and seasonal variations in rainfall amount and intensity, can be considered a constant forcing and redistributes on average 9 t ha(-1) year(-1) (range -0.9 to 19 t ha(-1) year(-1)). The second process, bioturbation, where in this study soil is disturbed by feral pigs (wild boar), occurs in selected areas throughout each year. Pigs exhume 3 to 36.0 t ha(-1) year(-1) (average similar to 11 t ha(-1) year(-1)). The effect of this disturbance may last for many years afterwards. The third process is the disturbance of the soil surface by tree throw and creation of pit-mound topography (also a form of bioturbation), together with the resultant placement of the tree superstructure (above ground biomass) on the ground, which may form debris dams. Tree throw at the scale examined here is likely to occur only once every 50-100 years, with the influence of this single event lasting for at least 10 years post event. Tree throw in a single event exhumed similar to 5 t ha(-1) (1.1-9.5 t ha(-1)) of soil. In contrast to rainsplash, pig disturbance and tree throw events are largely point-based phenomena. Field observation suggests that it takes many years for the disturbance from both pigs and tree throw to be removed. We find here that in terms of relative soil redistribution, rainsplash has the largest influence, with any erosional disturbance by pigs and tree throw being within the variability of rainsplash. However, the disruption of surface flow by the pig digs and tree throw disrupts sedimentological and hydrological connectivity.

AB  - The endangered Yellow Cardinal Gubernatrix cristata is under pressure from habitat loss and from capturing for the cage bird trade. In north-east Argentina it is known to be associated with the Espinal ecoregion, but no information was available on habitat selection within this ecoregion. In Entre Rios province, Argentina, we first sampled Yellow Cardinal presence in four environments: Espinal savannahs, Espinal open woodlands, riparian woodlands, and agricultural fields. Yellow Cardinals were only detected in savannahs. In a second set of surveys, transects were surveyed at sites with known presence of Yellow Cardinals and were placed within savannahs as well as nearby in open forests of only slightly different physiognomy. Yellow Cardinals were again only detected in savannahs. Tree density, shrub cover and height of herbaceous layer were lower in savannahs than in open woodlands. Ground-foraging Yellow Cardinals in savannahs foraged exclusively in grass patches with short grass of 3 ˗12 cm height. Such short grass occurred in 75% of spots of savannahs sites, but only in 48% of open woodlands. Savannah sites with Yellow Cardinals were significantly further away from permanent roads than sites without Cardinals, likely a reflection of capture pressure near roads. We recommend establishing additional protected areas with a high proportion of savannah patches and with limited or no road access. The short grass used by foraging Yellow Cardinals requires maintenance through grazing. Rewilding with native herbivores in protected areas is preferable to attain natural herbivory, but during the initial stages of rewilding, cattle and sheep grazing are essential to avoid tree and shrub proliferation in savannahs. The Yellow Cardinal can also persist on private lands with Espinal vegetation under sustainable livestock grazing. Frequent and effective patrolling and road controls are essential to reduce illegal capturing.

AB  - Understanding functional processes of aquatic bodies provides alternative means of assessing aquatic ecosystem health and identifying sites in urgent need of conservation or restoration. In this study, aquatic macroinvertebrates were used to assess the ecosystem health of a protected headwater stream (Olumirin Stream) and an unprotected middle-sized stream (Opa Stream) in Southwest Nigeria. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected between May 2019 and January 2022 and assessed for their taxonomic and functional diversity. A total of 51 macroinvertebrate species were recorded in Olumirin Stream, while a total of 35 species were recorded for Opa Stream. A significantly higher species richness (p < 0.001), Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) richness (p < 0.0001) and EPT abundance (p < 0.0001) were recorded in Olumirin Stream. While the Simpson Index (1 - D) showed higher diversity (p > 0.05) in Opa Stream, the Shannon-Wiener Index (H) indicated a significantly higher diversity (p < 0.05) in Olumirin Stream. Also, a total of six functional feeding guilds (FFGs) were recorded in the Olumirin Stream, namely predators, scrapers, shredders, collector-gatherers (CGs), collector-filterers (CFs) and piercer-herbivores (PHs). Predators dominated the fauna of both streams, while CGs and PHs were not recorded in the Opa Stream. The FFG-based channel stability index reflected a generally stable substrate in Opa stream. The production/respiration ratio (P/R) revealed the autotrophic and heterotrophic states of Opa and Olumirin Streams, respectively, with a significant difference (p < 0.05) between both streams. The P/R ratio (0.75) of the Olumirin Stream clearly indicates that its biological productivity is being driven by allochthonous organic matter of its riparian forest, while that of the Opa Stream is being driven largely by autochthonous organic matter. As a result, a dual approach of riparian forest and freshwater system protection is advocated for the sustainability of freshwater biodiversity in particular.

AB  - Northern protected areas guard against habitat and species loss but are themselves highly vulnerable to environmental change due to their fixed spatial boundaries. In the low Arctic, Torngat Mountains National Park (TMNP) of Canada, widespread greening has recently occurred alongside warming temperatures and regional declines in caribou. Little is known, however, about how biophysical controls mediate plant responses to climate warming, and available observational data are limited in temporal and spatial scope. In this study, we investigated the drivers of land cover change for the 9700 km(2) extent of the park using satellite remote sensing and geostatistical modelling. Random forest classification was used to hindcast and simulate land cover change for four different land cover types from 1985 to 2019 with topographic and surface reflectance imagery (Landsat archive). The resulting land cover maps, in addition to topographic and biotic variables, were then used to predict where future shrub expansion is likely to occur using a binomial regression framework. Land cover hindcasts showed a 235% increase in shrub and a 105% increase in wet vegetation cover from 1985/89 to 2015/19. Shrub cover was highly persistent and displaced wet vegetation in southern, low-elevation areas, whereas wet vegetation expanded to formerly dry, mid-elevations. The predictive model identified both biotic (initial cover class, number of surrounding shrub neighbors), and topographic variables (elevation, latitude, and distance to the coast) as strong predictors of future shrub expansion. A further 51% increase in shrub cover is expected by 2039/43 relative to 2014 reference data. Establishing long-term monitoring plots within TMNP in areas where rapid vegetation change is predicted to occur will help to validate remote sensing observations and will improve our understanding of the consequences of change for biotic and abiotic components of the tundra ecosystem, including important cultural keystone species.

AB  - Alpine large herbivores have developed physiological and behavioural mechanisms to cope with fluctuations in climate and resource availability that may become maladaptive under climate warming. We tested this hypothesis in female Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) by modelling annual and daily movement and activity patterns in relation to temperature, vegetation productivity and reproductive status based on bio-logging data and climate change projections. In summer, ibex moved upslope, tracking the green wave. Ibex decreased diel activity sharply above a threshold temperature of 13-14 degrees C, indicating thermal stress, but compensated behaviourally by foraging both earlier and later in the day, and by moving further upslope than on cooler days, especially reproductive females. This critical temperature will be exceeded three times as often under climate change projections. Under such scenarios, the altitudinal extent of the area will limit the available habitat providing thermal shelter, potentially impacting performance and population distribution of this emblematic mountain ungulate.

AB  - Herbivores play a crucial role in shaping tundra ecosystems through their effects on vegetation, nutrient cycling, and soil abiotic factors. Understanding their habitat use, co-occurrence, and overlap is therefore essential for informing ecosystem-based management and conservation. In the High Arctic, only a marginal proportion of the land area is vegetated, and climate change is impacting herbivore population sizes and their habitats. In this study, we assessed the spatial habitat overlap of a vertebrate herbivore community based on: 1) regional predictive summer habitat suitability models for the resident Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus), resident Svalbard rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea), and the migratory pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus), and 2) presence of fecal pellets, reflecting the annual habitat use of reindeer, ptarmigan, and geese, including the pink-footed goose and barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis). Our findings revealed that only small proportions of the available land cover (similar to 12,516 km(2); all land area excluding glaciers and freshwater) are suitable for each of the species (habitat suitability [HS] > 0.5): reindeer (22 %), ptarmigan (11 %), and pink-footed goose (4 %). Overlapping suitable habitat [HS > 0.5] for reindeer and goose accounted for only 3 % of the total vegetated area (similar to 8848 km(2)) and was primarily found in heath and moist habitats dominated by mosses, graminoids, and herbaceous plants. The overlapping suitable habitat for reindeer and ptarmigan covered 8 % of the vegetated area, in higher elevation ridges with vegetation on drier substrates. The shared habitat for ptarmigan and goose, and all three species of herbivores, was less than 1 % of the vegetated area. Additionally, an assessment of fecal pellets suggested that the highest overlap in habitat use among reindeer and goose occurred in bird cliff moss tundra, followed by moss tundra and heath habitats. The small proportion of the vegetated area suitable for all three herbivores indicates a high degree of habitat differentiation. Therefore, different habitats need to be considered for the management and conservation of resident and migratory herbivore species in this High Arctic Archipelago. Moreover, our results underscore the importance of the small but productive parts of the landscape that were used by all herbivores

AB  - The extensive, prehistoric loss of megafauna during the last 50 000 years led early naturalists to build the founding theories of ecology based on already-degraded ecosystems. In this article, we outline how large herbivores affect community ecology, with a special focus on plants, through changes to selection, speciation, drift, and dispersal, thereby directly impacting ecosystem diversity and functionality. However, attempts to quantify effects of large herbivores on ecosystem processes are markedly scarce in past and contemporary studies. We expect this is due to the shifting baseline syndrome, where ecologists omit the now-missing effects of extinct, large herbivores when designing experiments and theoretical models, despite evidence that large herbivores shaped the physical structure, biogeochemistry, and species richness of the studied systems. Here, we outline how effects of large herbivores can be incorporated into central theoretical models to integrate megaherbivore theory into community ecology. As anthropogenic impacts on climate and nutrient levels continue, further warping ecological processes and disconnecting species distributions from optimal conditions, the importance of quantifying large herbivore functionality, such as facilitation of dispersal and coexistence, increases. Our findings indicate that current scientific attention to large herbivores is disproportionate to their past impacts on habitat structure and evolutionary trajectories, as well as the role large herbivores can play in restoring diverse and resilient ecosystems.

AB  - Kangaroos (Macropus spp., Osphranter sp.) are the most ubiquitous free-ranging herbivores in Australia. Much has been written on their impacts on plant community composition and how they interact with livestock, particularly in extensive rangelands. Little is known, however, about how kangaroos affect soil function and their relationship with healthy soils, nor the impact of peri-urban populations of kangaroos where they might come into conflict with humans. To address this, we used exclosures to examine the impacts of low densities of kangaroos on the morphology of the soil surface in a peri-urban environment on the outskirts of Sydney, Australia. We found that kangaroo grazing was associated with reduced herbaceous biomass and cover, and biocrust cover, and surfaces were generally more stable, had a greater cover and incorporation of litter and had greater plant species richness. There were no differences in indices of nutrient cycling nor stability. Overall, our study supports the notion that kangaroo grazing, at the current low densities experienced in this peri-urban reserve, has had no significant deleterious effect on soil surface health, as measured by the morphology of the surface. We conclude that grazing at the current low levels (similar to 70 km(-2)) is unlikely to have major long-term negative effects on soil surface condition.

AB  - Artificial hard substrates such as shipwrecks and large debris can impact biodiversity, especially in the deep sea where hard substrate is limited. A potential complex interplay occurs where wrecks provide surfaces for recruitment of epibenthic organisms and structured habitat for mobile invertebrates and fish but may also inhibit successional processes due to the presence of oil and other toxins. Here, we examined the interplay of these dynamics using remotely operated vehicle (ROV) surveys of the wrecks of the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, the SS 'Robert E. Lee,' and the USS 'Peterson.' Megafauna were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic unit using the high-definition video captured by ROV. Comparisons of the 3 wrecks revealed communities with unique compositions, but that did not vary significantly in total abundance, density, richness, evenness, or diversity. Furthermore, while species identities varied between wreck sites, the functional roles they fulfilled based on motility, tiering, and feeding mode largely did not. We posit wreck age, depth, and the presence of oil as potentially interacting factors influencing the assembly of these artificial hard substrate communities. As industrial activities continue to introduce more artificial substrates into the deep sea, our findings suggest that these structures may not support the diverse, thriving ecosystems typically expected, which has important implications for deep-sea restoration and conservation efforts focused on enhancing biodiversity through artificial habitats.

AB  - Questions How does long-term, moderate-intensity mowing affect plant community diversity, biomass, and composition in semi-arid grasslands? And what are the underlying mechanisms that drive differences in plant community structure and functions between mowed and unmowed grasslands?Location A semi-arid grassland in Jilin Province, northeastern China.Methods In a 30-year experiment, we investigated long-term effects of mowing on the grassland ecosystem in northeastern China by comparing plant community diversity, biomass, and composition between mowed and unmowed permanent plots across six grasslands.Results Long-term mowing did not affect plant species richness, but increased species evenness by 29%. Mowing had little effects on above-ground (shoot) and below-ground (root) biomass. The unchanged above-ground biomass in the mowed areas was attributed to a trade-off between biomass of grasses and forbs: mowing significantly increased forb biomass by 50%, but reduced grass biomass by 20% and the grass to forb biomass ratio by 46%. Mowing also reduced biomass of the dominant Leymus chinensis grass by 24% and litter biomass by 56%. Regression analyses indicated that the species evenness was negatively affected by L. chinensis biomass and litter biomass.Conclusions This study demonstrates that, although long-term moderate mowing has limited effects on plant species richness and plant biomass, such a managed strategy can greatly reduce the dominance of grass species and allow the growth of forb species, leading to a higher species evenness in the plant community. This win-win situation promotes forage production for farmers while increasing plant diversity for conservation, suggesting that current mowing tactics can be a sustainable management practice in this ecosystem. However, the continuous loss of plant litter because of mowing may have negative influences on soil nutrient availability in the long run. From this perspective, a short-term halt in mowing or fertilization that allows plants and soil nutrients to recover could represent a more optimal protocol for management.

AB  - Almost one third of global drylands are open forests and savannas, which are typically shaped by frequent natural disturbances such as wildfire and herbivory. Studies on ecosystem functions and services of woody vegetation require robust estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB). However, most methods have been developed for comparatively undisturbed forest ecosystems. As they are not tailored to accurately quantify AGB of small and irregular growth forms, their application on these growth forms may lead to unreliable or even biased AGB estimates in disturbance-prone dryland ecosystems. Moreover, these methods cannot quantify AGB losses caused by disturbance agents. Here we propose a methodology to estimate individual-and stand-level woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems. It consists of flexible field sampling routines and estimation workflows for six growth classes, delineated by size and damage criteria. It also comprises a detailed damage assessment, harnessing the ecological archive of woody growth for past disturbances.
   Based on large inventories collected along steep gradients of elephant disturbances in African dryland ecosystems, we compared the AGB estimates generated with our proposed method against estimates from a less adapted forest inventory method. We evaluated the necessary stepwise procedures of method adaptation and analyzed each step's effect on stand-level AGB estimation. We further explored additional advantages of our proposed method with regard to disturbance impact quantification. Results indicate that a majority of growth forms and individuals in savanna vegetation could only be assessed if methods of AGB estimation were adapted to the conditions of a disturbance-prone ecosystem. Furthermore, our damage assessment demonstrated that one third to half of all woody AGB was lost to disturbances. Consequently, less adapted methods may be insufficient and are likely to render inaccurate AGB estimations.
   Our proposed method has the potential to accurately quantify woody AGB in disturbance-prone ecosystems, as well as AGB losses. Our method is more time consuming than conventional allometric approaches, yet it can cover sufficient areas within reasonable timespans, and can also be easily adapted to alternative sampling schemes.

AB  - Loss of arthropod biodiversity can impair the provision of ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Crop diversification strategies offer the possibility to support arthropod communities without putting aside agricultural land as conservation areas. Within-field crop diversification measures, such as strip cropping and crop mixtures, may provide arthropods with continuity and diversity in food, shelter and habitat at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. However, it is unclear how strip cropping and plant species diversity within strips influences aerial arthropod and weed communities in commercially sized arable fields. In this 2-year study we tested the effects of crop heterogeneity on aerial arthropod and plant communities in organically managed strip fields. We tested effects of configurational crop heterogeneity by comparing sole cropping (MONO) with strip cropping (STRIP), and compositional crop heterogeneity by comparing STRIP with flower-legume-grain crop mixtures grown in strips (STRIPMIX). Aerial arthropod communities were assessed in 138 sweep net transects and plant communities in 124 vegetation plots in cabbage, wheat, sugar beet and barley. Higher configurational crop heterogeneity by strip cropping reduced herbivore abundances and increased natural enemy species richness in organic cabbage strips. Cabbage in MONO had a significantly higher herbivore abundance (+11%) and a lower natural enemy species richness (-57%) than cabbage in STRIP. Higher compositional crop heterogeneity by sowing additional plant species in strips (STRIPMIX) significantly increased plant abundance (+33%), plant species richness (+21%), total aerial arthropod abundance (+45%), and total aerial arthropod species richness (+21%) compared to STRIP. Our work shows that both configuration of crop areas (MONO vs. STRIP) and plant species diversity within strips (STRIP vs. STRIPMIX) can support arthropod biodiversity and natural pest suppression, but that arthropod responses differ between diversification strategies and crop combinations. Further optimization of design and management of within-field crop diversification strategies holds potential to attain biodiversity-based cropping systems which deliver multiple ecosystem services and have a reduced dependency on pesticides.

AB  - Animals disperse seeds in various ways that affect seed deposition sites and seed survival, ultimately shaping plant species distribution, community composition, and ecosystem structure. Some animal species can disperse seeds through multiple pathways (e.g., defecation, regurgitation, epizoochory), each likely producing distinct seed dispersal outcomes. We studied how seed traits (size and toughness) interact with disperser species to influence seed dispersal pathway and how this ultimately shapes the proportion of seeds deposited in various habitat types. We focused on three frugivorous species of duikers (African forest antelopes) in the Dja Faunal Reserve, a tropical rainforest in southern Cameroon. Duikers can both defecate and regurgitate seeds, the latter predominantly occurring during rumination at their bedding sites (or "nests"). We located duiker nests and dungs along 18 linear 1-km-transects to assess: (1) how seed traits affect the likelihood of dispersal via defecation versus regurgitation, (2) if defecated versus regurgitated seeds are deposited at different rates in different forest types (assessed by indigenous Baka), microhabitats, and forest structural attributes (measured by drone lidar), and (3) if these differ between three duiker species that vary in size and diel activity patterns. We found that duikers predominantly defecated small seeds (<3 mm length) and regurgitated larger and tougher seeds (>10 mm length), the latter including 25 different plant species. The three duiker species varied in their nesting habits, with nocturnal bay duikers (Cephalophus dorsalis) nesting in dense understory vegetation at proportions 3-4 times higher than Peter's and yellow-backed duikers (Cephalophus callipygus and Cephalophus silvicultor). As a result, bay duikers deposited larger regurgitated seeds at a higher rate in habitats with denser understory where lianas and palms predominate and near fallen trees. This directed regurgitation seed deposition likely plays an important and unique role in forest succession and structure. This study highlights the importance of ungulate seed dispersal by regurgitation, a vastly understudied process that could impact many ecosystems given the prevalence of ruminating ungulates worldwide.

AB  - Ecological theory predicts the strongest ecosystem effects of herbivory when dominant and ecologically important species are consumed. Bilberry, Vaccinium myrtillus, is such a key plant species, attractive to many other species in the boreal forests, for example ungulate and invertebrate herbivores. Large herbivores may remove substantial biomass and alter plant quality and therefore affect abundance and populations of invertebrate animals sharing the same food plant. We combined experimental exclusion of ungulates with a browsing intensity gradient to investigate the 15-year effect of ungulate (Cervus elaphus and Ovis aries) browsing on bilberry plant size and on bilberry-feeding herbivorous larvae (Lepidoptera and Symphyta), in a Norwegian old growth boreal forest ecosystem. Bilberry ramets in exclosure plots had nearly nine times higher dry mass and three times higher abundance of invertebrates feeding on them than in ungulate-access plots. Sweep-netting data verified these findings as larval numbers were twice as high in exclosure plots. The pattern in the large herbivore effects on bilberry size and abundance of herbivorous larvae were identical along the browsing gradient. Differences in larval abundance between treatments, as indicated by leaf-chewing, increased during the 15-year study period, and the community fluctuations were larger when ungulate herbivores were excluded. The browsing effect was moderated by plant quality as larval densities were lowest on both heavily-browsed and non-browsed plants, and highest on ramets that had 50 similar to 74% of annual shoots browsed. Our study supports previous findings in that bilberry is relatively disturbance tolerant and may recover quickly, but that ungulates may compete with herbivorous larvae for food biomass. Additionally, our results strongly indicates that population insect community peaks and fluctuations are dampened by ungulate consumption. Our findings add to the understanding on how ungulates may structure forest ecosystems directly and indirectly. (C) 2021 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - How environmental conditions promote interspecific niche overlap and the occurrence of competition has long intrigued ecologists. In native ungulate assemblages, dietary partitioning based on interspecific differences in diet preferences has often been reported, but dietary overlap indicating competition is relatively rare. In Japan, native sika deer (Cervus nippon) have invaded high-elevation mountain areas and negatively affected the vegetation there, whereas native Japanese serows (Capricornis crispus) have declined in these areas. However, diet-related interspecific relationships between these species remain unclear in these areas. We examined the diets of deer and serows, and the forage availability in a subalpine forest and an alpine desert of Mt. Fuji, central Japan. The subalpine forest provided both graminoids and coniferous trees, while the alpine desert provided a homogeneous supply of dicot leaves, and forage abundance of both habitats was quite limited. In the subalpine forest, deer fed mainly on graminoids while serows fed mainly on conifer leaves, suggesting partitioning of food resources. By contrast, in the alpine desert, both species fed mainly on dicot leaves, resulting in dietary overlap. We show for the first time that the diets of these two species overlap when shared food resources are limited, suggesting that food resource competition is likely to occur in the alpine desert. These results suggest that food resource competition can occur when both food resource diversity and abundance are limited, even among native species with different diet preferences.

AB  - Recently expanded estimates for when humans arrived on Madagascar (up to approximately 10 000 years ago) highlight questions about the causes of the island's relatively late megafaunal extinctions (approximately 2000-500 years ago). Introduced domesticated animals could have contributed to extinctions, but the arrival times and past diets of exotic animals are poorly known. To conduct the first explicit test of the potential for competition between introduced livestock and extinct endemic megafauna in southern and western Madagascar, we generated new radiocarbon and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope data from the bone collagen of introduced ungulates (zebu cattle, ovicaprids and bushpigs, n = 66) and endemic megafauna (pygmy hippopotamuses, giant tortoises and elephant birds, n = 68), and combined these data with existing data from endemic megafauna (n = 282, including giant lemurs). Radiocarbon dates confirm that introduced and endemic herbivores briefly overlapped chronologically in this region between 1000 and 800 calibrated years before present (cal BP). Moreover, stable isotope data suggest that goats, tortoises and hippos had broadly similar diets or exploited similar habitats. These data support the potential for both direct and indirect forms of competition between introduced and endemic herbivores. We argue that competition with introduced herbivores, mediated by opportunistic hunting by humans and exacerbated by environmental change, contributed to the late extinction of endemic megafauna on Madagascar.

AB  - 1. Theory predicts that a large fraction of phytochemical diversity-the richness of individual chemical compounds produced by plants-governs the complexity of interactions between plants and their herbivores. While the effect of specific classes of chemical compounds on plant resistance against herbivores has been largely documented, the effect of community-level variation in phytochemical diversity on plant-herbivore interactions has so far received minimal consideration.
   2. We hypothesized that plant communities bearing on average higher levels of phytochemical diversity should sustain lower herbivory rates, overall. Yet, the magnitude of this effect could vary across different environmental conditions, potentially because of climate-mediated effects on phytochemical production and changes in herbivore community richness and composition.
   3. To address these hypotheses, we used previous knowledge of species-level phytochemical make-up for more than 400 plant species of the Swiss Alps. Using common garden experiments, we estimated season-wide herbivore damage on low (average 3,500 unique molecules) and high (average 4,500 unique molecules) phytochemical diversity plant communities that were planted in the colline, mountain and alpine vegetation sites along two elevation transects in the Alps.
   4. We found that high phytochemical diversity plant communities showed reduced levels of herbivore damage in the colline (low elevation) sites, but this pattern reversed in the alpine (high elevation) sites. Our results suggest that the outcome of phytochemical diversity on plant-herbivore interactions depends on the characteristics of the local herbivore communities, together with trade-offs between chemical defences and other plant traits (i.e. physical defences and plant palatability).
   5. Synthesis. Phytochemical diversity is a key component of functional diversity, influencing community composition and dynamics. We show that the effect of phytochemical diversity on herbivory is environmental-dependent, generating ecological switches when moving from low to high elevation. Through upward movement of plants under climate change, phytochemical community structure will be likely modified, ultimately disrupting local community assembly processes.

AB  - Fire refugia and patchiness are important to the persistence of fire-sensitive species and may facilitate biodiversity conservation in fire-dependent landscapes. Playing the role of ecosystem engineers, large herbivores alter vegetation structure and can reduce wildfire risk. However, herbivore effects on the spatial variability of fire and the persistence of fire-sensitive species are not clear. To examine the hypothesis that large herbivores support the persistence of fire-sensitive species through the creation of fire refugia in fire-prone landscapes, we examined the response of a fire-sensitive plant, Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis [Beetle & Young]) to fire and grazing in the fire-dependent mixed-grass prairie of the northern Great Plains. We carried out a controlled burn in 2010 within pre-established exclosures that allowed differential access to wild and domestic herbivores and no record of fire in the previous 75 years due to fire suppression efforts. The experiment was set up with a split-plot design to also examine potential changes in plots that were not burned. Canopy cover of big sagebrush was recorded before the burn in 2010 and again in 2011 with percent area burned recorded within 1-month post-fire in the burned plots. Percentage area burned was the greatest in ungulate exclosures (92% +/- 2%) and the least in open areas (55% +/- 21%), suggesting that large herbivores influenced fire behavior (e.g., reducing fire intensity and rate of spread) and are likely to increase fire patchiness through their alterations to the fuel bed. Regression analysis indicated that the proportion of sagebrush cover lost was significantly correlated with the proportion of area burned (R-2 = 0.76, p = 0.05). No differences in the non-burn plots were observed among grazing treatments or among years. Altogether, this illustrates the potential importance of large herbivores in creating biotic-driven fire refugia for fire-sensitive species to survive within the flammable fuel matrix of fire-dependent grassland ecosystems such as the mixed-grass prairie. Our findings also attest to the resiliency of the northern Great Plains to fire and herbivory and underscore the value of managing grasslands for heterogeneity with spatial and temporal variations in these historic disturbances.

AB  - The issue of agricultural land abandonment in southern Europe has raised concerns about its impact on biodiversity. While abandoned areas can lead to positive developments like creating new habitats and restoring native vegetation, they can also result in human-wildlife conflicts, particularly in areas with extensive farming and free-ranging livestock. To understand habitat selection and use of livestock and wild ungulates, it is essential to study their spatial and temporal distribution patterns. In this context, we conducted a long-term large mammal monitoring project using camera traps in the Peneda-Ger & ecirc;s National Park in northern Portugal. Our primary focus was on exploring habitat preferences, occupancy dynamics, and potential spatial use correlations between domestic and wild species, utilizing dynamic occupancy models. Most wild species exhibited stable area use patterns, while domestic species experienced marginal declines, and the Iberian ibex displayed signs of repopulation. We observed distinct effects of habitat variables on occupancy, colonization, and extinction, revealing species-specific patterns of habitat utilization. Human disturbance had a notable impact on domestic species but did not affect wild ones. Camera sensitivity emerged as a critical factor, enhancing detection probability for all species. Additionally, habitat and weather variables exerted varying effects on detection probabilities, underscoring the necessity of accounting for these factors in modeling the detection process. We found shared habitat preferences between cattle and horses, both positively correlated with wolves, suggesting potential human-wildlife conflicts. Despite extensive spatial overlap, domestic and wild species seem to exhibit ecological independence possibly due to distinct strategies and low predation pressure. Overall, the study emphasizes the multifaceted factors influencing habitat use. The observed species associations contribute to understanding ecological relationships and potential resource competition, emphasizing the importance of considering environmental variables for effective wildlife conservation and management.

AB  - Large-scale disturbances such as ice storms may increase in frequency and intensity as climate changes. While disturbances are a natural component of forest ecosystems, climatically driven alteration to historical patterns may impart fundamental change to ecosystem function. At Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, experimental ice storms of varying severity were applied to replicate plots of mature northern hardwoods to quantify their effects on forested ecosystems. We assessed ice storm treatment effects on insectivorous foliage-gleaning birds and evaluated insectivore predation on model caterpillars in the understory vegetation. These birds are charismatic, of conservation concern, and are major predators of caterpillars. In turn, lepidopterans are the dominant herbivores in temperate forests and are integral to ecosystem function. We predicted that avian abundance would increase due to additional structural heterogeneity caused by ice treatments, with a concomitant increase in caterpillar predation. Point counts were used to measure insectivorous bird activity in the ice storm experiment plots and additional control plots before and after treatments. We deployed and retrieved plasticine model caterpillars and estimated predation from characteristic marks to these surrogates. Abundance of foliage-gleaning birds was higher in the ice storm plots and birds responded to treatments as a single diffuse disturbance rather than on an individual plot level. All species except one were observed both before and after the ice treatments. Surprisingly, predation on caterpillar models was unaffected by ice storm treatments but rather was a function of caterpillar density. The increase in avian abundance in the ice storm treatment plots corroborates other studies of bird responses to relatively small-scale disturbances in forests and the limited change in species composition was expected given the plot size. We conclude that ice storms may provide beneficial changes for foliage-gleaning birds in the growing season following the disturbance.

AB  - Free-range domestic pig keeping in forests is a millennia-old practice in Eurasia, and remains common in many silvopastoral systems worldwide. Despite the long history of its potential impact on forests, the influence of this practice on the structure, composition and species richness of the understorey is hardly known. We studied the impact of free-ranging domestic pigs on the herb and shrub layers, and the consequences of abandoning pig keeping in a hardwood floodplain forest in Serbia, SE Europe. We recorded the cover and composition of the herb layer (incl. woody species) using 30 subsamples at each of the 56 sampling plots (1680 subsamples) in seven disturbance intensity and abandonment categories. We measured the browsing, rooting and rubbing impact on the shrub layer by sampling more than 3100 woody specimens. The cover of the herb layer decreased as disturbance intensity increased. We observed only a small compositional shift from currently used, slightly to highly disturbed plots in the herb layer, while the most severely disturbed currently used resting places and the abandoned sites were markedly different. The number and cover of hardwood forest species were the highest at abandoned sites, but only their cover showed a decreasing trend along the disturbance intensity gradient, while the cover of forest generalist species showed an increasing trend in currently used plots. The number and cover of forest ruderals were the highest in resting places in both abandonment categories, while the cover of non-forest ruderal and neophyte species was significantly higher only in currently used resting places. Unexpectedly, neither disturbance intensity nor abandonment had a substantial effect on the composition of the shrub layer. The cover of both the upper and lower shrub layers was the highest in plots abandoned 40 years ago, decreasing slightly as disturbance intensity increased in currently used plots. The impact of rooting and rubbing by pigs on shrub morphology (increase of resprouting specimens and specimens with distorted stems) was significant, while that of browsing was negligible. Our study shows that this previously widespread, but now almost completely disappeared land-use practice may have had a marked impact on the understorey vegetation of Eurasian temperate oak forests.

AB  - Understory conditions strongly influence the value of upland hardwood forests for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo). Canopy reduction can be paired with low-intensity prescribed fire to increase forage and cover. Most fire in these systems is applied during the dormant season, but there may be benefits to burning during different seasons to provide different resources throughout the year. We imple-mented a shelterwood harvest with reserves in four upland hardwood stands in east Tennessee in 2010, then applied fire during the early-growing season (EGS) and late-growing season (LGS) to different treatment units on approximately a 2.2-year return interval from 2012-2023. We recorded vegetation composition, measured vegetation structure, calculated deer forage availability, and tallied wildlife detections via camera traps in summer 2023 to evaluate our treatments relative to an unharvested and unburned control. We found canopy reduction and fire during either season resulted in greater understory coverage of plants, with tree and bramble coverage greatest following LGS fire, which was lower intensity on average than EGS fire. Vegetation structure following EGS fire was more open, which is typically selected by brooding turkeys. The taller structure following LGS fire provided conditions typically selected for bedding or fawning by deer and nesting for turkeys. Deer forage biomass in July was increased by both EGS and LGS relative to control, but forage of sufficient quality to support a lactating doe was increased only in EGS because of increased nutrition of recently resprouting vege-tation. Deer and turkey detections were greater in EGS than control or LGS during May-June. Turkey detections remained greater in EGS during July-August, but deer use was similar between EGS and LGS during July-August. Our results indicate burning during different seasons following canopy reduction can promote different food and cover resources which are important for deer and turkeys during different times of the year.

AB  - Activity patterns are an important behavioral trait linked to animal interactions within food webs. Biological invasions can have impacts on the behavior of native species through predation and competition, but few studies have determined if invasions lead to shifts in activity patterns of native species. Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a generalist, invasive vertebrate in North America that may affect activity patterns of native species through competition and predation. We hypothesized native species' activity patterns would differ from their expected activity pattern (i.e., typical hours of daily activity) and be more variable across sites occupied by wild pigs. We used a U.S. nationwide and a regional camera trapping dataset to determine if wild pig presence affected activity patterns of a nocturnal, diurnal, and crepuscular species: northern raccoon (Procyon lotor), eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), respectively. We simulated expected activity patterns of each species and overlapped them with observed activity patterns of respective species in populations where wild pigs were present and where they were not detected. Overlap coefficients were used in generalized linear mixed models to determine if wild pig presence explained deviations from the expected activity pattern. When wild pigs were detected, raccoons remained nocturnal, but their activity patterns were less variable, squirrel activity on the ground was less diurnal and their activity patterns were more variable, and deer activity patterns remained similar in both respects. These results highlight how biological invasions may differentially influence native species activity patterns, potentially altering food web-level interactions.

AB  - Dry grasslands are not only amongst the most species-rich habitats in Europe but also amongst the most threatened. Threats include habitat destruction as well as modification to the historic disturbance regime under which native plants have evolved (e.g. too high or too low levels of disturbance). The aim of this study is to examine the effects of soil disturbance intensity on species composition and diversity in a dry grassland in Mols Bjerge National Park in Denmark. We recorded vascular plant species inside and just outside patches of bare sand and at the transition between bare sand and dense vegetation outside the patches. We found that species richness was highest in the dense vegetation, intermediate in the transition zone and lowest in bare sand areas. However, an analysis of plant traits showed that the number of small annual species was highest in the transition zone. High abundance of small annual species may therefore indicate intermediate disturbance regimes. Moreover, literature indicates that many threatened species are adapted to such habitats, which suggests that dry grasslands should be managed to maintain areas with intermediate disturbance intensities to improve conditions for many threatened species. High abundance of small annual species thus indicates that favourable management has been achieved.

AB  - Background Climate change models predict changes in the amount, frequency and seasonality of precipitation events, all of which have the potential to affect the structure and function of grassland ecosystems. While previous studies have examined plant or herbivore responses to these perturbations, few have examined their interactions; even fewer have included belowground herbivores. Given the ecological, economic and biodiversity value of grasslands, and their importance globally for carbon storage and agriculture, this is an important knowledge gap. To address this, we conducted a precipitation manipulation experiment in a former mesic pasture grassland comprising a mixture of C-4 grasses and C-3 grasses and forbs, in southeast Australia. Rainfall treatments included a control [ambient], reduced amount [50% ambient] and reduced frequency [ambient rainfall withheld for three weeks, then applied as a single deluge event] manipulations, to simulate predicted changes in both the size and frequency of future rainfall events. In addition, half of all experimental plots were inoculated with adult root herbivores (Scarabaeidae beetles). Results We found strong seasonal dependence in plant community responses to both rainfall and root herbivore treatments. The largest effects were seen in the cool season with lower productivity, cover and diversity in rainfall-manipulated plots, while root herbivore inoculation increased the relative abundance of C-3, compared to C-4, plants. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering not only the seasonality of plant responses to altered rainfall, but also the important role of interactions between abiotic and biotic drivers of vegetation change when evaluating ecosystem-level responses to future shifts in climatic conditions.

AB  - Aims One of the most important questions of our time is how ecosystems will be transformed by climate change. Here, we used a five-year field experiment to investigate the effects of climate warming on the cover and function of a sub-Arctic alpine ecosystem in the highlands of Iceland dominated by biocrust, mosses and vascular plants. Methods We used Open Top Chambers (OTCs) to simulate warming; standard surface and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analyses to measure plant cover and function; gas analyzers to monitor biocrust respiration; and the Tea Bag Index approach to estimate mass loss, decomposition and soil carbon stabilization rates. Results Contrary to our initial hypothesis of warming accelerating an ecological succession of plants growing on biocrust, we observed a warming-induced decreased abundance of vascular plants and mosses -possibly caused by high temperature summer peaks that resemble heat waves- and an increase in the cover of biocrust. The functional responses of biocrust to warming, including increased litter mass loss and respiration rates and a lower soil carbon stabilization rates, may suggest climate-driven depletion of soil nutrients in the future. Conclusion It remains to be studied how the effects of warming on biocrusts from high northern regions could interact with other drivers of ecosystem change, such as grazing; and if in the long-term global change could favor the growth of vascular plants on biocrust in the highlands of Iceland and similar ecosystems. For the moment, our experiment points to a warming-induced increase in the cover and activity of biocrust.

AB  - The ability to move is essential for animals to find mates, escape predation, and meet energy and water demands. This is especially important across grazing systems where vegetation productivity can vary drastically between seasons or years. With grasslands undergoing significant changes due to climate change and anthropogenic development, there is an urgent need to determine the relative impacts of these pressures on the movement capacity of native herbivores. To measure these impacts, we fitted 36 white-bearded wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) with GPS collars across three study areas in southern Kenya (Amboseli Basin, Athi-Kaputiei Plains, and Mara) to test the relationship between movement (e.g., directional persistence, speed, home range crossing time) and gradients of vegetation productivity (i.e., NDVI) and anthropogenic disturbance. As expected, wildebeest moved the most (21.0 km day(-1); CI: 18.7-23.3) across areas where movement was facilitated by low human footprint and necessitated by low vegetation productivity (Amboseli Basin). However, in areas with moderate vegetation productivity (Athi-Kaputiei Plains), wildebeest moved the least (13.3 km day(-1); CI: 11.0-15.5). This deviation from expectations was largely explained by impediments to movement associated with a large human footprint. Notably, the movements of wildebeest in this area were also less directed than the other study populations, suggesting that anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., roads, fences, and the expansion of settlements) impacts the ability of wildebeest to move and access available resources. In areas with high vegetation productivity and moderate human footprint (Mara), we observed intermediate levels of daily movement (14.2 km day(-1); CI: 12.3-16.1). Wildebeest across each of the study systems used grassland habitats outside of protected areas extensively, highlighting the importance of unprotected landscapes for conserving mobile species. These results provide unique insights into the interactive effects of climate and anthropogenic development on the movements of a dominant herbivore in East Africa and present a cautionary tale for the development of grazing ecosystems elsewhere.

AB  - The distribution of wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) on almost all continents brings with it a number of negative impacts, the intensity of which depend on the local population density. One of these impacts is the rooting of the soil surface as part of their foraging behavior, which represents an ecologically valuable disturbance to the forest ecosystem. In this study, conducted in 2022 and 2023, we placed 50 pitfall traps across 10 plots at 10 model sites to compare epigeic arthropod communities in areas affected by wild boar rooting with those unaffected by rooting activity. Our findings demonstrate the presence or absence of rooting is a highly significant factor in shaping arthropod epigeic community assemblies. Rooted plots predominantly hosted species from the taxons Araneae, Carabidae, Elateridae, and Diplopoda, whereas plots without rooting were significantly associated with the taxons Tenebrionidae, Opiliones, Gryllidae, and Geotrupidae. Diptera, and Staphylinidae were not affected by wild boar rooting activity. Throughout the study, a decreasing trend in species diversity was observed. Wild boar rooting notably impacted the composition of epigeic assemblages.

AB  - Seed dispersal by frugivores is a key process which is necessary for the regeneration of plant communities. The decrease in the abundance of fruit-eating mammals due to anthropogenic pressures impacts on the proper functioning of forest ecosystems. In this study, for the first time we evaluate seed dispersal by duikers (Bovidae, frugivores and the most hunted animals of the rainforests of central Africa: Congo basin), using germination trials of seeds contained in their dung and rumen. The influence of selective timber harvesting on this dispersal was also examined by comparing duiker community occupancy between a logged and an unlogged site. Our results revealed a community of four duiker species Cephalophus silvicultor, Philantomba congica and two species of 'red' duiker (C. callipygus and C. castaneus). A total of 79 plant species (5481 seedlings) were found in the dungs of all duikers and a total of 37 species (5225 seedlings) were observed in the rumens of red duikers and P. congica. Phyllanthus sp. and Musanga cecropioides were the dominant taxa in dung and rumen contents respectively. Taxa of high commercial value such as Erythrophleum suaveolens, Milicia excelsa and Nauclea diderrichii were also observed. The lack of a clear difference between the plant communities dispersed by the duiker species (assessed by beta-diversity) showed that they play redundancy rather than complementary dispersal roles. Duikers play an underestimated role in the restoration of environments disturbed by logging or shifting cultivation as most of the species observed are pioneer colonizing species. Furthermore duiker communities appear to be affected little by selective logging.

AB  - 1. Invasive species are suspected to be major contributors to biodiversity declines worldwide. Counterintuitively, however, invasive species effects are likely scale dependent and are hypothesized to be positively related to biodiversity at large spatial scales. Past studies investigating the effect of invasion on biodiversity have been mostly conducted at small scales (<100 m(2)) that cannot represent large dynamic landscapes by design. Therefore, replicated experimental evidence supporting a negative effect of invasive plants on biodiversity is lacking across many landscape types, including large grasslands.
   2. We collected data across eight large (333-809 ha) grassland landscapes managed with pyric herbivory-that is the recoupling of fire and grazing-to test how an invasive legume Lespedeza cuneata affected plant and bird communities at spatial grains ranging from 0.1 m(2) to >3,000,000 m(2).
   3. Lespedeza cuneata invasion effects on grassland plant diversity and composition changed with scale, being negative at small spatial grains (0.1 m(2)) and neutral or positive at large spatial grains (>3,000,000 m(2)).
   4. Lespedeza cuneata abundance did not significantly affect bird diversity at any spatial grain measured.
   5. Lespedeza cuneata may negatively affect biodiversity if abundances are greater than those observed in this study. However, previous research suggests that Lespedeza cuneata may not be capable of exceeding 20% canopy cover across large landscapes (>400 ha). Control and eradication strategies can be costly and are fraught with risk. If data do not clearly support a negative Lespedeza cuneata abundance-biodiversity relationship, and if invasion is spatially limited across large landscapes, ongoing control and eradication efforts may be unwarranted and ineffective.
   6. Synthesis and applications: Invasive species effects gleaned from small-scale studies may not reliably predict their effects at larger scales. Although we recognize the importance of small-scale studies in potentially isolating individual mechanisms, management strategies based solely on results from small-scale studies of invasion are unlikely to increase or conserve biodiversity across large landscapes. Rather, processes that generate landscape heterogeneity-like pyric herbivory-are probably more important for promoting biodiversity across all scales. Scale is a central problem in ecology, and defining scale in management objectives is essential for effective biodiversity conservation.

AB  - Savannas are characterized by the co-occurrence of two different plant life forms: grasses and trees. Herbivory plays a major role in the balance between grasses and trees in savanna ecosystems. The present study aimed to investigate the impact and interactions between long-term (i.e. 20 years) herbivory and/or its exclusion and plant life form on the soil biochemistry of a protected semi-arid savanna ecosystem in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa. To study the effects of herbivory on soil properties, herbivore exclosures (fully fenced areas, partially fenced areas, and an unfenced area) were used in conjunction with plant life form (trees and grasses) were considered. Interaction effects of herbivory and plant life form on soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), available phosphorus (available P), exchangeable cations (K+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+) cation exchange capacity (CEC), organic matter (OM) and total microbial activity were determined on savanna soils in the Nkuhlu exclosures, KNP. Exclosures where herbivores were present had significantly higher soil pH, The presence of herbivores caused an increase in soil pH, EC, exchangeable Na, CEC, and OM. The influence of the tree canopy was significantly more pronounced in elevating total C and N, exchangeable K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+, CEC and OM than observed in the open grassland zones across all exclosures. The two-way interaction between herbivory and plant life form resulted in significant decreases in TN, TC, exchangeable K, Na and Mg in open grassland areas outside of herbivore exclosures where large animals had direct access, as compared to areas within the exclosures which was protected from animal entry herbivory. This data can be used by national parks as an indicator to increase their knowledge of environmental issues relating to maintaining and preserving landscape features of savannas.

AB  - Two types of domestic water buffalo are currently recognized: the river buffalo from the Indian subcontinent and Mediterranean countries and the swamp buffalo from China and Southeast Asia. To test the hypothesis of two separate species of water buffalo, we sequenced the genome of the lowland anoa, Bubalus depressicornis, which is a dwarf wild buffalo endemic to Sulawesi, and two genomes of swamp buffalo, and made comparisons with 12 additional genomes. Three genomic data sets were constructed to infer phylogenetic relationships: the mitochondrial genome (15,468 bp; maternal transmission), two concatenated Y-chromosomal genes, AMELY and DDX3Y (20,036 bp; paternal transmission), and a selection of 30 nuclear genes representing all cattle chromosomes (364,887 bp; biparental transmission). The comparisons between our 30 nuclear gene sequences obtained by read mapping and those directly extracted from Bos taurus and Bubalus bubalis genome assemblies show that the mapping approach revealed higher levels of heterozygosity at both nucleotide sites and indels (insertions and deletions) (0.09-0.15%), as well as several sequence errors (0.07%). Our phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses provide strong evidence that the lowland anoa, river buffalo, and swamp buffalo are three distinct taxa which separated rapidly from each other during the Pleistocene epoch. We therefore conclude that two species of domestic water buffalo should be distinguished: Bubalus bubalis for the river buffalo and Bubalus kerabau for the swamp buffalo. The new classification can have deep implications for understanding the evolution and selection of domesticated forms and for the conservation and management of wild buffalo populations in South and Southeast Asia.

AB  - Conservation grazing uses semi-feral or domesticated herbivores to limit encroachment in open areas and to promote biodiversity. However, we are still unaware of its effects on wild herbivores. This study investigates the influence of herded sheep and goats on red deer (Cervus elaphus) spatial behavior by testing three a-priori hypotheses: (i) red deer are expected to avoid areas used by livestock, as well as adjacent areas, when livestock are present, albeit (ii) red deer increase the use of these areas when sheep and goats are temporarily absent and (iii) there is a time-lagged disruption in red deer spatial behavior when conservation grazing practice ends. Using GPS-telemetry data on red deer from a German heathland area, we modelled their use of areas grazed by sheep and goats, using mixed-effect logistic regression. Additionally, we developed seasonal resource selection functions (use-availability design) to depict habitat selection by red deer before, during, and after conservation grazing. Red deer used areas less during conservation grazing throughout all times of the day and there was no compensatory use during nighttime. This effect mostly persisted within 21 days after conservation grazing. Effects on habitat selection of red deer were detectable up to 3000 meters away from the conservation grazing sites, with no signs of either habituation or adaption. For the first time, we demonstrate that conservation grazing can affect the spatio-temporal behavior of wild herbivores. Our findings are relevant for optimizing landscape and wildlife management when conservation grazing is used in areas where wild herbivores are present.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems play a crucial role in sustaining the stability of global ecosystem functions. However, the plant communities of grasslands exhibit spatially heterogeneous stability patterns such as vegetation patches influenced by human disturbances, herbivore activities, and climatic and topographic factors. This study investigated the vegetation dynamics in the Thymus mongolicus steppe in Bairin Right Banner, Inner Mongolia, analyzing the structural characteristics, species diversity, and community stability across six vegetation patches. Our findings revealed that patches dominated by grasses exhibited the highest values in coverage, height, density, and aboveground biomass. Besides, species diversity indices were highest in Achnatherum splendens patches and Festuca litvinovii patches, followed by Thymus mongolicus communities and Leymus chinensis patches, while the lowest diversity indices were observed in Artemisia frigida patches and Convolvulus ammannii patches. The order of community stability from high to low was Leymus chinensis patches, Festuca litvinovii patches, Achnatherum splendens patches, Convolvulus ammannii patches, Artemisia frigida patches, and Thymus mongolicus communities. Both the Patrick richness index and Margalef index showed a significant positive correlation with community stability (p < 0.05), indicating that plant communities with a higher species diversity tend to be more stable. These results emphasize the critical role of plant diversity in mediating community stability and contribute to the development of more effective grassland conservation and restoration strategies to maintain the health and sustainability of grassland ecosystems.

However, the relative effects of these factors and their effects on lineages characterized by high host specificity are not well known. In this study, we explored the extent to which contemporary climate, Quaternary climate change, habitat heterogeneity and host plants determine the species richness and endemism patterns of herbivorous eriophyoid mites. LocationGlobal. TaxonEriophyoid mites (Acari: Eriophyoidea). MethodsWe compiled a dataset comprising 4278 eriophyoid mite species from 22,973 occurrence sites based on a comprehensive search of the published literature and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a basis for predicting their global distribution patterns. We measured the association of environmental variables and host plant richness with species richness and endemism of eriophyoid mites through multiple regression analyses using a simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model, an ordinary least squares (OLS) model and a random forest model. We examined the direct and indirect effects of these environmental variables and the host plant richness on eriophyoid mite diversity using structural equation models (SEMs). ResultsThe species richness and endemism patterns of eriophyoid mites are concentrated in temperate regions. Contemporary climate, Quaternary climate change, habitat heterogeneity and host plants all significantly affected eriophyoid mite richness, while Quaternary climate change, habitat heterogeneity and host plants contributed to the eriophyoid mite endemism. Abiotic factors indirectly influenced the species richness and endemism of eriophyoid mites, via biotic factors-host plants. Main ConclusionsThe species richness and endemism of eriophyoid mites peak in temperate regions, opposite to the patterns of plants and some other organisms. Complex interactions among biotic and abiotic factors shape the current eriophyoid mite species diversity.

AB  - Overbrowsing by highly abundant white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) negatively impacts the regeneration of the forest understory throughout the eastern United States. Deer management programs are often used by land managers to reduce deer densities and promote forest regeneration. This study examines the impact of a 15 -yearlong archery-based deer management program on the understory of a nature preserve in southern NY consisting of an old-growth hemlock and second-growth mixed hardwood forest. Vegetation plots were sampled every 3-5 years between 2004 and 2019, while deer density was estimated using camera trap survey data annually since 2009. Generalized mixed-effects models were used to determine the influence of deer density, forest type, canopy cover, and time on species richness, native stem density and total stem density. The most predictive models showed an increase in richness as time went on. Additionally, stem density had a negative relationship with deer density (i.e., stem density and species richness increased as deer density declined over time). For both native and total stem density, the highest-ranked model included only deer density as a predictor. Generally, woody species richness and stem density increased in the seedling ( 0.3 m tall) and sapling (0.3-0.9 m tall) size classes but remained relatively constant for the transgressive ( 0.9 m) size class over time and as deer density decreased. Many native species exhibited density increases in the smallest size classes, but black birch (Betula lenta), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and mapleleaf viburnum (Viburnum acerifolium) were the only native species to increase in the transgressive (>0.9 m tall) class. Several non-native species, however, did increase in the transgressive size class since 2004. These results indicate that the forest has improved as a result of the DMP, but long-term recruitment of native species is still uncertain. The DMP has shown the potential to help restore woody regeneration but monitoring should continue to ultimately determine whether deer management can allow for true recruitment of native seedlings into the forest understory and canopy.

AB  - The spatiotemporal behaviour of animals may be determined by interactions with competitors, predators and humans. Nonconsumptive effects, or risk effects of predation, whereby predators induce behaviour changes in prey through their perceived risk, are increasingly seen as important determinants of prey behaviour and spatiotemporal landscape use, which may scale to have population and ecosystem level consequences. Similarly, human disturbance, even that from recreational activity, may result in behav-ioural changes analogous to the risk effects of predation. As landscapes steadily urbanize, these effects are likely to become common and understanding behavioural responses to human activity may be a crucial component of conservation and management of species in the Anthropocene. We propose using time-to-event analysis based on remote camera images as a behavioural indicator to compare the in-fluence of competitors, predators and humans on the length of time between successive deer events (i.e. deer return times), by season, as a case study. We found that the mere presence of humans was the most important determinant of deer return times in spring and autumn, whereas in summer, competitor (i.e. moose and elk) presence was most important. In winter, a combination of human presence and the number of predators (i.e. canids) was the strongest determinant of deer return times. We suggest human recreation is a major driver of fine-scale, spatiotemporal behavioural responses of deer and that using time-to-event analyses provides a novel framework to identify these behavioural responses. Under-standing an animal's behavioural response to humans, competitors and predators has important im-plications for conservation areas and multiuse landscapes in urbanizing landscapes.(c) 2023 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Global climate change can interact with local drivers, such as ecosystem engineers, to exacerbate changes in ecosystem structure and function, with socio-ecological consequences. For regions of Indigenous interest, there may also be cultural consequences if species and areas affected are culturally significant. Here we describe a participatory approach between the Indigenous (Yolngu) Yirralka Rangers and non-Indigenous researchers that explored the interaction between sea level rise and feral ungulate ecosystem engineers on culturally significant floodplains in the Laynhapuy Indigenous Protected Area (IPA), northern Australia. A feral ungulate exclusion fence array (12 fenced and 12 unfenced plots) was stratified by elevation/salinity to disentangle the effects of salinity and ungulates on floodplain soil and vegetation. We found that exclusion of feral ungulates improved ground cover vegetation, which, according to our literature-derived ecosystem process model, may enhance soil trapping and reduce evapotranspiration to provide the antecedent conditions needed to improve floodplain resilience to sea level rise. The mid-zone of the supratidal floodplain study site was suggested as the region where the benefits of fencing were most pronounced after two years and ground cover species diversity was highest. Ongoing monitoring is required to investigate whether removal of feral ungulates can increase resilience against sea level rise and recruitment of eco-culturally significant Melaleuca species. An interview with a key Yolngu Traditional Owner of the study site demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of the partnership. Yolngu land owners and rangers were active co-researchers and will decide if, when and how to integrate results into feral ungulate management and climate adaptation responses, highlighting the importance of industry-university partnerships in maximising biocultural conservation outcomes.

AB  - The Eastern European Alps boasts highly biodiverse ecosystems and a rich archaeological history. However, there is limited research on the enduring impacts of historical climate change and human activities on plant biodiversity in this region. Using sedimentary ancient DNA, we reconstructed plant and animal dynamics from 8500 years before present (ka BP) around Gro beta er Winterleitensee (Zirbitzkogel, Austria). Variable intensities of human activities since the Middle Bronze Age (similar to 3.5 ka BP) facilitated the persistence of biodiverse Alpine meadow communities and lowered timberlines below their natural limit. Since the end of the Bronze Age (similar to 2.8 ka BP), human activities, particularly pasturing, and increasing temperatures, emerged as significant drivers of plant community dynamics. The introduction of sheep (Ovis aries) did not reduce wild mammal presence, including red deer (Cervus elaphus), hare (Lepus), European mole (Talpa europaea), bank vole (Myodes glareolus), and short-tailed field vole (Microtus agrestis). During the High & Late Mediaeval Period, (similar to 1150-450 BP), cattle (Bos taurus) and horses (Equus caballus) became the dominant domesticates, while all wild mammals except the short-tailed field vole and Eurasian water shrew (Neomys fodiens) declined or even disappeared. These changes are also accompanied by a significant transformation of plant community structure. The ability to determine both plant responses and animal drivers from the same palaeolimnological sequence vastly improves our ability to partition causes of vegetation change over the Holocene. Here, we reveal that plant biodiversity is maintained or increased by moderate cattle grazing. Therefore, non-intensive domesticated stock grazing is essential for maintaining diverse Alpine meadows.

AB  - The Arctic is under great pressure due to climate change. Drones are increasingly used as a tool in ecology and may be especially valuable in rapidly changing and remote landscapes, as can be found in the Arctic. For effective applications of drones, decisions of both ecological and technical character are needed. Here, we provide our method planning workflow for generating ground-cover maps with drones for ecological monitoring purposes. The workflow includes the selection of variables, layer resolutions, ground-cover classes and the development and validation of models. We implemented this workflow in a case study of the Arctic tundra to develop vegetation maps, including disturbed vegetation, at three study sites in Svalbard. For each site, we generated a high-resolution map of tundra vegetation using supervised random forest (RF) classifiers based on four spectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and three types of terrain variables-all derived from drone imagery. Our classifiers distinguished up to 15 different ground-cover classes, including two classes that identify vegetation state changes due to disturbance caused by herbivory (i.e., goose grubbing) and winter damage (i.e., 'rain-on-snow' and thaw-freeze). Areas classified as goose grubbing or winter damage had lower NDVI values than their undisturbed counterparts. The predictive ability of site-specific RF models was good (macro-F1 scores between 83% and 85%), but the area of the grubbing class was overestimated in parts of the moss tundra. A direct transfer of the models between study sites was not possible (macro-F1 scores under 50%). We show that drone image analysis can be an asset for studying future vegetation state changes on local scales in Arctic tundra ecosystems and encourage ecologists to use our tailored workflow to integrate drone mapping into long-term monitoring programs.

AB  - Grazing is one of the most important management practices for grasslands. To date, most studies on how grazing affects plant diseases have focused on a single plant species, ignoring plant community characteristics and phylogeny. We used data from a 6-year yak grazing experiment (0, 1, 2, and 3 yak(s) ha( - 1) treatment) in an alpine meadow ecosystem of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, from which we tested grazing effects on foliar fungal diseases at both population and community levels. By measuring plant community variables (including richness, evenness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition) and disease severity, we evaluated the relative importance of plant community-mediated effects of yak grazing on community pathogen load with a multi-model inference approach. We found significant differences in pathogen load among different grazing treatments; we recorded the highest and lowest pathogen loads in the 1 yak ha( - 1) treatment and in the 3 yaks ha( - 1) treatment, respectively. Pielou's evenness index and community proneness (i.e., an estimate of the capacity of plant communities to support diseases) best explained variation in pathogen load, indicating that plant community-mediated effects (through evenness and proneness) of yak grazing determined pathogen load. Our study provides empirical evidence that grazing influences foliar fungal disease prevalence through plant community evenness and composition, which demonstrates the necessity of incorporating host plant community characteristics into disease load prediction frameworks.

AB  - There is an increasing need to understand how animals respond to modifications of their habitat following landscape-scale disturbances such as wildfire or timber harvest. Such disturbances can promote increased use by herbivores due to changes in plant community structure that improve forage conditions, but can also cause avoidance if other habitat functions provided by cover are substantially reduced or eliminated. Quantifying the total effects of these disturbances, however, is challenging because they may not fully be apparent unless observed at successional timescales. Further, the effects of disturbances that improve habitat quality may be density dependent, such that the benefits are (1) less valuable to high-density populations because the per-capita benefits are reduced when shared among more users or, alternatively, (2) more valuable to animals living in high densities because resources may be more depleted from the greater intraspecific competition. We used 30 years of telemetry data on elk occurring at two distinct population densities to quantify changes in space use at diel, monthly, and successional timescales following timber harvest. Elk selected logged areas at night only, with selection strongest during midsummer, and peak selection occurring 14 years post harvest, but persisting for 26-33 years. This pattern of increased selection at night following a reduction in overhead canopy cover is consistent with elk exploiting improved nutritional conditions for foraging. The magnitude of selection for logged areas was 73% higher for elk at low population density, consistent with predictions from the ideal free distribution. Yet elk avoided these same areas during daytime for up to 28 years post logging and instead selected untreated forest, suggesting a role for cover to meet other life history requirements. Our results demonstrate that while landscape-scale disturbances can lead to increased selection by large herbivores and suggest that the improvement in foraging conditions can persist over short-term successional timescales, the magnitude of the benefits may not be equal across population densities. Further, the enduring avoidance of logging treatments during the daytime indicates a need for structurally intact forests and suggests that a mosaic of forest patches of varying successional stages and structural completeness is likely to be the most beneficial to large herbivores.

AB  - Soil microbial diversity and community structure play pivotal roles in maintaining multiple ecosystem functions and biogeochemical cycling. However, the patterns and mechanisms of grazing effects on bacterial and fungal diversity remain poorly understood on a broad scale. To address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis by compiling a comprehensive dataset consisting of 543 paired observations from 48 manipulative grazing experiments in grassland ecosystems. Pooling all data, our results indicated that grazing significantly altered soil bacterial and fungal community structure, almost uniformly decreased beta diversity, and did not change alpha diversity. However, grazing intensity had different effects on bacterial and fungal communities, with more pronounced alterations in the bacterial community. Moreover, bacterial alpha diversity showed a positive response to cattle/yak grazing and short-term grazing (e.g., less than 5 years), while sheep grazing and long-term grazing had negative effects on bacterial and fungal alpha diversity. Model-selection analysis further suggested that changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and soil pH, grazing duration, and livestock type jointly regulated the responses of bacterial and fungal diversity and community structure to grazing disturbances. Our findings underscore the divergent responses of soil microbial alpha and beta diversity to grazing in grassland ecosystems. Appropriate livestock selection (e.g., cattle), short grazing duration, and moderate intensity can help to maintain the stability of microbial communities and ecosystem functions. These insights are crucial for establishing precision grazing management strategies, promoting the sustainability of grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Human-caused landscape disturbance is one of the most widespread threats to wildlife. Forest harvesting reduces canopy closure, an important component of habitat that allows ungulates to mitigate warm temperatures and deep snow. These pressures may be exacerbated by the warming temperatures and increased snowfall associated with climate change. Also, linear features that result from human activities increase the movement rate and efficiency of predators. We used LiDAR and GPS-collar data to test three hypotheses that explained the use of forest cover by female moose (Alces americanus) in a landscape characterized by extensive forest harvest; the Thermal Stress, Locomotion, and Direct Mortality Hypotheses. The risk of direct mortality by predation and during the licensed hunting season was the primary factor influencing the use of horizontal and vertical cover by moose. Moose used less horizontal cover when accompanied by a neonate and in areas with greater risk of predation by wolves. Maternal status of moose mediated their use of vertical cover to avoid predation. Moose also used more horizontal and vertical cover during peak hunting season and in the spring and summer. Our results suggest that the use of forest type and cover by moose differs, from open to closed, depending on the type of threat and reproductive status. When managing moose habitat, we recommend maintaining forests that vary in structure and cover, attributes often associated with a spatially adjacent mix of young and old forest.

AB  - Both precipitation and herbivores can independently control plant community composition and ecosystem function. However, few studies have experimentally examined the potential interactive effects of altered precipitation and herbivores on plant communities and plant traits. Here, we manipulated summer precipitation and insect presence in an old-field ecosystem and quantified their interactive effects on plant community structure and functional traits. Overall, the effect of an insect herbivore on the plant community was contingent on the precipitation treatment. There were no experimental effects on total plant biomass or plant species richness, but grass biomass was higher in the absence of insect herbivores only in reduced summer precipitation plots. Furthermore, plant functional diversity and the community-averaged trends of several plant functional traits related to resource use and herbivore resistance varied systematically with reduced precipitation and insect presence. We demonstrate that the effect of reduced precipitation on plant biomass, functional diversity, and the community-averaged trends of plant functional traits can be mediated by the presence of insects. Our findings further suggest that the functional traits of the common plant species in the community are the most affected by the combined manipulation of altered summer precipitation and insect presence.

AB  - Ornamental plants constitute a major source of invasive species. Gaillardia aristata (great blanketflower) is planted worldwide and its escape has been reported in several European countries without ecological impact assessment on the invasive potential. As there is a markedly spreading population with invasive behaviour in Hungary, we aimed to reveal the distribution, impacts and traits of G. aristata. We gathered occurrence data outside the gardens in Hungary, based on literature, unpublished observations by experts and our own records. We investigated the impacts of an extended population, where the species invaded sandy old-fields within a 25 km2 area. Here, we compared the species richness, diversity, community com-position and height of invaded and uninvaded vegetation. Furthermore, we evaluated the traits potentially associated with the invasiveness of G. aristata in comparison with other herbaceous invasive species in the region. We found that G. aristata occurred mostly by casual escapes, but naturalised and invasive popula-tions were also detected in considerable numbers. G. aristata usually appeared close to gardens and ruderal habitats, but also in semi-natural and natural grasslands and tended to spread better in sandy soils. We found lower plant species richness and Shannon diversity in the invaded sites and the invasion of G. arista-ta significantly influenced the composition of the plant community. The trait analyses revealed that the invasive potential of G. aristata is backed by a wide germination niche breadth, extremely long flowering period, small shoot-root ratio (large absorption and gripping surface), large seeds (longer persistence) and dispersal by epizoochory of grazing livestock (mostly by sheep), probably helping the species' survival and spreading in the disturbed, species-poor, sandy, open habitats. These functional traits, as well as the ornamental utilisation, may act together with the aridisation of the climate and the changing land-use practices of G. aristata from ornamental plant to casual alien and then to invasive species in certain environmental conditions (i.e. sandy soils, species-poor communities, human disturbances), although it seems to be not strategy and long-term monitoring of this species would be important to halt its spreading in time.

AB  - Spatial patterns and determinants of species richness in complex geographical regions are important subjects of current biogeography and biodiversity conservation research. Glires are small herbivorous mammal species with limited migratory ability that may serve as an indicator of biodiversity and ecosystems. Herein, we aimed to evaluate how multiple ecological hypotheses could explain the species richness patterns of glires in China. Initially, we constructed a mapping grid cell operating units of 80 x 80 km(2) which covered China's land mass and mapped the distribution ranges of the 237 glires species that had recorded. The glires taxa were separated into three response variables based on their distribution: (a) all species, (b) nonendemic species, and (c) endemic species. The species richness patterns of the response variables were evaluated using four predictor sets: (a) hydrothermal characteristics, (b) climatic seasonality, (c) habitat heterogeneity, and (d) human factors. We performed regression tree analysis, multiple linear regression analysis, and variation partitioning analyses to determine the effects of predictors on spatial species patterns. The results showed that the distribution pattern of species richness was the highest in the Hengduan Mountains and surrounding areas in southwest China. However, only a few endemic species adapted to high-latitude environments. It was found that there are differences about the determinants between nonendemic and endemic species. Habitat heterogeneity was the most influential determinant for the distribution patterns of nonendemic species richness. Climatic seasonality was the best predictor to determine the richness distribution pattern of endemic species, whereas this was least affected by human factors. Furthermore, it should be noted that hydrothermal characteristics were not strong predictors of richness patterns for all or nonendemic species, which may be due to the fact that there are also more species in some areas with less precipitation or energy. Therefore, glires are likely to persist in areas with characteristics of high habitat heterogeneity and stable climate.

AB  - Drylands, which cover more than 40% of the Earth's terrestrial surface, face rising agricultural demand and the influence of climate change. Understanding how livestock grazing pressure and local climate affect these environments is pivotal for informed land management. We studied big sagebrush plant communities in southwestern Wyoming over grazing gradients created by artificial livestock watering points. To explore the role of abiotic factors in shaping plant community response to grazing, we assessed the response of plant functional groups to grazing while accounting for soil texture variability across a precipitation gradient. Our models estimated that sagebrush cover responded positively to grazing intensity, with a 6% increase in cover with intensity when comparing the heaviest grazing treatment with the lowest grazing intensity. Perennial bunchgrass cover, the primary forage component, had a small negative response, a 3% decrease in cover from the lowest grazing intensity to the highest. Grazing intensity had no effect on bunchgrass density, perennial forbs, or rhizomatous grasses. Compared with abiotic factors, grazing intensity had a small effect on perennial bunchgrass and bare ground. We found that precipitation explained a 13% increase in perennial bunchgrass cover and a 34% decrease in bare ground cover compared with a 6% increase with increasing intensity across our grazing gradients. Sand content also had a larger effect on perennial bunchgrass cover and density than grazing. Increased sand content was associated with increased bunchgrass cover and density, supporting the inverse texture hypothesis. Our results show that while livestock grazing impacts sagebrush plant communities, its effect is small when compared with the effects of climate and soil. Our study contributes to a growing body of research emphasizing the need to contextualize plant community responses to grazing within specific climatic and edaphic conditions, which will promote effective land management in dryland ecosystems.

AB  - Human-induced forest loss has had devastating impacts on biodiversity. Mammal populations in the tropics have been hit particularly hard by the resulting habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, as well as by overhunting which often goes hand-in-hand. While declines in these populations are generally well documented, few studies offer a pathway for their recovery. Here, we test the association between changes in forest habitat and occupancy trends of Sumatran megafauna (elephant and tiger) and key tiger prey species (wild boar and sambar) in the Leuser Ecosystem: a large forest landscape on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. For elephant and tiger, we develop additional occupancy models to predict their respective spatial distribution under different scenarios of forest loss and gain (through restoration and increased connectivity) to provide a blueprint for avoiding future species loss and assisting with their population recovery. From 2000 to 2019, 254,722 ha (6.7%) of natural forest was converted, primarily to plantations and shrubs. The species-specific responses over the study period revealed that the occurrence of elephant declined along the west, with a range shift to the northeast of Leuser, whereas wild boar underwent a dramatic widespread decline and although sambar experienced losses around the forest edge, it remained widespread in the interior forest, while tiger occupancy remained stable. Modelling habitat loss and fragmentation led to an unsurprising demise of Sumatran megafauna, whereas strategic investments that reconnected several forest patches provided disproportionately large benefits for their recovery through the recolonization of former parts of their range. Indonesia has achieved six consecutive years of declining forest loss rates, and our study's findings can build off this conservation success by supporting improved provincial spatial planning and field-based restoration efforts that avoid declines of threatened megafauna species and act as a catalyst for rewilding a landscape of global importance.

AB  - The Serengeti-Masai Mara Ecosystem (SMME) is an iconic ecological and biodiversity resource in East Africa with a spectacular great animal migration feature. Environmental shocks like droughts, floods, and land degradation threaten the SMME's ecological functioning. However, the spatiotemporal ecosystem dynamics during climate extremes are inadequately examined. Here we quantified water availability and vegetation changes during extreme wet (EWE) and dry (EDE) events over the SMME for wet and dry seasons in 1982-2020. We derived extreme events from seasonal mean precipitation anomaly exceeding standard deviation and applied composite and correlation techniques to assess their dynamics with animal populations and migration prospects. Wet season EWE increases vegetative and moist conditions over southern SMME, suggesting elongating migrants' occupancy compared to normal periods and delayed northward migration. Wet season EDE significantly suppresses these features, heightening ecosystem competition and survival threats, proposing an earlier northward migration. Dry season EWE increases vegetation and water availability over northern SMME, prompting the late southward migration. Dry season EDE significantly reduces vegetation and water availability over northern SMME, suggesting an early southward migration towards regions with more vegetation and increased water availability. The SMME also experiences multiple EDE occurring in consecutive seasons, prolonging dry conditions that aggregate wildlife survival threats. Notably, two EDE prevailed consecutively from the 1993 dry season to the 1994 wet season, coupled with a population decline of wildebeest (1.2-0.9 million), buffalo (40-20 thousand), and lion (1.3-0.9 thousand). We also note a reversal from more EDE to EWE during the study period. Prevalent EWE can lessen wet and vegetative conditions distribution gradient, which is imperative for the functioning of the SMME migratory ecosystem. Our study unveiled hotspot areas of extremes-driven ecosystem changes for the sustainable SMME migratory functioning essential for framing meaningful conservation management policies under climate change.

AB  - Understanding the effect of landscape configuration on the bird species richness and their functional traits (dietary preferences) is important to link the conservation and restoration plans to the production of the crops. Our aims were: 1) to study the influence of forest types (native, mixed and plantations) on the bird species richness in two agroforestry landscapes (heterogeneous/ homogeneous); 2) to assess the effect of size/density of forest patches in the birds' functional traits; 3) to evaluate the effect of isolated trees on them, and 4) to discuss conservation and restoration measures for the birds' functional traits in agroforestry landscapes. We used hierarchical occupancy models to evaluate the effect of different landscape metrics and detectability measures on bird communities. We recorded a total of 64 bird species. The estimated species richness was considerable higher in homogeneous landscape (31.7 +/- 2.7) than heterogeneous (27.3 +/- 2.5). Our results showed the bird assemblage had a positive trend with native forests, negative with mixed forests and neutral trend for plantations. The granivores and insectivore's species showed significant preferences for homogeneous landscape, while omnivores had significant preferences for heterogeneous landscape. Carnivores/Piscivores and herbivores/frugivores species did not show preferences by any landscape type. The response of functional traits depended on different forests attributes. The isolated trees had a significant effect on the birds' functional traits. In conclusion, it is necessary a deep knowledge about the relationship between the landscape configuration and the bird species richness/functional traits. These findings could help in the future with the conservation, restoration, and rewilding policies in this important hotspot of biodiversity, avoiding alterations in the ecosystem services.

AB  - Microsites created by soil-disturbing animals are important landscape elements in arid environments. In the Pre-Namib, dust-bathing behavior of the near-endemic Hartmann's mountain zebra creates unique rolling pits that persist in the landscape. However, the ecohydrological characteristics and the effects of those microsites on the vegetation and on organisms of higher trophic levels are still unknown. In our study, we characterized the soil grain size composition and infiltration properties of rolling pits and reference sites and recorded vegetation and arthropod assemblages during the rainy season of five consecutive years with different amounts of seasonal rainfall. We further used the excess green vegetation index derived from drone imagery to demonstrate the different green up and wilting of pits and references after a rainfall event. In contrast to the surrounding grassland, rolling pits had finer soil with higher nutrient content, collected runoff, showed a higher infiltration, and kept soil moisture longer. Vegetation in the rolling pits was denser, dominated by annual forbs and remained green for longer periods. The denser vegetation resulted in a slightly higher activity density of herbivorous arthropods, which in turn increased the activity density of omnivorous and predatory arthropods. In times of drought, the rolling pits could act as safe sites and refuges for forbs and arthropods. With their rolling pits, Hartmann's mountain zebras act as ecosystem engineers, contributing to the diversity of forb communities and heterogeneity of the landscape in the Pre-Namib.

AB  - Since the late 1800s, north Australian savannas have experienced a fundamental shift in grazing pressure, moving from an assemblage of native macropods to introduced ungulates. In contrast to macropods, ungulates have hard hooves, are greater in size and exhibit bulk feeding strategies, resulting in a greater impact on perennial grass cover. However, the response of perennial grasses to ungulate grazing may vary depending on rainfall, soil fertility and fire, as well as ungulate density and feeding behaviour. Interactions between grazing, drought and fire are of particular interest, as climate change is predicted to increase rainfall variability and fire frequency across northern Australia. In this study, we tested for interactions between grazing and drought, as well as fire and grazing, on two vegetation zones surrounding waterholes, through a 5 years fencing exclusion experiment. Despite drought conditions occurring over 2 years of the study, no interaction between grazing and drought was detected. This is most likely due to the relatively low ungulate density present during the study (similar to 1 ungulate/km(2)). In contrast, after fire was introduced to the study sites, significantly more perennial grass cover was recorded at fenced sites relative to unfenced sites. Due to the study design the cause of change cannot be directly inferred. However, when the potential drivers are considered further (rainfall, soil properties, fire and changes in ungulate density), an interaction between grazing and fire is the most probable cause. Wetland vegetation showed a stronger response to fencing than the surrounding savanna, with this result most likely due to differences in ungulate feeding behaviour between the two vegetation zones. Our findings are important, as fire and ungulate grazing are both widespread across Australia's savannas and reduced perennial grass cover has been linked to increased cat predation on rapidly declining small, native mammal populations.

AB  - Given the massive and growing environmental impacts of conventional agriculture, humanity needs new methods for growing food that not only meet dietary needs but also provide for multiple ecosystem functions with potential benefits to people and biodiversity. Concepts from ecology and complex adaptive systems suggest that persistent structural heterogeneity and functional diversity are key for supporting biodiversity, ecosystem services, and resilience, but these concepts have not been extensively applied in agriculture, which is still dominated by annual monocropping systems. Perennial agriculture seems to embody these ecological concepts-particularly perennial polycultures that combine a variety of long-lived woody perennial food crops with continuous ground cover. However, our understanding of the benefits and trade-offs of such systems compared to conventional agriculture is limited, especially in temperate climates. Here, we provide a systematic and comprehensive study of the ecological attributes of 14 woody perennial polyculture farm fields to conventional annual and hay fields in the U.S. Midwest, one of the most industrialized food-producing regions in the world. We found that perennial fields had (1) more diverse soil fungal, invertebrate, plant, and bird communities but found no difference in soil bacterial communities; (2) less compacted soil; (3) denser ground cover; (4) more active carbon, organic carbon, and nitrogen and the same available phosphorus in the top layer of soil; and (5) more species of predatory, detritivorous, and herbivorous insects, and approximately fourfold higher abundance of herbivorous insects. Food production from the oldest half of perennial fields was only 14.7% of a regional corn/soy rotation by weight, but increased with the age of the perennial field and had high nutritional diversity. Together, these findings indicate that woody perennial polyculture fields in the U.S. Midwest are characterized by higher biodiversity and ecosystem functions than adjacent conventional fields. Woody perennial polycultures in the temperate north might play a role in the transition of agricultural landscapes toward sustaining both people and nature over the long term.

AB  - Genotypic diversity has the potential to function in a similar manner to species diversity, particularly in ecosystems dominated by a single foundational plant, and may promote stability in the face of disturbance. However, it has primarily been documented only in terrestrial species or in seagrasses. We conducted three separate experiments in which we compared plant production between monocultures and polycultures of the widely distributed salt marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora, exposed to increased levels of stress from competition, herbivory, and tidal inundation (simulating the effects of sea-level rise). Increased levels of disturbance reduced aboveground growth of monocultures in all three experiments, but greater clonal diversity offset the negative effects of increased levels of all the stressors in polycultures. Our results contribute to a growing body of literature demonstrating that genotypic diversity of a foundational species can function analogously to species diversity. They also highlight the potential importance of high levels of genotypic diversity in this species in determining the response to anthropogenic disturbances and in management or restoration efforts.

AB  - Migratory animals can serve as ecological links between geographically distant ecosystems. Moreover, when seasonally linked ecosystems differ in carrying capacity of migrant species, those with high capacity may support population growth with consequences to shared ecosystems with lower capacity through trophic cascades. Agricultural production has increased carrying capacity of lesser snow (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's geese (Anser rossii, collectively, "light geese") in southern agricultural landscapes where these species winter and stage during migration to and from northern breeding areas, resulting in population increase. In subarctic and arctic ecosystems where carrying capacity for geese is lower, high abundance and densities of light geese have caused trophic cascades during summer breeding. This has raised concern for resilience of northern ecosystems to withstand cumulative and intense pressures of above- and belowground herbivory and nest construction. We investigated the empirical relationship between intensity of vegetation disturbance by multidecadal foraging and nest construction by up to similar to 1.3 million geese and shifts in (1) plant community composition and (2) taxon richness of freshwater plant communities near Karrak Lake, in Canada's central arctic. Intense use by nesting light geese caused shifts from lowland communities dominated by grasses and sedges (collectively, graminoids), Sphagnum spp., and willows (Salix spp.) to those comprised of exposed peat, non-Sphagnum mosses, marsh ragwort (Tephroseris palustris), mare's tail (Hippuris vulgaris), and particularly birch (Betula glandulosa). Community change was less apparent in upland regions that were naturally less vegetated even in the absence of avian herbivores, but fruticose lichens, crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), and white heather (Cassiope tetragona) dominated undisturbed plant communities, whereas crustose lichens and bearberry (Arctostaphylos spp.) comprised disturbed communities. We did not find evidence for dominance by a limited number of species with long-term occupancy by light geese, as taxon richness was equivocal between disturbed and undisturbed plant communities. Cessation of foraging and nesting pressure increased taxon richness and reestablishment of locally eradicated plant species. Overall, herbivory and nesting effects were not uniform across this widespread nesting colony and, together with underlying influence from abiotic gradients, increased heterogeneity in the mosaic of vegetation communities.

AB  - Forests in the United States continue to lose biodiversity and many fail to regenerate due to high deer (family Cervidae) abundance. Declines in biodiversity and overall ecosystem health due to high deer populations increases prevalence of wildlife and human diseases associated with increasing tick abundances and decreases forest resilience and the ability to deliver benefits provided by healthy ecosystems. In the eastern and midwestern United States, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are the main stressor, while in the western U.S. elk (Cervus elaphus) and black-tailed and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) can become equally problematic. Federal and State Wildlife Agencies are responsible for environmental stewardship and management of deer, migratory and endangered species, yet they lack authority to address human health concerns or commercial interests (we acknowledge tribal authority to manage wildlife as an important contributor to conservation). Furthermore, State Wildlife Agencies have retained their traditional focus to manage wildlife for recreational hunters while neglecting their obligations to manage wildlife in the interest of all citizens rather than special interest groups. Fragmented institutional arrangements and widely scattered responsibilities for human health, environmental conservation and management, agriculture, and commerce among tribal, federal, and state agencies have allowed deer impacts to grow into nationwide conservation and human health crises. Given that local, regional, and state-level initiatives have failed to provide appropriate remedies, federal leadership is now essential to integrate concerns among disciplines, policy domains, regions, habitats, and biota. We recommend developing a National Strategy to build strong collaborative efforts and diverse and inclusive relationships across environmental, human health and economic interests. These should reach beyond state boundaries to comprehensively address interrelated deer, human health, forest, and conservation crises. A well-coordinated and collaborative approach has the potential to overcome traditional turf battles between tribal, state, and federal interests by recognizing joint responsibilities and obligations to manage wildlife as a public trust resource. This collective approach can protect species before they become endangered, avoiding further declines in environmental and human health.

AB  - Forests of eastern North America have been negatively impacted by excessive white-tailed deer browsing for decades. Previous studies have shown how deer-driven changes to forest structure, plant species composition, and microhabitat negatively impact forest birds. However, most experimental studies used relatively small plot sizes with few replications, limiting the transferability of findings to operational-scale timber harvests and landscape-scale management. We studied the influence of white-tailed deer browsing on breeding bird communities in ten pairs of operational-sized fenced and unfenced regeneration timber harvests in northcentral Pennsylvania. Based on a previous study that examined correlations between bird and deer abundance in Pennsylvania, we developed species-specific predictions about how density would vary between fenced and unfenced harvests. We predicted six species would show a negative response to deer and three would show a neutral response. Overall, diversity and composition of breeding bird communities did not differ between fenced and unfenced harvests. However, four species showed a negative response to deer, four showed a neutral response to deer, and one showed a positive response to deer. Thus, six of nine focal species aligned with our predictions: negative (n = 4) and neutral (n = 2). Densities of two remaining focal species were associated with vegetative features that also were consistent with our predictions. Our final focal species showed a strong positive association with unfenced harvests, contrary to our prediction. Our findings demonstrate that deer-induced impacts on vegetation in operational-scale timber harvests can have considerable influence on densities of some avian species. We conclude that the use of deer-exclusion fencing after timber harvests is an effective and sometimes necessary management tool to achieve maximum forestry and wildlife benefits.

AB  - This special volume considers major recent changes in southern South American animal communities. Eleven papers consider megafauna, pinnipeds, marine mammals, small terrestrial mammals and birds and are grouped under four sub-headings: (1) Isotopic insights into guanaco populations; (2) Historical sources and marine ecosystem change; (3) Changes in small mammal communities and human impacts; and (4) megafaunal extinction, domestication, avifauna and recent interactions with humans. Although some of these contributions include changes that occurred earlier in the Holocene, many highlight a current decrease in the taxonomic diversity of communities and ecosystems in different environments, which are likely to have been caused by modern human activities. The Anthropocene concept is seen as providing a useful framework for understanding and mitigation of such adverse human impacts.

AB  - Dorcas gazelles are believed to use middens to mark their territories and transmit information. Given the commitment to maintaining a midden, it is believed that middens are not placed randomly. We examined how the habitat (tree height and maximum canopy) and anthropogenic disturbance (camel and human presence) influenced the selection of midden sites by Dorcas gazelles in South Sinai, Egypt. Our results showed that Dorcas gazelles did not place middens at larger trees, while favoring relatively smaller trees and shrubs where the anthropogenic disturbance and perceived hunting risk are less. Our results, in light of the previous findings, suggest that selection of midden sites is species context-dependent behavior. In areas with less anthropogenic disturbance and hunting, Dorcas gazelles have been shown to select the largest trees of the same species as midden sites. In contract, in our study site with high anthropogenic disturbance and no protection from hunting, gazelles did not utilize the presumably optimum landmarks for midden sites. Our study showed that Dorcas gazelles instead utilized smaller trees and some shrubs that are less conspicuous and presumably less effective as advertisement sites, but safer.

AB  - Restoring anthropogenic footprints to pre-disturbance conditions or minimizing their long-term impacts is an important goal in conservation. Many footprints, particularly if left alone, have wide-ranging effects on biodiversity. In Canada, energy exploration footprints result in forest dissection and fragmentation contributing to declines in woodland caribou. Developing cost effective strategies to restore forests and thus conserving the woodland caribou habitat is a conservation priority. In this study, we compared the effects of wildfire and local variation in the amount of residual woody debris on natural regeneration in jack pine on exploratory well pads in Alberta's boreal forest. Specifically, we investigated how footprint size, fire severity (overstory tree mortality), ground cover of fine and coarse woody debris, and adjacent stand characteristics (i.e., height, age, and cover), affected tree regeneration densities and height using negative binomial count and linear models (Gaussian), respectively. Regeneration density was 30% higher on exploratory well pads than adjacent forests, increased linearly with fire severity on the exploratory well pads (2.2% per 1% increase in fire severity), but non-linearly in adjacent forests (peaking at 51,000 stems/ha at 72% fire severity), and decreased with amount of woody debris on exploratory well pads (2.7% per 1% increase in woody debris cover). The height of regenerating trees on exploratory well pads decreased with fire severity (0.56 cm per 1% increase in fire severity) and was non-linearly related to coarse woody debris (peaking at 286 cm at 9.4% coarse woody debris cover). Heights of 3 and 5 m on exploratory well pads were predicted by 13- and 21-years post-fire, respectively. Our results demonstrate that wildfires can stimulate natural recovery of fire-adapted species, such as jack pine, on disturbances as large as exploratory well pads (500-1330 m(2)) and that the type and amount of woody debris affects these patterns.

AB  - Rewilding with locally extinct terrestrial vertebrates has been a popular conservation initiative over the past few decades. Among the animals used for rewilding are the small- to medium-sized vertebrates that forage in the soil and that have been lost from many ecosystems due to habitat destruction or predation by exotic species. Soil foraging by these animals creates surface depressions that generate resource-rich patches and novel niches. Thus, their reintroduction can have beneficial effects on both the biodiversity and functioning of the ecosystems they inhabit. An important knowledge gap, however, is the extent to which soil foraging by these animals might compromise ecosystem functioning if they reach extremely high densities in the absence of natural predators, such as occurs with the extensive soil disturbance by feral pigs. We performed a field experiment to test the effects of increasing soil disturbance and herbivory, and their interaction, on ecosystem functioning and the diversity of multiple taxa in a dry subhumid grassy woodland. Of the 106 possible attribute x treatment combinations assessed, we found only eight effects (three declines and five herbivory effects that varied depending on disturbance or community) in response to increasing levels of soil surface disturbance or herbivory. System-based modelling revealed that the greatest overall effects on our organisms were due to plants (plant richness, plant biomass, litter depth), with generally positive effects of plants on surface-active arthropods, negative effects on the whole metazoan community, and a negative litter effect, but only on microbes. Levels of disturbance (0-60%) and herbivory (0-100%) imposed in our treatments were greater than those observed under natural conditions. Our results suggest therefore that there are unlikely to be substantial negative impacts of reintroducing soil-foraging animals on biodiversity or ecosystem functioning in our target dry woodlands, even under potentially large levels of disturbance and herbivory.

AB  - Coral reefs are one of the most diverse marine ecosystems, providing numerous ecosystem services. This present study investigated the relationship between coral reef condition and the diversity and abundance of fishes, on a heavily fished East African coral reef at Gazi Bay, Kenya. Underwater visual censuses were conducted on thirty 50 x 5 m belt transects to assess the abundance and diversity of fishes. In parallel, a 25-m length of each of the same transects was recorded with photo-quadrats to assess coral community structure and benthic characteristics. For statistical analyses, multi-model inference based on the Akaike Information Criterion was used to evaluate the support for potential predictor variables of coral reef and fish diversity. We found that coral genus richness was negatively correlated with the abundance of macroalgae, whereas coral cover was positively correlated with both the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates (sea urchins) and with fish family richness. Similarly, fish family richness appeared mainly correlated with coral cover and invertebrate abundance, although no correlates of fish abundance could be identified. Coral and fish diversity were very low, but it appears that, contrary to some locations on the same coast, sea urchin abundance was not high enough to be having a negative influence on coral and fish assemblages. Due to increasing threats to coral reefs, it is important to understand the relationship among the components of the coral reef ecosystem on overfished reefs such as that at Gazi Bay.

AB  - Chemical responses of tundra vegetation and tundra soil to environmental changes are likely to differ, with implications for ecosystem functioning, yet they are rarely compared. Here, we aimed at comparing sensitivity and magnitude of short-term carbon and nitrogen responses of three main tundra ecosystem compartments: vascular plants, mosses, and soil, to two environmental perturbations: herbivore disturbance and warming. In a full-factorial field experiment in the high-Arctic Svalbard, we simulated herbivore disturbance as spring grubbing activity by pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) and passively increased summer temperatures using open-top chambers. Manipulations were set up within three habitats that differ in soil moisture and carried out for two consecutive growing seasons. Overall, we found small and few significant responses to herbivore disturbance and warming, suggesting that carbon and nitrogen contents of high-Arctic ecosystems are relatively resistant to these perturbations, at least in the short term. However, the three ecosystem compartments still differed in their sensitivity to perturbations (vascular plants > soil > mosses), and this was exacerbated by their differential sensitivity across habitats (mesic > moist > wet). Also, while vascular plants responded to herbivore disturbance in mesic and wet habitats and to warming in mesic and moist habitats, soil and mosses only responded to herbivore disturbance in mesic and wet habitats, respectively. Responses to treatments were generally consistent across the two growing seasons, despite great differences in temperature conditions and large between-year variations in the chemical composition of the three ecosystem compartments. These findings highlight the potential for environmental perturbations to have small, yet differential short-term impacts on the carbon and nitrogen contents of vascular plants, mosses, and soil, both within and between tundra habitats. Our results imply that assessments of a single ecosystem compartment in a given context cannot be extrapolated to the whole ecosystem, thus stressing the importance of considering both vegetation and soil carbon and nitrogen responses, and how they display across habitats, in order to better understand how environmental changes might affect biogeochemical processes in the tundra. Longer-term studies should dig deeper into the relative role of (simulated) global change drivers vs. natural inter-annual climatic fluctuations for tundra ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics.

AB  - Caracal is an adaptive and generalist predator with high ecological tolerance on the other hand it has an isolated population in Turkiye. We investigated the ecological characteristics of caracal (Caracal caracal) in the Mediterranean ecosystems of Southwestern Anatolia (Turkiye) where its population is isolated from other Asian populations. We used field observations and camera trap methodology across a landscape covering 750 km2 to determine the population status, morphology, behavioural characteristics, the status of species in the community, diet and habitat preference of caracal in the region. Caracal density was estimated to be 0,18 caracals/km2. The female home range was estimated to be between 4,1 km2 and 25 km2 whereas the male home range was estimated to be between 5 km2 and 50 km2 or more. Species' daily activity was determined as cathemeral. Annual activity patterns as well as home range sizes decreased during the dry season. During the wet season, caracal activity as well as home range sizes increased. Vegetation cover was found to be the most important factor affecting habitat use by caracal. A strong negative correlation of 0.7 between caracal occurrence and forest cover indicated that forest cover was the most important factor affecting habitat use by a caracal. Caracal occurrence was also positively correlated with 3 mammal species in the study area, wild boar, European hare and wild goat. Caracal was determined as the dominant carnivore species in the ecosystem. Wild herbivore populations in the study area seem to be influenced by caracal thus resulting in a conspicuous effect on grazing pressures. We conclude that caracal is a keystone species in our ecosystem and plays a vital role in maintaining their integrity. Thus, the conservation of the caracal population is crucial for the conservation of the whole Mediterranean ecosystem.

AB  - An observed acceleration of tree mortality rates in European forests has been attributed to the impacts of climate change and extreme disturbances. Ecosystem recovery depends on regeneration success, but the recruitment of juveniles has been recognized as bottleneck in the development of forests. We investigated the potential importance of biotic (canopy tree abundance, ungulate herbivory) and abiotic (light, soil nutrients) factors in the limitation of regeneration in montane primary forests in central Europe. We used widely distributed forest inventory data (n = 348 plots) for two forest types, multiple tree taxa, and two life stages (seedlings and saplings). Seedling densities were promoted by more abundant parent trees, but saplings were either negatively influenced or unaffected by the number of conspecific adults. Browsing intensity (per capita defoliation severity) strongly limited the density of seedlings, but not saplings, at a community level. Low understory light levels were positively associated with seedling densities, but either did not affect or depressed sapling abundance A tolerance of shading was enhanced by nitrogen availability in some taxa. Our findings reflect highly complex, context-specific regeneration processes that vary by species and life stage within species.

AB  - Context. Wildfire can affect freshwater ecosystems in many ways, notably when post -fire rainfall washes ash and sediment into waterways. Aims. We investigated species-specific effects of bushfire and subsequent channel sedimentation on the abundance of platypus and fish populations in the upper Buffalo River, Australia. Methods. Pre-and post -fire population surveys were conducted using fyke nets. Key results. There was no evidence that fish numbers declined because of direct fire effects. However, native two-spined blackfish and Macquarie perch numbers dropped dramatically following post -fire sedimentation, whereas non-native redfin perch increased, most likely as a result of migration from a nearby lake. Platypus captures were consistently recorded at all survey sites both before and after the fire and sediment inflows occurred, with many juveniles being recorded in the first post -fire breeding season. Conclusions. The platypus's greater resilience to post -fire sediment inflows than that of native fish presumably reflects its reliance on lungs rather than gills and its ability to take refuge in burrows. It also has a broad diet, flexible foraging behaviour, is highly vagile and typically stores enough fat to support fasting for up to 2-3 weeks. Implications. Management of fire-affected aquatic ecosystems must consider species-specific responses of freshwater vertebrates to fire.

AB  - The role of human hunting behavior versus climate change in the mass extinction of megafauna during the Late Quaternary is much debated. To move beyond monocausal arguments, we treat human-megafauna-environment relationships as social-ecological systems from a complex adaptive systems perspective, to create an agent-based model that tests how human hunting may interact with environmental stress and animal life history to affect the probability of extinction. Using the extinction of Syncerus antiquus in South Africa at 12-10 ka as a loose inspirational case study, we parameterized a set of experiments to identify cross-feedbacks among environmental dynamics, prey life history, and human hunting pressure that affect extinction probability in a non-linear way. An important anthropogenic boundary condition emerges when hunting strategies interrupt prey animal breeding cycles. This effect is amplified in patchy, highly seasonal environments to increase the chances of extinction. This modeling approach to human behavior and biodiversity loss helps us understand how these types of cross-feedback effects and boundary conditions emerge as system components interact and change. We argue that this approach can help translate archaeological data and insight about past extinction for use in understanding and combating the current mass extinction crisis.

AB  - Variability in large mammalian herbivores can reshape smaller animal communities in complex ways. Accordingly, conservation strategies require a deeper understanding of the extent to which mesoherbivores (>20-1000 kg) and megaherbivores (>1000 kg) influence on animal communities are mediated by changes to vegetation structure, and the extent to which the influence of megaherbivores overlap with mesoherbivores. Using an exclusion experiment, we examined how megaherbivores altered mesoherbivore activity and how both groups influenced small mammals. We compared influences that were mediated by broad metrics of vegetation structure (i.e., indirect effects) with all other influences that were not mediated by vegetation structure (e.g., direct effects). We found megaherbivores were linked to increased mesoherbivore activity, particularly grazers, through both vegetation structure-mediated and other pathways. Alternatively, we found small mammals were suppressed where megaherbivores were present, and their population fluctuations were explained by both structure-mediated and other pathways. Small mammal abundance was higher where large herbivores were excluded compared to open plots, with no difference between plots excluding only megaherbivores and those excluding all herbivores. This suggests that these effects were produced by either megaherbivores alone, or by megaherbivores in conjunction with the increased mesoherbivore activity they facilitated. While small mammal abundance was linked to mesoherbivore-induced changes in grass biomass, their non-linear response, did not correspond with the exclusion of mesoherbivores. These findings highlight megaherbivores' capacity to reshape animal communities through interactions beyond broad metrics of vegetation structure, underscoring the importance of considering the varied influences of megaherbivores on mammal communities in conservation strategies.

AB  - Vegetation phenology and productivity drive resource use by wildlife. Vegetation dynamics also reveal patterns of habitat disturbance and recovery. Monitoring these fine-scale vegetation patterns over large spatiotemporal extents can be difficult, but camera traps (CTs) commonly used to survey wildlife populations also collect data on local habitat conditions. We used CTs (n = 73) from 2016 to 2019 to assess impacts of habitat change in a boreal landscape of northern Canada, where seismic lines for petroleum exploration disturbed wildlife habitat and prompted vegetation restoration efforts. First, we quantified vegetation dynamics from CTs, comparing them to satellite-based estimates that are typically used to monitor vegetation at broad spatial scales. We then used understory phenology and productivity estimated from CT time-lapse images to assess vegetation recovery on seismic lines. Finally, we related vegetation dynamics with the habitat use of three wildlife species: sandhill cranes Grus canadensis, woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus, and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus. CTs provided unique insight into vegetation dynamics that were different from signals measured by satellites, with temporally inconsistent and even some negative correlations between CT and satellite metrics. We found some indication of vegetation recovery on seismic lines that had received restoration treatment, with understory patterns more similar to undisturbed habitat than to seismic lines that did not receive restoration treatment. CTs also provided inferences about wildlife activity related to vegetation resources, which approaches using satellite data failed to detect. Wildlife habitat use tracked vegetation phenology, but did not always increase with vegetation productivity at weekly, 16-day, or annual intervals. Instead, associations with vegetation productivity depended on species, temporal scale, and productivity metrics. Given the widespread and growing use of CTs to monitor terrestrial wildlife, we recommend their use to simultaneously monitor habitat conditions to better understand the mechanisms that govern wildlife habitat use in changing environments.

AB  - Ecological disturbance is a driving force that structures ecosystems and shapes landscape pattern. Wildfire is a widespread form of ecological disturbance, and in some vegetation communities fires are increasing in extent and severity. Across the gradient of fire severity, fire can have both positive and negative effects on animals, where some species require mature climax vegetation conditions and other species select for early successional stages. However, further work is necessary to understand how large mammalian herbivore and carnivore populations respond to the gradient of fire severity. The overall objective of this research was to understand the relative roles of fire, landscape, and human factors across the gradient of fire severity on occupancy and/or relative habitat use of large herbivores (i.e., elk and mule deer) and carnivores (i.e., black bear, mountain lion, and gray wolf) seven years post fire. We predicted that animals would increase use of areas characterized by higher fire severity (moderate, moderate/high, or high fire severity) and heterogeneity, where food resources were expected to be greatest. In addition, road density could either increase or decrease animal use of areas, where some animals might increase use near roads due to increased forage along roadsides or decrease use due to higher human activity. Remote wildlife (RW) cameras sampled the gradient of fire severity seven years post a large mixedseverity wildfire (Wallow Fire, year 2011, 2,177 km2) in the White Mountains of Arizona, USA. We evaluated RW camera data using single-species occupancy and Royle-Nichols (relative habitat use) models. As predicted, large mammals (black bear, elk, mountain lion, mule deer, and wolves) exhibited high occupancy and/or habitat use in relation to higher levels of fire severity and/or fire heterogeneity, which was likely related to bottom-up factors related to increased food resources. Some species (black bear and elk) also exhibited relatively high use of unburned forest. Elk reduced use of areas with higher road density, likely to avoid human activity, whereas mule deer increased use of areas with high road density. Mixed-severity wildfire may provide important resources, including pulses of food in early successional forests. Thus, allowing fire-adapted forests to experience mixedseverity wildfire is predicted to benefit some large herbivore and carnivore populations. If high occupancy and/or habitat use by wildlife in areas experiencing higher fire severity and heterogeneity translates into increased populations of animals, wildfire might be beneficial to humans, focal wildlife populations, and fireadapted ecosystems.

AB  - Increased wildfire size and frequency, invasion of non-native annual grasses, extensive fire suppression, climate change, and widespread juniper expansion have led to dramatic changes in sagebrush ecosystems, which provide habitat for a suite of wildlife species, including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). These landscape-level disturbances can cause habitat loss and degradation, which influence the quantity and quality of available forage and can negatively influence adult female mule deer survival. We used Program MARK to estimate survival rates using a known-fate model. Our dataset included 111 radiocollared female mule deer to estimate monthly survival rates and to investigate factors that may affect these rates, including movement behavior (migratory or resident) and habitat characteristics (wildfire and juniper canopy cover) in mule deer habitats supporting sagebrush potential vegetation types (PVTs). The dataset included 116 421 Global Positioning System (GPS) location points from 2015 to 2017 in the John Day Basin, Oregon, United States. Survival averaged 0.78 (95% confidence interval = 0.61-0.82) across the study period but was 0.69 (95% confidence interval = 0.59-0.77) in 2015. Our results indicated survival was positively influenced by the presence of small amounts of recent fire ( < 15% of total winter range burned; 1 -20 yr postfire) within an individual's winter range. Annual survival (0.78) was low compared with survival rates for adult female mule deer in other parts of their geographic range. These findings demonstrate how postfire vegetation response can have a positive effect on mule deer survival, regardless of their migration strategy. Our findings also indicate how climate change poses a growing threat to mule deer populations as prolonged periods of drought increase the spread of fatal diseases.(c) 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Three different herbivore grazing assemblages, namely, yak grazing (YG), Tibetan sheep grazing (SG) and yak and Tibetan sheep co-grazing (MG), are practiced in alpine meadows on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), but the effects of the different herbivore assemblages on soil microbes are relatively unknown. The microbial community plays an important role in the functional stability of alpine grassland ecosystems. Therefore, it is important to understand how the microbial community structure of grassland ecosystems changes under different herbivore grazing assemblages to ensure their sustainable development. To fill this gap, a field study was carried out to investigate the effects of YG, SG, and MG on plant communities, soil physico-chemical properties and microbial communities under moderate grazing intensity in alpine meadows. Grazing increased the beta-diversity of the bacteria community and decreased the beta-diversity of the fungal community. The herbivore assemblage affected the microbial community diversity, but not the plant community diversity. Total phosphorus, soil bulk density, root biomass, and plant alpha-diversity were correlated with both the bacterial and fungal community composition, available phosphorus and soil moisture were correlated only with the bacterial community composition, while available potassium and above-ground net primary production (ANPP) were correlated only with the fungal community composition. Soil available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil bulk density were highest in SG, while ANPP was highest in MG. It was concluded that MG can improve ANPP and stabilize the soil microbial community, suggesting that MG is an effective method for sustainable use and conservation of alpine meadows on the QTP.

AB  - Populations of Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an iconic symbol of sagebrush ecosystems, are declining in native grasslands due to habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation. We conducted a field experiment in Grasslands National Park, Saskatchewan, Canada, to investigate how disturbance and land management (cattle grazed, bison grazed, watered, and ungrazed) affected Greater sage-grouse habitat and the efficacy of common restoration methods. Restoration treatments consisted of a seed mix of native forbs, grasses, and sagebrush; seeding season (fall and spring); planted sagebrush seedlings; and applications of glyphosate herbicide. Total vegetation cover, moss, and lichen cover, and species richness were greater, and litter cover was less with cattle grazing than with other management treatments. Herbicide increased native forb cover and negatively affected established sagebrush. Seeding season (fall and spring) had little effect on vegetation parameters. Establishment of native forbs and grasses by seed was mostly unsuccessful. Planting sagebrush seedlings was more effective than broadcast seeding; although, after 2 years, seedling survival was very low. There was an abundance of diverse forbs for the dietary requirements of pre-laying hens, chicks, and juveniles with most management treatments. The proportion of litter cover played a significant role in successful vegetation establishment. All sites had key components of sage-grouse habitat and showed potential for restoration success given some land management modifications.

AB  - Feral horse (Equus ferus caballus) grazing can alter arid shrubland habitat in the western United States to the detriment of sympatric wildlife species, including the greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). To date, studies of horse-influenced habitat alteration have only occurred in a few locations and have infrequently represented gradients of horse use. We investigated whether greater sage-grouse habitat quality metrics were negatively associated with feral horse use in southcentral Wyoming, USA. We also tested whether utilization distributions generated from feral horses tracked with global position system transmitters were correlated with dung pile density, our index of horse use. Dung pile density did not vary among utilization distribution levels, indicating utilization distributions were a poor predictor of cumulative horse use. Bare ground increased with dung pile density (beta = 0.06, 85% CI = 0.04-0.18), and grass height exhibited a threshold response and began to decline after 638 piles/ha. Other habitat metrics including percent shrub cover, native perennial grass cover, and visual obstruction were better explained by topographic and temporal variation. Our results suggest that herd size reduction may limit soil erosion potential and improve desired herbaceous structure, though additional management actions regarding feral horse use are needed to sustain high-quality greater sage-grouse habitat.

AB  - Question Understanding the sensitivity and magnitude of plant community responses in tundra wetlands to herbivory and warming is pressing as these ecosystems are increasingly threatened by changes in grazing pressure and higher temperatures. Here, we ask to what extent different low-Arctic coastal wetland plant communities are affected by short-term goose grazing and warming, and whether these communities differ in their responses. Location Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska. Methods We conducted an experiment where we simulated goose grazing by clipping the vegetation and summer warming by using open-top chambers in three plant communities along a 6-km coastal-inland gradient. We assessed plant community compositional changes following two years of treatments. Results Grazing had stronger effects than warming on both plant functional group and species composition. Overall, grazing decreased the abundance of grasses and sedges and increased the abundance of forbs, whereas warming only caused a decrease in forb abundance. However, plant communities and functional groups, both within and across communities, varied widely in their responses to treatments. Grazing decreased grass abundance (-25%) and increased forb abundance (+44%) in the two more coastal communities, and reduced sedge abundance (-22%) only in the most inland community. Warming only decreased forb abundance (-18%) in the most coastal community, which overall was the most responsive to treatments. Conclusions We show that short-term goose grazing predominates over short-term summer warming in eliciting compositional changes in three different low-Arctic coastal wetland plant communities. Yet, responses varied among communities and the same functional groups could respond differently across them, highlighting the importance of investigating the effects of biotic and abiotic drivers in different contexts. By showing that tundra wetland plant communities can differ in their immediate sensitivity to goose grazing and, though to a lesser extent, warming, our findings have implications for the functioning of these rapidly changing high-latitude ecosystems.

AB  - Responses of forest-floor small mammals to clearcutting are species-specific with generalists occupying a range of habitats, and specialists persisting on clearcuts for variable periods. We investigated the responses in abundance and species composition of small mammal communities to cumulative clearcutting of coniferous forests on a landscape that had four independent clearcutting events (Periods 1 to 4) over a 42-year interval from 1979 to 2020 in south-central British Columbia, Canada. We ask if the small mammal communities have changed significantly over these decades owing to removal of old-growth forest by clearcut harvesting. Hypotheses (H) predicted that the small mammal community would (H1) increase in abundance, species richness, and diversity on new clearcuts owing to the availability of early seral post-harvest habitats from cumulative clearcutting; and (H2) have higher mean abundance, species richness, and species diversity in clearcut than uncut forest sites, owing to availability of vegetative food and cover. A third hypothesis (H3) predicted that abundance of (i) early seral vegetation (herbs and shrubs) and (ii) small mammal populations, will be greater in ungrazed clearcut sites than in those grazed by cattle (Bos taurus). Mean total numbers of small mammals on new clearcuts declined in Periods 3 and 4, and hence did not support the abundance part of H1. Much of this decline was owing to low numbers of the long-tailed vole (Microtus longicaudus) and meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus). Two generalist species: the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and northwestern chipmunk (Neotamias amoenus), contributed to high mean species richness and diversity in Periods 2 and 3 before these metrics declined in Period 4, and hence partly supported H1. The similarity in mean total numbers of small mammals in Periods 2 to 4 did not support the abundance prediction of H2 that total numbers would be higher in clearcut than uncut forest sites. Higher mean species richness (Periods 2 and 3) and diversity (Period 3) measurements on clearcut than forest sites, particularly in the early post-harvest years, did support these parts of H2. The vegetation part (i) of H3 was not supported for herbaceous plants but it was for shrubs. The small mammal part (ii) of H3 that populations would be higher in ungrazed than grazed clearcut sites was supported for abundance but not for species richness or diversity. The decline and near disappearance of both species of Microtus was possibly related to the reduction in plant community abundance and structure from grazing (at least for shrubs) and potentially from drought effects associated with climate change. Loss of microtines from these early seral ecosystems may have profound negative effects on various ecological functions and predator communities.

AB  - Context. There is concern about potential competition between non-native fallow deer (Dama dama) and livestock for food, particularly during times of low rainfall when pasture is scarce. Aims. We aimed to estimate the extent to which a high-density fallow deer population (similar to 37 deer per km(2)) competed with livestock for food during a severe drought on pastoral properties on the Liverpool Plains, New South Wales, Australia. Methods. We collected rumen contents from 125 fallow deer shot from helicopters during control operations in June and August 2018, and used microhistology to quantify their diets. We then used the diet data to adjust published estimates of stock unit equivalence from farmed fallow deer. Fallow deer sex and age class abundances and stock unit equivalences were multiplied to estimate the grazing pressure of the fallow deer population pre-and post-control relative to recommended sheep and cattle stocking rates. Finally, we estimated density-impact relationships for fallow deer. Key results. Fallow deer diet was dominated by monocots (primarily grasses), but some individuals consumed large amounts of dicots (commonly Eucalyptus). Fallow deer were grazers to intermediate mixed feeders. Fallow deer dry-sheep equivalents (DSEs, based on a 50-kg merino wether) varied from 1.01 (juveniles) to 1.85 (adult females and adult males). Assuming complete diet overlap, the pre-control fallow deer population was equivalent to approximately 60.3 DSEs per km(2) and reduced the potential stocking rate of domestic livestock by 50.2%. Discounting the fallow deer DSEs by the amount of browse in the diet resulted in a pre-control population of 45.7 DSEs per km(2). The helicopter-based shooting reduced the fallow deer population by 26%, increasing the stocking rate in natural pasture by 22.0% (complete overlap) or 13.8% (discounting for browse). Conclusions. When food is limiting, fallow deer at high density can exert strong competitive pressure on livestock, reducing carrying capacity. Browsing, including on Eucalyptus, likely helped fallow deer to persist at high densities during the severe drought of 2018, when properties had destocked. Implications. Helicopter-based shooting reduced the competitive effects of fallow deer on livestock in our study area to only a small extent, but more intensive shooting would have led to a greater reduction. The helicopter-based shooting of deer was received positively by landholders at a time of severe stress, suggesting that deer control in agricultural areas can have other important benefits.

AB  - South American subtropical landscapes are dominated by open grasslands and mosaics of forest-grassland formations. Forests are often restricted to riverine margins with sharp forest-grassland ecotones. Understanding the mechanisms maintaining forest-grassland ecotones is important to anticipate the effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes on the extent of these biomes and the ecosystem services they provide. We used a combination of field surveys and long-term field experiments to explore the mechanisms that explain tree cover expansion at the ecotone of riverine forests and grasslands in central Uruguay, within the South American Campos. We assessed the role of tree seed dispersal and seedling establishment limitations, and experimentally tested for the effects of cattle, nurse tree cover and grasses on the recruitment of forest and grassland tree species at the forest-grassland ecotone. We found that forest expansion depends on the interplay between cattle and nurse trees. Vachellia caven trees colonize the grassland successfully and facilitate the formation of forest patches by enhancing seed accumulation and seedling establishment of forest tree species. Surprisingly, grass cover had mostly positive effects on early seedling survival of forest tree seedlings. However, cattle limits tree seedling growth and survival, especially of forest tree species. This results in a nucleated vegetation pattern of tree patches that ultimately limits forest expansion. Synthesis and applications. Tree cover can potentially expand on the subtropical South American grasslands. Reductions in cattle densities and increases in rainfall levels associated with climate change could facilitate forest expansion in this region.
   Los paisajes subtropicales de Am & eacute;rica del Sur est & aacute;n cubiertos predominantemente por pastizales y diversos tipos de mosaicos de bosques y pastizales. Los bosques est & aacute;n frecuentemente restringidos a las orillas de los r & iacute;os formando ecotonos muy marcados con los pastizales abiertos. El entendimiento de los mecanismos que mantienen los ecotonos entre los bosques y los pastizales es importante para poder anticipar los efectos que cambios clim & aacute;ticos y en el r & eacute;gimen de perturbaciones pueden tener en la extensi & oacute;n de estos dos tipos de biomas y los servicios ecosist & eacute;micos asociados a ellos. Nosotros usamos una combinaci & oacute;n de muestreos y experimentos de campo a largo plazo para estudiar los mecanismos que explican el proceso de expansi & oacute;n de la cobertura arb & oacute;rea en el ecotono de bosques ribere & ntilde;os y pastizales del centro de Uruguay, dentro de la bio-regi & oacute;n Campos de Am & eacute;rica del Sur. Estudiamos los patrones de dispersi & oacute;n de semillas y de establecimiento de pl & aacute;ntulas y evaluamos experimentalmente los efectos del ganado, la cobertura herb & aacute;cea y los & aacute;rboles nodriza en el establecimiento de especias arb & oacute;reas asociadas a los bosques y los pastizales en el ecotono del bosque-pastizal. Encontramos que la expansi & oacute;n del bosque depende de la interacci & oacute;n entre el ganado y los & aacute;rboles nodriza. Los & aacute;rboles de Vachellia caven colonizan el pastizal exitosamente y facilitan la formaci & oacute;n de parches boscosos a trav & eacute;s de la acumulaci & oacute;n de semillas y del mejor establecimiento de juveniles de especies arb & oacute;reas asociadas al bosque bajo sus doseles. Curiosamente, la cobertura herb & aacute;cea tiene efectos predominantemente positivos en la sobrevivencia de las pl & aacute;ntulas de las especies arb & oacute;reas asociadas al bosque. En cambio, el ganado limita el crecimiento y sobrevivencia de las pl & aacute;ntulas, especialmente de las especies arb & oacute;reas asociadas al bosque. Como consecuencia de estos efectos, el ecotono se caracteriza por un patr & oacute;n nucleado de reclutamiento arb & oacute;reo formando parches boscosos que no logran expandir la cobertura del bosque. S & iacute;ntesis y aplicaciones. La cobertura arb & oacute;rea puede expandirse en los pastizales de Am & eacute;rica del Sur. La expansi & oacute;n de los bosques en esta regi & oacute;n puede ser facilitada con disminuciones en las densidades del ganado y con aumentos en las precipitaciones asociadas al cambio clim & aacute;tico.

AB  - In the vast expanse of Baikal Siberia, indigenous nomadic animal groups have been conserved, grazing on pastures throughout the year. It is believed that the fecal microbiota of these diverse nomadic animal species is unique to each species and closely tied to their feeding environments. We conducted a pioneering comparative analysis of the taxonomic structure and the diversity of fecal microbiota in indigenous nomadic animals inhabiting Baikal Siberia. Our study encompassed 20 deer, 23 yaks, 24 camels, and 29 sheep, using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene profiling. In the fecal microbiota of these animals, we observed a predominant presence of the phyla Bacillota, Bacteroidota, and Verrucomicrobiota, collectively comprising over 88% of the microbial communities. Moreover, these proportions exhibited variations according to the host species. The unculturable Bacillota UCG-005 and UCG-010 are the key groups for all animals. However, at the genus level, distinctive compositions of fecal microbiota were discernible within each animal group. We identified a total of 37 dominant genera across the fecal samples from these four animal species. Principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis demonstrated that the fecal microbiota composition clustered among individuals of the same animal species. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) indicated that camels exhibited higher abundances of the family Akkermansiaceae and the uncultured clostridial lineage UCG-010, while deer featured Lachnospiraceae; sheep had Ruminococcaceae; and yaks displayed Monoglobaceae, Bacteroidaceae, and methanogenic archaea from the family Methanobacteriaceae as distinctive marker taxa. Our studies showed that the studied nomadic animals feed mainly on plants belonging to the families Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Asteraceae, and Rosaceae. Our research indicated that the identity of the host species and, to a lesser degree, their diets and habitats, significantly shape the composition of fecal microbiota in these studied nomadic ruminant animals.

AB  - We selected 15 sheep-grazed sand pastures along a gradient of increasing grazing intensity to study the fine-scale patterns of main biomass fractions (green biomass, litter) and that of plant species and functional groups (life forms and social behaviour types). We classified them into five grazing intensity levels based on stocking density, proximity to drinking and resting places and the number of faeces. We aimed to answer the following questions: (i) How does increasing intensity of sheep grazing affect the amount of green biomass, the species richness and their relationship in sand pastures? (ii) How does increasing intensity of sheep grazing affect the biomass of perennial and short-lived graminoids and forbs? (iii) How does the disturbance value-expressed in the biomass ratio of disturbance-tolerant and ruderal species-change along the gradient of grazing intensity? A unimodal relationship between green biomass and species richness was detected; however, the ordination (canonical correspondence analysis, CCA) showed no clustering of pastures subjected to the same levels of grazing intensity. Along the grazing intensity gradient we found an increasing trend in species richness and significant differences in green biomass (decreasing trend), litter (decreasing trend), graminoids (decreasing trend) and short-lived forbs (increasing trend). We found an increasing amount of disturbance-tolerant and ruderal species with increasing grazing intensity. We suggest that we might need to use multiple scales for sampling and a fine-scale assessment of grazing intensity. Our findings might be instructive for pastures in densely populated regions, which are prone to the encroachment of disturbance-tolerant and ruderal species.
   We analysed the fine scale biomass patterns of sheep-grazed sand pastures along increasing grazing intensity. Along the grazing intensity gradient, we found an increasing trend for species richness and the biomass of short-lived forbs; while green biomass, litter and graminoid biomass showed a decreasing trend. We found an increasing amount of disturbance tolerant and ruderal species with increasing grazing intensity.image

AB  - Questions Inter-annual variability in precipitation is expected to increase in grasslands, potentially causing additional stress to systems already impacted by anthropogenic activities such as livestock grazing, which can induce changes to grassland vegetation. Yet, the sensitivity of key ecosystem functions to these co-occurring factors is often overlooked. Here, we determine: (a) the effects of grazing on the sensitivity of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP sensitivity) to inter-annual variation in water-year precipitation (the sum of precipitation from September through to the following August); (b) whether ANPP sensitivity to precipitation is associated with shifts induced by grazing in functional group biomass (grass vs forb) contribution to total ANPP, litter, and species richness, and mean annual water-year precipitation; and (c) whether the impacts of grazing on ANPP vary between dry and wet years.
   Location Native grasslands in Alberta, Canada.
   Methods We used long-term (14-28 years) ANPP and precipitation data from 31 grazed grasslands, each with a paired non-grazed livestock exclosure. ANPP was sampled annually within exclosures and adjacent grazed locations at each site.
   Results We found that grazing increased ANPP sensitivity to inter-annual changes in precipitation. Increased ANPP sensitivity to precipitation in grazed, relative to non-grazed locations was associated with both an increase in the contribution of forbs to total ANPP and a decrease in the contribution of grasses to total ANPP; reduced litter also increased ANPP sensitivity to precipitation. Species richness was not associated with ANPP sensitivity in both grazed and non-grazed locations. Arid grasslands were more sensitive to inter-annual variation in precipitation when grazed than were mesic grasslands. Similarly, grazing reduced ANPP during dry years but had no effect during wet years.
   Conclusions Overall, these findings suggest that grazed grasslands are more vulnerable to reductions in primary productivity in dry years, which may present a challenge for maintaining ecosystem services in an era of increasing precipitation variability.

AB  - This field study in a semi-arid savannah at Senkelle Swayne's Hartebeest Sanctuary, Ethiopia, examined livestock grazing effects on rangeland condition, plant species composition and richness, and population of the endangered Swayne's hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus swaynei). Rangeland condition was analysed using a common protocol for the assessment of semi-arid rangelands. A total count method was used to estimate ungulate numbers. Grazing reduced all measures of range condition and productivity and affected the composition and richness of the herbaceous species. Grazing also induced an increase in the density and number of encroaching woody species Vachellia seyal and Senegalia senegal. The population of the Swayne's hartebeest significantly affected by livestock grazing (mean number of hartebeests observed under moderately and lightly grazed sites were 10.00 +/- 2.49 and 6.75 +/- 2.06, respectively). No individual hartebeest was observed roaming in the heavily grazed zone, which implies an effective reduction in the extent of habitat available for the hartebeest. The overall condition of the rangeland was poor. Measures to reduce livestock presence in areas from which the hartebeest has been displaced and controlled seasonal livestock grazing within non-sensitive parts of the Sanctuary may benefit the hartebeest. Coupled with these, livestock exclusions for up to a year and interseeding may help improve rangeland condition and hartebeest's habitat.

AB  - IntroductionLivestock overgrazing represents one of the most destructive uses of land in terrestrial ecosystems and threatens biodiversity. However, understanding the effects of livestock overgrazing on below-ground soil microbial diversity is limited, despite soil microbes representing the majority of biodiversity and determining ecosystem functioning.Materials and MethodsTo investigate the effects of overgrazing on soil microbial richness, a long-term grazing exclusion experiment was conducted at six sites including three meadow steppes and three typical steppes in northern China.ResultsOur results revealed that overgrazing decreased bacterial and fungal richness across temperate steppes in northern China, and the biome could regulate the overgrazing effects, especially for fungal richness. Specifically, the negative effects of overgrazing on microbial richness were highly significant in typical steppes while not significant in meadow steppes that contained higher plant diversity and precipitation. Partial least-squares path model showed that overgrazing affected soil microbial richness in highly complex ways, and the affected pathways were different in meadow steppes and typical steppes. The direct negative effects of grazing and their indirect negative effects via soil properties resulted in a significant decrease in microbial richness in typical steppes. In meadow steppes, the indirect beneficial effects via plant attributes offset the direct negative effects of grazing. Consequently, the soil microbial community in meadow steppe resisted overgrazing disturbance.ConclusionOur study illuminates the complex and highly biome-dependent grazing effects and pathways on soil microbiota and indicates that meadow steppe may be more resistant or resilient to human disturbance than typical steppe. These findings suggest that different grasslands might be managed differently considering their intrinsic characteristics to help biodiversity conservation. Moreover, future research should focus on the underlying mechanisms of grazing effects on soil microbial richness. Besides grazing-induced plant and soil traits changes, other potential pathways could strongly influence soil microbial diversity.

AB  - Wild herbivore distribution responds to habitat and forage availability modulated by predation risk and inter-specific interactions. Nowadays, the study of distribution and abundance of wild and domestic herbivores have regained importance to understand and diminish conservation conflicts in productive lands worldwide. Contiguous ranching and protected areas have created conflicting scenarios when wild ungulate populations increase and redistribute in livestock rangelands, because of competition for food and disease transmission. Consequently, understanding wild ungulate distribution and density patterns is critical to inform efficient management strategies for livestock grazing and wild ungulate coexistence. Here we analyze guanaco (Lama guanicoe) density and distribution, and compare habitat and microhabitat use (plant biomass, species richness, and diversity) in a protected area and in surrounding sheep ranches of Tierra del Fuego. Density of guanaco was similar between protected area and ranches, but proportion of groups and average group size were larger on ranches, and total guanaco density was also higher outside than within the protected area, which contrasts with previous studies. Use of microhabitat features was also different between both management regimes. Guanaco used areas with higher vegetation biomass, plant composition and richness in the protected area than on ranches. These results suggest that both intrinsic (socio-biological) and extrinsic (forage availability and human distur-bance) factors influence density and distribution patterns as well as microhabitat use by the guanaco, which have large implications for its conservation.

AB  - Successful restoration measures need a good understanding of how the composition, structure, and functioning of ecosystems change with degradation and what the best indicators of these changes are. To answer these questions, we worked on four ecosystem types in the Mediterranean Andes mountains in central Chile (from sclerophyllous forest to Andean shrublands), which represent an elevational gradient from 700 to 3,250 m. We sampled three plots on each of the three degradation levels (low, medium, and high) for each ecosystem at increasing distances from goat corrals. We measured 35 indicators that describe vegetation (14), soil (15), and ecosystem processes (6) for one growing season. Degradation caused a decrease in shrub cover, shrub productivity, the Normalized Community Structure Integrity Index (CSIIn), litter depth, total soil nitrogen and C/N ratio, and an increase in clay content. Plant species indicating low degradation were consistently native woody species. When comparing ecosystems (i.e., at different elevations) against the type of variable, process-based indicators showed more statistically significant differences. Based on their consistency across ecosystems and ease of measurement, we recommend using shrub cover and litter depth as indicators of degradation. Finally, we concluded that ecosystems are highly degraded when vegetation- and process-based indicators change - 60% or when soil indicators change - 25%. These results could also be used to set goals for restoration projects in these mountain ecosystems.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, understanding the impacts of anthropogenic influence on biodiversity and behavior of vulnerable wildlife communities is increasingly relevant to effective conservation. However, comparative studies aimed at disentangling the concurrent effect of different types of human disturbance on multifaceted biodiversity and on activity patterns of mammals are surprisingly rare. We applied a multiregion community model to separately estimate the effects of cumulative human modification (e.g., settlement, agriculture, and transportation) and human presence (aggregated presence of dogs, people, and livestock) on species richness and functional composition of medium- and large-bodied mammals based on camera trap data collected across 45 subtropical montane forests. We divided the detected mammal species into three trophic guilds-carnivores, herbivores, and omnivores-and assessed the nocturnal shifts of each guild in response to anthropogenic activities. Overall, species richness tended to increase (beta coefficient = 0.954) as human modification increased but richness decreased as human presence increased (beta = -1.054). Human modification was associated with significantly lower functional diversity (mean nearest taxon distance [MNTD], beta = -0.134; standardized effect sizes of MNTD, beta = -0.397), community average body mass (beta = -0.240), and proportion of carnivores (beta = -0.580). Human presence was associated with a strongly reduced proportion of herbivores (beta = -0.522), whereas proportion of omnivores significantly increased as human presence (beta = 0.378) and habitat modification (beta = 0.419) increased. In terms of activity patterns, omnivores (beta = 12.103) and carnivores (beta = 9.368) became more nocturnal in response to human modification. Our results suggest that human modification and human presence have differing effects on mammals and demonstrate that anthropogenic disturbances can lead to drastic loss of functional diversity and result in a shift to nocturnal behavior of mammals. Conservation planning should consider concurrent effects of different types of human disturbance on species richness, functional diversity, and behavior of wildlife communities.

AB  - Do light vertical gradients in temperate forest structure insect herbivore communities? We tested the hypothesis that the increase in light intensity from understory to forest canopy drives differences in leaf physical traits and bud burst phenology that impact insect herbivores and thus play a role in structuring both herbivore communities and the leaf damage they cause. Understanding these interactions is essential for addressing knowledge gaps in the dynamics of temperate deciduous forest ecosystems. Twelve sugar maple (Acer saccharum) sites were monitored in southern Quebec, examining insect herbivore patterns from understory saplings to mature tree-shaded and sun canopy (where intensity is highest and canopy cover lowest) over the summers of 2020, 2021 and 2022. Additionally, we recorded leaf physical traits and sun exposure. Our findings revealed that leaf thickness increased along the vertical gradient in 2021, making mature tree leaves in the canopy less favourable to herbivores than understory sapling leaves. Accordingly, we recorded a consistent decrease in insect herbivory damage rates from understory to shaded and to sun canopy in 2020 and 2021, driven by leaf cutters, skeletonizers, stipplers and leaf miners. These results support our hypothesis that variation in leaf physical traits contributes to the vertical stratification of insect damage. This variation in leaf traits can be linked to light levels or to tree ontogeny. In 2022, the gradient of insect herbivore abundance corroborated the observed damage trends from the previous years. We calculated an average annual herbivory rate of 9.1% of the leaf surface in our study site. Overall, our study highlights the importance of vertical gradients in structuring insect herbivore communities and emphasizes the role of leaf traits in mediating these interactions. In addition, the average annual herbivory rate suggests limited evidence supporting a significant contribution of background herbivory to the decline of sugar maple forests.
   Vertical stratification influences herbivory patterns, with highest damage in understory, followed by shaded and sun canopy leaves. Leaf physical traits vary with light exposure, influencing herbivore damage; thicker, tougher leaves exhibit less damage, especially in sun-exposed canopies. Temporal and spatial gradients in leaf traits contribute to shifts in herbivore communities, highlighting the role of light gradients in structuring herbivory patterns. image

AB  - Large herbivores can profoundly influence terrestrial ecosystems. Through browsing, for example, they can impact forest regeneration with consequences for both plant and animal species. Understanding the drivers of ungulate browsing is therefore crucial from a conservation and management standpoint. Browsing is generally thought to be affected by ungulate density, such that increased density leads to greater browsing probability. As a result, browsing has been suggested as an indicator of ungulate density. While most studies investigated longterm browsing impact of ungulates in single study areas, few of them focused on different spatial scales using multiple replications in time and space. In this study we took advantage of 25 years of browsing data within the Stelvio National Park (central Italian Alps) derived from several populations of red deer and modelled the ratio of browsing on conifers (calculated as browsed conifers divided by total number of conifers) as a function of two different density indices at different spatial scales and a set of environmental covariates. Specifically, we investigated whether variations in red deer density at different spatial scales reflect variations in browsing probability. The results suggest that as deer density increased, the ratio of browsing increased at all spatial scales, at times mediated by shrub species diversity. Density was a consistent driver of browsing probability within all deer populations, while the effect of confounding variables was statistically unclear as they yielded conflicting results for the different populations, failing to find common patterns. This study highlights that density at different spatial scale is an important predictor of browsing probability, suggesting that browsing could be a reliable indicator of variations in ungulate density. In turn, as browsing can map small- and large-scale density variations, pattern of browsing impact may be a useful tool to investigate small- and large-scale changes in red deer densities due to disturbance factors such as human activities or the presence of large predators.

AB  - Soil nematode communities are one of the most used bioindicators for assessing soil health and soil conditions. However, they are dependent on the presence of plants, some of which, known as 'invasive', affect local biodiversity when established. This study aimed to compare the communities of soil nematodes in riverbanks non-invaded and invaded by Fallopia japonica at three sites characterised by different environmental conditions. Our findings indicated that the ecosystem had a larger impact on the nematode communities than did the environmental variability at the study sites. Soil properties, such as pH, moisture content and organic-carbon content, differed significantly amongst the sites, but the nematode communities remained similar. Organic-carbon content was lower, and soil pH was higher, in the ecosystem with invasive F. japonica. Total nematode abundance, the abundances of fungivores, herbivores, omnivores and predators, and the maturity indices were significantly lower with invasive F. japonica. Fungivorous nematodes are essential for breaking down organic matter and releasing nutrients. Herbivorous nematodes respond to changes in the vegetation, and omnivorous and predatory nematodes contribute to the overall biodiversity and ecological balance in the soil ecosystem, so their lower abundance suggests a disturbance in the soil food web. The lower maturity indices suggested a disturbance or degradation of the soil ecosystem, which could have secondary negative effects on plant growth, nutrient availability and ecosystem resilience. These findings indicate that invasion both decreased the abundance of important soil organisms and disrupted the cycling of nutrients, potentially leading to long-term negative consequences for the invaded ecosystems. Understanding and managing the effects of invasive plants such as F. japonica are crucial for preserving soil health and promoting sustainable ecosystem functioning.

AB  - The interplay of disturbance and stability drives vegetation dynamics. Disturbance reduces vegetation biomass, and stability fosters its development. In riparian systems, natural disturbance is largely manifested through flood-driven fluvial processes, but other forms of disturbance, such as herbivory or fire, may influence vegetation dynamics. We studied the successional trajectories of plant communities following a 40-year flood in 2010 that significantly changed floodplain vegetation along the lower Virgin River (southwestern USA). Shortly (0-2 years) after this flood, another large disturbance event of a different nature occurred: extensive defoliation and some mortality of alien Tamarix shrubs (which dominated vegetation cover at that time in the study area) by a biological control beetle. In 2021, we resampled vegetation and topography in 439 plots that we previously monitored in 2010, 2012, 2015, and 2017 along 23 transects across five river reaches. Between 2015 and 2021, stability predominated, with only small floods (1.5- to 3-year) and limited Tamarix defoliation. By 2021, plant communities were converging, but persistent divergences existed and were associated with legacy effects of fluvial disturbance and defoliation. Native Pluchea sericea shrubs had the highest cover across all fluvial landforms. Tamarix partially recovered from defoliation, but only reached similar cover to P. sericea in plots less affected by the 40-year flood. Native Populus fremontii, Prosopis pubescens, and Salix gooddingii trees, and Salix exigua shrubs, remained subordinate. Our study illustrates how successional trajectories in riparian systems depend on the nature and regime of disturbance and its legacy effects on vegetation.

AB  - Relative to their biomass or abundance, keystone species have a disproportionate effect on many other organisms. Common juniper (Juniperus communis) is an evergreen shrub that has significant impacts on microclimate, composition of plant assemblages and herbivorous insects. However, J. communis is currently not considered a keystone species. The present study aims to provide deeper insights into the potential importance of juniper as a keystone species in its two main habitats: calcareous grasslands and heathlands. The response of breeding birds to the occurrence of Common juniper was highly similar in both habitat types. Plots with the presence of J. communis had a higher species richness and density of all and shrub-nesting species than absence plots. Additionally, presence plots exhibited a higher density (calcareous grasslands) or richness (heathlands) of threatened species than absence plots. Overall, the occurrence of scat-tered juniper shrubs boosted species richness and abundance of breeding birds. Responsible for this pattern were (i) the general increase in structural complexity and (ii) two (genuine) prop-erties of the tall, evergreen shrub in particular: dense growth and prickly leaves. Due to the latter, the shrubs provide nesting sites that are strongly sheltered against predation and adverse weather. However, juniper shrubs have also an important function as song posts and perches for hunting. Additionally, the usually scattered distribution of juniper shrubs ensures a maximum territory density in calcareous grasslands and heathlands. Our study provides evidence that J. communis should be considered a keystone species in both habitat types of European conser-vation concern.

AB  - Savannas are the major biome in tropical regions of the globe, defined as sparsely wooded regions with a continuous herbaceous layer of mainly C-4 grasses where rainfall is distinctly seasonal. Fire is a common feature of most savannas. The largest protected areas of savannas are found in sparsely populated monsoonal northcentral Australia with strong annual wet and dry seasons. The most common vegetation type is relatively intact, tall (<15 m), open forests where Eucalyptus canopy trees form the basic structure. Over the past half century, traditional indigenous fire regimes were largely replaced by contemporary fires where individual trees may experience fire as often as 3 out of 5 years. The potential for long-term persistence of the canopy tree populations is an open question. A stage-based population model of the canopy trees was previously developed to address this question, drawing on data from three decades of experimental field studies wherein the survival, growth, and reproduction of individual marked trees were recorded under different seasonal fires and understory types to produce transition matrices among eight life history stages, and used to calculate population growth rates (lambda). Here, we apply that model to determine how lambda varies across a range of fire return intervals from 1 to 12 years for both early and late dry season fires, in two different understory types. We also explore the sensitivity of lambda to two key life history parameters: recruitment and seedling survival. Minimum fire return intervals of 2-5 years were generally required for lambda >= 1 that would allow populations to persist; these were shorter with stochastic year-to-year timing of fires and with higher recruitment rates. Uniquely, under certain conditions, there was also a maximum fire return interval above which lambda <1, creating a "window" of fire return intervals that allowed canopy tree populations to persist. Mechanisms underpinning results as well as implications for savanna structure, alternate states, cyclical dynamics, future research, and management by fire are discussed.

AB  - Fire and herbivory are major drivers in tropical savanna ecosystems and they selected a flora composed of species able to cope with recurrent aboveground biomass removal. Renewal of the herbaceous stratum is made possible by resprouting, mostly through a belowground bud bank. Evaluating the impacts of disturbances on the bud bank can assist in predicting post-disturbance responses and system resilience. In a semi-arid savanna, we aimed to verify whether lower fire frequency, fire and herbivory exclusion could affect belowground bud bank and organs diversity and consequently, the resprouting potential. Lower fire frequency or suppression and absence of herbivory were expected to reduce the bud bank density, which was confirmed by our results. If the fire is suppressed or fire frequency is reduced, the total, graminoid and the shrub bud bank decreased, whereas herbivory exclusion resulted in total and a forb bud bank of lower densities. Belowground buds were identified in non-woody and woody rhizomes, stolons, root crowns, and bulbs or corms. Despite having bud banks of lower density, disturbance exclusion promoted belowground biomass accumulation. Our results indicated the importance of maintaining the endogenous disturbances to the preservation of the belowground community and regeneration strategy, guaranteeing resilience in semi-arid savanna communities.

AB  - The Asiatic ibex (Capra sibirica), the largest member of the genus Capra, is widely distributed in Central and South Asia. It is a primitive ibex species of the family Bovidae that is distinct from other ibex species. The Asiatic ibex is native to highland landscapes characterized by challenging terrains that have resulted in incomplete knowledge of this species. To understand the research advances in this species, this review summarizes the taxonomic position, global distribution, population size, foraging ecology, sexual segregation, health threat by diseases, and potential threats and conservation biology. Besides, this species is facing increasing impacts of anthropogenic activities and habitat loss induced by global climate change. It also proposes new research perspectives and priorities to understand the advanced ecology of the Asiatic ibex. We also highlight a suite of research gaps that require multidisciplinary approaches. These will increase understanding of the evolution, biology, ecology, and epidemiology of this species.

AB  - The diet of fossil herbivores inferred from enamel stable carbon isotopes is often used to make paleoenvironmental reconstructions. While many studies have focused on using environmental indicator taxa to make paleoenvironmental reconstructions, community-based approaches are considered to provide a more complete picture of paleolandscapes. These studies assume that the diet and relative abundance of herbivores are related to the areal extent of different vegetation types on the landscape. Here, we quantitatively test this assumption in 16 modern ecosystems in eastern and southern Africa with a wide range of woody vegetation cover. We conducted a landscape-level spatial analysis of vegetation patterns using a published land cover data set and computed landscape metrics. We compiled data on relative abundance and diet of herbivores inferred from carbon isotope studies for all large herbivores in these ecosystems. We found that despite differences in the total areal extent of different vegetation types, numerous sizable patches of each vegetation type are available in most ecosystems. However, despite variation across the ecosystems examined, grazers are typically the most abundant herbivores even in sites that have a higher proportion of forest and shrub cover. This indicates that the diet and relative abundance of herbivores is not a simple reflection of the total areal extent of vegetation types available on the landscape. The higher proportion of grazers observed in these ecosystems is a result of multiple factors including habitat heterogeneity, differences in biomass turnover rate between grasses and woody vegetation, resource partitioning, and the advantages of group living in open environments. Comparison of diet and relative abundance of herbivores in modern ecosystems to fossil herbivore assemblages shows that very different vegetation regimes can support similar herbivore assemblages. This study has significant implications for paleolandscape reconstructions and cautions against a simplistic wooded vs. grassland paleoenvironmental interpretations based on fossil herbivore assemblages.

AB  - Grazing contributes substantially to grassland degradation worldwide and may alter soil biota and function. However, the effects of grassland type, grazing intensity and duration, and livestock type on soil nematodes are not fully understood. Here, we compiled 783 pair-wise comparisons from 28 publications to better understand the pattern and underlying mechanisms of soil nematodes responses to grazing. Grazing significantly decreased the abundance of bacterial-feeding and omnivorous-predatory nematodes but had no effect on diversity (e.g. generic richness) and ecological indices (e.g. maturity index and plant-parasitic index). Grazing effects on soil nematodes varied strongly by grassland type, grazing intensity and duration, and livestock type. Grazing decreased bacterial-feeding nematodes in steppe. In meadow, grazing increased plant-feeding nematodes and reduced nematode diversity. The abundance of bacterial-feeding and fungal-feeding nematodes significantly decreased in long-term grazing (>10 years). Light grazing increased fungal-feeding nematodes and maturity index. Heavy grazing decreased total nematode abundance, the abundance of all trophic groups except plant-feeding nematodes and the enrichment index. Sheep grazing produced a stronger negative response than cattle grazing on the abundance of bacterial-feeding and omnivorous-predatory nematodes, Shannon-Wiener index and enrichment index. Environment factors and soil properties influenced the grazing effects on nematode abundance. Our results showed that the grazing effects on nematode abundance were well explained by pH and soil organic carbon. Synthesis and applications. Our findings highlight that grazing effects on soil nematodes are context-specific. As the contribution of soil nematodes to grassland management and ecosystem functions, we propose that policymakers should consider devising local-scale grazing strategies for conserving soil biota and the functions of soil food webs.

AB  - Understanding how primary productivity and diversity affect secondary productivity is an important debate in ecology with implications for biodiversity conservation. Particularly, how plant diversity influences arthropod diversity contributes to our understanding of trophic cascades and species coexistence. Previous studies show a positive correlation between plant and arthropod diversity. The theory of associational resistance suggests that plant herbivory rate will decrease with increasing plant diversity indicating feedbacks between primary diversity, productivity, and secondary productivity rates. However, our understanding of how these relations are mediated by anthropogenic disturbance is still limited. We surveyed 10 forest sites, half of which are disturbed by fire, logging, and tree pruning, distributed in two climatic zones in Benin, West Africa. We established 100 transects to record plant species and sampled arthropods using pitfall traps, ceramic plates with bait, and sweeping nets. We developed a structural equation model to test the mediating effect of chronic anthropogenic disturbance on plant diversity and how it influences arthropod diversity and abundance. Arthropod diversity increased but arthropod abundance decreased with increasing intensity of disturbance. We found no significant bottom-up influence of the plant diversity on arthropod diversity but a significant plant diversity-arthropod abundance relationship. Some arthropod guilds were significantly affected by plant diversity. Finally, herbivory rates were positively associated with arthropod diversity. Synthesis. Our results highlight how chronic anthropogenic disturbance can mediate the functional links between trophic levels in terms of diversity and productivity. Our study demonstrated a decoupled response of arthropod diversity and abundance to disturbance. The direct positive influence of plant diversity on herbivory rates we found in our study provides counter-support for the theory of associational resistance.
   How plant diversity influences arthropod diversity contributes to our understanding of trophic cascades and species coexistence. This relationship can be altered by disturbance. We showed that the bottom-up effect of plant diversity on arthropod diversity and abundance can be decoupled, whereby plant diversity affects arthropod abundance without altering their diversity.image

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances degrade ecosystems, elevating the risk of emerging infectious diseases from wildlife. However, the key environmental factors for preventing tick-borne disease infection in relation to host species, landscape components, and climate conditions remain unknown. This study focuses on identifying crucial environmental factors contributing to the outbreak of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), a tick-borne disease, in Miyazaki Prefecture, southern Japan. We collected data on SFTS case numbers, annual temperature and precipitation, species richness of large- and middle-sized mammals, forest perimeter length (indicating the amount of forest boundaries), percentage of agricultural land, human population, and sightseeing place numbers for each 25 km2 grid cell encompassing Miyazaki Prefecture. Through the construction of a model incorporating these factors, we found that longer forest perimeter and higher temperature led to a higher number of SFTS cases. Precipitation, mammal species richness, percentage of agricultural land, human population, and sightseeing point numbers had no effect on SFTS case numbers. In conclusion, climate condition and forest fragmentation, which increase the opportunity for human infection, played a pivotal role in SFTS outbreak.

AB  - <ol><li>Rapid vegetation establishment is an important goal for many freshwater wetland, coastal and terrestrial restoration projects. To accelerate the restoration process, managers often introduce target plant species, potentially generating priority effects that can lead to either divergence or convergence of community compositions over time, depending on the local biotic and abiotic conditions. These alternative trajectories pose the question of whether active restoration by initial steering of plant community composition results in a different long-term community assembly when compared to restoration via natural development.</li><li>Here, we tested vegetation development subject to active restoration or natural development strategies with plant introduction and protection against herbivory by geese (Anser anser). This was facilitated by a 1300 ha restoration project in which new, bare wetland habitat was created from soft sediments ("Marker Wadden", the Netherlands). We studied vegetation cover, plant community composition and soil elevation in a full-factorial experiment under grazed, ungrazed, planted and unplanted conditions for 6 years.</li><li>Without herbivory by geese, the planting of reed (Phragmites australis) accelerated vegetation establishment and resulted in greater vegetation cover. However, cover was dominated by reed, and plant diversity remained low. With herbivory, grazing on reed increased plant diversity. With herbivory and without reed planting, vegetation established slower. However, after 6 years, plant cover became similar to the treatment with planted reed rhizomes in the absence of herbivory-albeit with higher plant community diversity. Across all treatments, locations with higher vegetation cover decelerated soil subsidence, which maintained important abiotic conditions for the developing food web.</li><li>Synthesis and applications: Active steering of wetland restoration by introducing target species and preventing herbivory accelerated vegetation development, while natural development took longer. However, natural development resulted in more diverse plant community compositions over time. These results imply that restoration projects face a trade-off between actively stimulating vegetation cover to facilitate food web development and prevent soil subsidence, or waiting for more diverse plant communities to develop naturally.</li> </ol>

AB  - The populations of the endangered mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), which inhabit large parts of Israel, across various ecosystems and climatic conditions, shrunk drastically over the last decades. To date, data on gazelle nutrition, how these relate with individual characteristics and respond to seasonal and environmental changes, have not been available. We analyzed 110 samples from gazelle rumen contents collected throughout the country from occasional fatalities, mainly roadkills, and tested the feasibility of using them for near-infrared spectrometry (NIRS) calibrations. Although NIR calibrations for crude protein, in vitro dry matter digestibility, and ash were reasonable, we found that using calibrations based on local forage and feed plant species performed better, and used these to estimate several nutritional constituents in gazelle rumens, using NIRS. We tested how constituents relate to the sex, age-class, and weight of the individual gazelle, and to season and ecosystem type, and found that season plays a major role in gazelle nutrition. Winter is the most propitious season, when crude protein, ash and digestibility are highest, and acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio are lowest. Autumn, being the harshest season, mirrors winter conditions, and summer and spring show intermediate levels. Yet the relative changes between seasons were mild: about 30%, for crude protein, digestibility, and ash, and 14-22% for ADF, NDF, and C:N ratio. Ecosystem type affected several constituents, and nutrition was slightly better in Mediterranean than in dry ecosystems. Gazelle sex, weight, and age-class had minor effects on nutrition. Overall, it seems that the adaptation of gazelles to their environment is germane to keeping relatively steady nutrition throughout the year. Our results, which do not show a dramatic decline in the quality of gazelle nutrition during any season or among the climatic regions that were studied, suggest that nutrition is not a major driver of the survival of gazelles in the populations surveyed.

AB  - AimPredicting biodiversity responses to global changes requires good models of species distributions. Both environmental conditions and human activities determine population density patterns. However, quantifying the relationship between wildlife population densities and their underlying environmental conditions across large geographical scales has remained challenging. Our goal was to explain the abundances of mammal species based on their response to several remotely sensed indices including the Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs) and the novel Winter Habitat Indices (WHIs). LocationRussia, the majority of regions. TaxonEight mammal species. MethodsWe estimated average population densities for each species across Russia from 1981 to 2010 from winter track counts. The DHIs measure vegetative productivity, a proxy for food availability. Our WHIs included the duration of snow-free ground, duration of snow-covered ground and the start, end and length of frozen season. In models, we included elevation, climate conditions, human footprint index. We parameterized multiple linear regression and applied best-subset model selection to determine the main factors influencing population density. ResultsThe DHIs were included in some of the top-twelve models of every species, and in the top model for moose, wild boar, red fox and wolf, so they were important for species at all trophic levels. The WHIs were included in top models for all species except roe deer, demonstrating the importance of winter conditions. The duration of frozen ground without snow and the end of frozen season were particularly important. Our top models performed well for all the species (R-adj(2) 0.43-0.87). Main ConclusionsThe combination of the DHIs and the WHIs with climate and human-related variables resulted in high explanatory power. We show that vegetation productivity and winter conditions are key drivers of variation in population density of eight species across Russia.

AB  - Studies on the impacts of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter deer) herbivory on vegetation biomass and nutritional availability are limited. Considering deer can shift plant species composition and abundance through selective browsing, we sought to investigate whether deer could influence their own nutritional carrying capacity. Using paired control and exclosure experimental units constructed in 2000 on three Wildlife Management Areas in the Upper Coastal Plain, Lower Coastal Plain, and Mississippi Alluvial Valley (hereafter Delta) ecoregions of Mississippi, we collected biomass samples following methods initially used on the sites in 2005. Biomass data were collected during July - August of 2021 at 15 random sampling points per experimental unit. Additionally, representative samples of each plant species were collected and analyzed for crude protein content to determine nutritional carrying capacity. By analyzing biomass data from 2005 and 2021, we found between-year differences, but no differences by treatment (exclosure vs. control). Notably, there was a simultaneous increase in shade tolerant species and decrease in shade intolerant species from 2005 to 2021, and a decrease in preferred forage species. Nutritional carrying capacity was only determined using 2021 data and revealed a lack of treatment effects. The differences between ecoregions demonstrated abundant low quality forage on both Coastal Plain sites (Upper and Lower) and a comparatively low amount of forage that was higher in quality in the Delta. Results suggest changing understory light conditions and a need for additional management if increasing available forage for deer is a desired management outcome. Specifically, regional differences in nutritional availability between the Coastal Plain sites and the Delta site illustrate the potential for active management to aid in the promotion of herbaceous understory forage species.

AB  - With rapid global change, the frequency and severity of extreme disturbance events are increasing worldwide. The ability of animal populations to survive these stochastic events depends on how individual animals respond to their altered environments, yet our understanding of the immediate and short-term behavioral responses of animals to acute disturbances remains poor. We focused on animal behavioral responses to the environmental disturbance created by megafire. Specifically, we explored the effects of the 2018 Mendocino Complex Fire in northern California, USA, on the behavior and body condition of black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus). We predicted that deer would be displaced by the disturbance or experience high mortality post-fire if they stayed in the burn area. We used data from GPS collars on 18 individual deer to quantify patterns of home range use, movement, and habitat selection before and after the fire. We assessed changes in body condition using images from a camera trap grid. The fire burned through half of the study area, facilitating a comparison between deer in burned and unburned areas. Despite a dramatic reduction in vegetation in burned areas, deer showed high site fidelity to pre-fire home ranges, returning within hours of the fire. However, mean home range size doubled after the fire and corresponded to increased daily activity in a severely resource-depleted environment. Within their home ranges, deer also selected strongly for patches of surviving vegetation and woodland habitat, as these areas provided forage and cover in an otherwise desolate landscape. Deer body condition significantly decreased after the fire, likely as a result of a reduction in forage within their home ranges, but all collared deer survived for the duration of the study. Understanding the ways in which large mammals respond to disturbances such as wildfire is increasingly important as the extent and severity of such events increases across the world. While many animals are adapted to disturbance regimes, species that exhibit high site fidelity or otherwise fixed behavioral strategies may struggle to cope with increased climate instability and associated extreme disturbance events.

AB  - Humans arrived in the Patagonia region of southern South America in the late Pleistocene period, ca. 15,000 years ago. A few centuries later, during a period of rapid warming, the megafauna went extinct in Patagonia, as well as some smaller species, like the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), in the southern portion of the region. As in other regions, extinctions probably occurred due to a combination of effects of climate and direct and indirect impacts of humans on wildlife communities. We reviewed recent archeological and genetic-based discoveries about numbers and distributions of humans and wildlife and their early interactions and used them to draw lessons for current debates among managers and scientists. Recent discoveries, for example, help us understand (1) the population limitation mechanisms and other interactions involving guanacos, livestock, forage, predators, and scavengers; (2) the magnitude of wildlife movements and the need for landscape-level planning for conservation; (3) the importance of indirect effects of human activities on wildlife communities; and (4) the compounded effects of human activities and climate change on wildlife. We believe these lessons drawn from deep time and recent history can help define new priorities for research and management and inform our conservation vision for the 21st century, a period when dramatic climate change impacts will add challenges to a region subject to a century of overgrazing and other anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - Unplanned urban development has consequences for natural ecosystems, resulting in habitat fragmentation and loss. Arthropod responses to urbanisation are well documented in the Global North, but no clear responses are found for the Global South. We assessed beta diversity, composition, richness and abundance responses of arthropods in Turnera subulata in an urbanisation gradient. Urbanisation affected arthropod communities' composition, and more urbanised areas showed lower insect richness and abundance. Arthropod taxa did not respond homogeneously to urbanisation. Turnover best explained the change in beta diversity along the urbanisation gradient, indicating urbanisation causes species replacement compared to less urbanised areas. We found negative results of urbanisation on the arthropod community on flowers of T. subulata. Our results are a first approximation to the effects of rural-urban gradient of urbanisation on multiple arthropod taxon in Brazil, highlighting the need for maintenance of urban green areas to allow the existence of a richer and more diverse community, especially in the face of the arthropod biodiversity crisis that we are experiencing.
   We investigated the beta diversity, composition, richness and abundance of arthropod communities on flowers of a widely ruderal species native to Brazil in response to urbanisation. Structure of arthropod communities was affected by urbanisation, and more urbanised areas showed lower arthropod richness and abundance, but arthropod taxa did not respond homogeneously to urbanisation. Turnover best explained the change in diversity along the urbanisation gradient, indicating urbanisation causes species replacement compared to less urbanised areas. image

AB  - Halting biological invasions and rewilding extirpated native fauna are conservation interventions to bolster biodiversity, species interactions, and ecosystems. These actions are often considered separately and the potential for reintroduced wildlife to facilitate invasive plants has been largely overlooked. Here, we investigated the role of Singapore's recolonizing native wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in facilitating an invasive weed Miconia crenata into tropical rainforests, which are normally highly resistant to invasion. We conducted line-transect surveys in 11 Singaporean rain forests and used generalized linear mixed models to consider the contribution of pigs' soil disturbances, human forest paths, and other environmental covariates, on the density of M. crenata. We found that M. crenata was more abundant at forest edges and invasion into forest interior was facilitated by pigs, paths, and canopy gaps, but that these effects were all additive, not synergistic (i.e., not multiplicative). These results highlight how modern invasions are driven by multiple disturbances as well as propagule pressure (e.g., urban birds dispersing seeds at forest edges where they establish in pig soil disturbances). Singapore's extensive native forest restoration efforts may have provided plentiful edge and secondary forests that are well suited to pigs and M. crenata, which in turn undermine the aims of fostering later-successional native plant communities. To prevent negative externalities, we suggest that plant restoration and rewilding projects consider the potential role of wildlife in facilitating non-native plants, and couple these actions with preliminary screening of unintended consequences and continued monitoring, as well as limiting human-mediated weed invasion to minimize propagule sources.

AB  - Tree stocking and the associated canopy closure in production forests is often greater than optimal for wildlife that require an open canopy and the associated understory plant community. Although mid-rotation treatments such as thinning can reduce canopy closure and return sunlight to the forest floor, stimulating understory vegetation, wildlife-focused thinning prescriptions often involve thinning stands to lower tree densities than are typically prescribed for commercial logging operations. Therefore, we quantified the accuracy and precision with which commercial logging crews thinned pre-marked and unmarked mid-rotation loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stands to residual basal areas of 9 (low), 14 (medium), and 18 (high) m(2)/ha. Following harvest, observed basal areas were 3.36, 1.58, and 0.6 m(2)/ha below target basal areas for the high, medium, and low basal area treatments, respectively. Pre-marking stands increased precision, but not accuracy, of thinning operations. We believe the thinning outcomes we observed are sufficient to achieve wildlife objectives in production forests, and that the added expense associated with pre-marking stands to achieve wildlife objectives in production forests depends on focal wildlife species and management objectives.

AB  - Context. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) are a species of social, economic and cultural importance that are experiencing a population decline throughout much of their range. Factors such as disease, landscape-level changes in nutritional output of forage species, winter habitat degradation, habitat fragmentation, competition for resources with both domestic and wild ungulates, and predation have all been implicated in the decline. Recently, summer habitat quality in Oregon has been identified as a potentially strong limiting factor for mule deer population performance. Competition and habitat degradation from feral horses (Equus caballus) have been proposed as factors potentially exacerbating existing habitat limitations for mule deer.Aims. The aim of this study was to investigate factors affecting mule deer summer range occupancy within a study area that experienced both wildfires and the presence of feral horses.Methods. We deployed 72, 77 and 75 camera traps throughout the Murderers Creek and Northside wildlife management units located in north-eastern Oregon during summer 2019, 2020 and 2021 respectively. We used an occupancy modelling framework to build and evaluate models of mule deer summer range occupancy related to competition, vegetation and abiotic variables.Key results. Our final model set included four covariates: (1) an index of feral horse use; (2) whether the site was disturbed by wildfire; (3) distance to forest edge; and (4) eastness of the site. Model averaging indicated that mule deer probability of occupancy was negatively related with increased feral horse use and distance to forest edge, and positively related to eastern slopes and sites within a wildfire perimeter.Conclusions. Our results add to the growing body of literature indicating that wildfires in forested ecosystems benefit mule deer and add to the limited body of literature indicating that feral horse use of a site negatively impacts mule deer.Implications. Managers should incorporate fire into forest restoration projects when possible to benefit mule deer. Where feral horses and mule deer overlap, increased management of feral horse herds could potentially benefit mule deer. Lastly, our research showcases the utility of camera traps coupled with occupancy modelling to answer research questions that, in the past, were mainly answered through radio collaring.

AB  - During deep snow conditions, wildlife must balance between minimizing movements to conserve energy while seeking high amounts of browse to gain the energy. Knowledge of how snow begins to hinder their movements is therefore vital when predicting their wintertime behavior. We assessed the phenomenon with moose. Movement data from 122 GPS-collared moose were integrated with snow depth data from designated measurement stations. The effects of increasing snow depths on moose movement rates were then modeled with spline regression. The study was conducted in Finland, between 2009 and 2011. The moose were known for their sex and for the presence of calf at heel. On average, the movement rates decreased sharply until snow depths of ca. 30-40 cm, after which further significant decreases were not seen. The movement rates decreased from several kilometers per day to less than 500 m per day. Moose in the northernmost study area with the deepest snow covers moved as much as the moose in the other areas with less snow. Although we saw differences in the movement rates between males and females, differences between individuals were markedly higher than those caused by sex or a calf at heel. Moose are keystone species whose heavy browsing, especially during winter, can have profound effects on vegetation and forest regeneration. As snow covers in large parts of the boreal zone are predicted to decrease due to warming climate, the wintertime movements of moose and how they affect the local vegetation will remain relevant questions.

AB  - Trade-offs between reproductive effort and subsequent growth in males are not well explored, despite their relevance in questions of individual energy allocation. Regarding the growth of sexual secondary characters in polygynous breeding male mammals, indeed, no conclusive studies exist. We investigated in male Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) the relationship between their behavioral reproductive effort, current horn size, and subsequent horn growth. While controlling for age, no evidence was found for male behavioral reproductive effort during the rut being affected by their horn size. On the other hand, reproductive effort significantly decreased age-specific horn growth during the following summer. Our study provides evidence that growth of secondary sexual characters is traded against behavioral investments in reproduction in a male mammal. It bears important implications for the understanding of energy allocation between various life-history components and the evolutionary ecology of secondary sexual characters.

AB  - Populations of large mammals have declined at alarming rates, especially in areas with intensified land use where species can only persist in small habitat fragments. To support conservation planning, we developed habitat suitability models for the Walia ibex (Capra walie), an endangered wild goat endemic to the Simen Mountains, Ethiopia. We calibrated several models that differ in statistical properties to estimate the spatial extent of suitable habitats of the Walia ibex in the Simen Mountains, as well as in other parts of the Ethiopian highlands to assess potentially suitable areas outside the current distribution range of the species. We further addressed the potential consequences of future climate change using a climate model with four emission scenarios. Model projections estimated the potential suitable habitat under current climate to 501-672 km(2) in Simen and 6,251-7,732 km(2) in other Ethiopian mountains. Under projected climate change by 2,080, the suitable habitat became larger in Simen but smaller in other parts of Ethiopia. The projected expansion in Simen is contrary to the general expectation of shrinking suitable habitats for high-elevation species under climate warming and may partly be due to the ruggedness of these particular mountains. The Walia ibex has a wide altitudinal range and is able to exploit very steep slopes, allowing it to track the expected vegetation shift to higher altitudes. However, this potential positive impact may not last long under continued climate warming, as the species will not have much more new space left to colonize. Our study indicates that the current distribution range can be substantially increased by reintroducing and/or translocating the species to other areas with suitable habitat. Indeed, to increase the viability and prospects for survival of this flagship species, we strongly recommend human-assisted reintroduction to other Ethiopian mountains. Emulating the successful reintroduction of the Alpine ibex that has spread from a single mountain in Italy to its historical ranges of the Alps in Europe might contribute to saving the Walia ibex from extinction.

AB  - While human-driven biological invasions are rapidly spreading, finding scalable and effective control methods poses an unresolved challenge. Here, we assess whether megaherbivores-herbivores reaching & GE;1,000 kg of body mass-offer a nature-based solution to plant invasions. Invasive plants are generally adapted to maximize vegetative growth. Megaherbivores, with broad dietary tolerances, could remove large biomass of established plants, facilitating new plant growth. We used a massive dataset obtained from 26,838 camera stations and 158,979 vegetation plots to assess the relationships between megaherbivores, native plants and alien plants across India (similar to 121,330 km(2)). We found a positive relationship between megaherbivore abundance and native plant richness and abundance, and a concomitant reduction in alien plant abundance. This relationship was strongest in protected areas with midproductive ecosystem and high megaherbivore density but it was lost in areas where thicket-forming alien plants predominated (>40% cover). By incorporating the role of ecosystem productivity, plants traits and densities of megaherbivores on megaherbivore-vegetation relationships, our study highlights a function of megaherbivores in controlling alien plant proliferation and facilitating diverse native plants in invaded ecosystems. The study shows great potential for megafauna-based trophic rewilding as a nature-based solution to counteract dominance of plant invasions.

AB  - Seed predation may reduce the quantity and diversity of seeds and limit seedling recruitment. However, the extent to which seed predation may depend on the species and vegetational microhabitat has been less studied. We studied seed predation of woody species in the Mediterranean-type ecosystem of central Chile. We explored if interspecific differences in the magnitude of seed predation depends on the seed mass, evaluated the role vertebrate herbivores in seed predation, and examined if seed predation depends on the vegetation patch type. We conducted a seed removal experiment with eight woody species in three vegetation patch types (forest, shrub, and open) and replicated in two localities. We established exclosures for birds and mammals (wire cages covering 1 m2) and evaluated seed removal during 18 days within and outside of them. We also evaluated the soil seed availability by collecting soil samples inside and outside these exclosures after 2 years of exclusion in the same vegetation patches, adding other three localities. Exclosures significantly reduced the number of seeds removed in all species and patch types of both localities (overall 24.02% of removal in non-exclusion areas vs. 1.77% in exclosures). The magnitude of seed predation was negatively related to the seed mass of species. Exclosures significantly increased the number and species richness of seeds in the soil of forest and shrub patches of four localities. The results suggest that seed predation is mainly produced by vertebrates, affects several woody species from central Chile, and is more common in forest and shrub patches.

AB  - The past century witnessed a dramatic increase in deer abundance in North America, Western Europe, and Japan, that triggered profound changes in the vegetation structure of temperate forests. Considering the effects large herbivores can have on soil properties and organisms, it is likely that such increased deer abundance will have consequences belowground. Current studies in temperate forests, however, found inconsistent results regarding the effect of deer on soils within, and across, ecosystems. These inconsistencies may be the result of a timedependent response of the soil to deer presence. Short-term belowground modifications may reflect the direct interactions of deer on soil (i.e. trampling and waste deposition), while long-term belowground modifications may reflect both direct and indirect effects of deer on soil (e.g. through vegetation shifts). To test these ideas, we measured the effects of deer on soil properties and prokaryotic communities in the temperate forests of Haida Gwaii, Canada. We compared three complementary systems varying in duration of deer presence or exclusion, so as to be able to assess the short- (before and after a deer cull), intermediate- (inside vs. outside deer exclosures) and long- (comparing islands with and without deer) term effects of deer, respectively. We found no change in soil physical and chemical properties and in prokaryotic community structure after one year of deer removal. Twenty years of deer exclusion significantly reduced soil compaction but had no effect on soil prokaryotic community structure. Over 70 years of deer presence significantly correlated with: increased soil compaction, reduced total soil phosphorus content and soil prokaryotic diversity, and modified soil prokaryotic community structure and composition. Such effects of deer on the soil may have consequences for nutrient cycling. Revealing the belowground effects of deer in temperate forests, therefore, requires long-term studies, longer than most of those currently available in the literature.

AB  - Large wild herbivores are important and natural components of forest ecosystems, but through their browsing activities have the potential to influence the structure and composition of forest communities, thus timber production and ecosystem dynamics. To examine the effects of browsing by wild herbivores on a young post-disturbance forest in the Kysuce region of northwestern Slovakia, we established two sets of 2 m radius plots, 15 within a fenced area (5.12 ha) that excluded large wild herbivores, and 15 within an adjacent unfenced area. In each plot, we recorded the species, tree height, stem base diameter, and mutual geographic positions of trees. When we compared tree community characteristics between the unfenced and fenced plots, we found fewer and smaller broadleaved tree species, except silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) in the unfenced plots. Although common rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) was the dominant species within fenced plots, where some individuals were over 6.0 m tall, this species was rare outside the fenced area and usually did not exceed 1.5 m. In contrast, Norway spruce (Picea abies Karts L.) was more abundant and taller within the unfenced area, likely released from competition by suppression of broadleaved trees by herbivores. In addition, fenced plots also showed twice the tree species richness (Shannon index) of unfenced ones. Despite changes in tree communities, total aboveground biomass stock was only slightly but significantly lower in the unfenced than the fenced plots (29.6 kg per 10 m(2) vs. 33.5 kg per 10 m(2)). Our study suggested that browsing pressure by large wild herbivores that focused on most broadleaved trees weakened interspecies competition and allowed the expansion of Norway spruce. As a consequence, converting spruce monocultures to mixed species stands is likely unrealistic when faced with heavy browsing pressure by wild large herbivores.

AB  - Forest soils are shaped by various processes, like runoff, erosion, sedimentation and bioturbation. A better understanding of the interactions between abiotic and biotic soil-forming processes, including wild boar (Sus scrofa) rooting (i.e., subsurface foraging), enhances adequate management of forest ecosystems. We hypothesized that intense soil sedimentation influences wild boar rooting occurrence and that wild boars modify the outcome of the sedimentation process by redistributing soil layers. This study was conducted in the Babat Valley, Hungary. We estimated the availability of sedimented and non-sedimented patches and the occurrence of boar rooting. Surveys and samplings were done along transects, over consecutive months, where the impact of rooting on the physical and chemical characteristics of soil was measured by comparing them between control and rooted sites. We found that non-sedimented, steep areas were preferred areas for rooting. Sedimentation processes have a higher impact on soil chemical characteristics and soil layer composition than wild boar rooting. We conclude that mitigation of soil degradation can be more effective by reducing adverse abiotic processes rather than wild boar population control.

AB  - Globally, the conservation value of tropical grasslands, unlike tropical forests, is underappreciated, and their degradation is widespread. Conservation of this vulnerable ecosystem requires scientifically validated management strategies. The present study examines the impact of flooding, herbivory, and other management practices on the riverine grasslands of Brahmaputra floodplains of Assam, India, for devising effective conservation strategies. Inundation period-based unsupervised classification was used to derive the types and extent of grasslands viz., short (SG) and tall (TG). Subsequently, the data on vegetation composition and nutrient status viz., soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), was collected from inside and outside of 15 exclosures that were subjected to different management regimes, including grazing (freely accessed by mega- and meso-herbivores), ungrazed (not accessed by mega- and meso-herbivores), ungrazed with controlled burning and ungrazed with invasive removal. A total of 1152 plots were monitored for two-year, from January 2014 to December 2015. The results of the study revealed that the areas inundated for a longer duration were dominated by SG and had higher species diversity, while areas inundated for the shorter duration were dominated by TG and had low species diversity. We further observed that grazing exclusion promoted heterogeneity, woody and invasive growth, and soil nutrient content. Burning and invasive removal reduced woody and invasive growth and enhanced soil nutrient conditions. Grazing and burning decreased heterogeneity, while invasive removal increased heterogeneity. Alteration of the flooding regime due to reduced water availability may affect the ratio of SG and TG extent in the long run, which may alter the vegetation composition and the productivity of these grasslands. We recommend short-term rotational grazing for SG and long-term for TG to promote heterogeneity and soil quality. Controlled burning can be carried out in dry and invaded areas post uprooting of invasives to mitigate the effect of succession.

AB  - In ungulate assemblages, although interspecific differences in body size and gregariousness are thought to have a direct impact on winning or losing in interference competition, this has not been fully investigated. We observed a total of 64 instances of interspecific contact between larger -gregarious sika deer and smaller-solitary Japanese serows over eight years field observations. Deer-to-serow aggression were never observed. Whereas, serows showed antagonistic behaviour, such as walk push and chasing, to deer, but could rarely displace deer. Serows showed higher alertness to deer than deer did to serows. These results suggest that larger-gregarious ungulates do not necessarily exclude smaller-solitary ones and serows are sensitive to the presence of deer. Differences in aggressiveness and alertness between deer and serows may reflect differences in territoriality: serows may be more sensitive to the invasion of deer into their territory. Serows' sensitivity to deer may have a negative effect on their population.

AB  - 1. Freshwater megafauna species (i.e., animals that can reach a body mass >= 30 kg, including fish, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians) play important roles in freshwater systems (e.g., by influencing habitat structure, trophic dynamics, or the dispersal of smaller species). As they tend to be large and charismatic, they may also function as flagship umbrella species in future freshwater conservation initiatives. Despite this, as a group they are highly threatened, and our knowledge of the nature of these threats is limited. In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of the impacts of alien species on native freshwater megafauna.2. We undertook the first global assessment of the impacts of alien species on native freshwater megafauna using the Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) framework. We conducted a literature review to identify published and grey literature on impacts, which we quantified and categorised by their severity and type, following the EICAT guidelines.3. Negative impacts on native freshwater megafauna were caused by 61 alien species from a diverse range of taxonomic groups, including both freshwater and terrestrial alien species, and both vertebrates and invertebrates. They adversely affected 44 of 216 native freshwater megafauna species, including amphibians, fish, mammals, and reptiles. The Great Lakes Basin had the highest number of affected megafauna species (six of the 14 freshwater megafauna species it supports, mainly fish). Impacts occurred through a broad range of mechanisms (10 of the 12 identified mechanisms under EICAT); predation and competition were the most frequently reported mechanisms. Some impacts were relatively minor, adversely affecting the performance of individuals of native freshwater megafauna species. However, some reported impacts did cause declining populations of native freshwater megafauna species, and one impact contributed to the local extinction of the ship sturgeon (Acipenser nudiventris) in the Aral Sea. The vulnerability of native freshwater megafauna species to different types of impact varies during different life-cycle stages (egg, juvenile, and adult).4. Our understanding of impacts posed by alien species on native freshwater megafauna is limited because data are unavailable for many regions, particularly the Global South, including hotspots for freshwater megafauna diversity such as the Amazon, Congo, Mekong, and Ganges-Brahmaputra basins. Freshwater megafauna species are often subject to multiple threats, which makes it difficult to determine the significance of alien species impacts relative to other threats such as habitat degradation and overexploitation. In addition, short-term studies are likely to be masking the severity of the impacts identified. We call for more long-term studies that attempt to identify population-level impacts, and for studies that identify impacts in data-deficient regions.5. The EICAT assessments undertaken for this study will be reviewed by the EICAT Authority and subsequently incorporated into the IUCN EICAT database. They may be used to guide future research and conservation actions.

AB  - The 'landscape of fear' concept offers valuable insights into wildlife behaviour, yet its practical integration into habitat management for conservation remains underexplored. In this study, conducted in the subtropical monsoon grasslands of Bardia National Park, Nepal, we aimed to bridge this gap through a multi-year, landscape-scale experimental investigation in Bardia National Park, Nepal. The park has the highest density of tigers (with an estimated density of similar to 7 individuals per 100 km(2)) in Nepal, allowing us to understand the effect of habitat management on predation risk and resource availability especially for three cervid species: chital (Axis axis), swamp deer (Rucervus duvaucelii) and hog deer (Axis porcinus). We used plots with varying mowing frequency (0-4 times per year), size (ranging from small: 49 m(2) to large: 3600 m(2)) and artificial fertilisation type (none, phosphorus, nitrogen) to assess the trade-offs between probable predation risk and resources for these cervid species, which constitute primary prey for tigers in Nepal. Our results showed distinct responses of these deer to perceived predation risk within grassland habitats. Notably, these deer exhibited heightened use of larger plots, indicative of a perceived sense of safety, as evidenced by the higher occurrence of pellet groups in the larger plots (mean = 0.1 pellet groups m(-2) in 3600 m(2) plots vs. 0.07 in 400 m(2) and 0.05 in 49 m(2) plots). Furthermore, the level of use by the deer was significantly higher in larger plots that received mowing and fertilisation treatments compared to smaller plots subjected to similar treatments. Of particular interest is the observation that chital and swamp deer exhibited greater utilisation of the centre (core) areas within the larger plots (mean = 0.21 pellet groups m(-2) at the centre vs. 0.13 at the edge) despite the edge (periphery) also provided attractive resources to these deer. In contrast, hog deer did not display any discernible reaction to the experimental treatments, suggesting potential species-specific variations in response to perceived predation risk arising from management interventions. Our findings emphasise the importance of a sense of security as a primary determinant of habitat selection for medium-sized deer within managed grassland environments. These insights carry practical implications for park managers, providing a nuanced understanding of integrating the 'landscape of fear' into habitat management strategies. This study emphasises that the 'landscape of fear' concept can and should be integrated into habitat management to maintain delicate predator-prey dynamics within ecosystems.

AB  - Aims: Persistent land use change throughout the North American Great Plains increases the need to maintain and improve ecosystem service delivery from remaining rangelands to meet production and conservation goals. Vegetation structure is an ecosystem property influenced by management that has site selection and use implications for wildlife and livestock. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of patch-burn grazing to increase structural heterogeneity on semi-arid post-Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands in southwestern North Dakota. Location: Hettinger Research Extension Center in Hettinger, North Dakota. Methods: We surveyed plant community composition and structural characteristics in patch-burn grazing pastures during the 2017-2020 summer grazing seasons. Three pastures were stocked with cow-calf pairs and three were stocked with sheep. We also surveyed structural characteristics on units with conventional management (hay or idle) for active and post-CRP enrolled grasslands during the summers of 2018-2020. We tested for vegetative and structural differences between patches with varying time since fire and between grazer types on patch-burn pastures using mixed-effect models and ordination. We used variance partitioning to determine if structural contrast on patch-burn pastures increased over the study period and if structural contrast was higher on patch-burn grazing pastures relative to conventional management. Results: Time since fire was significant for all structural characteristics, with recently burned patches being different from other patches. There were no structural differences between cattle and sheep pastures, but forb and legume cover were lower in sheep pastures. Structural contrast on patch-burn pastures increased over the study and was greater than conventional management. Conclusions: Increased structural heterogeneity is important for supporting a broad suite of rangeland wildlife and can stabilize forage production. This study supports the expectation that patch-burn grazing with moderate stocking rates will increase structural contrast regardless of grazer type, but practitioners should consider which suites of species that management may benefit.

AB  - Disturbance by herbivores occurs in most of the natural ecosystems and influence species diversity and vegetation structure. This study compares the vegetation of elephant (disturbed) zone (EZ) and non-elephant (undisturbed) zone (NEZ) in the Omo biosphere reserve to assess the effect of elephant browsing on the vegetation. Woody species densities, basal area, importance value and species diversity were determined from twenty sampling plots (20 m x 20 m) established randomly each in the EZ and NEZ. The result of floristic composition shows more species were in the NEZ than EZ. The species diversity reduced by 3.3% in EZ. Sorensen index of similarity of the two communities was 62%. Celtis zenkeri (74.75) and Diospyros dendo (51.1) dominated the species in the EZ while Gmelina arborea (127.35) and Funtumia africana (16.63) were the dominant species in the NEZ. Browsing of elephants directly influence species composition, diversity and structure in the forest ecosystem leading to loss of biodiversity.

AB  - Societal Impact StatementBesides being important components of landscape-level biodiversity, medicinal plants are essential resources for traditional and modern healthcare. However, human-driven biodiversity loss has resulted in the decline of medicinal plant populations. By maintaining connections between nature, culture, and people, sacred natural sites can help counteract this trend. We studied the potential of ancient burial mounds to maintain populations of medicinal plants and related phytochemical diversity in European agricultural landscapes. Our findings highlight the importance of conserving grassland vegetation and associated biodiversity at these sites, which is crucial for preserving a key ecosystem service in intensively managed landscapes.Summary Medicinal plants are threatened by overcollection and habitat loss due to human activities. In this study, we aimed to reveal how ancient earthen burial mounds covered with successional grasslands of different ages can contribute to conservation of medicinal plants and related phytochemical diversity in European agricultural landscapes. Using vegetation data collected from 166 mounds in Hungary, we identified the medicinal plant species present at these sites, and based on multiple literature sources, provided the secondary metabolite profiles of the medicinal plants and plant communities. By using generalized linear mixed models and redundancy analysis, we investigated how vegetation age, percentage of croplands around the sites, site area, and soil properties influence the diversity of medicinal plants and associated phytochemicals. We found that mounds provide safe havens for a wide range of medicinal plants and secondary metabolites. Our results showed that grassland-related medicinal plants producing iridoids and diterpenes were typical on mounds with older grasslands. A large proportion of croplands in the neighboring landscape and high soil pH supported generalist medicinal plants producing nitrogen-containing and sesquiterpene related secondary metabolites. Higher soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content favored medicinal plants producing lignans, glycosides, and organic acids. Our results suggest that the high phytochemical diversity is supported by the occurrence of various compounds facilitating the adaptation of medicinal plants to various environmental stressors and biotic factors, such as competition, herbivory, and pathogens, typically present in sites embedded in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - This study investigates the long-term trends and potential drivers of changes in the epibenthic community at the "Dogger Bank" to clarify the effects of rising sea temperatures and trawling activities on epibenthic species composition and biodiversity. Over three decades (1991-2021), the epibenthic megafauna (> 1 cm) has been regularly sampled in summer with a 2-m beam trawl at five stations at the Dogger Bank tail end, and the epibenthic species abundances were quantitatively recorded. Furthermore, sea temperature and trawling effort datasets for the corresponding area were used to check for correlations with the species composition and abundances. The study relies on long-term data analysis and the application of multivariate statistical methods to discern temporal trends and the relative contributions of environmental and anthropogenic factors to community changes. This study hypothesizes that the benthic species community at the MPA on the Dogger Bank has undergone significant shifts over three decades due to rising sea temperatures and pressure from bottom contact fisheries. While local summer temperatures of the bottom water layer increased by up to 4 degrees C throughout the research period, trawling efforts rather decreased continuously in the area. Despite low interannual differences in species composition between the stations, we found the faunal regime to be under constant change (MDS, CCA), with a decrease in biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener indices) along with a general faunal regime shift around the turn of the millennium. We did not detect a linear correlation between biodiversity and temperature/trawling effort; however, we did find certain species positively or negatively correlating with these factors when using Spearman's rank analysis. Our results provide a solid benchmark for future research in the German and neighboring Exclusive Economic Zone.

AB  - In the Mediterranean dry ecosystems, Fabaceae species are considered as a major factor for natural and unnatural restoration of degraded rangelands and therefore play a crucial role in soil and water conservation, maintaining ecological balance in terrestrial ecosystems. The central objective of the current research study, conducted during growing season, in an afforested steppe (South Tunisia), was to determine the effects of the shrub species Retama raetam on floristic composition, total plant cover, species density, dry matter (DM) yield and soil characteristics in protected sites (inside the park of El Gonna) and unprotected sites (outside the park). In each study site, two microsites were distinguished, namely the canopied microsite (under the shrub crown) and uncanopied microsite (in open area). The herbaceous community (floristic composition, species density, total plant cover, dry matter) and soil characteristics (soil nutrients and soil water) were sampled using the quadrat method beneath 60 adult shrubs of R. raetam (30 in protected sites and 30 in unprotected sites) and 60 open areas among the shrubs (30 in protected sites and 30 in unprotected sites). Results revealed that R. raetam improves soil water availability, the nutrient status of soil (organic matter, total carbon, total nitrogen, extractable phosphorus) and the understorey vegetation under arid conditions. Certain palatable species are frequently found under shrubs. In the protected sites, these species are being replaced by less desirable species, which emphasizes the importance of conservative stocking rates and proper pasture management. Our work provides additional evidence that shrubs have the potential to increase the diversity of arid systems at the landscape level. Additionally, grazing by large herbivores influences negatively the dynamic of vegetation under arid bioclimate.

AB  - Higher temperatures can increase metabolic rates and carbon demands of invertebrate herbivores, which may shift leaf-chewing herbivory among plant functional groups differing in C:N (carbon:nitrogen) ratios. Biotic factors influencing herbivore species richness may modulate these temperature effects. Yet, systematic studies comparing leaf-chewing herbivory among plant functional groups in different habitats and landscapes along temperature gradients are lacking. This study was conducted on 80 plots covering large gradients of temperature, plant richness and land use in Bavaria, Germany. We investigated proportional leaf area loss by chewing invertebrates ('herbivory') in three plant functional groups on open herbaceous vegetation. As potential drivers, we considered local mean temperature (range 8.4-18.8 degrees C), multi-annual mean temperature (range 6.5-10.0 degrees C), local plant richness (species and family level, ranges 10-51 species, 5-25 families), adjacent habitat type (forest, grassland, arable field, settlement), proportion of grassland and landscape diversity (0.2-3 km scale). We observed differential responses of leaf-chewing herbivory among plant functional groups in response to plant richness (family level only) and habitat type, but not to grassland proportion, landscape diversity and temperature-except for multi-annual mean temperature influencing herbivory on grassland plots. Three-way interactions of plant functional group, temperature and predictors of plant richness or land use did not substantially impact herbivory. We conclude that abiotic and biotic factors can assert different effects on leaf-chewing herbivory among plant functional groups. At present, effects of plant richness and habitat type outweigh effects of temperature and landscape-scale land use on herbivory among legumes, forbs and grasses.

AB  - Edge effects, the altered abiotic and biotic conditions on the borders of natural areas, have rarely been linked to altered soil biota, which shape ecosystem processes including carbon storage, biogeochemical cycling, and plant performance. Here, we investigated if increased wildlife populations (their increase mediated by foraging in nearby oil palm plantations) affect soil biota when they move between plantations and natural habitats. We used a 22-year fenced exclusion experiment in a primary rain forest in Peninsular Malaysia. We found that the presence of wildlife (mainly native pigs; Sus scrofa) was associated with greater bacterial diversity, an altered bacterial community composition, and indications of a reduced abundance of symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi. There were only minor effects of pigs on soil chemistry or microclimate, so we suggest that changes in soil communities are driven by pigs' leaf litter removal and alterations to plant composition. Our study highlights that indirect effects from agriculture can be induced by wildlife more than1 km into protected areas and this could have important repercussions for ecosystem processes and plant-soil feedbacks.

AB  - Wildlife conservation and management in human -dominated landscapes are major concerns for wildlife ecologists and managers. The dynamics of human disturbance, combined with seasonal limitations in the availability of nutritious foods, may restrict wildlife population growth and recovery. However, understanding how large mammal species adjust their population distribution in forest habitats with seasonal changes in food and disturbances requires a deeper and more extensive analysis. In this study, we found that three ungulate species, roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), sika deer (Cervus nippon), and wild boar (Sus scrofa), employ robust, conservative, and flexible distribution strategies, respectively, to adapt to the effects of seasonal changes and human disturbances. Moreover, croplands, villages, and grazing have some negative effects on the distribution of roe deer and sika deer, while wild boar can be highly abundant near human land use. Additionally, roe deer, sika deer, and wild boar are also affected by the abundance of shrub species they consume. During the cold season, the populations of the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) and Amur leopard (P. pardus orientalis) were primarily located near roads and dense forests, respectively. In the warm season, the distribution of both big cats was influenced by prey abundance, and Amur tigers also avoided grazing livestock. Nevertheless, the negative effects of human land use on Amur tigers and wild boars increased during the warm season, which was attributed to more frequent human activities during that time. Consequently, it is crucial to implement season -specific habitat management, particularly by regulating human disturbances during the warm season, in order to promote the recovery and expansion of populations of big cats and ungulates.

AB  - Encounter rates of carnivores with prey are dependent on spatial and temporal overlap, and are often highest with their preferred prey. The Critically Endangered Sumatran tiger Panthera tigris sumatrae is dependent on prey populations, but little is known about its prey preferences. We collected camera-trap data for 7 years (2010-2016) in Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Sumatra, to investigate spatial and temporal overlap of tigers with potential prey species. We also developed a novel method to predict predator-prey encounter rates and potential prey preferences from camera-trap data. We documented at least 10 individual tigers, with an overall detection rate of 0.24 detections/100 trap nights. Tigers exhibited a diurnal activity pattern and had highest temporal overlap with wild boar Sus scrofa and pig-tailed macaques Macaca nemestrina, but highest spatial overlap with wild boar and sambar deer Rusa unicolor. We created a spatial and temporal composite score and three additional composite scores with adjustments for the spatial overlap and preferred prey mass. Wild boars ranked highest for all composite scores, followed by sambar deer, and both are known as preferred tiger prey in other areas. Spatial and temporal overlaps are often considered as separate indices, but a composite score may facilitate better predictions of encounter rates and potential prey preferences. Our findings suggest that prey management efforts in this area should focus on wild boar and sambar deer, to ensure a robust prey base for this Critically Endangered tiger population.

AB  - (1) Background: Desertification is one of the most important environmental impacts around the world. In the semiarid grassland of North of Chile, overgrazing has deep effects on arid lands and consequently on its economy and social development. It is necessary to conduct very detailed studies to determine how the climate, the botanical composition and the grazing system affects this process; (2) Methods: In this paper, we have determined the effect on arid grasslands of three goat managements: exclusions, continuous and deferred grazing on forage biomass, richness, Berger-Parker's dominance and Shannon's diversity. This study was developed in Las Cardas Range Station (CEALC) of the University of Chile in the Coquimbo region. The effect of annual and seasonal rainfall on biomass, diversity, richness and dominance parameters was determined; (3) Results: Allochthonous, endemic and native species showed significant changes both for seasonal and annual precipitation. In contrast, the grazing system only affected dominance and biomass of native and endemic species. Deferred grazing was the only management system that increased overall biomass productivity, especially on the best forage plant species. Exclusions showed a positive influence on more endangered species, which were the most vulnerable to goat overgrazing; (4) Conclusions: In consequence, we proposed a network of areas under deferred grazing combined with exclusions. This strategy can increase simultaneously forage productivity, grassland conservation and preservation of associated resources as hunting and wildlife tourism. Moreover, this strategy of range management will allow the sustainability of community of farmers in one of the poorest and most desertified areas in South America.

AB  - Habitat use influences the survival and fitness of animals. Habitat quality and food availability in spring and summer are crucial determinants of ungulate population dynamics, peaking in spring and drastically decreasing in summer in Mediterranean region. Here, over a 2-year period we examine foraging habitat use in both spring and summer of 3 threatened gazelle species living in sympatry in a private reserve in Morocco: Cuvier's Gazelle (Gazella cuvieri), Dama Gazelle (Nanger dama), and Dorcas Gazelle (G. dorcas). We observed differences among species-Cuvier's Gazelle foraged in woodland, Dama Gazelle in grassland, and Dorcas Gazelle in scrubland-with differences being mediated by seasonal effects as all species broadened their foraging habitat use in summer. We observed differences between years in foraging patterns of Dama Gazelle and Dorcas Gazelle, reflecting greater herb and scrub cover in 2018, potentially related to greater rainfall. Given the seasonal and annual differences observed, reductions in rainfall predicted with the progression of changing climatic conditions in the Mediterranean basin would reduce the availability of food resources and heighten the vulnerability of these species. The study illustrates interspecific coexistence through food resource partitioning of the 3 species, contributing to support conservation management actions of their populations in setting up structured reintroduction programs within their range.
   Cuvier's Gazelle (Gazella cuvieri), Dama Gazelle (Nanger dama), and Dorcas Gazelle (G. dorcas) are 3 species that were historically abundant and widely distributed in northern Africa but have declined dramatically in the second half of the 20th century. The Conservation Strategy and Action Plan for Gazelle species in North Africa 2017 to 2026 developed by the International Union of Nature Conservation includes the study of their habitat use to support conservation strategies. We investigated the habitat use of the 3 species when foraging in spring and summer on a private reserve of Morocco. There was spatial segregation and seasonal differences among species. These specific preferences might permit stable coexistence among them and reflect their need for structural habitat diversity, which might be promoted in reforestation programs to improve their survival and coexistence in future reintroduction areas, accounting for climate (rainfall reduction decreases forage availability) and population dynamics.

AB  - Plant primary production is a key factor in ecosystem dynamics. In environments with high climatic variability such as the Mediterranean region, plant primary production shows strong seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations, which both drive and interplay with herbivore grazing. Knowledge on the responses of different vegetation types to the variability in both rainfall and grazing pressure by wild and domestic ungulates is a necessary starting point for the sustainable management of these ecosystems. In this work we combine a 15 year series of remote sensing data on plant production (NDVI) with meteorological (daily precipitation data) and ungulate abundance (annual counts of four species of wild and domestic ungulates: red deer, fallow deer, cattle, and horses) in an iconic protected area (the Donana National Park, SW Spain) to (i) estimate the impact of intra- and inter-annual variation in rainfall and herbivore pressure on primary production, for each of four main vegetation types; and (ii) evaluate the potential impact of different policy (i.e., herbivore management) strategies under expected climate change scenarios. Our results show that the production of different vegetation types differed strongly in their responses to phenology (a surrogate of the effect of climatology on vegetation development), water availability (rainfall accumulated until the phenological peak), and grazing pressure. Although the density of domestic ungulates shows a linear, negative effect on the primary production of three of the four vegetation types, differences in primary production and phenology among vegetation types increase ecosystem resilience to both climatological variability and grazing pressure. Such resilience may, however, be reduced under the conditions predicted by climate change models, if the moderate predicted reduction in rainfall levels combines with moderate to high densities of domestic ungulates, resulting in important reductions in primary production that may compromise plant regeneration, leading to irreversible degradation. New management strategies taking advantage of habitat heterogeneity and phenological alternation, more flexible stocking rates, and the redistribution of management units should be considered to mitigate these effects. The use of available remote sensing data and techniques in combination with statistical models represents a valuable tool for developing, monitoring, and refining such strategies.

AB  - Grassland ecosystems are under threat globally, primarily due to land-use and land-cover changes that have adversely affected their biodiversity. Given the negative ecological impacts of biodiversity loss in grasslands, there is an urgent need for developing an operational biodiversity monitoring system that functions in these ecosystems. In this paper, we assessed the capability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) to capture plant alpha-diversity in a large naturally-assembled grassland while considering the impact of common management practices, specifically prescribed fire. We collected a robust in -situ plant diversity data set, including species composition and percent cover from 2500 sampling points with different burn ages, from recently-burned to transitional and pre-prescribed fire at the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma, USA. We expressed in-situ plant alpha-diversity using the first three Hill numbers, including species richness (number of observed species in a plant community), exponential Shannon entropy index (hereafter Shannon diversity; effective number of common species, where species are weighed proportional to their percent cover), and inverse Simpson concentration index (hereafter Simpson diversity; effective number of dominant species, where more weight is given to dominant species) at four different plot sizes, including 60 m x 60 m, 120 m x 120 m, 180 m x 180 m, and 240 m x 240 m. We collected full-range airborne hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution (1 m) and visible and near-infrared spaceborne hyper -spectral data from DESIS sensor with coarse spatial resolution (30 m), and used the spectral diversity hypoth-esis-i.e., that the variability in spectral data is largely driven by plant diversity-to estimate alpha-diversity remotely. In recently-burned plots and those at the transitional stage, both airborne and spaceborne data were capable of capturing Simpson diversity-a metric that calculates the effective number of dominant species by emphasizing abundant species and discounting rare species-but not species richness or Shannon diversity. Further, neither airborne nor spaceborne hyperspectral data sets were capable of capturing plant alpha-diversity of 60 m x 60 m or 120 m x 120 m plots. Based on these results, three main findings emerged: (1) management practices influence grassland biodiversity patterns that can be remotely detected, (2) both fine-and coarse -resolution remotely-sensed data can detect the effective number of dominant species (e.g., Simpson diversity), and (3) attention should be given to site-specific plant diversity field data collection to appropriately interpret remote sensing results. Findings of this study indicate the feasibility of estimating Simpson diversity in naturally -assembled grasslands using forthcoming spaceborne imagers such as National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration's Surface Biology and Geology mission.

AB  - Plant and soil microbial diversities are linked through a range of interactions, including the exchange of carbon and nutrients but also herbivory and pathogenic effects. Over time, associations between plant communities and their soil microbiota may strengthen and become more specific, resulting in stronger associations between plant and soil microbial diversity. We tested this hypothesis at the end of a 4-year field experiment in 48 plots with different plant species compositions established 13 years earlier in a biodiversity experiment in Jena, Germany. We factorially crossed plant community history (old vs. new plant communities) and soil legacy (old vs. new soil) with plant diversity (species richness levels 1, 2, 4 and 8, each with 12 different species compositions). We use the term 'plant community history' to refer to the co-occurrence history of plants in different species compositions in the Jena Experiment. We determined soil bacterial and fungal community composition in terms of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using 16S rRNA gene and ITS DNA sequencing. Plant community history (old plants) did not affect overall soil community composition but differentially affected bacterial richness and abundances of specific bacterial taxa in association with specific plant species compositions. Soil legacy (old soil) markedly increased soil bacterial richness and evenness and decreased fungal evenness. Soil fungal richness increased with plant species richness, regardless of plant community history or soil legacy, with the strongest difference between plant monocultures and mixtures. Specific plant species compositions and functional groups were associated with specific bacterial and fungal community compositions. Grasses increased fungal richness and evenness and legumes decreased fungal evenness, but bacterial diversity was not affected. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that as experimental ecosystems varying in plant diversity develop over time (2002-2010), plant species associate with specific soil microbial taxa. This can have long-lasting effects on below-ground community composition in re-assembled plant communities, as reflected in strong soil legacy signals still visible after 4 years (2011-2015). Effects of plant community history on soil communities are subtle and may take longer to fully develop.

AB  - Aim: Global warming is threatening species survival worldwide. Cold-adapted montane ungulates may be among the first species to be affected by global warming. Here, we investigate the behavioural thermoregulation hypothesis that montane ungulates buffer the effects of warming climate through behavioural adjustment.
   Location: Foping National Nature Reserve (FNNR) on the southern slopes of the Qinling Mountains, Shaanxi, China.
   Methods: We used infrared camera traps over six consecutive years to monitor behavioural responses of montane ungulates to seasonal and diurnal changes in ambient temperature. We evaluated how seasonal altitudinal migration and changes to their daily activity budget may mitigate the effect of warming on montane ungulates.
   Results: All four montane ungulate species examined here preferred ambient temperatures <22 degrees C in summer. On this basis, we estimate that 27.9% (+2 degrees C) and 46.7% (+3 degrees C) of suitable summer habitats will become unsuitable under climate change. Chinese muntjac and tufted deer displayed behavioural changes to daily activity budgets, which may help them overcome global climate warming to a certain extent. By contrast, golden takin and wild boar did not display similar behavioural changes, and it may be because they are not affected by current shifts in climate due to larger body size and thus lower thermal stress.
   Main Conclusions: These analyses demonstrate different species responses to warming are likely and are determined by specific tolerances to ambient temperature thresholds. However, it remains to be seen whether species interactions caused by behavioural shifts may affect species ability to respond to climate.

AB  - Human expansion can cause disturbance and intrusion of invasive species, which are detrimental to small carnivores. We investigated how European wildcats responded to disturbance from mushroom collectors, cattle and feral pigs in Sicily, Italy. We used detections from 76 cameras over 2 surveys (2015-2016 and 2018; camera days = 1985) to run occupancy and co-occurrence models and estimate overlap in activity patterns between species pairs. During 2015-2016, wildcats were detected at the same location with cattle, mushroom hunters and feral pigs at 14.4%, 26.3% and 17.1% of cameras. During 2018, wildcats were detected at the same location with cattle, mushroom hunters and feral pigs at 7.8%, 19.7% and 6.5% of cameras. Dominant species (A; cattle, mushroom hunters and feral pigs) did not affect occupancy of the subordinate species (B; wildcats) during 2015-2016. In 2018, the effect of species A on wildcat occupancy was evident for cattle-wildcat and mushroom hunters-wildcat pairs and wildcat occupancy was higher at sites where species A was not present. Probabilities of detecting wildcats at sites where species A was not present or not detected were higher than probabilities of detecting wildcats at sites where species A was detected. Overlap in activity levels was low between mushroom hunters and wildcats and higher between cattle and wildcats, but varied between surveys for feral pig-wildcat pair. Although results differed between survey periods, we suggest that wildcats generally avoided cattle, feral pigs and mushroom hunters, at both temporal and spatial scales. Anthropogenic disturbance, livestock and invasive species are emerging threats to wildcats and future conservation actions should consider our results.

AB  - Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain species coexistence and maintainance of local species diversity in tree communities. Among the proposed mechanisms, negative density dependence theory (NDD) predicts that seedling growth rate declines at high conspecific densities. However, local environmental conditions and seasonality may also modulate the strength of NDD. We used data from dry and wet seasons in West African semi-arid savannas to explore the importance of NDD and environmental heterogeneity in predicting seedling growth of Afzelia africana Sm, a threatened species with high economic and cutural values. First, we analysed variation of seedling growth in dry and wet seasons, and between vegetation types (tree and shrub savannas). Next, we assessed the effects of environmental heterogeneity (soil type, slope and elevation) and biotic factors (conspecific/heterospecific seedling and adult densities, leaf fungal infection, herbivory) on seedling growth in dry and wet seasons, while controlling for initial seedling size. We predicted that seedling growth would be higher in the wet than in the dry season, and in shrub savannas than in tree savannas due to variation in stand density and intensity of competitive biotic interactions. We also hypothesized that slope and negative density dependence would influence seedling growth and that, the density-dependent effects would vary with environmental heterogeneity and seasonality. Results showed two distinct patterns of seedling growth primarily driven by seasonality: a higher growth rate in the wet season due to water availability and a smaller growth rate during the dry season, possibly because seedlings develop adaptation to drought and fire at the expense of their growth. Growth rate was also higher on flat and gentle slope. Density-dependent effects on seedling growth were only observed with conspecific adults. Seasonality modulated the strength of the density-dependent effect, which was significantly negative in the wet season and nonsignificant in the dry season. This study suggests that A. africana early seedling growth is modulated by interacting effects of seasonality, terrain slope and adult conspecific density. Campaigns for reforestation with A. africana in the semi-arid areas will require increased attention on the seedlings during the long periods of drought.

AB  - African savanna ecosystems are home to the world's richest large herbivore (LH) assemblages. However, its landscapes are changing faster than any other region on Earth due to human activities and natural events. Therefore, understanding the factors influencing the distribution of LH in these human-dominated environments is crucial for decision-making on wildlife and habitat management. We combined ecological aerial surveys, camera trap, and dung count data to investigate how ecological (habitat types, perennial rivers, and rainfall) and anthropogenic (human settlements and cattle grazing areas) factors influence the distribution of LH species in Limpopo National Park (LNP). We used generalized linear models fitting binary logistic regression models to distinguish 25-km2 cells occupied (where the species were detected) by elephants (Loxodonta africana), buffalos (Syncerus caffer), zebras (Equus quagga), kudus (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), nyalas (Tragelaphus angasii), and impalas (Aepyceros melampus) from unoccupied regions (where the species were not detected) in the LNP landscape. We found that habitat type and rainfall were the most influential factors shaping the pattern of LH distribution in the LNP, except for elephants, whose prevalence was not associated with rainfall. The prevalence of zebras was positively associated with the proximity to perennial rivers, while kudus avoided these areas. While some species (zebras, kudus, and impalas) tended to avoid settlements, others (elephants, buffalos, and nyala) seemed attracted to settlements. Cattle grazing areas were the worst predictors of the distribution of all study species. Our results disclosed the role of ecological factors for the distribution of LH and showed that anthropogenic disturbances seemed to either (partially) prevent the occurrence of LH or show the potential for human-wildlife conflict risk in the study area. Therefore, the results highlight the need to investigate/quantify the potential human-wildlife conflict risk at finer spatial scales to improve future management.

AB  - Monitoring prey species is crucial for tiger conservation, particularly in the Sundarbans, where prey diversity is limited. This study assessed the status of tiger prey species and examined the relationship between tiger and prey abundance using tiger pugmarks and prey pellet counts under a unified sampling framework. We established a total of 808 pellet sample plots (200 m2 each) and conducted 1286 km boat-based transect to collect data between 2021 and 2023. The mean pellet group densities of Spotted deer (Axis axis) and Wild boar (Sus scrofa) were 295.09 and 27.21 pellet groups/ha, corresponding to densities of 35.44 and 15.75 ind./km2, respectively. The mean number of tiger pugmark set was 0.47/km of river courses travelled, with reasonable variation across east-west forest regions that closely aligned with the latest tiger density estimates. The generalized linear model revealed a significant positive relationship between Spotted deer and tiger abundance, while the relationship between Wild boar and tiger abundance was positive but not statistically significant. In contrast, human disturbance and reserve forest had negative impacts on tiger abundance in the Sundarbans. This study presents a cost-effective method for monitoring tigers and their prey, and offers valuable insights into predator-prey dynamics within the fragile ecosystem of the Sundarbans. Furthermore, our findings underscore the critical role of Spotted deer in sustaining tiger populations and highlight the need to strengthen protection strategies not only for sanctuaries but also for the reserve forests of the Sundarbans.

AB  - Headwater streams are reliant on riparian tree leaf litterfall to fuel brown food webs. Terrestrial agents like herbivores and contaminants can alter plant growth, litter production, litter quality, and the timing of litterfall into streams, influencing aspects of the brown food web. At Mount St. Helens (USA), early successional streams are developing willow (Salix sitchensis) riparian zones. The willows are attacked by stem-boring herbivores, altering litter quality and the timing of litterfall. Within a established experimental plots, willows (male and female plants) were protected from herbivores using insecticides and provided with experimental additions of nitrogen. This enabled us to test the interacting influences of herbivores, nitrogen deposition, and willow sex on leaf litter quality, aquatic litter decomposition, and microbial and invertebrate detritivores. We found weak litter quality effects (higher N and lower C:N) for the herbivore treatment, but no effect of nitrogen deposition. Although litter decomposition rates were not strongly affected by litter treatments, detritivore communities were altered by all treatments. Nitrogen deposition resulted in decreased bacterial richness and decreased fungal diversity in-stream. Aquatic macroinvertebrate communities were influenced by the interacting effects of herbivory and nitrogen addition, with abundances highest in herbivore litter with the greatest N addition. Shredders showed the highest abundance in male, herbivore-attacked litter. The establishment of riparian willows along early successional streams and their interacting effects with herbivores and nitrogen deposition may be influencing detritivore community assembly at Mount St. Helens. More broadly, global changes like increased wet and dry N deposition and expanded ranges of key herbivores might influence tree litter decomposition in many ecosystems.

AB  - Humans have impacted most of the planet, and the ensuing fragmentation results in small, isolated habitat patches posing a risk of genetic diversity loss, inbreeding, and genetic load. Understanding how natural and anthropogenic landscape features affect gene flow among habitat patches is critical for maintaining connectivity. Genome-wide data are required to comprehend the impacts of recent fragmentation, which can be challenging when only non-invasive samples are available. Here, we build upon advancements in conservation genomics to address connectivity of two large herbivores, gaur (Bos gaurus) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) in central India. Given their habitat associations, we expected these species to respond similarly to habitat fragmentation. We used faecal-DNA and methylation-based host-DNA enrichment with modified ddRAD protocol to generate genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 124 gaur and 99 sambar individuals. Our findings reveal that gaur populations in central India are fragmented, displaying high genetic differentiation, with drift significantly affecting small populations like Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary. Although sambar shows low genetic structure, another small population, Bor Tiger Reserve is genetically differentiated. Our results suggest that although land cover change and roads restrict animal movement, the extent of this impact varies across the two species. We show that different species respond differently to landscape features, even with similar habitat associations. We highlight small and isolated populations requiring urgent conservation intervention. Such multi-species approaches enhance our understanding of cross-species connectivity patterns. We suggest shifting from single-species to multi-species holistic conservation approach in rapidly developing landscapes to better manage co-occurring endangered species.

AB  - The oligotrophic tropical western Pacific region is characterized by a high density of seamounts, with the Kyushu-Palau Ridge (KPR) being the longest seamount chain here. Effective spatial management plans for seamount ecosystems necessitate an understanding of distribution patterns and key environmental factors influencing benthic communities. However, knowledge regarding deep-sea biodiversity patterns over intricate topography remains limited. In this study, we investigated a seamount with a water depth of 522 m at the summit located in the southern section of KPR. Survey transects were conducted from 522 m to 4059 m. By analyzing video-recorded data obtained by a human-occupied vehicle (HOV) during dives and environmental variables derived from bathymetry, distinct assemblages were identified through noise clustering. alpha- and beta-diversity patterns within the seamount megabenthic community were analyzed across the depth gradient, along with investigation of their environmental drivers. A total of 10,596 megafauna individuals were documented, categorized into 88 morphospecies and statistically separated into six distinct community clusters using noise clustering analysis. Species abundance and richness were highest within the 700-800 m water depth range, declining notably beyond 2100 m, indicating a critical threshold for habitat classification in this region. The beta-diversity of megabenthic communities was high (0.836). Although beta-diversity patterns along the depth gradient were mostly dominated by differences in species richness, the contribution of species replacement increased with depth, becoming dominant at depths greater than 3000 m. Depth emerged as the primary driver of spatial variation in community structure, while near-bottom current velocity, topographic parameters (bathymetric position index, slope), and substrate type also influenced the formation of microhabitats. The study highlights the depth gradients, thresholds, and other intricate environmental factors shaping the spatial heterogeneity of these communities. It provides valuable insights for the future development of effective survey and conservation strategies for benthic biodiversity on the KPR.
   We conducted a detailed study of a seamount in the Philippine Sea and analyzed the patterns of variation and factors controlling the beta diversity of the benthic community.

AB  - Pronounced glacial and interglacial climate cycles characterized northern ecosystems during the Pleistocene. Our understanding of the resultant community transformations and past ecological interactions strongly depends on the taxa found in fossil assemblages. Here, we present a shotgun metagenomic analysis of sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) to infer past ecosystem-wide biotic composition (from viruses to megaherbivores) from the Middle and Late Pleistocene at the Batagay megaslump, East Siberia. The shotgun DNA records of past vegetation composition largely agree with pollen and plant metabarcoding data from the same samples. Interglacial ecosystems at Batagay attributed to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 17 and MIS 7 were characterized by forested vegetation (Pinus, Betula, Alnus) and open grassland. The microbial and fungal communities indicate strong activity related to soil decomposition, especially during MIS17. The local landscape likely featured more open, herb-dominated areas, and the vegetation mosaic supported birds and small omnivorous mammals. Parts of the area were intermittently/partially flooded as suggested by the presence of water-dependent taxa. During MIS 3, the sampled ecosystems are identified as cold-temperate, periodically flooded grassland. Diverse megafauna (Mammuthus, Equus, Coelodonta) coexisted with small mammals (rodents). The MIS 2 ecosystems existed under harsher conditions, as suggested by the presence of cold-adapted herbaceous taxa. Typical Pleistocene megafauna still inhabited the area. The new approach, in which shotgun sequencing is supported by metabarcoding and pollen data, enables the investigation of community composition changes across a broad range of taxonomic groups and inferences about trophic interactions and aspects of soil microbial ecology.

AB  - Animal activity rhythms, especially expressed as periodic displacement in the case of motile megafauna, can affect the detection of species in a certain spot during a short sampling window, and thus affect our perception of local biodiversity. However, this temporal aspect of animal behavior is rarely included in the data collection strategies of ecological monitoring programs, potentially leading to biased scientific outcomes and/or management decisions. Here, we innovatively performed high-frequency Remotely Operated Vehicle video surveys to assess the effects of benthic species' rhythmic displacement on the assessment of their densities and overall biodiversity indicators inside and outside (as control) a deep Mediterranean No-Take Zone, a Marine Protected Area where all fishery activity is banned year-round. These depths are hosting several targets of commercial interest for the local fisheries, including the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus. We used Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering on the waveform data of 22 identified taxa (18 species and 4 genera) and identified 6 groups of rhythmic behavior: nocturnal, crepuscular, diurnal (with N. norvegicus as a special, singular case), bimodal and arrhythmic. Species accumulation curves and Pielou<acute accent>s J<acute accent> index showed that biodiversity indices of different orders (i.e., both richness and evenness) varied in relation to the time of sampling during the 24-h cycle (i.e., daytime, nighttime and crepuscular hours). Our work showcases the need for temporally structured data collection strategies in deep-sea ecological monitoring programs, and provides further evidence towards the integration of robotic technologies in Ecosystem-Based Management approaches to increase sampling capabilities while reducing operational costs.

AB  - Background and aimsUngulates are integral to Mediterranean ecosystems, influencing vegetation dynamics and soil microbial communities. While previous studies have documented the effects of herbivory on the soil microbiome (e.g. nitrogen-fixation groups), the impacts on root-associated fungal communities and their role in plant responses to herbivory remain poorly understood. These interactions are vital for ecosystem functioning and deserve further investigation.MethodsTo explore these interactions, we used Agrostis spp. as species model, a common grass genus, highly consumed by ungulates worldwide. Roots were sampled from areas with high ungulate activity (deer density of 25-40 ind/km2) and from adjacent 14-year ungulate exclosures to assess long-term changes in root-associated fungal communities. Additionally, Agrostis plants were grown in soils from these areas under greenhouse conditions to evaluate their regrowth capacity after simulated herbivory.ResultsThe fungal communities of the roots differed significantly between plants grown inside and outside the ungulate exclosures. Despite these differences, the regrowth capacity after simulated herbivory was not significantly affected by the soil origin (areas with and without herbivory). Plants grown in sterilized soils with recolonized fungal communities exhibited enhanced growth compared to those in untreated soils.ConclusionsThe study demonstrates that ungulate herbivory alters root-associated fungal communities in Agrostis spp., yet plant growth remains unaffected, suggesting resilient plant-fungal interactions. Our findings show that microbial diversity alone may not predict ecosystem function, emphasizing the need to consider both taxonomic and functional dimensions of soil communities in conservation strategies for Mediterranean ecosystems.

AB  - Reducing browsing damages from cervids (Cervidae) on economically valuable tree species is a challenging task in many countries. Apart from cervid abundance, landscape characteristics, such as forest composition, land use, forage availability and climatic conditions, may affect the degree of browsing through both direct and indirect effects. A better understanding of basic mechanisms in this complex system is needed to design efficient and convincing management strategies. Focusing on Sweden as a case, which has been widely studied using regression analyses only, we applied path analysis to test the validity of a model on the indirect and direct links between landscape characteristics, cervid populations, and browsing damages on Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). Our results validated the tested model in which moose (Alces alces) density and pine availability directly influence browsing damages. Increasing amounts of pine forests, preferred deciduous trees, and young forest had positive direct effects on moose densities and thereby indirectly contributed to increased browsing damages. The density of smaller deer species showed no direct effect on browsing damages on pine. Path analysis corroborated our attempt to disentangle direct and indirect potential causal drivers of browsing damages and shows that the choice of statistical method may alter the understanding of mechanistic driving forces.

AB  - Green roofs offer numerous environmental benefits, and thus their implementation is considered an initiative to create sustainable cities. However, the characteristics of green roofs that could enhance arthropod biodiversity and ecological functioning are poorly known, especially for South American countries. Here, we analyzed the influence of several characteristics of green roofs (plant species richness, vegetation cover of the roof, age, substrate depth, area, and isolation in terms of height and green cover in the landscape scale) on the abundance, richness (total and by functional feeding groups), and community composition of arthropods. To do that, we selected 30 green roofs located in different urbanization contexts, from small towns in semi-rural areas to Cordoba, the second-largest city of Argentina. Our results indicated a high diversity of arthropods, registering a total of 12,942 individuals corresponding to 505 species from 14 orders, being herbivores and parasitoids the dominant groups. The area of the green roofs was positively linked to total species richness, species richness of most functional feeding groups, and total abundance of arthropods. The community composition of arthropods on green roofs was also affected by their area, and by the green cover in the landscape. Moreover, green roofs with higher plant richness, mainly spontaneous, and less isolated (both vertically and horizontally) favored entomophagous arthropods. Other variables, such as age and vegetation cover of the green roofs, were also important for herbivores, predators, parasitoids and detritivores. Our study clearly demonstrates that green roof size is not all that matters for supporting arthropod biodiversity because promoting high plant diversity, allowing spontaneous ecosystem dynamics, and diminishing roof isolation foster entomophagous arthropod diversity. Our study is the first that considers multiple factors of roofs in South America and provides key knowledge for stakeholders interested in the development and management of this green infrastructure in semi-rural and urban landscapes.

AB  - In southern Patagonia, fire and domestic herbivory are the main disturbances affecting native forest dynamics. The effects of disturbances such as fire and livestock on the diversity and structure of plant communities depends on the intensity of these disturbances and the characteristics of the stand type. The overall objective of this study was to evaluate changes in forest diversity and structure under varying intensities of fire and livestock disturbances in Nothofagus antarctica forests in three different stand types. Two types of disturbances, fire and cattle, were evaluated at three different intensities; maximum disturbance, medium disturbance and no disturbance in high, medium and low stand types. Ecological and structural parameters were calculated for each experimental unit and their corresponding interactions. Diversity increased for the three stand types at maximum and medium disturbance intensities. Herbaceous cover increased for the three stand types at maximum and medium disturbance intensities. Shrub cover decreased in the high and medium stands due to the disturbances, but not in the lower stands. Understanding the responses of plant communities to fire and domestic livestock disturbances under different intensities and stand types is fundamental to predict the dynamics of native vegetation recovery and to guide sustainable management practices for each stand type.

AB  - The idea that several small, rather than a single large, habitat areas should hold the highest total species richness (the so-called SLOSS debate) brings into question the importance of habitat fragmentation to extinction risk. SLOSS studies are generally addressed over a short time scale, potentially ignoring the long-term dimension of extinction risk. Here, we provide the first long-term evaluation of the role of habitat fragmentation in species extinction, focusing on 22 large mammal species that lived in Eurasia during the last 200 000 years. By combining species distribution models and landscape pattern analysis, we compared temporal dynamics of habitat spatial structure between extinct and extant species, estimating the size, number and degree of the geographical isolation of their suitable habitat patches. Our results evidenced that extinct mammals went through considerable habitat fragmentation during the last glacial period and started to fare worse than extant species from about 50 ka. In particular, our modelling effort constrains the fragmentation of habitats into a narrow time window, from 46 to 36 ka ago, surprisingly coinciding with known extinction dates of several megafauna species. Landscape spatial structure was the second most important driver affecting megafauna extinction risk (ca 38% importance), after body mass (ca 39%) and followed by dietary preferences (ca 20%). Our results indicate a major role played by landscape fragmentation on extinction. Such evidence provides insights on what might likely happen in the future, with climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation acting as the main forces exerting their negative effects on biodiversity.

AB  - Precommercial thinning and tree pruning are frequently used together to improve timber quality and wildlife habitat in even-aged Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) stands. Thinning enhances crop tree growth and understory plant production; however, the benefits and drawbacks of tree pruning have received less attention. Tree pruning was investigated in two long-term experiments on the Tongass National Forest, Alaska, USA. Experiment 1 tracked four uniformly thinned sites for similar to 30 years that received 2.4, 3.6, and 5.2 m lift, and no pruning treatments. Experiment 2 tracked 11 sites for 16 years that received thinning/no pruning, thinning plus pruning (25% of trees), thinning plus pruning (50% of trees), and no thinning/no pruning treatments. We investigated (i) how pruning lift height affects tree form and understory production and (ii) how pruning density affects canopy closure and understory production. In Experiment 1, pruning reduced butt log taper and did not adversely affect diameter or height in either species. Pruning lift was visible in height-to-live crown measurements. Crown recession occurred first in low lift treatments and later in all treatments until crown form was similar after 28-31 years. Epicormic branching rates in Sitka spruce peaked 6-9 years after treatment before falling sharply. Deer forage declined through time and did not differ between lift treatments. In Experiment 2, canopy closure was lower shortly after thinning and pruning, but did not differ from the control after 16 years. Epicormic branching rates were greater shortly after thinning and pruning but did not differ from the control after 16 years. Deer forage declined with canopy closure and thinned and pruned treatments exhibited greater forage than the control. We conclude that pruning can improve log quality for timber applications but does not enhance understory plant biomass and deer forage over thinning treatment alone.

AB  - Aim: How much stronger would the effects of herbivorous mammals be in natural ecosystems if human-linked extinctions and extirpations had not occurred? Many mammal species have experienced range contractions, and numerous species have gone extinct in the late Quaternary, completely or in large part linked to human pressures. Therefore, herbivore consumption rates in seemingly natural ecosystems will deviate from their pre-anthropogenic state. Here, we estimate the size of this deviation.
   Location: Terrestrial systems, globally.
   Time period: Current.
   Major taxa studied: All late-Quaternary terrestrial mammals.
   Methods: We estimated and mapped vegetation consumption rate by all late-Quaternary terrestrial mammals. We did this through the estimation of natural densities and dietary needs. We mapped their consumption rate in both current ranges and present-natural ranges, that is estimated ranges in the absence of human-linked range contractions and extinctions. We compared these estimated consumption rates to current net primary productivity (NPP). We summarized the results across ecosystem types everywhere as well as for only the last remaining wilderness areas.
   Results: We estimate that wild mammals consume a median of 11% of NPP (at the scale of 96.5 km x 96.5 km grid cells) in current natural areas and that this would have been much higher in the absence of extinctions and extirpations, namely 21%. Looking at the change per grid cell, the mammal losses result in a median 42% reduction in consumption rate. Importantly, we estimate very similar declines in herbivory in what are considered the last remaining wilderness areas.
   Main conclusions: Our results suggest that the natural interaction of mammalian herbivores with vegetation in ecosystems across the world is strongly reduced by prehistoric and historic to recent species losses, even in the last remaining wilderness areas, likely with major effects on ecosystem structure and functioning.

AB  - Whether environmental conditions under exotic tree plantations abandoned in the Western Ghats of India can facilitate the natural regeneration of tropical montane forest (Shola forest) tree species is being debated. In many cases, the exotic tree plantations are being cleared to allow for the restoration of native ecosystems. In this paper, we examined whether exotic tree plantations have indeed a negative effect on the regeneration of Shola forest tree species. For this, we assessed the abundance, diversity, and composition of the regeneration of Shola forest tree species in plantations, each with different dominant tree species (Acacia mearnsii, Pinus sp., and Eucalyptus sp.). We tested the abundance of regenerating native tree species against the main plantation canopy species (plantation type) as well as other environmental factors (aspect, distance to nearest Shola forest, structural diversity, slope, elevation, presence of herbivores, and canopy closure). We found that the number of native tree species regenerating in all plantation types was at an acceptable level: 1960, 1773, and 462 individuals ha-1 for Acacia, Eucalyptus, and Pinus plantations, respectively. A rare fraction analysis showed that the highest number of Shola tree species were regenerating under Acacia mearnsii (25) followed by Eucalyptus (19) and Pinus (8) plantations. The density and diversity of regenerating Shola trees was greatest under Acacia plantations and northern aspects but declined with increasing elevation. The presence of herbivores also reduced the density and diversity of Shola tree regeneration. We concluded that the restoration of Shola forest in the Western Ghats is possible in existing stands of exotic tree species and this process can be accelerated with appropriate silvicultural methods. We additionally recommend that studies involving long-term exclosures can provide valuable insights into the effects of browsing on regeneration and species composition.

AB  - The southern slopes of the Himalayas, with their significant altitudinal gradients and diverse climates and habitats, harbour exceptional biodiversity and serve as crucial habitats for endangered pheasant species in Asia. However, increasing human disturbances pose severe threats to local ecosystems. Understanding the distribution patterns of endangered pheasants and their responses to environmental changes is vital for their conservation. This study utilised infrared camera traps combined with the Joint Species Distribution Model and the MaxEnt model to analyse the spatial distribution patterns of Satyr Tragopan (Tragopan satyra) in the southern Himalayas and predict its future responses to climate change. The results indicate that Satyr Tragopan is primarily distributed in riverine forests at altitudes between 2700 m and 3600 m. Its occupancy probability was significantly influenced by altitude, human activity disturbances, and forest cover proportion. Species co-occurrence patterns revealed a significant positive correlation between Satyr Tragopan and Hill Partridge, Mainland Serow, and Chinese Goral, suggesting similar habitat requirements or mutualistic relationships. MaxEnt model predictions indicated that, under future climate scenarios, the suitable habitat for Satyr Tragopan is projected to increase, particularly expanding westwards into Nepal under the SSP245 scenario. However, owing to its limited dispersal ability and poor habitat connectivity, the survival of Satyr Tragopan remains threatened. This study emphasizes the importance of enhancing habitat connectivity, establishing new protected areas, and reducing habitat fragmentation, thus providing a scientific basis for the long-term conservation of pheasants on the southern slopes of the Himalayas.

AB  - Shrub cover in alpine meadows around the world has experienced significant changes during the past 20 yr. An increase in shrub cover has often been associated with large influences in ecosystem functions. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the impact of shrub cover on herbaceous forage quality and yak grazing efficiency on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Forty-eight yak steers were randomly assigned to four grazing pastures with different shrub cover rates (control, low, middle, and high). The whole grazing period was categorized as vegetative stage Uune to July), bloom stage (August to October), and senescent stage (November to December). Herbaceous forage chemical composition and body weight of yaks were measured, and serum and rumen samples were analyzed. Although shrub cover had no effect on herbaceous forage chemical composition and serum biochemical parameters of yaks, total herbaceous forage production in pastures and crude protein intake of yaks decreased with increasing shrub cover. Such changes decreased average daily gain of yaks. As expected, increasing the herbaceous forage maturation significantly decreased crude protein content while increased dry matter, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber contents, consequently, reduced herbaceous forage crude protein and organic matter intakes and average daily gain of yaks. The rumen of yaks has higher ammonia nitrogen and total volatile fatty acid concentrations and butyrate proportion in the bloom stage of forage compared with those of the senescent stage. The results indicate that shrub cover on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau needs a certain level of control for the sustainable grazing yak production, although it has little negative effect on blood health and rumen fermentation. Additionally, it is vital to select the optimum time to market livestock or supplement feed with yaks during the cold season on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2020 The Society for Range Management.

AB  - Reducing grass standing crop by grazing may increase forbs and benefit wildlife that depend on forbs. However, precipitation and soil texture also strongly influence forb standing crop. We determined if standing crop of forbs selected by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.) is more strongly influenced by grazing or precipitation. Ungulates typically graze in patches with greater standing crop than the surrounding vegetation. Our second objective was to determine if predicted relationships of forb standing crop with grazing, precipitation, and percent sand were similar with less productive sites included or excluded from models. We estimated standing crop of grasses and forbs in 50 paired grazing exclosures and grazed plots on each of six 2 500-ha study sites. Standing crop of forbs selected by white-tailed deer (selected forbs) was strongly related to precipitation and percent sand but not estimated percent use of grasses. For our second objective, we examined grazing effects on forbs by removing pairs of exclosures and grazed plots from the data where grass standing crop in nongrazed exclosures exceeded the average standing crop of grass after grazing. Percent use of grasses did not influence selected forb standing crop when we included only productive patches. For overall forb standing crop in productive patches, percent use of grasses and percent sand interacted. Forbs declined with increasing percent use of grasses in less sandy soils and increased with percent use of grasses in sandy soils. Grazing is not useful to increase forbs selected by white-tailed deer in our study sites because standing crop of selected forbs is more strongly dependent on precipitation and soil texture than on grazing. Grazing did influence forb standing crop in productive areas, which suggests accounting for grazing effects in productive versus less productive areas of the landscape provides insight into herbivore-vegetation relationships.

AB  - 1. Climate change is generating extreme climate events, affecting ecosystem integrity and function directly through increases in abiotic stress and disturbance and indirectly through changes in the strength of biotic interactions. As consumers play an essential role in ecosystem functioning and have been shown to be highly sensitive to climate conditions, improved understanding of their role under changing environmental conditions is necessary to accurately anticipate climate change impacts on ecosystem integrity.

We evaluated if prolonged periods of extreme rain, a climatic event increasing in severity in many places around the world, and coincident increases in coastal flooding duration intensify consumer control of foundational salt marsh grass structure and quantify the consequences of flooding-consumer interactions on salt marsh range extent. To achieve this, we analysed: historic trends in crab grazing; crab numbers and activity in and out of rainy years on the low marsh edge; vegetation retreat from the low marsh edge at a plot scale in a manipulative exclosure experiment; vegetation retreat at a landscape-scale from drone image analyses; and the vertical erosion in the lowest edge of an Argentinean salt marsh.
   3. During flooded periods, crabs congregated in the low marsh, resulting in localized overgrazing of salt marsh grass and the rapid horizontal retreat of the marsh edge (98.5 cm on average). Salt marsh edge retreat resulted in a loss of similar to 4.5% of the total marsh area at the landscape scale. Inside crab exclusion plots, although grass cover declined slightly during the study period, the marsh edge did not retreat.
   4. Synthesis. This study provides experimental evidence that an extreme climate event can destabilize a local consumer-prey interaction, indirectly triggering the range contraction of a critical coastal habitat. This work contributes to a growing body of research demonstrating that consumers can be unleashed, rather than suppressed, by extreme climatic events. Moreover, in cases where consumer fronts form during such events, the result can be not only local (along habitat edges) but also landscape-scale extinction of foundation species and the habitats they biogenically create. Together, this supports the general idea that models of future climate scenarios integrate the indirect effects on ecosystem-regulating food web interactions.

AB  - Conservation of elusive species affected by habitat degradation, population fragmentation and poaching is challenging. The remaining wild populations of a desert-adapted ungulate, Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana), within Oman are small and fragmented. The appropriateness of captive insurance populations for reinforcing existing, or establishing new, wild populations remains uncertain for Oman due to ambiguity regarding their genetic provenance. For effective management of this threatened species, it is essential to assess the genetic relationships between the wild and captive populations, and to investigate hybridisation with domestic goats (Capra hircus). We identified 5,775 high-quality SNPs using double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD), to assess genetic structure, gene flow and divergence between Oman's wild populations of Nubian ibex and in captivity, which are likely of North African provenance. We detected hybridisation with goats in captivity and recommend that genetic assessments of captive individuals are routinely used to evaluate their suitability for conservation programs. Building on previous mitochondrial evidence, substantial nuclear divergence (F-ST = 0.540) was found between wild Oman and captive populations, providing further evidence that Nubian ibex may be composed of multiple species and urgently needs a taxonomic review. Additionally, an appropriate insurance population should be established for Oman's threatened wild population. The data provided here will be invaluable for developing marker systems to assess wild populations using low-quality DNA from non-invasive sampling. Consequently, it will support further research into Nubian ibex throughout their range and highlights the need to integrate genetic information for effective conservation management of Nubian ibex.

AB  - Wildlife managers are implementing programs to reduce abundant populations of large herbivores, such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in eastern North America, with renewed research interest in understanding these programs' ecological effects. To examine plant community change following culling of white-tailed deer in oak (Quercus spp.) forests in Ohio, USA, we measured browse severity on tree seedlings and cover of 43 deer-sensitive, native indicator plant species across 20 years spanning pre- (2002-2015) and post- (2016-2021) deer culling periods. After culling halved deer abundance from 16.7 deer/km 2 to 8.6 deer/km(2), browse patterns on tree seedlings reversed from most seedlings exhibiting browse damage to most being undamaged. Cover of deer-sensitive indicator plants increased 7-fold in the 6 years after deer culling. Five of 6 indicator plant groups (e.g., Liliaceae) and 32 of 43 indicator species (74%) increased in cover after deer culling. Rhizomatous, clonally reproducing and early flowering (May-Jun) species were generally most responsive. The rapid increase in deer-sensitive plants after deer culling in our study is among the fastest and largest reported among eastern North American studies. The plant community resilience observed in this study could partly relate to the relatively short duration (similar to 10 yr) that deer populations were elevated before culling began, allowing persistence of local plant regeneration potential. Deer culling enabled a moderate deer population to coexist with a rising sensitive plant population.

AB  - Few studies have evaluated the relative importance of various factors in the invasion of exotic plants in freshwater ecosystems due to the difficulty of observing numerous factors simultaneously. In this study, we surveyed 236 exotic aquatic plant communities using 2267 quadrats in China's freshwater ecosystems to explore the roles and relative importance of various biotic and abiotic factors in the invasion of exotic aquatic plants. We found that competition from native plants was the most important factor determining the mean biomass of all exotic plants in communities, as well as the biomass of the submerged plant Cabomba caroliniana and the free-floating plant Eichhornia crassipes. Whereas competition from co-occurring exotic plants was the most important for the biomass of the emergent plant Alternanthera philoxeroides. Elevated water nutrient status accelerated the invasion of exotic plants by directly favoring them and indirectly weakening the resistance of native plants. Exotic plants responded differently to climate. Moreover, water depth, habitat area, herbivory, and anthropogenic disturbance had relatively weak impacts on the biomass of exotic plants. Our study highlights the necessity and priority of biodiversity conservation and vegetation restoration in controlling invasive aquatic plants. It also emphasizes the significance of considering interactions between invaders in the research and management of invasive species.

AB  - Metrics of structural vegetation complexity derived from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have been used extensively in studies on plant ecology, animal behavior and the distribution of biodiversity. However, the acquisition of remotely-sensed data from the air and the surveying of biological information on the ground are often temporally disjunct and collected in different seasons. It is assumed that seasonal variation in vegetation structure is not substantive enough to affect landscape-level correlational analyses, but this assumption has never been explicitly tested in savanna ecosystems. Moreover, phenological differences in vegetation are thought to adversely affect the comparability of LiDAR measurements from different seasons, but these effects have seldom been tested and could depend on data resolution. We used repeat ultrahigh-resolution LiDAR data (>100 points/m2) acquired in the wet and dry season in Kruger National Park, South Africa, to evaluate the consistency of the spatial distribution of vegetation structural complexity across the landscape. We computed 16 commonly used metrics of vegetation complexity (derived from LiDAR canopy height models and point clouds), and found that patches of the landscape that were vegetatively complex in the wet season LiDAR data remained so in the dry season LiDAR dataset (although phenological differences were detected within individual patches). We repeated our analysis at a thinned point cloud density of 10 points/m2 and found that seasonal consistencies were not resolution dependent. Our findings provide validation for correlational studies that employ seasonally disjunct LiDAR and field data.

AB  - Sapling recruitment in hardwood forests is often suppressed by overstory shade, interspecific competition, and browsing pressure from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman). In some northern hardwood stands, these three interacting factors may cause persistent recruitment failure of the dominant canopy species, sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), into the sapling size class. In this study, we compared initial (two-year) sugar maple and hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana ((Mill.) K. Koch) seedling and sapling recruitment in strip clearcuts to strip selection cuts, with combinations of herbicide and deer exclosures, in a northern hardwood forest with limited sugar maple sapling recruitment. We found that sugar maple sapling recruitment was higher in exclosures, particularly in strip clearcuts. Moreover, mixed models predicted that exclosures in strip clearcuts with herbicide tended to benefit sugar maple sapling recruitment, especially when the pre-treatment density was less than similar to 1500 stems ha(-1). Sapling density of hophornbeam was also promoted in exclosure plots but was negatively affected by herbicide. Graminoid and Rubus spp. cover was also limited by herbicide following harvest, potentially alleviating constraints on future sugar maple sapling recruitment. Our findings indicate that sugar maple sapling recruitment in strip clearcuts is similar to strip selection cuts unless browsing pressure and interspecific competition are also alleviated.

AB  - The variability of annual precipitation and grazing are primary drivers shaping the structure and function of plant communities in grasslands. Yet it remains unclear on a mechanistic understanding of how annual precipitation and grazing affect the plant community structure, function, and their linkage via direct or indirect pathways. We measured the plant community structure (plant traits, species abundance, and plant diversity), total aboveground biomass, total cover, and species covers in plant communities in responses to annual precipitation variability from 2014 to 2017 and grazing pressure comprising 0, 0.93, 1.82, and 2.71 sheep ha(-1) in a desert steppe. Two-way ANOVAs, ordinary least square regressions, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to test the impacts of annual precipitation variability and grazing pressure on the plant community structure and function. Results showed that higher annual precipitation of 2016 and 2017 increased the relative abundances of forbs; grazing pressure increased the relative abundances of dominant grasses [Stipa breviflora Griseb. and Cleistogenes songorica (Roshev.) Ohwi], but decreased those of subdominant forbs (Convolvulus ammannii Desr. and Artemisia frigida Willd.). Plant traits, such as leaf nitrogen concentration, regulated plant species abundance directly or indirectly via affecting sheep diet selection. Annual precipitation variability and grazing pressure independently regulated plant diversity, aboveground biomass, and total cover, which the former had larger effects. There was slower decrease in grass biomass than that in forb biomass with increasing grazing pressure, indicating that dominant grasses are resilient to grazing but subdominant forbs are sensitive due to their distinct difference in sward palatability. The positive correlation between plant diversity and aboveground biomass was driven by both annual precipitation variability and grazing pressure. These highlight direct and indirect (via traits and abundances of plant species) effects of annual precipitation and grazing in shaping the structure and function of desert steppe ecosystems.

AB  - Advanced regeneration, in the form of tree seedlings and saplings, is critical for ensuring the long-term viability and resilience of forest ecosystems in the eastern United States. Lack of regeneration and/or compositional mismatch between regeneration and canopy layers, called regeneration debt, can lead to shifts in forest composition, structure, and, in extreme cases, forest loss. In this study, we examined status and trends in regeneration across 39 national parks from Virginia to Maine, spanning 12 years to apply the regeneration debt concept. We further refined the concept by adding new metrics and classifying results into easily interpreted categories adapted from the literature: imminent failure, probable failure, insecure, and secure. We then used model selection to determine the potential drivers most influencing patterns of regeneration debt. Status and trends indicated widespread regeneration debt in eastern national parks, with 27 of 39 parks classified as imminent or probable failure. Deer browse impact was consistently the strongest predictor of regeneration abundance. The most pervasive component of regeneration debt observed across parks was a sapling bottleneck, characterized by critically low sapling density of native canopy species and significant declines in native canopy sapling basal area or density for most parks. Regeneration mismatches also threaten forest resilience in many parks, where native canopy seedlings and saplings were outnumbered by native subcanopy species, particularly species that are less palatable deer browse. The devastating impact of emerald ash borer eliminating ash as a native canopy tree also drove regeneration mismatches in many parks that contain abundant ash regeneration, demonstrating the vulnerability of forests that lack diverse understories to invasive pests and pathogens. These findings underscore the critical importance of an integrated forest management approach that promotes an abundant and diverse regeneration layer. In most cases, this can only be achieved through long-term (i.e., multidecadal) management of white-tailed deer and invasive plants. Small-scale disturbances that increase structural complexity may also promote regeneration where stress from deer and invasive plants is minimal. Without immediate and sustained management intervention, the forest loss we are already observing may become a widespread pattern in eastern national parks and the broader region.

AB  - Invasive woody species produce significant ecological and economic threats globally, disrupting native biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Detecting factors that favour nonnative species recruitment could help design management strategies to reduce their negative impacts. In the Patagonian steppe, nonnative pines affect larger areas, which is a growing problem. The native community is distributed in patches dominated by cushion shrubs, with vertical and deep roots, and tussock grasses, with shallow roots. Cushion shrubs may facilitate pine recruitment by generating a nurse effect. Meanwhile, shallow roots of grasses could function as a recruitment filter as soil growing space is already occupied. We monitored Pinus contorta saplings in 4m2 plots. We determined distance to nearest seed source, quantified shrub and grass cover and neighbouring root biomass under each sapling. 82% of saplings recruited next to shrubs (shrub cover = 37%), up to 200 m from seed source. These saplings were 20% taller and had 80% less neighbouring root biomass than next to grasses. Only 10% recruited next to grasses (grass cover = 19%), only up to 50 m from the seed source. The remaining 8% recruited in bare ground (bare ground cover = 44%). Shrubs facilitate pine recruitment by promoting nonnative conifer growth and reducing belowground competition, while grasses and bare ground inhibit it. Our results can be used to help design invasive pine management strategies, such as promoting high-density sheep grazing (holistic ranching), which could reduce the abundance of both pines and shrub species around plantations.
   Las especies le & ntilde;osas invasoras suponen amenazas ecol & oacute;gicas y econ & oacute;micas a nivel global, alterando biodiversidad nativa y funciones ecosist & eacute;micas. Detectar los factores que favorecen el reclutamiento de especies no nativas podr & iacute;a ayudar a dise & ntilde;ar estrategias de manejo para reducir sus impactos negativos. En la estepa patag & oacute;nica, los pinos no nativos afectan & aacute;reas cada vez mayores. La comunidad nativa se distribuye en parches dominados por arbustos en coj & iacute;n, con ra & iacute;ces profundas y verticales, y pastos cespitosos, con ra & iacute;ces superficiales. Los arbustos podr & iacute;an facilitar el reclutamiento de pinos por efecto nodriza, mientras que los pastos, con sus ra & iacute;ces superficiales, podr & iacute;an ejercer un filtro al ocupar el suelo. Monitoreamos renovales de Pinus contorta en parcelas de 4m(2), determinamos distancia a fuente de semillas, cobertura de arbusto y pastos y medimos biomasa radical bajo cada renoval. El 82% de los renovales reclutaron junto a arbustos (cobertura arbustiva=37%), hasta a 200m de la fuente de semillas y fueron 20% m & aacute;s altos que junto a pastos. Solo el 10% reclut & oacute; junto a pastos (cobertura de pastos=19%), hasta 50m de la fuente, con una biomasa radical 80% mayor que junto a arbustos. El 8% restante reclut & oacute; en suelo desnudo (cobertura suelo desnudo=44%). Los arbustos facilitan el reclutamiento de pinos, mientras que los pastos y el suelo desnudo lo reducen. Nuestros resultados pueden emplearse para dise & ntilde;ar estrategias de manejo de pinos invasores, como el uso de pastoreo ovino en alta densidad (manejo hol & iacute;stico), para reducir la abundancia de pinos y especies arbustivas alrededor de las plantaciones.

AB  - This study compares species composition, abundance, biomass, and several other factors by which sedentary megafaunal and macrofaunal assemblages at depths between 14 m and 55 m on the Hueneme Shelf in southern California, USA, can be characterized. It details fundamental differences between these assemblages in this study area and demonstrates how little we know about a diverse range of attributes that are important in describing and evaluating infaunal assemblages. It provides strong support for a recent claim that: "The soft-sediment seafloor of the open continental shelf is among the least-known biomes on Earth, despite its high diversity and importance to fisheries and biogeochemical cycling" (Toma.sovych and Kidwell, 2017). Basic and applied research after the 1950s transformed infaunal ecology from a discipline focused primarily on long-lived sedentary megafauna (analogous to 'trees' on land) into a field concentrating on opportunistic or ephemeral macrofauna (analogous to 'weeds' on land). Based on findings of this study, macrofaunal assemblages play a subordinate role in ecosystem dynamics. Most research in recent decades has overlooked contributions by sedentary megafauna. This focus leads to a poor understanding of the dynamics of these widespread ecosystems, severely undervalues their ecological importance and production, underestimates impacts of anthropogenic activities on unconsolidated sediments as well as the duration of recovery trajectories following disturbances. Sedentary megafaunal and macrofaunal assemblages were quite different in virtually all aspects assessed during this analysis. Although macrofauna in this study had far greater species richness and were far more abundant than sedentary megafauna, conservative estimates for megafaunal biomass and secondary production indicate these organisms contribute substantially more energy to higher trophic levels than macrofauna. In addition, the megafaunal assemblages are characterized by many influential `ecosystem engineers'. Consequently, the differences in numbers of species and individuals are irrelevant with regard to determining value to the ecosystem. Megafauna in this area also exhibited more sensitivity in environmental factors. They live substantially longer than macrofauna, likely leading to greater stability in megafaunal assemblages. These differences indicate that current approaches focusing on macrofauna severely undervalue infaunal resources and contributions to higher trophic levels. They imply that studies of megafaunal assemblages should provide considerably greater insight into ecosystem dynamics and secondary production than macrofaunal assemblages and would have greater power to predict or assess environmental degradation or change, and document or predict recovery trajectories.

AB  - Wildlife -vehicle collisions (WVCs hereafter) have become a significant global challenge for biodiversity conservation and management. Understanding factors that drive collisions is crucial for devising management policies and plans. Field surveys were conducted in 2019 to collect data on the physical and ecological features of the study area in each 875 m segment, and species death records were collected from government agencies between 2015 and 2019. This study identified the most important factors that influence WVCs, and we predicted the WVC hotspot along the East-West highway of Banke and Bardia National Parks in western Nepal using the kernel density estimation function in Arc GIS 10.5. We performed Binomial regression analysis to identify the most important factors associated with WVCs. Results showed that geographic factors such as topography, presence of retaining walls, canals/drainage, land use or land cover, forest land, agricultural land, grassland, and barren land have negative influence on WVCs, whereas speed breaker and aspect exhibit a positive influence. We found that WVCs are more likely to occur near forest land than agricultural land, grasslands, and barren land. We also found that the presence of the retaining wall, cannel/drainage, and speed breakers increased the likelihood of WVCs events. Mammals like spotted deer, Axis axis (27 %) and wild boars, Sus scrofa (21 %) are the most frequently affected species in wildlife -vehicle collisions. Due to the unavailability of data from the park office, this study does not include species like insects, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and small mammals. Animal -friendly infrastructures like wildlife crossings (overpass/underpass), canopy bridges, conservation signage and reflectors near the hotspot can reduce WVCs. In addition, alternative roads outside the park area can be constructed to divert vehicle movement and reduce collisions in the national park area.

AB  - Species interactions structure ecological communities through direct and indirect pathways with ecosystem-wide implications. Despite mounting interest in the importance of indirect interactions, empirical evidence remains limited. Here, we demonstrate the critical role of parasite-mediated competition in driving community outcomes in a multi-species system of conservation and management concern. We leveraged 2 years of detection/non-detection data of moose (Alces alces) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and parasite loads in faecal samples within a hierarchical abundance-mediated interaction model to test hypotheses regarding interactions between these cervids and their shared parasites (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis, Fascioloides magna). We demonstrate that moose occupancy was limited by parasite-mediated competition, with no evidence of population-level effects of direct competitive interactions between moose and white-tailed deer. Such evidence of the importance of indirect interactions and resulting community outcomes is critical for species conservation and managing range contractions due to increasing pressures from habitat loss, disease and climate change.

AB  - Wild boar populations have increased worldwide, but the consequences of their disturbances on boreal forest ecosystems are largely unknown. We investigated how wild boars affect soil processes in a Swedish boreal forest. We estimated effects on ecosystem functioning using phospholipid fatty acid analyses (PLFA) to characterise microbial groups, and by measuring soil respiration, soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations, as well as the availability of NO3- and NH4+. We compared samples collected inside wild boar enclosures with adjacent reference areas without wild boar disturbance. We found no difference in soil microbial composition, except for a consistently higher fungi:bacteria ratio in the enclosures. These results are contrary to our hypothesis that rooting raises nitrogen levels, which in turn result in more bacteria. Soil nutrient levels showed inconsistent patterns, suggesting that substrate changes - as opposed to nutrient changes - stimulated fungal growth. Soil respiration was lower in the enclosures, contradicting earlier findings suggesting increased soil CO2 emissions from wild boar rooting. Overall, our study suggests that increased wild boar abundance has a minor impact on soil processes in boreal forests. Future studies should determine if the modest impacts remain across time and boreal forests.

AB  - Temperate grassland ecosystems are one of the most threatened ecosystems worldwide, and their loss endangers the grassland songbirds that rely upon them. This guild of birds has shown long-term declines in North America. At the same time, American bison (Bison bison) are becoming more common through reintroductions, and they may make significant modifications to grassland songbird habitat. To support conservation for this guild, we sought to understand the importance of bison grazing and ecosystem productivity to the species richness, occupancy, and abundance of this avian community. We conducted dependent double-observer bird counts, measured bison grazing intensity with patty counts, and used remote-sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data to measure ecosystem productivity. Our work took place in the National Bison Range near Moiese, Montana and in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. We found that species richness was positively correlated with patty counts and had a weak negative correlation with NDVI. Occupancy probability for six of seven grassland songbird species was positively correlated with patty counts, and for six of seven species was negatively correlated with NDVI. Abundance of vesper sparrow (Pooecetes graminueus) and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta) were positively correlated with patty counts, although for western meadowlark, this trend became less positive with increasing patty counts. Our work suggests that managers may want to encourage a broad range of bison grazing intensities to ensure that vegetative conditions related to bison grazing are present for all species.

AB  - Thyroid hormones play a role in the control of seasonal reproduction in wild and domestic ruminants such as red deer and sheep. Horn growth shows an inverse relationship with reproductive activity, but the effect of thyroid function on the regulation of the seasonal pattern of horn growth is unknown. This work examines the seasonal pattern of plasma thyroxine concentration, and its effect on testosterone secretion and seasonal changes in horn growth, in male Iberian ibexes (Capra pyrenaica). Plasma testosterone, plasma thyroxine, and horn growth were measured over a year in four males kept under natural photoperiod conditions. In another four, thyroxine was administered coinciding with the period of physiological reduction in plasma testosterone (January-February). In the first four, seasonal changes in the plasma concentration of thyroxine were detected with the highest concentrations recorded in October, November, and December, coinciding with the greatest testosterone secretion. In the second four, thyroxine treatment affected neither plasma testosterone concentration nor horn growth. The plasma concentrations of testosterone and thyroxine appear to be closely related in the ibex, but the seasonal pattern of horn growth does not seem to be modulated by seasonal changes in thyroxine.

AB  - The hog deer Axis porcinus formerly occurred in south-west China but has not been recorded there since 1965. To investigate the current status of the species in China, we conducted interviews, and transect and camera-trap surveys during October 2018-June 2020 to search for signs of hog deer across its historical range in the country. We interviewed 50 local inhabitants and surveyed 14 line transects in four counties of Lincang City, Yunnan Province. The camera traps were deployed in Nangunhe Nature Reserve (39.4 km of transects, 82 camera stations, 15,120 camera days) and Daxueshan Nature Reserve (41.1 km of transects, 68 camera stations, 13,554 camera days). We found no hog deer tracks and no hog deer were trapped by cameras. The floodplain grasslands preferred by hog deer along Nanting River have been transformed into agriculture plantations and human settlements. Our findings suggest that hog deer may have been extirpated from China, most likely as a result of habitat loss and overhunting. The conservation priorities for this species in China are the establishment of a protected area in the Nanting River watershed, restoration of habitat and reintroduction of individuals from range countries.

AB  - Questions Livestock management in rangelands depends on the production of plant biomass. Biomass production is driven by the temporal and spatial variability in precipitation, but our understanding of how precipitation variability mediates grazing effects on biomass production is still fragmented. Along a 600-km precipitation gradient we extracted biomass data to ask the questions: (a) what are the effects of grazing intensity on biomass production; (b) does grazing intensity interact with plant species richness to affect biomass production; and (c) how do plant functional groups respond to grazing and precipitation? Location Mongolia. Methods Biomass was sampled along 15 grazing intensity transects within the precipitation gradient over two consecutive years. We modeled spatial variability in above-ground plant biomass using mixed-effects models. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were combined with field-sampled biomass data to correct for inter-annual precipitation variation. The effects of species richness were modeled with respect to possible interactions with grazing intensity, and the composition of plant functional groups was modeled with respect to possible interactions between grazing intensity and precipitation. Results Biomass was negatively correlated with grazing intensity and this effect increased as precipitation increased. Biomass was positively correlated with species richness in both years, but the strength of this effect and the interaction between species richness and grazing intensity differed between 2014 and 2015 in line with highly variable precipitation between both years. The plant functional groups grasses, sedges, legumes, wormwood and forbs had contrasting responses to grazing and precipitation. Conclusion Biomass production in drylands is more vulnerable to changes in precipitation variability and grazing intensities in relatively moist and productive rangelands than in dry and unproductive ones. Future rangeland management needs to address potentially increasing precipitation variability in order to promote desired forage plants, and to preserve the positive effects of biodiversity for biomass production.

AB  - While agricultural intensification and habitat loss are cited as key drivers of moth decline, these alone cannot explain declines observed in UK woodlands - a habitat that has expanded in area since 1968. We quantified how moth communities changed across habitats and regions and determined how species traits interacted with habitat in predicting moth abundance change. We hypothesised that, in woodlands, species more vulnerable to shading and browsing by deer (species specialising on forbs, shrubs and shade-intolerant plants) had declined more severely than other species, and that moth decline in woodlands was more severe at sites more susceptible to deer damage. We modelled abundance, biomass, species richness and diversity from 1968 to 2016 and explored how these interacted with habitat and region. We also modelled the interaction between habitat and two moth species traits: larval feeding guild and shade-tolerance of hostplant. Moth declines were consistently highest in broadleaf woodland. Abundance, biomass, species richness and diversity declined significantly by -51%, -52%, -14% and -15% in woodlands, respectively, compared to national trends of -34%, -39%, -1% (non-significant) and +10%. Declines were no greater in woodlands more susceptible to deer browsing damage. Traits based analysis found no evidence that shading and intensive browsing by deer explained moth declines in woodland. Moth decline was more severe in broadleaf woodlands than in intensively managed farmlands. We found no evidence that deer browsing or increased shading has driven these trends: the primary cause of the decline of moths in woodlands remains unclear.

AB  - The Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) has experienced dramatic range and population contractions over the last century. Conservation efforts for this felid focused on captive breeding and identification of suitable conditions for reintroductions. With this study, we unravelled historical collaring and direct observations data to understand the spatial use of the last leopards recorded in the region of Israel and the West Bank (IWB). Through datasets of leopard occurrence, we characterised suitable habitats, assessed niche overlap with the Arabian leopard's main prey, the Nubian ibex (Capra nubiana), and evaluated their distributions with respect to currently protected habitats. We estimated home-ranges employing area-corrected density kernel methods and investigated suitable conditions through multiple scales habitat modelling. Average home ranges for the population were 73.24 +/- 47.91 km2 and 77.46 +/- 54.94 km2, depending on the time lag adopted. Ecological response to predictors highlighted reliance by both predator and prey on the same habitat characteristics, suggesting they occupied essentially identical niches. These characteristics were intermediately rugged topographic conditions and high indices of vegetation in scarcely populated desert environments, mostly encompassed within protected areas. The distribution of leopard and ibex overlapped substantially according to several metrics. Notably, more than half of potential habitat for both species is encompassed by protected areas and military zones. Given the coincidence in their ecological requirements, and highly congruent distributions, an important step towards future reintroduction of Arabian leopards will include gaining a better understanding of ibex populations, alongside attention to the practicality of enforcing habitat protection.

AB  - The walia ibex Capra walie is endemic to the Simien Mountains, Ethiopia, and is a national symbol. The Simien Mountains National Park was established in 1966 to protect the last 200 walia ibexes from extinction. We coordinated a population census across their c. 100 km2 range in 2015 and annually during 2019-2024. We counted 865 walia ibexes of all age and sex classes in 2015; this dropped to 650 in 2019-2021, reducing further to 306 in 2024. We investigated this decline through interviews with representatives from neighbouring communities including park personnel, village elders, farmers, local authority staff and militia. More than 70% of those interviewed attributed the drop in walia ibex numbers to poaching, both for food and medicinal purposes. Instability as a result of the Covid-19 crisis and the 2021-2022 war was seen as the fundamental cause. A species action plan is in preparation to mobilize local community ambassadors and increase protection. A database of individually recognized walia ibexes would increase our understanding of population dynamics and distribution to complement the annual counts. We recommend a change of the species' IUCN Red List status from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered based on the recent, severe population decline and limited extent of occurrence. This status update would accurately reflect the high extinction risk of the walia and help to mobilize resources for urgent conservation actions.

AB  - AimsLivestock production is the most widespread land use globally and occurs across a diverse set of ecosystems. Variability in long-term livestock grazing impacts across ecosystems is poorly characterized, particularly at larger spatial scales, despite strong relationships with various ecosystem services related to soil fertility and stabilization and vegetation productivity. Here we examine the effects of grazing on vegetation and the implications for resistance and resilience to global change. MethodsWe use six long-term research stations in the western United States, spanning two ecoregions, multiple ecosystems, and 311 total site-years of research. Across these sites we evaluate convergence and divergence of vegetation response to grazing vs grazing removal, focusing on interactions with drivers of global change. ResultsWe found that at long time scales (multiple decades), grazing has numerous convergent and divergent effects across ecoregions and ecosystems. Similarity among precipitation patterns and plant traits linked to grazing and production timing were key elements explaining convergence or divergence in long-term patterns of livestock grazing response. Ecosystem differences across western US rangelands are also associated with variable effects of grazing on resistance and resilience to invasive species and climate change. ConclusionsThese results suggest that unique ecosystem or ecoregion responses to future global change may result from complex interactions between grazing and environmental factors, such as precipitation timing and plant traits. Adapting livestock and grazing management to specific ecosystem vegetation and climate variability is needed to manage for the myriad global changes affecting rangeland production and diversity.

AB  - Analysis of enamel stable carbon isotopes (delta C-13(enamel)) of fossil herbivores is an important tool for making inferences about Plio-Pleistocene vegetation structure in Africa and the environmental context of hominin evolution. Many palaeoecological studies implicitly or explicitly assume that individual variation in C-3-C-4 plant consumption among fossil herbivores directly reflects the abundance of C-3 (trees, shrubs) or C-4 (low-altitude tropical grasses) vegetation. However, a strong link between delta C-13(enamel) of herbivores and ecosystem vegetation structure has not been rigorously established. Here we combine delta C-13(enamel) data from a large dataset (n = 1,643) with multidecadal Landsat estimates of C-3 woody cover across 30 African ecosystems to show that there is little relationship between intrataxonomic variation in delta C-13(enamel) and vegetation structure. This is especially true when removing forested ecosystems (>80% woody cover)-which numerous lines of evidence suggest are rare in the Plio-Pleistocene fossil record of eastern Africa-from our analyses. Our findings stand in contrast with the common assumption that variation in herbivore delta C-13(enamel) values reflects changes in the relative abundance of C-3-C-4 vegetation. We conclude that analyses using herbivore delta C-13(enamel) data to shed light on the environmental context of hominin evolution should look to explicitly community-level approaches for making vegetation inferences.
   Combining a published dataset of stable carbon isotopes from herbivore tooth enamel with multidecadal Landsat estimates of C-3 woody cover across 30 African ecosystems, the authors show that there is little relationship between intrataxonomic variation in delta C-13 enamel and vegetation structure, leading them to recommend a community-level approach for making vegetation inferences.

AB  - Wetlands provide vital services on which human societies depend. As they have been rapidly degrading due to anthropogenic impacts worldwide, wetland restoration is increasingly applied. When a return to the original state of a wetland is constrained, forward-looking restoration can provide a new way to enhance an ecosystem's ecological integrity. However, the direction in which new ecosystems will develop is strongly coupled to the initial environmental conditions and may benefit from active decisions on (future) management. To improve the natural values of a degrading freshwater lake in the Netherlands, a forward-looking restoration project was initiated in lake Markermeer in 2016, involving the construction of a 700-ha archipelago called the "Marker Wadden". This archipelago should provide new habitat to higher trophic levels in the lake's food web through the development of currently missing Common reed (Phragmites australis) dominated marshlands with gradual land-water transitions. However, the restoration project faces strong grazing pressure by Greylag geese (Anser anser) that possibly inhibit reed establishment. Here, we aimed to unravel the effect of herbivory by Greylag geese (using exclosures) and the introduction of reed rhizomes on early vegetation development and carbon dynamics on the bare soils of this new ecosystem in a manipulative field experiment. Our results showed that excluding herbivores strongly increased reed-vegetation cover, density and maximum height, but only when reed rhizomes were actively introduced. Spontaneous vegetation development on bare soils was limited, and colonization by Broadleaf cattail (Typha latifolia) dominated over reed. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon and ecosystem respiration were strongly linked to vegetation development, with highest methane emissions in the most densely vegetated plots. We conclude that the establishment of reed marshes can strongly benefit from excluding herbivores and the introduction of reed, and that otherwise other vegetation types may establish more slowly in newly created wetlands. This illustrates how active management of vegetation development has the potential to benefit novel ecosystems.

AB  - Spatial and temporal partitioning often facilitates species coexistence. We used camera traps to study habitat use and spatio-temporal interactions among three large carnivores-tiger, leopard, and dhole-in two national parks in Thailand where key prey species (sambar, gaur) were scarce from overhunting. The availability of remnant sambar was the strongest determinant of tiger occupancy. Leopard occupancy was positively related to the presence of wild pig. Dhole occupancy was negatively associated with sambar, opposite to tiger. Results of two-species occupancy modeling did not support our hypothesis that leopard would be excluded from tiger-occupied zones, but leopard detectability was seven times lower in the presence of tigers, indicative of fine-scale avoidance. Dhole avoidance of sambar might have been a tactic by which dhole avoided tigers. All three carnivores were mainly diurnal and thus had high temporal overlap (> 80%). Tiger density may have been too low (0.36/100 km2) to compel temporal avoidance by leopard and dhole where they overlapped. Our results suggest that low density populations of tigers and leopards can overlap in habitat use and temporal activity, despite the potential for intensified competition due to prey scarcity. Dholes were widespread despite scarcity of large ungulates, and seem more resilient to the loss of large-bodied prey than tigers. MWKL has an important role in conserving dholes, which are declining globally.

AB  - Grazing affects plant community characteristics and the relationship between above-ground biomass and diversity, which has become a hot topic in grassland ecosystem research in recent years. The present study investigated grassland vegetation in the Two Rivers pastoral area based on 60 sampling points using sampling methods. The effects of grazing on the structural characteristics of plant communities were analysed using the alpha-diversity index, and the relationship between species diversity and the above-ground biomass of plant communities, as well as their changes, was explored. The results showed that grazing disturbance decreased the number of family species in the grassland plant communities and the similarity between communities; grazing activities significantly decreased the above-ground biomass of the grassland plant communities; the height and cover also showed a decreasing trend (p < 0.01), but the density of the grassland plant communities improved (p < 0.01). The Margalef index, the Shannon-Wiener index, and the Simpson index of the grassland plant communities all showed different degrees of decrease after grazing, while the Alatalo index showed an increase; biomass was positively correlated with the Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, and Alatalo indices and negatively correlated with the Simpson index (p < 0.01). Therefore, in the management and maintenance of grasslands, the impact of grazing on the structural characteristics of plant communities should be taken into account, and reasonable response policies should be implemented according to the actual local situation. This study provides a theoretical basis for grassland maintenance and management and the sustainable development of ecosystems in the pastoral areas of the two river sources of the Altay Mountains.

AB  - The vulnerability of grassland ecosystems in the Mongolian Plateau has increased due to climate change and human intervention, and thus herdsmen must adopt additional livelihood adaptation strategies. In this study, we determined the impact of the livestock structure, that is, the proportion of sheep and goats in the livestock population, on grassland coverage on the Mongolian Plateau (Mongolia and the Nei Mongolia Autonomous Region of China). By applying a fixed effect model and mediating effects model to a unique combination of statistical and remote sensing data for 20 border provinces/banners from 2007 to 2016, we found that a higher proportion of sheep and goats led to grassland degradation, and the grassland type (i.e., whether among the top 50% in terms of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) could alleviate the negative impact of a high proportion of sheep or goats on grassland coverage. The results obtained by the mediating effects model showed that the primary industry gross domestic product (GDP) had a masking effect, where it could mitigate the negative influence of sheep or goats on grassland coverage. Regional heterogeneous analysis did not provide significant results for Mongolia due to its relatively stable livestock structure, but the livestock structure in Nei Mongolia had a greater negative impact on grassland coverage, thereby further indicating that a decrease in the proportion of sheep and goats had a greater ecological benefit.

AB  - 1. Introduced large herbivores have partly filled ecological gaps formed in the late Pleistocene, when many of the Earth's megafauna were driven extinct However, extant predators are generally considered incapable of exerting top-down influences on introduced megafauna, leading to unusually strong disturbance and herbivory relative to native herbivores.
   2. We report on the first documented predation of juvenile feral donkeys Equus africanus asinus by cougars Puma concolor in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of North America. We then investigated how cougar predation corresponds with differences in feral donkey behaviour and associated effects on desert wetlands.
   3. Focusing on a feral donkey population in the Death Valley National Park, we used camera traps and vegetation surveys to compare donkey activity patterns and impacts between wetlands with and without cougar predation.
   4. Donkeys were primarily diurnal at wetlands with cougar predation, thereby avoiding cougars. However, donkeys were active throughout the day and night at sites without predation. Donkeys were similar to 87% less active (measured as hours of activity a day) at wetlands with predation (p <0.0001). Sites with predation had reduced donkey disturbance and herbivory, including similar to 46% fewer access trails, 43% less trampled bare ground and 192% more canopy cover (PERMANOVA, R-2 = 0.22, p = 0.0003).
   5. Our study is the first to reveal a trophic cascade involving cougars, feral equids and vegetation. Cougar predation appears to rewire an ancient food web, with diverse implications for modern ecosystems. Our results suggest that protecting apex predators could have important implications for the ecological effects of introduced megafauna.

AB  - Current understanding of the distribution of vegetation and large mammalian herbivores (LMH) is based on a combination of biogeographic studies and highly controlled field experiments, but a more complete understanding of these patterns requires study of their natural co-occurrence patterns at intermediate spatial scales. The study was conducted in the 120 -ha Mpala Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) plot, Kenya. We examined differences in herbaceous plant communities and habitat use by LMH among three topographic habitats with distinct soil types, namely steep slopes, valley and plateau. Each pair of habitats differed in plant and animal composition. The steep slopes and plateau respectively had =1 -fold higher percentage herbaceous cover than the valley, whereas the steep slopes and valley had >1.5 -fold greater grass species richness and diversity than the plateau. The activity of LMH was =1.7 -fold higher in the valley than the steep slopes and plateau, reflecting a positive relationship between LMH activity index and richness and diversity of grass species. Results indicate that fine -scale variation in topography and soil are associated with both the distribution of herbaceous vegetation and LMH, suggesting a need to account for local habitat characteristics when examining the distributions of plants, animals, and plant-herbivore interactions in natural systems.

AB  - QuestionsFire regime alterations are pushing open ecosystems worldwide past tipping points where alternative steady states characterized by woody dominance prevail. This reduces the frequency and intensity of surface fires, further limiting their effectiveness for controlling cover of woody plants. In addition, grazing pressure (exotic or native grazers) can reinforce woody encroachment by potentially reducing fine-fuel loads. We investigated the effects of different fire energies on the herbaceous plant community, together with mammalian wildlife herbivory (exotic and native combined) exclusion, to inform best management practices.LocationTexas semi-arid savanna, southern Great Plains, USA.MethodsWe conducted an experiment in which we manipulated fire intensity and herbivore access to herbaceous biomass in a split-plot design. We altered fire energy via fuel addition rather than applying fire under different environmental conditions to control for differences in standing biomass and composition attributable to differential plant physiological status and fire season.ResultsHigh-energy fire did not reduce herbaceous biomass or alter plant community composition, although it did increase among-plot variability in composition and forb biomass relative to low-energy fire and non-burned controls. Grazing pressure from native and non-native mammalian herbivores reduced above-ground herbaceous biomass regardless of fire treatments, but did not alter community composition.ConclusionsManagers seeking to apply high-intensity prescribed fire to reduce woody encroachment will not negatively impact herbaceous plant productivity or alter community composition. However, they should be cognizant that repeated fires necessary for greatly reducing woody plants in heavily invaded areas might be difficult to accomplish due to fine-fuel reduction from wild herbivores. High fencing to restrict access by wildlife herbivores or culling might be necessary to build fuels sufficient to conduct high-intensity burns for woody-plant reduction.
   We conducted an experiment manipulating fire energy and herbivore access to herbaceous biomass in a well-replicated, split-plot design. Managers seeking to apply high-intensity prescribed fire to reduce woody encroachment will not negatively impact herbaceous plant productivity or alter community compositional trajectories. However, exotic herbivores greatly reduce fine fuels.image

AB  - The expansion of trees into previously grass- and shrub- dominated ecosystems is a global phenomenon threatening ecosystem integrity and function in encroached systems, including the North American sagebrush biome. This ecosystem is currently in peril, threatened in part by juniper (Juniperus sp.) encroachment. Sagebrush (Artemisia sp.) ecosystems contain a diversity of forage, including grasses, forbs, and shrubs, that serve as a key food source for vertebrate herbivores. Removal of encroached juniper has been used by land managers as a widespread restoration technique in sagebrush ecosystems, however, the long-term impact of this restoration action on shrubs and understory vegetation has not been thoroughly examined in the context of sagebrush dependent vertebrate herbivores. In 2020 and 2021, we studied shrub and understory vegetation response to juniper treatment in the sagebrush of northern Nevada and northeastern California. Juniper treatments completed between 2008 and 2020 were surveyed and sampled to assess the impact of this restoration action on grasses, forbs, and shrubs over time. Forage biomass was higher in old treatments than untreated reference sites, which was a trend that persisted across all vegetation functional groups. Differences in plant cover were slight or had inconsistent nonlinear trends between reference sites and treatments. Forage from treated sites had higher crude protein levels than forage from untreated sites, although the nutritional difference was slight. Our results suggest that juniper treatments that increase forage quantity and improve forage quality may benefit sagebrush dependent wildlife or domestic livestock in coniferencroached ecosystems.

AB  - Invasive and alien plant species (IAPS) are considered as major threats to native biodiversity because TAPS alter ecosystem structure and their functions. We assessed the association of four major IAPS(A likania micrantha, Chtomolaena odorata, Lantana camara, and Parthenium hysterophorus) and the abundance of wild ungulates in Barandabhar Corridor Forest (BCF), Chitwan, Nepal. We collected data on the presence of wild ungulates in IAPS invaded habitats through direct observation and sign surveys. Our study showed that the cover of Al. micrantha was significantly high in Sal forest (Prominence value PV = 73.23) followed by riverine forest (PV = 40.5) and grassland (PV = 37.7) whereas P. hysterophorus was high in grasslands (PV = 22.9). Similarly, C. odorata was significantly high in Sal forest (PV =141.6%), and L. camara was high in mixed forest (PV = 22.6). It was found that there was a significant negative association of IAPS (p = 0.002) with wild ungulates. The abundances of deer and wild pigs were more in the buffer zone than in the non-buffer zone. The abundance of deer decreased with increasing cover of C. odorata, M. micrantha, and P hysterophorus (p = 0.002). Similarly, the abundance of wild pigs decreased with increasing cover of M. micrantha and L. camara. IAPS were not uniformly distributed in different habitats and abundances of wild ungulates were less in IAPS invaded habitats. Hence, it is important to initiate management plans to control IAPS spread to avoid their negative impacts on wild ungulate population such as deer and wild pigs.

AB  - Butterflies and bees contribute significantly to grassland biodiversity and play important roles as pollinators and herbivores. Grassland conservation and management must be seen through the lens of insect conservation and management if these species are to thrive. In North America, grasslands are a product of climate and natural disturbances such as fire and grazing. These natural disturbances have changed considerably since European colonization and subsequent landscape fragmentation. The aim of this study was to better understand the impacts of fire and grazing management on butterfly and bee communities in tallgrass prairie, enabling land managers and conservationists to better protect and manage remnant prairie. We examined butterfly and bee abundance, species richness, and diversity in Minnesota tallgrass prairies managed by grazing or fire. In 2016 and 2017, we surveyed butterflies, bees, vegetation, and surrounding land use at 20 remnant prairies (10 burned and 10 grazed) with known management histories. Butterfly and bee abundance at our study sites were significantly negatively correlated. Butterfly abundance, but not species richness, was higher in burned than grazed prairies, and prairie-associated grass-feeding butterflies were more abundant at sites with higher plant species richness. Bee abundance was unrelated to management type but was higher at sites with sandier soils; bee species richness was positively associated with forb frequency. These findings highlight the challenges of designing management plans tailored to wide groups of pollinators and the potential pitfalls of using one group of pollinators as indicators for another. They also point to the importance of a mosaic of management practices across the prairie landscape.

AB  - Vegetation recovery in severely disturbed alpine ecosystems can be accelerated through active restoration measures. This study evaluated the short-term effects of two restoration treatments, planting of propagated native Salix (willow) shrubs in three different densities (1, 2.5, and 4 plants/m(2)) and seeding of the native grass Festuca ovina (sheep fescue), in a disturbed alpine heathland. We evaluated natural vegetation recovery (i.e. vegetation cover, vascular plant species richness, and Salix recruitment) in permanent plots, 5 years after the implementation of restoration measures. The results showed that both treatments had positive but different effects on vegetation recovery; Salix plantings (with densities >= 2.5 plants/m(2)) increased vascular plant species richness and recruitment of Salix seedlings, whereas seeding of F. ovina increased bottom and field layer cover. Our results also show the importance of soil conditions for vegetation recovery, as moister plots with a higher percentage of fine soil substrate had a higher vegetation cover and vascular plant species richness. This study shows that different restoration treatments can work complementary and also highlights the importance of considering different indicators of vegetation recovery when evaluating the effectiveness of restoration measures.

AB  - The Amazon is one of the most diverse biomes around the globe, currently threatened by economic and industrial development and climate change. Large mammals are keystone species, playing an important role in ecosystem structure and function as ecological engineers, while being highly susceptible to deforestation, habitat degra-dation, and human exploitation. Using a unifying hierarchical Bayesian spatial approach, we examine the site-use patterns of four large Amazonian Forest mammals and their relationships to anthropogenic factors at a biome -wide scale. Our results showed that species' patterns of site use are correlated with human induced habitat changes, and that this correlation is species-specific. The white-lipped peccary shows highest site-use estimates within strict protected areas, affected by proximity to urban areas and benefiting from indigenous territories, the tapir responding slightly to proximity to burned forested areas, while the giant armadillo and the jaguar were primarily affected by vegetation cover loss; disturbances related to the colonization of the Amazon. Our findings contribute to the understanding of how human-induced environmental changes influence the site-use patterns of these four large mammals, and inform future conservation and land use planning. Transboundary conservation efforts, empowering and integrating native (indigenous and non-indigenous) communities in land governance schemes, involving the private sector and securing the commitment of developed countries are important paths for the protection and sustainability of the globally-crucial Amazon rainforest.

AB  - Ungulate impacts on forest understory alter tree species composition, with cascading effects on forest functions and resilience against future climate conditions. Indeed, the ungulate browsing pressure on tree seedlings is species-specific and causes contrasted growth reductions that alter tree recruitment rates. Untangling the effects of browsing from the effects of the other factors driving regeneration success is required to guide the forest and ungulate management. In particular, Fagus sylvatica L. strongly dominates temperate Quercus-Fagus forests close to their climax, and it remains unclear if controlling ungulate populations can maintain tree species diversity in naturally regenerated forests. We addressed this question by monitoring 734 pairs of fenced and unfenced 6-m(2) plots across a broad gradient of Cervus elaphus L. abundance in Belgian Quercus-Fagus forests managed by continuous cover forestry. Seedling height, density, and vegetation cover were monitored from 2016 to 2021. Species diversity and ecological affinity for light, temperature, and atmospheric humidity conditions were computed from these measures. With ungulates, the mean growth of Betula pendula Roth. and Sorbus aucuparia L. was negligible, whereas, without ungulates, their growth was higher than the growth of other species. With ungulates, the growth of Fagus sylvatica L. and Picea abies (L.) H. Karst was higher than other species. Quercus (Quercus petreae (Matt.) Liebl and Quercus robur L.) growth was the lowest in all conditions. Finally, Carpinus betulus L. was heavily browsed but still grew higher than its competitors with ungulates. Ungulate browsing can then severely affect seedling growth and likely reduce the diversity of future recruited trees. In the study area, browsing unfavored the regeneration of the species that are less shade tolerant, more-drought tolerant, and more-heat tolerant. It thus accelerates the natural succession and reduces forest resilience to heat and drought events. Such an observation was found valid over a wide study area encompassing contrasting levels of Cervus elaphus L. abundance. Combining further reductions of ungulate populations with foodscape improvement is likely required to maintain species diversity in these forests.

AB  - Beta diversity measures the spatial variation in species composition. Because it influences several community attributes, studies are increasingly investigating its drivers. Spatial environmental heterogeneity is a major determinant of beta diversity, but canopy-forming foundation species can locally modify environmental properties. We used intertidal communities dominated by the canopy-forming alga Mazzaella laminarioides as a model system to examine how a foundation species affects spatial environmental heterogeneity and the resulting beta diversity. Since canopies were found to reduce the spatial variation of temperature and desiccation during low tides, we hypothesized that canopies would decrease understory beta diversity, which we tested through a field experiment that contrasted canopy removal with presence treatments over 32 months. The beta diversity of sessile species was always lower under canopies, but canopies never affected the beta diversity of mobile species. The observed responses for sessile species may result from their abundance being more dependent on spatial abiotic variation than for mobile species, which can occur in stressful areas while temporarily foraging or in transit to other areas. These responses may likely apply to other systems exhibiting canopy-forming foundation species hosting sessile and mobile species assemblages.

AB  - 1. The relationship of plant diversity and several ecosystem functions strengthens over time. This suggests that the restructuring of biotic interactions in the process of a community's assembly and the associated changes in function differ between species-rich and species-poor communities. An important component of these changes is the feedback between plant and soil community history.
   2. In this study, we examined the interactive effects of plant richness and community history on the trophic functions of the soil fauna community. We hypothesized that experimental removal of either soil or plant community history would diminish the positive effects of plant richness on the multitrophic functions of the soil food web, compared to mature communities. We tested this hypothesis in a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment by comparing plots across three treatments (without plant history, without plant and soil history, controls with similar to 20 years of plot-specific community history).
   3. We found that the relationship between plant richness and below-ground multitrophic functionality is indeed stronger in communities with shared plant and soil community history. Our findings indicate that anthropogenic disturbance can impact the functioning of the soil community through the loss of plant species but also by preventing feedbacks that develop in the process of community assembly.

AB  - The soil is the primary carbon pool in grassland ecosystems, and the turnover of plant roots is an essential way of organic carbon input. Grazing intensity under a single animal species is usually used to explore the effects of herbivores on grassland, but multi-species grazing is common in grassland utilization. However, few studies have examined the impact of different livestock species and herbivore combinations on the root growth of the grassland community. We used the minirhizotron method to explore the response of root growth in a temperate desert steppe community to cattle and sheep grazing over two years. Among root characteristics and environ-mental factors, grazing method(cattle grazing; sheep grazing; cattle and sheep grazing; no grazing) is the most significant inhibiting factor affecting root longevity. We found that mixed cattle and sheep grazing significantly reduced the root lifespan of the community, with a median survival time of 120 d, and a survival rate of only 30 % at the end of the observation period. Compared with other treatments, mixed cattle and sheep grazing significantly reduced the number of live roots (0.3724 +/- 0.0453 piece/cm(2)). The change in fine root length of mixed grazing (-0.012 +/- 0.0013 mm/cm(2)) was considerably greater than other treatments. The root lifespan of the community was significantly negatively correlated with the ratio of belowground to aboveground net pri-mary productivity (BNPP/ANPP). The mixed cattle and sheep grazing changed in the patterns of plant carbon contribution, and increased the organic carbon content of the soil. Therefore, under moderate grazing intensity, adjusting the combination of herbivores is an effective strategy to accelerate root turnover rate of the commu-nity, accelerate the input of carbon from plant photosynthesis into the soil carbon pool, and may increase soil carbon storage.

AB  - Grazing exerts a profound influence on both the plant diversity and productivity of grasslands, while simultaneously exerting a significant impact on regulating grassland soil carbon sequestration. Moreover, besides altering the taxonomic diversity of plant communities, grazing can also affect their diversity of functional traits. However, we still poorly understand how grazing modifies the relationship between plant functional diversity (FD) and soil carbon sequestration in grassland ecosystems. Here, we conducted a grazing manipulation experiment to investigate the effects of different grazing regimes (no grazing, sheep grazing (SG) and cattle grazing (CG)) on the relationships between plant FD and soil carbon sequestration in meadow and desert steppe. Our findings showed that different livestock species changed the relationships between plant FD and soil organic carbon (SOC) in the meadow steppe. SG decoupled the originally positive relationship between FD and SOC, whereas CG changed the relationship from positive to negative. In the desert steppe, both SG and CG strengthened the positive relationship between FD and SOC. Our study illuminates the considerable impact of livestock species on the intricate mechanisms of soil carbon sequestration, primarily mediated through the modulation of various measures of functional trait diversity. In ungrazed meadows and grazed deserts, maintaining high plant FD is conducive to soil carbon sequestration, whereas in grazed meadows and ungrazed deserts, this relationship may disappear or even reverse. By measuring the traits and controlling the grazing activities, we can accurately predict the carbon sequestration potential in grassland ecosystems.

AB  - ContextClimate change is considered an important factor affecting the distribution and genetic diversity of species. While many studies have described the influence of climate change on population structure at various scales, little is known about the genetic consequences of a changing climate on endemic species.ObjectivesTo assess possible changes in the distribution and genetic structure of the endangered Nilgiri tahr (Nilgiritragus hylocrius), which is endemic to the Western Ghats in India, under climate change and human disturbances.MethodsWe integrated tahr occurrence and nuclear DNA data with environmental geo-datasets to project the response of tahr populations to future climate change with respect to its distribution, genetic diversity and population structure. We screened the environmental variables using MaxEnt to identify a manageable set of predictors to be used in an ensemble approach, based on ten species distribution modelling techniques, to quantify the current tahr distribution. We then projected the distribution and genetic structure under two climate change scenarios.ResultsWe found that suitable habitat for tahr (9,605 km(2)) is determined predominantly by a combination of climatic, human disturbance and topographic factors that result in a highly fragmented habitat throughout its distribution range in the Western Ghats. Under the severe high emissions RCP8.5 scenario tahr populations may lose more than half of their available habitat (55.5%) by 2070. Application of spatial Bayesian clustering suggests that their current genetic structure comprise four genetic clusters, with three of them reflecting a clear geographic structure. However, under climate change, two of these clusters may be lost, and in the future a homogenization of the genetic background of the remaining populations may arise due to prevalence of one gene pool cluster in the remaining populations.ConclusionsOur interdisciplinary approach that combines niche modelling and genetic data identified the climate refugia (i.e., the remaining stable habitats that overlap with the current suitable areas), where the tahr populations would be restricted to small, isolated and fragmented areas. Essential factors to avert local extinctions of vulnerable tahr populations are a reduction of human disturbances, dispersal of tahr between fragmented populations, and the availability of corridors.

AB  - Questions: (1) Is the co-dominance of grasses and shrubs a general feature of Patagonian steppes? (2) At a local scale, does it change with domestic grazing intensity or decadal changes in precipitation?Locations: Question 1. Patagonia region in southern South America. Question 2. Shrub-grass steppes (45 & DEG;24 & PRIME;S, 70 & DEG;17 & PRIME;W) subjected to different grazing intensity for decades.Methods: We sampled vegetation to estimate perennial grass and shrub cover at two scales: regional and local. At the regional (phytogeographical) scale, we sampled grazed steppes under different climates and soils (n = 324 sites over ca. 487,000 km(2)). At the local scale, we sampled paddocks subjected to known grazing management, from commercial intensive densities of sheep to total (experimental) exclusion. Also, in the same site, we sampled permanent plots (25 years old) in a grazing exclosure to study the effects of precipitation variation.Results: Mixed communities are the predominant form of community organization in the Patagonia region. At the regional scale, shrub cover was negatively related to grass cover and communities where shrubs had higher cover than grasses represent 54% of the data set. At the local scale for an arid steppe, perennial grasses had higher cover than shrubs, regardless of grazing pressure. The shrub-to-grass ratio was increased only by intensive grazing. Permanent plots in a grazing-excluded paddock indicate that decadal xeric or humid climate periods decrease or increase total cover, respectively. Surprisingly, the relative shrub-to-grass ratio did not change significantly.Conclusions: Although perennial grasses and shrubs cover are negatively correlated, they coexist in the Patagonian steppes under a wide range of climate, soil and grazing conditions. At a local scale, selective herbivory promotes species replacement but did not substantially change the life-form covers. Water shortages, as well as periods of water surplus, similarly affect both life forms without compromising their coexistence.

AB  - Eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) are an important game bird in the United States, particularly in the Southeast. The introduction of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) can negatively affect native wildlife, habitat quality, and ecosystem functions. To explore the potential effects that pig presence, through habitat degradation and interspecific competition, may have on wild turkeys, we evaluated changes in occupancy of co-occurring wild pigs and wild turkeys.We deployed camera-monitored bait stations on 3 wildlife management areas in Arkansas during January-April 2017-2019 and collected >680,000 images to determine turkey and wild pig occurrence. We evaluated presence/absence of turkeys and wild pigs in camera trap images using Timelapse2 image analyzer software (R) and then used program MARK to create 2-species occupancy models and determine the effect of wild pig presence and various landscape covariates on the occupancy and detectability of wild turkeys. The occupancy rate of wild pigs was 50.4% (95% CI = 46.9%-54.0%) and included positive relationships with the percent cover of deciduous forest and the number of wildlife openings within 500 m. The occupancy rate of turkeys increased from 45.5% (95% CI = 39.3%-51.6%) when wild pigs were not present to 59.4% (95% CI = 45.2%-73.5%, 95%) when wild pigs were present, indicating a tendency of the 2 species to select for similar environmental conditions (Species Interaction Factor = 1.13). Detectability of turkeys decreased when wild pigs occupied a site at any point during the season, regardless of whether or not the wild pigs were detected during the same trapping occasion. The decrease in detectability suggests a possible short-term displacement of turkeys by wild pigs. This displacement can have indirect effects through alteration of breeding behaviors and altered habitat use patterns, and these indirect effects represent an important topic for research moving forward.

AB  - The degradation of grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has severely impacted the region's ecology and productivity, subsequently affecting the dietary niche of the region's herbivores. Currently, little is known about the dietary strategies of plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae), an important species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau ecosystem, or freely grazing yaks (Bos grunniens) in response to grassland degradation. Fecal samples from plateau pikas and yaks were collected from degraded grasslands in the southwestern part of the plateau. The feeding habits and interactions between plateau pikas and yaks were investigated using chloroplast trnL-P6 amplification and sequencing technology to determine how these have changed given different levels of grassland degradation. The results indicated that alterations in food resources due to grassland degradation led to significant differences in the proportions of shared food types consumed by yaks and pikas; hence, these species adjusted their dietary breadths to mitigate the adverse effects of grassland degradation. As grassland degradation intensified, the proportion of shared food types between yaks and plateau pikas increased, suggesting that grassland degradation may increase dietary competition between these two species.

AB  - In the analysis of a multi-host/multi-parasite system and its associated risk factors, it is particularly interesting to understand the natural dynamics among pathogens, their hosts, and the environment in wildlife populations. This analysis is particularly feasible in a scenario where multiple overlapping host populations are present in high densities, along with a complex community of parasites. We aimed to describe and analyze the naturally occurring lungworm polyparasitism in a wild ruminant community in Southeast Spain. The respiratory tracts of 250 specimens belonging to four different species (red deer, mouflon, Iberian ibex, and fallow deer) were studied. Almost half (48.0%) of the animals were infected with bronchopulmonary nematodes. Seven different nematodes were identified of which two genera (Protostrongylus spp. and Dictyocaulus spp.) and three additional species (Cystocaulus ocreatus, Muellerius capillaris, and Neostrongylus linearis) were recorded in at least two ruminants, with the mouflon as the commonest host. Our study shows a significant effect of host species and sampling area, plus a marginal effect of age, on parasite multivariate abundance at the host population level. Mouflon and adults of all hosts appear to carry the highest parasite load on average. From a spatial perspective, the highest parasite abundance was detected at the central part of the park.

AB  - Southeastern Europe is home to remnants of highly diverse open ecosystems, including grasslands and forest- steppe. To understand the impacts of climate changes, fire disturbance, and herbivory on forest-grassland coexistence in this region, we integrated new and published paleoecological data from two sedimentary records in southeastern Romania with information on herbivore population dynamics and dietary habits. Our findings indicate that fluctuations in forest-grassland cover closely mirrored changes in regional growing season moisture availability in the Black Sea region. During periods with increased moisture availability (e.g. 6000-3800 cal yr BP), diverse broadleaved forest dominated by Quercus expanded. Conversely, more drought- tolerant herbaceous cover increased during drier intervals (7200-6800 and 3800-2000 cal yr BP). We identified a critical tree cover of 25-40% at Mangalia Herghelie and 25-55% at Lake Oltina where neither forest nor grassland dominated. Stable forest states emerged above 40% tree cover and 55% respectively, while grassland- dominated states had tree cover below 25%. Disturbances by fire and herbivores fluctuated over time, and were further influenced by human activity, which along with deforestation, altered the composition and extent of steppe and forest-steppe vegetation. High fire severity occurred during intermediate moisture conditions and tree cover (6800-5500, 3800-2800 cal yr BP), while low fire severity was observed when herbaceous biomass dominated (7200-7000, 2800-2000 cal yr BP) or under greater tree cover (5500-3800 cal yr BP). Herbivore dynamics shifted from large-bodied grazers in the Neolithic and early Eneolithic (7650-6550 cal yr BP; Prehamangia and Hamangia cultures) to a more diverse array of feeding types involving smaller domestic and wild herbivores along with sedentary agriculture during the flourishing Eneolithic (6550-5850 cal yr BP; Gumelnita culture), before returning to larger domestic grazers as well as omnivores in the Bronze and Iron Ages (3500-2000 cal yr BP). Large-bodied herbivores with selective diets (primarily grazers) had a more substantial effect on grasses compared to mixed feeders with bulk diets, whereas domestic herbivory was associated with increased apophyte abundance and diversity. Our findings underscore the essential factors for sustainable management of forest-grassland mosaics under changing climate conditions with projected accelerating aridification. They also highlight the need for continued research to enhance our understanding of these biodiverse, sensitive open ecosystems to inform effective management strategies.

AB  - Coastal ecosystems worldwide are being threatened by invasive plants in the context of global changes. However, how invasive plants influence native faunal communities and whether native faunal communities can recover following the invader removals/controls across global coastal ecosystems are still poorly understood. Here, we present the first global meta-analysis to quantify the impacts of Spartina species invasions on coastal faunal communities and further to evaluate the outcomes of Spartina species removals on faunal community recovery based on 74 independent studies. We found that invasive Spartina species generally decreased the biodiversity (e.g., species richness), but increased coastal faunal abundance (e.g., individual number) and fitness (e.g., biomass), though the effect on abundance was insignificant. The pattern of influence was strongly dependent on habitat types, faunal taxa, trophic levels, and feeding types. Specifically, Spartina species invasion of mudflats caused greater impacts than invasion of vegetated habitats. Insects and birds at higher trophic levels were strongly affected by invasive Spartina, indicating that invasive plant effects can cascade upward along the food chain. Additionally, impacts of Spartina invasions were more obvious on food specialists such as herbivores and carnivores. Furthermore, our analyses revealed that invader removals were overall beneficial for native faunal communities to recover from the displacement caused by Spartina invasions, but this recovery process depended on specific removal measure and time. For example, the long-term waterlogging had strong negative impacts on faunal recovery, so it should not be encouraged. Our findings suggest that invasive plants could have contrasting effects on functional responses of native faunal communities. Although invasive plant removals could restore native faunal communities, future functional restorations of invaded ecosystems should take the legacy effects of invasive species on native communities into account. These findings provide insightful implications for future scientific controls of invasive species and ecosystem restoration under intensifying global changes.

AB  - Artiodactyl prey species of Chile, especially guanacos (Lama guanicoe), are reported to be very susceptible to predation by pack-hunting feral dogs. It has been previously suggested that guanacos and endemic South American deer may have evolved in the absence of pack-hunting cursorial predators. However, the paleoecology of canid presence in southern South America and Chile is unclear. Here, we review the literature on South American and Chilean canids, their distributions, ecologies, and hunting behavior. We consider both wild and domestic canids, including Canis familiaris breeds. We establish two known antipredator defense behaviors of guanacos: predator inspection of ambush predators, for example, Puma concolor, and rushing at and kicking smaller cursorial predators, for example, Lycalopex culpaeus. We propose that since the late Pleistocene extinction of hypercarnivorous group-hunting canids east of the Andes, there were no native species creating group-hunting predation pressures on guanacos. Endemic deer of Chile may have never experienced group-hunting selection pressure from native predators. Even hunting dogs (or other canids) used by indigenous groups in the far north and extreme south of Chile (and presumably the center as well) appear to have been used primarily within ambush hunting strategies. This may account for the susceptibility of guanacos and other prey species to feral dog attacks. We detail seven separate hypotheses that require further investigation in order to assess how best to respond to the threat posed by feral dogs to the conservation of native deer and camelids in Chile and other parts of South America.

AB  - Integrated sheep-vineyard systems are an example of ecological intensification. Sheep can replace mulching, thereby reducing the input of fossil fuels and agrochemicals. However, knowledge about the co-benefits of sheep grazing for biodiversity is lacking. This study examined the impact of grazing on wild bee diversity within terraced vineyards and vineyard embankments. Additionally, dung beetle colonization of sheep dung was investigated in the wine-growing region of southwestern Germany. Five vineyards and their terrace risers (embankments) had been grazed by sheep for several years, typically in a rotational system, or were managed conventionally by mulching as control. Wild bee diversity was compared in five pairs of grazed and non-grazed vineyards and five pairs of grazed and non-grazed embankments within one year. Dung beetle diversity, reared from sheep dung collected at three grazed vineyards, was also assessed. In the vineyards, bee abundance and species richness did not differ between grazed plots and mulched controls, but bee abundance increased with flower abundance, and bee species richness increased with flowering herb species richness. In contrast, on vineyard embankments, both species richness and abundance of wild bees were higher on grazed embankments compared to control embankments, whereas flower cover did not have any effect. At least 20 different dung beetle species, including threatened ones, were recorded in sheep droppings of grazed vineyards. This additional food resource may support dung beetle populations, contributing to overall insect biomass, with potential relevance for nature conservation. Our study shows that sheep grazing may support dung beetles, but does not affect bees in vineyards. However, allowing sheep to access vineyard embankments for vegetation management supports wild bees. Therefore, sheep grazing in vineyards offers opportunities for biodiversity conservation and maintaining ecosystem functions, though is not an all-in-one solution.

AB  - Context. Ungulate life-history strategies and behaviour are driven by two dominant factors, namely, acquisition of nutrients and avoidance of predation. Although many studies have investigated single species resource/habitat selection, there are still gaps in our understanding of multi-species systems and resource partitioning. Aim. We explored the habitat selection of five sympatric resident ungulates in relation to seasonal phenological gradients in a temperate grassland (Northern Great Plains) system. We identified and compared habitat-utilisation strategies across the vegetation-growing season and related to established forage acquisition hypotheses. Methods. We collected ungulate detection data during two field seasons (July-October 2018, May-September 2019) across 202 sites and deployed 1202 cameras (29 284 camera-nights). We modelled ungulate detections in relation to normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and NDVI slope (rate and direction of change) to learn about ungulate resource selection in four habitat types (grass, prairie dog colonies, forest and riparian). Results. We found unique foraging strategies for each of the focal species throughout the growing season (spring, summer, early autumn), which resulted in seasonal partitioning of resources among sympatric ungulate species. Conclusions. The temporal and spatial patterns observed emphasise that multiple species can experience the same vegetation phenology and respond differently in their movements and foraging behaviour. At local scales, some ungulates selected for higher forage quantity (selection of higher NDVI) and some for higher forage quality (selection of positive NDVI slope or greening up). implications. The unique foraging strategies presented here indicated that generalisations are problematic when managing wildlife resources and emphasise the need to conduct multi-species studies to understand resource utilisation at local scales. Furthermore, understanding variation in foraging strategies of resident sympatric species can direct management planning where decreased connectivity or loss of migration pathways alters traditional behaviours.

AB  - Coral reefs are being impacted by myriad stressors leading to drastic changes to their structure and function. Fishes play essential roles in driving ecosystem processes on coral reefs but the extent to which these processes are emergent at temporal or ecosystem scales or otherwise masked by other drivers (for example, climatic events and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks) is poorly understood. Using time series data on fish community composition and coral and macroalgae percentage cover between 2006 and 2017 from 57 sites around Mo'orea, Polynesia, we found that fish community diversity predicts temporal stability in fish biomass but did not translate to temporal stability of coral cover. Furthermore, we found limited evidence of directional influence of fish on coral dynamics at temporal and ecosystem scales and no evidence that fish mediate coral recovery rate from disturbance. Our findings suggest that coral reef fisheries management will benefit from maintaining fish diversity but that this level of management is unlikely to strongly mediate coral loss or recovery over time.
   A comparison of fish community data with reef coral and macroalgae cover at several sites around Polynesia over 11 years and spanning disturbance events suggests that fish community diversity has only minimal influence on coral dynamics, including recovery from disturbance.

AB  - The common wombat (Vombatus ursinus) is the largest extant fossorial mammal in Tasmania. Fossorial mammals have substantial edaphic and geomorphic effects, which, in turn can affect vegetation. We asked whether wombat disturbances were associated with particular environments in an alpine environment in Tasmania, and whether, and to what degree, they altered topography, soil or vegetation. Soil analyses, vegetation surveys and topographic transects were used to test for the effects of wombat activity. We contrasted toilets and controls. We compared adjacent burrows, mounds and paths. We also mapped burrows and animal trails. Wombat burrowing created distinct topography and was linked to feeding areas by path systems. There was no difference in bulk density, pH or phosphorus among burrow mounds, paths and undisturbed areas. Burrow mounds, usually used as toilets, were higher in nitrogen (mg L-1) (9. 8 +/- 6.3) than either paths (2.3 +/- 2.0) or controls (1.08 mg L-1 +/- 1.5). Herbs were favoured by wombat disturbance, having a mean percentage cover of 27.8 +/- 4.1 on burrow mounds compared to 14 +/- 2.69 on controls, and a mean percentage cover of 51.6 +/- 7.8 in toilets compared to 25.6 +/- 4.8 in control plots. In contrast, shrubs have greater percentage cover in controls than on mounds (47.2 +/- 12.0 cf. 12.7 +/- 5.0) and toilets (37.3 +/- 10 cf. 17.8 +/- 6.5). Overall, wombat activity and modification of the alpine environment were concentrated in grassy vegetation above the winter water table, although paths, burrows and toilets extended into less grassy alpine communities. Our results imply that common wombats have a major role in engineering topography and soils with subsequent effects on vegetation, directly affecting at least 1.2% of the study area. Their reduction, or loss, is likely to lead to substantial changes in patterns of geodiversity and biodiversity.

AB  - Invasive species are increasingly spreading, particularly in rangeland ecosystems. It is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of different methods for controlling invasive plants in these ecosystems. This study aimed to investigate the effects of three strategies-21-year grazing exclusion (21-YES), mowing-grazing in rotation in alternate years (MGRS), and moderate grazing (MGS)- on the change in cover, density, and biomass of Leucanthemum vulgare Lam. (Ox-eye Daisy=OED) and the plant community. To accomplish this, three sites selected for each treatment. In 2021, 270 vegetation plots were sampled using a random systematic method. Subsequently, we recorded the density and canopy cover of all growth forms (forbs, grasses, and ferns), the OED biomass, and the ground cover. The results indicated that MGS reduced OED density, OED canopy, and OED biomass. Furthermore, this strategy demonstrated the highest density and canopy cover of the plant community (including total, forbs, grasses, and ferns). Additionally, the strongest correlation was observed between the total canopy and the OED density (R2=-0.91, -0.95, -0.94 in 21-YES, MGRS, and MGS, respectively), as well as between the total canopy and the OED canopy (R2=-0.51, -0.98, -0.97 in 21-YES, MGRS, and MGS, respectively). The MGS led to an increase in diversity indices. In general, the grazing strategy has proven to be effective in controlling the spread of invasive OED and has also resulted in an increase in canopy cover, density, and diversity indices of the plant community. The study highlights the importance of ongoing management efforts to control invasive species, with moderate grazing potentially serving as a more practical, culturally accepted, and cost-effective short-term control strategy for widespread rangeland weed infestations.

AB  - Wild ungulates play a pivotal role in shaping temperate Carpathian forests, with their feeding behaviour influencing for-est community dynamics, regeneration processes and overall ecosystem biodiversity. Thus, understanding their diet is essential for assessing foraging impacts, improving management strategies and ensuring ecosystem sustainability. This is especially important when facing challenges such as climate change and the continuous increase in deer populations across Europe over the last two decades, which has intensified pressure on forest ecosystems. The aim of our study was to investigate the spatio-temporal variation in red deer diet composition and to analyze key environmental factors driving observed dietary patterns across the Western Carpathians, Slovakia. We found that Carpathian red deer consumed a mixed diet, comprising 29.0% of graminoids and 70.4% of herbaceous plats with woody browse, characteristic of an intermediate feeder within the European landscape. As predicted, red deer primarily consumed herbaceous plants and woody browse year-round and did not switch to a grass-dominated diet in winter. We attribute this to the low availability of grasses dur-ing winter, which likely prevents red deer from shifting from summer browsing to winter grazing, despite strong selection for grasses in winter. We confirmed that differences in red deer diet composition between low and high elevations were driven by forage availability in these habitats. As forage availability is primarily determined by habitat composition, we concluded that the observed dietary differences resulted from variations in habitat structure rather than from changes in red deer feeding behaviour. Seasonal dietary patterns were influenced by human impact, followed by forage availability, deer density and wolf predation risk. Notably, human impact was the most significant factor shaping the summer diet at both low and high elevations and the winter diet at low elevations. Our findings demonstrate how red deer adjust their foraging behaviour flexibly in response to environmental constraints and provide important insights for management to reduce human impact in favourable habitats during critical life stages and recommends to regulate deer densities to prevent overgrazing of economically valuable regenerating forest stands. Our study further highlights the importance of imple-menting adaptive forest and wildlife management, which is essential for ensuring the long-term sustainability of forest ecosystems amid future challenges such as climate change and increasing wild ungulate populations

AB  - Daily activity in herbivores reflects a balance between finding food and safety. The safety-in-numbers theory predicts that living in higher population densities increases safety, which should affect this balance. High-density populations are thus expected to show a more even distribution of activity-that is, spread-and higher activity levels across the day. We tested these predictions for three ungulate species; red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). We used camera traps to measure the level and spread of activity across ten forest sites at the Veluwe, the Netherlands, that widely range in ungulate density. Food availability and hunting levels were included as covariates. Daily activity was more evenly distributed when population density was higher for all three species. Both deer species showed relatively more feeding activity in broad daylight and wild boar during dusk. Activity level increased with population density only for wild boar. Food availability and hunting showed no correlation with activity patterns. These findings indicate that ungulate activity is to some degree density dependent. However, while these patterns might result from larger populations feeling safer as the safety-in-numbers theory states, we cannot rule out that they are the outcome of greater intraspecific competition for food, forcing animals to forage during suboptimal times of the day. Overall, this study demonstrates that wild ungulates adjust their activity spread and level based on their population size.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of high grazing pressure for short, intermittent periods (1-2 h per day) on fuel load management in cork oak (Quercus suber L.) forests in the north-eastern region of Portugal. This evaluation aims to understand the effectiveness of targeted grazing as a forest management tool, specifically in reducing fuel load accumulation and thereby potentially reducing wildfire risk. In addition, this study extends its analysis to examine the time required for vegetation recovery in the absence of grazing, with the aim of determining the optimal grazing interval. Changes in herbaceous and shrub cover, herbaceous biomass and phytovolume were compared between grazed and ungrazed plots over a period of thirty-four months. Using a stocking rate of 400 goats per hectare for 21 cumulative hours over 12 days resulted in a 93.43% reduction in shrub phytovolume and a 76.2% reduction in shrub cover. Herbaceous biomass also decreased from 53.80 +/- 7.82 g m-2 to 17.76 +/- 6.29 g m-2 in the grazed areas. Twenty-two months after cessation of grazing, no significant differences in plant and shrub cover or herbaceous biomass were observed. The results highlight the effectiveness of targeted grazing in managing fuel loads in cork oak woodlands, with pronounced short-term benefits. However, the rapid recovery of vegetation in the absence of grazing highlights the need for a strategic and continuous management approach to maintain the benefits of fuel reduction.

AB  - The dung of Tibetan livestock serves as a natural fertilizer that plays a crucial role in maintaining plant productivity and restoration of degraded alpine grasslands. However, research on how livestock dung affects vegetation composition and soil quality in Tibetan alpine grassland on the time scale remains uncertain. We established three types of nutrients (yak dung, Tibetan sheep dung and urea) and control on a Tibetan alpine grassland in 2017, and measured the vegetation (species composition, aboveground biomass, composition of functional group biomass, and species diversity) and soil characteristics (soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)), and calculated the SOC/TN, SOC/TP and TN/TP ratios) at the end of August 2017, 2018, and 2019. The study aimed to compare the effect organic fertilizers (two Tibetan livestock dungs) and inorganic nitrogen fertilizer (urea) on vegetation characteristics and soil chemical properties, and to assess whether the livestock dung can improve soil nutrient availability level in degraded Tibetan alpine grassland. Our results showed that: (1) Tibetan sheep dung delayed the increase of aboveground biomass, and urea increased the aboveground biomass in 2017 and 2018; (2) yak and Tibetan sheep dungs and urea increased proportional biomass of aboveground grasses and plant species richness index in the three years; and (3) livestock dungs increased SOC, TN, the ratios of SOC/TP and TN/TP in 2018. Our study implies that yak and Tibetan sheep dung stimulated plant growth and altered soil nutrients, while alleviating soil nitrogen limitation in degraded alpine grasslands. The return of livestock dung to soil may be a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers in near-natural recovery of degraded Tibetan alpine grasslands.

AB  - Habitat loss affects the nature of biotic interactions in all ecosystems and at all levels of the food web. Nevertheless, little attention has been given to soil nematodes in tropical habitats despite their important role in ecosystem functioning worldwide. Here, we analyzed the influence of anthropogenic habitat disturbance on the absolute and relative density and composition (i.e., trophic guilds) of soil nematode communities associated with the rhizosphere of the tropical herb Heliconia collinsiana in continuous mature forests and human-induced secondary forests. We compared nematode densities based on the following feeding guilds: bacterivores, fungivores, herbivores and predators. Thereafter, we classified herbivorous nematodes into genera and described soil properties in both habitat types including pH, electrical conductivity, and organic matter content. Herbivores were significantly the most abundant feeding guild for both habitats represented by Criconemella spp., Helicotylenchus spp., and Meloidogyne spp., which showed no significant differences in density between habitats. Relative but not absolute nematode density differed between habitats, with fungivore nematodes being significantly lower in secondary forests. No significant differences in soil properties were detected. Overall, our results suggest that forest disturbance affects the nematode community associated with the rhizosphere of H. collinsiana which may affect forest succession and the dynamics of the soil biota. Our study contributes to the understanding of biotic interactions in conserved and disturbed tropical habitats.

AB  - The many publications on forests and moth communities accomplished in different sampling regions and habitat types have produced diverse results and conclusions. The multiplicity of outcomes requires regional or local investigations on forest traits and herbivores to determine optimal management methods to maintain biodiversity and ecological stability in woodlands. Our study focused on sessile oak-hornbeam forests, which are economically and ecologically significant in many European countries. Samplings were performed in 2011-2012 using portable light traps in a highly forested area in western Hungary. We used 16 variables for PCA from the sampling of vascular plants and the local forest management plan document. These newly created variables (i.e., principal components) were related (used generalized linear models) to different groups of sampled moth communities: Macrolepidoptera, Microlepidoptera, and ecological groups (according to the host vegetation layer). Based on these significant relations, thinning activity may have various effects on moth communities, through the changed light regime and microclimate conditions. Temperature growth in the gaps could lead to the increasing abundance of heat-preferred Lepidoptera species; however, the decreasing species richness of trees (as a result of thinning) is less favourable for moth assemblages. Increasing herb coverage supports moth communities in the investigated forest stands, which may also be induced by the lower canopy closure. Besides the increasing coverage in the lower vegetation layers, plant species richness is also an important element for moth communities; this was demonstrated by the negative relation between the PC4, PC6 (weighted toward coverage), and Lepidoptera groups. Our results supported the fact that a single study on forest management practice or on vegetation traits is not sufficient to indicate their exact effect on moth communities, because their influence is complex. In order to halt the loss in diversity of the examined forest type, we suggest an overall approach to define the optimal forest management practice and tree mixture rate, regarding a larger area.

AB  - Large structures are introduced into deep-water marine environments by several industrial activities, including hydrocarbon exploitation. Anthropogenic structures can alter ecosystem structure and functioning in many marine ecosystems but the responses on continental margins are poorly known. Here, we investigate the short-term response of benthic megafauna to the installation of a 56 km-long 30 cm diameter pipeline on the Angolan Margin (Block 31) from 700 to 1800 m water depth using remotely operated vehicle imagery. Clear depth-related patterns exist in the density, diversity and community structure of megafauna observed in 2013 prior to pipeline installation. These patterns are altered in a subsequent survey in 2014, three-months after pipeline installation. Significant increases in density, particularly in mid-slope regions are observed. Diversity is generally, but not consistently, enhanced, particularly in the shallower areas in 2014. Clear changes are noted in community structure between years. These changes are primarily caused by increases in the abundance of echinoderms, particularly the echinoid Phormosoma sp. indet. There was no evidence of colonisation of the pipeline in three months by visible fauna. The few large anemones observed attached to the pipe may be able to move as adults. The pipeline appeared to trap organic material and anthropogenic litter, and may enhance available food resources locally as well as providing hard substratum. These results indicate complex and ecosystem-dependent responses to structure installation and caution against simplistic approaches to environmental management.

AB  - In many regions of Europe, large wild herbivores alter forest community composition through their foraging preferences, hinder the forest's natural adaptive responses to climate change, and reduce ecosystem resilience. We investigated a widespread European forest type, a mixed forest dominated by Picea abies, which has recently experienced an unprecedented level of disturbance across the continent. Using the forest landscape model iLand, we investigated the combined effect of climate change and herbivory on forest structure, composition, and carbon and identified conditions leading to ecosystem transitions on a 300-year timescale. Eight climate change scenarios, driven by Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 and 8.5, combined with three levels of regeneration browsing, were tested. We found that the persistence of the current level of browsing pressure impedes adaptive changes in community composition and sustains the presence of the vulnerable yet less palatable P. abies. These development trajectories were tortuous, characterized by a high disturbance intensity. On the contrary, reduced herbivory initiated a transformation towards the naturally dominant broadleaved species that was associated with an increased forest carbon and a considerably reduced disturbance. The conditions of RCP4.5 combined with high and moderate browsing levels preserved the forest within its reference range of variability, defining the actual boundaries of resilience. The remaining combinations of browsing and climate change led to ecosystem transitions. Under RCP4.5 with browsing effects excluded, the new equilibrium conditions were achieved within 120 years, whereas the stabilization was delayed by 50-100 years under RCP8.5 with higher browsing intensities. We conclude that forests dominated by P. abies are prone to transitions driven by climate change. However, reducing herbivory can set the forest on a stable and predictable trajectory, whereas sustaining the current browsing levels can lead to heightened disturbance activity, extended transition times, and high variability in the target conditions.
   Large herbivores' browsing alters forest community composition. It also often compromises the forest's natural adaptive responses to climate change and management efforts. In Europe, pressure from herbivores coincides with a recent disturbance wave, which has particularly affected P. abies forests. We found that the persistence of the current browsing level impedes adaptive changes in these forests and sustains the vulnerable P. abies, which is not favored by game. Conversely, reduced herbivory initiates a transformation towards the naturally dominant broadleaved species, associated with considerably reduced future disturbance impacts. Therefore, game management is a crucial element in achieving ecosystem adaptation goals.image

AB  - Aim Climate warming reshuffles biological assemblages towards less cold-adapted but more warm-adapted species, a process coined thermophilization. However, the velocity at which this process is happening generally lags behind the velocity of climate change, generating a climatic debt the temporal dynamics of which remain misunderstood. Relying on high-resolution time series of vegetation data from a long-term monitoring network of permanent forest plots, we aim at quantifying the temporal dynamics - up to a yearly resolution - of the climatic debt in the understorey of temperate forests before identifying the key determinants that modulate it.
   Location France.
   Time period 1995-2017.
   Taxa studied Vascular plants.
   Methods We used the community temperature index (CTI) to produce a time series of understorey plant community thermophilization, which we subsequently compared to a time series of mean annual temperature changes over the same period and for the same sites. The direction and magnitude of the difference (i.e., the climatic debt) was finally analysed using linear mixed-effect models to assess the relative contributions of abiotic and biotic determinants, including forest stand characteristics.
   Results We found a significant increase in CTI values over time (0.08-0.09 degrees C/decade), whereas the velocity of mean annual temperature changes was three times higher over the same period (0.22-0.28 degrees C/decade). Hence, the climatic debt increased over time and was greater in forest stands with higher basal area or older trees as well as under warmer macroclimate. By contrast, a greater frequency of anthropogenic disturbances decreased the climatic debt, while natural disturbances and herbivory had no impact.
   Conclusions Although often overlooked in understanding the climatic debt of forest biodiversity, changes in forest stand characteristics may modulate the climatic debt by locally modifying microclimatic conditions. Notably, the buffering effect of the upper canopy layer implies microclimate dynamics that may provide more time for understorey plant communities to locally adapt.

AB  - Plant essential macronutrients like nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can limit savanna tree growth and are important determinants of savanna vegetation dynamics, along with rainfall, fire and herbivory. How nitrogen and phosphorus shape tree-grass competition and their coexistence remain unclear, hindering our ability to predict how savannas may respond to altered nutrient cycling. Here, we evaluate (1) if trees and grasses respond differently to N versus P availability, or (2) if grasses are more competitive in low nutrient environments while trees are more competitive in high nutrient environments. To do this, we grew saplings of 6 tree and 1 grass species from the Kruger National Park, South Africa, for 16 weeks under fully factorial nutrient and competition treatments (with/without competitors, low/high rate of N supply and low/high rate of P supply) under a watering regime designed to mimic wet season rainfall in a mesic savanna. Trees and grasses foraged most aggressively for nitrogen and allocated biomass differently depending on nitrogen availability. Overall, tree growth decreased in competition with grass, even in high nutrient environments where they grew faster. Grasses were always better below-ground competitors, utilising aggressive nutrient foraging strategies, including high root phosphatase activity in response to nitrogen and large root biomass allocation. Synthesis. In low nutrient environments (e.g. on nutrient-poor sandy soils), nutrients may limit tree growth. Nutrient rich environments enable tree growth, but grasses continue to compete effectively with trees. Understanding what this means for ecosystem responses to nutrient availability is not trivial, especially in the context of fire and herbivory. However, it is clear that soil nutrients likely affect tree and grass growth and competition in savannas, which suggests that future changes in nutrient cycling, such as N deposition, may have important effects on savanna vegetation.
   Plant essential macronutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus can impact savanna vegetation dynamics, but how nitrogen and phosphorus shape tree-grass competition and their coexistence remains unclear. By growing trees and grasses in different levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, both in and out of competition, the authors find soil nutrient availability can alter the competition intensity of grasses on trees, suggesting that soil nutrients are vital, though understudied, components of savannas.image

AB  - Theory predicts a decline in grassland diversity under nutrient enrichment and loss of herbivory, and one possible cause is hampered seedling recruitment. Two potential drivers for reduced diversity at the seedling level are diminished light availability caused by surrounding vegetation and accumulation of dead biomass. To test the importance of these two mechanisms on early recruitment, we added seeds of 15 herbaceous grassland plant species and monitored sown and natural seedling emergence during one growing season in a full factorial field experiment with light addition and litter removal under fertilization and exclusion of mammalian herbivores in an experimental grassland in Central Germany. We used modern LED lamps, mimicking the spectrum of natural sun light, to provide light to small-statured understorey plants. This novel experimental set-up allowed us to specifically disentangle the roles of light limitation and litter accumulation independently and in combination. In general, herbivore exclusion, but not fertilization increased the amount of litter biomass. Litter removal increased seedling number and richness by 83% and 33%, respectively, while light addition had no significant main effect on seedling recruitment, nor did it interact with any other factors, and did not affect recruitment even when litter was removed. In addition, fertilization had a negative and herbivore exclusion a negligible impact on recruitment, and these effects were independent of litter removal. Furthermore, seedling number and richness were unrelated to light intensity and quality, litter depth, soil moisture, temperature and C:N ratio. Synthesis: These results provide novel insights into the role of light limitation versus litter accumulation driving early recruitment and help understanding the mechanisms that affect diversity in grassland communities via recruitment. Our results highlight the detrimental role of litter accumulation as opposed to surrounding vegetation induced light deficiency driving early recruitment from seeds and call for management actions that reduce the amount of litter when maintaining or restoring diversity.

AB  - Rapid climate warming is 'greening' the tundra, reflecting a higher plant biomass, particularly of deciduous shrubs and grasses. However, the consequences of these changes for herbivore nutrition are unclear. Although, the gut microbiome mediates nutrient metabolism, and hence herbivores' capacity to adapt to dietary change, few studies have investigated the effect of annual changes in the diet-gut microbiome nexus on fitness-related traits. In a model system, the Svalbard reindeer, a species experiencing the greatest rate of climate warming on Earth, we investigate how changes in diet and the gut microbiome impact reindeer body mass. Using high-resolution DNA metabarcoding, we assessed diet and gut microbiome bacterial composition in rumen samples from animals culled in October from 1998 to 2004 in four different valleys. Overall diet diversity and grass relative reads abundance (RRA) were significantly higher following warmer summers, while the RRA of the dwarf shrub Salix polaris increased with the maximum normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), our measure of annual biomass. Autumn body mass, a strong proxy of fitness in Svalbard reindeer, was significantly, positively correlated with Salix RRA, most pronounced in females that had reproduced, and by that depleted body reserves. Multivariate analyses revealed a highly significant relationship between diet and microbiome composition at the individual level. This included a significant positive correlation between Salix and bacterial diversity. However, a structural equation model revealed that the direct path effect of Salix on reindeer body mass was stronger than the indirect path effect, mediated through the gut microbiome. Our results suggest that climate-driven Arctic greening may have implications for herbivore body mass, operating through a change in diet composition. These findings reveal some of the mechanistic underpinnings of Arctic warming on herbivore populations and highlight the importance of the diet-gut microbiome nexus in facilitating species resilience to rapid climate change.

AB  - Future climate conditions will alter the frequency and intensity of typhoons. Thus, post-windthrow management, which can enhance tree recovery in wind-disturbed forests with dense understory species, is essential for sustainable forest management to adapt to climate change. This study explores management options that can recover the above-ground biomass (AGB) and tree species composition after windthrow damage even under climate change. A case study area was established in the Oshima-Hiyama National Forest in southern Hokkaido, northern Japan, which were damaged by typhoons in late August 2016. We incorporated the understory species Sasa kurilensis as understory vegetation into the LANDIS-II Net Ecosystem Carbon and Nitrogen Succession extension v6.3 model to simulate the outcome of tree establishment under climate change. AGB recovery up to the year 2100 at 1,753 damaged grid cells was simulated for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios. Different post-windthrow management cases were designed by varying the treatment of fallen trees and the types of trees planted. The results demonstrated that salvage logging and planting successfully recovered the AGB by 2050 at the landscape scale regardless of the climate change scenario, whereas leaving fallen trees in the damaged site or salvage logging only did not facilitate the recovery of AGB. Leaving fallen trees in damaged grid cells as ecological legacies recovered the AGB only in damaged grid cells with a sufficient number of advanced seedlings of adequate types of species irrespective of the climate change scenario. The decreasing water equivalent of snowpack in the RCP scenarios caused Sasa kurilensis mortality and promoted the recovery of AGB of trees. The dominant species recovered in natural forests, which experienced either salvage logging or leaving trees in the damaged site, varied among climate change scenarios. The warmer climate condition facilitated the recovery of Fagus crenata by 2100. These results can help designing a robust forest recovery even in uncertain future climate.

AB  - Formative patterns of vegetation responses to cattle grazing can be difficult to detect because of innate heterogeneity of vegetation communities and grazing patterns, especially in semiarid environments. Nonetheless, some of this heterogeneity can be accounted for using appropriate experimental designs and statistical analyses. Bork and Werner (1999) suggested retention of negative vegetation consumption values for paired herbivory studies to concurrently analyze spatial heterogeneity and intensity of herbivory. Yet, inclusion of negative consumption metrics has not been widely utilized. Our objective is to determine if postulates proposed by Bork and Werner (interpretation of effects when negative consumption values are manipulated) are applicable to a real data set utilizing a paired experimental design in a heterogeneous, semiarid environment. We determined manipulation of negative consumptive values affects interpretation; it skews data distribution, over-estimates treatment effect, and results in a statistically weaker treatment effect. Therefore, we recommend employing a biologically paired experimental design and the retention of all negative vegetation consumption values so that: (1) resulting models represent a normally distributed population, (2) standing crop of vegetation resulting from the treatment is not over-estimated and (3) grazer treatment effect in heterogenous environments is recognized if existent. This will ensure conservative metrics guide management decisions.

AB  - Southeast Asia is experiencing a biodiversity crisis driven by the synergistic forces of deforestation and poaching. The mainland serow (Capricornis sumatraensis) is a large rainforest goat threatened by habitat loss, hunting for bushmeat, and poaching for traditional medicine. Serow have been considered to be montane forest specialists and preferring limestone karsts, but this has never been rigorously evaluated. If the species is restricted to high elevations, climate change and the upward expansion of deforestation and agriculture would threaten the species, but less so if serows are more closely associated with landscape roughness (i.e., rough topography including at low elevations such as in karst landscapes). We collated and synthesised new and existing camera-trap data from 29 landscapes across Southeast Asia to determine the serow's habitat associations at regional, landscape, and local scales. Serow occurrence was negatively associated with oil palm plantation cover and positively associated with landscape roughness across all scales; elevation was not a top-performing variable in model selection. With just 16% of their forested range under some form of declared protection, climate change and expansion of oil palm plantations into higher elevations will further reduce habitat and facilitate poaching into the species' core habitat. However, the serow's preference for rough landscapes, where mechanised agriculture is infeasible, may be its saving grace. An improved understanding of megafauna habitat associations provides conservationists, enforcement agencies, and policymakers with practical and applicable guidance to ensure their persistence in Asia.

One such region is western Maharashtra, India, where old-growth savannas occupy a broad rainfall gradient and are increasingly rare due to agricultural conversion and afforestation.To understand the consequences of land-use change, we sampled herbaceous plant communities of old-growth savannas and three alternative land-use types: tree plantations, tillage agriculture and agricultural fallows (n = 15 sites per type). Study sites spanned 457 to 1954 mm of mean annual precipitation-corresponding to the typical rainfall range of mesic savannas globally.Across the rainfall gradient, we found consistent declines in old-growth savanna plant communities due to land-use change. Local-scale native species richness dropped from a mean of 12 species/m(2) in old-growth savannas to 8, 6 and 3 species/m(2) in tree plantations, fallows and tillage agriculture, respectively. Cover of native plants declined from a mean of 49% in old-growth savannas to 27% in both tree plantations and fallows, and 4% in tillage agriculture. Reduced native cover coincided with increased cover of invasive species in tree plantations (18%), fallows (18%) and tillage agriculture (3%).In analyses of community composition, tillage agriculture was most dissimilar to old-growth savannas, while tree plantations and fallows showed intermediate dissimilarity. These compositional changes were driven partly by the loss of characteristic savanna species: 65 species recorded in old-growth savannas were absent in other land uses. Indicator analysis revealed 21 old-growth species, comprised mostly of native savanna specialists. Indicators of tree plantations (nine species) and fallows (13 species) were both invasive and native species, while the two indicators of tillage agriculture were invasive. As reflective of declines in savanna communities, mean native perennial graminoid cover of 27% in old-growth savannas dropped to 9%, 7%, and 0.1% in tree plantations, fallows and tillage agriculture, respectively.Synthesis. Agricultural conversion and afforestation of old-growth savannas in India destroys and degrades herbaceous plant communities that do not spontaneously recover on fallowed land. Efforts to conserve India's native biodiversity should encompass the country's widespread savanna biome and seek to limit conversion of irreplaceable old-growth savannas.<p style="border:0px; display:block; height:0px; left:-9999px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; margin-top:0px; opacity:0; overflow:hidden; padding:0px; position:absolute; top:0px; width:0px">

AB  - Spatial responses to risk from multiple predators can precipitate emergent consequences for prey (i.e. multiple-predator effects, MPEs) and mediate indirect interactions between predators. How prey navigate risk from multiple predators may therefore have important ramifications for understanding the propagation of predation-risk effects (PREs) through ecosystems. The interaction of predator and prey traits has emerged as a potentially key driver of antipredator behaviour but remains underexplored in large vertebrate systems, particularly where sympatric prey share multiple predators. We sought to better generalize our understanding of how predators influence their ecosystems by considering how multiple sources of contingency drive prey distribution in a multi-predator-multi-prey system. Specifically, we explored how two sympatric ungulates with different escape tactics-vertically agile, scrambling ibex Capra sibirica and sprinting argali Ovis ammon-responded to predation risk from shared predators with contrasting hunting modes-cursorial wolves Canis lupus and vertical-ambushing, stalking snow leopards Panthera uncia. Contrasting risk posed by the two predators presented prey with clear trade-offs. Ibex selected for greater exposure to chronic long-term risk from snow leopards, and argali for wolves, in a nearly symmetrical manner that was predictable based on the compatibility of their respective traits. Yet, acute short-term risk from the same predator upended these long-term strategies, increasing each ungulates' exposure to risk from the alternate predator in a manner consistent with a scenario in which conflicting antipredator behaviours precipitate risk-enhancing MPEs and mediate predator facilitation. By contrast, reactive responses to wolves led ibex to reduce their exposure to risk from both predators-a risk-reducing MPE. Evidence of a similar reactive risk-reducing effect for argali vis-a-vis snow leopards was lacking. Our results suggest that prey spatial responses and any resulting MPEs and prey-mediated interactions between predators are contingent on the interplay of hunting mode and escape tactics. Further investigation of interactions among various drivers of contingency in PREs will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding and improved forecasting of the ecological effects of predators.

AB  - Context. Chital deer (Axis axis) are long established in the northern Queensland dry tropics, and at high densities are considered pests by cattle graziers. Cost-effective management is difficult for widespread, fluctuating populations of vertebrate pests such as these deer. Historically, control of chital deer has been limited to recreational and some commercial ground-shooting and trapping. Concerns over chital deer impacts were heightened during drought in 2015 and funding became available for aerial culling. Aim. This study set out to determine (1) distribution and abundance, (2) seasonal reproductive output, (3) potential and actual rates of increase and their determinants, and (4) efficient management strategies for chital deer in the northern Queensland dry tropics. Methods. In 2014, similar to 13 000 km(2) of the main distribution was surveyed by helicopter. Multiple vehicle ground surveys per year monitored chital deer density on two properties during 2013-2022. Seasonal shot samples of deer on both properties assessed reproductive output during 2014-2016. Aerial surveys during 2016-2020 determined chital deer densities on seven properties, prior to aerial culling on four properties. Finally, the maximum rate of increase of chital deer was calculated from life-history data. Key results. Regionally, chital deer are patchily distributed and so are best monitored locally where densities can be >50 deer km(-2). Vehicle ground surveys recorded an similar to 80% decline in chital deer populations on two properties over 7-10 months during drought in early 2015, with a similar rate being recorded by aerial survey at a third site. There was little recruitment during the drought, but the decline was seemingly driven by adult mortality. Aerial shooting further reduced populations by 39-88% to <3 deer km(-2) on four properties. Where there was no continuing control, culled populations recovered to pre-cull densities or higher after 2.4 years. One unculled property recovered to its pre-drought density after 6 years. Rates of recovery were at or higher than the maximum annual rate of increase for chital deer estimated here as 26-41%. Conclusions. Drought has a lasting effect on this chital deer population, because of the resulting large population decline and the modest rate of any recovery in the absence of culling. Culling can reduce populations to low density, but the removal rate needs to be sustained to suppress future growth. Implications. Drought provides a strategic opportunity to further reduce chital deer populations for enduring control. Large reductions are feasible given the clumped dispersion of populations within properties and in the region.

Besides adversely affecting native biodiversity, these species also pose a major threat from a wider socioecological perspective (e.g. 'roughness' increases flood risk). Finding options to control dense shrub layers consisting of invasive alien species is therefore of high priority for multipurpose management. We studied cattle grazing impacts on the cover, composition and diversity of the herb and shrub layers in floodplain poplar plantations along the Tamis river, Serbia. Non-grazed, moderately grazed, intensively grazed and resting place stands were sampled in five locations in three sampling points. Non-grazed stands had substantially higher cover of invasive alien shrub species (on average 65%) than moderately and intensively grazed stands, and resting places (5.17, 0.02 and 0.00%, respectively), but without considerable differences between the grazing intensity categories. The number of invasive alien species in the shrub layer decreased considerably from non-grazed to intensively grazed stands. Species composition in the herb layer changed from non-grazed to intensively grazed stands, while resting places differed substantially from the other categories. Total species richness, richness of native generalist herbaceous grassland species, and the cover of palatable grasses were the highest in moderately and intensively grazed stands. Our results suggest that cattle grazing in floodplains is effective at controlling invasive alien shrub species. Furthermore, continuous moderate or intensive grazing would contribute to multifunctional management of invaded floodplains by enhancing local biodiversity, reducing flood risk, and providing additional grazing areas for the local community.

AB  - Legacies of land use can persist for decades, thereby impacting populations, communities, and ecosystems long after the original disturbance has concluded. The coastal rainforests of western North America were fundamentally transformed by commercial logging throughout the 20th century, resulting in depauperate second-growth forests that provide limited understory production and foraging habitat for herbivores. The Tongass National Forest in Alaska, USA, is the largest contiguous tract of coastal temperate rainforest in the world, but nearly 200,000 ha of second-growth forest have created a need to restore understory plant communities and foraging habitat for ungulates like Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis), a regional indicator of forest health and key subsistence resource for local and Indigenous communities. We leveraged a 16-year adaptive management experiment-the Tongass-Wide Young Growth Studies (TWYGS) program-to test the effects of precommercial thinning on forage availability and use by deer in second-growth forests. We measured plant communities, presence-absence of browse, and slash debris in 14,908 quadrats across 730 plots and found that plant community composition, understory forage biomass, digestible energy, and digestible protein were all significantly higher in thinned plots versus controls. Precommercial thinning also doubled browse probabilities relative to unthinned stands, and plots treated within 35 years of stand initiation experienced the highest gains. Deer selected for both plant quantity and plant quality, as browse was positively associated with both digestible energy and digestible protein. Conversely, slash debris generated by precommercial thinning reduced browse probability by an average of 11.3%, but these effects attenuated as slash decomposed over the course of the study. We found no effects of landscape composition on relative browse probability, indicating that fine-scale resource quality and accessibility were the strongest drivers of habitat use by deer over nearly two decades of sampling. Collectively, our results show that precommercial thinning is a valuable management tool that increases forage and deer habitat use in second-growth coastal rainforests. This study highlights the enduring legacies of forest disturbance and underscores the value of adaptive management experiments with long-term monitoring to optimize habitat management for wildlife.

AB  - Differential resource use by sympatric species mediates coexistence by specialising in individual ecological niches. We investigated the population, habitat use and dietary overlaps between wild ungulates, i.e., blackbuck Antilope cervicapra, chital Axis axis, domestic livestock and feral horse at Point Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary, India. The food habits and diet overlap of ungulates were estimated using the feeding site method and the density were estimated using distance sampling-based line transect approach. The estimated overall density (number of individuals per km(2) +/- SE) of blackbuck was (37.1 +/- 5.2), chital (4.5 +/- 0.9), feral horse (7.6 +/- 1.2) and cattle (21.9 +/- 3.3). The target species fed on 43 plant species, of which, plant use was high in feral horse (35), followed by chital (33), cattle (29) and blackbuck (23). Dung/pellet analysis revealed that all the target species used monocots (graminoids) in high proportion. Feral horse had the highest habitat niche breadth (0.89) followed by cattle (0.72), blackbuck (0.48) and chital (0.26). Diet overlap was maximum between blackbuck and cattle (95%) followed by feral horse (81%), and chital (38%) with respect to blackbuck. The observed high degree of diet overlaps between wild ungulates with domestic livestock and feral horses is a matter of concern for the long-term survival of the wild ungulates.

AB  - Recent studies of ungulate movement ecology suggest that seasonal movement tactics often vary within a population. The forest-tundra and forest-dwelling ecotypes of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Ontario, Canada, are traditionally presumed to differ in migratory strategy; however, their potential for facultative migration, the practice of interannual switching between migratory and non-migratory strategies, has yet to be explored. Understanding facultative migration, and any inherent variation and influences could help improve habitat management. We acquired global positioning system (GPS) telemetry-based movement data from 109 radio-collared caribou across the Hudson Bay lowlands between 2009 and 2019. We compared the data with estimates of vegetation density, snow cover, and human disturbance to identify environmental influences associated with the probability and magnitude of migration. We also compared seasonal resource selection between migratory and sedentary individuals. Caribou demonstrated plasticity in migration, with evidence of facultative migration by the forest-tundra and the forest-dwelling ecotypes. Variation in migration was likely a combination of local adaptation and acute response to changing environmental factors, particularly snow. Probability and distance of migration were positively correlated with snow, while distance also showed spatial dependency. Plasticity in migration has significant implications in relation to future shifts in climate and should be considered in relevant predictive analyses.

AB  - The Arctic is experiencing rapid climate change. This research documents changes to tundra vegetation near Atqasuk and Utqiagvik, Alaska. At each location, 30 plots were sampled annually from 2010 to 2019 using a point frame. For every encounter, we recorded the height and classified it into eight groupings (deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs, forbs, graminoids, bryophytes, lichens, litter, and standing dead vegetation); for vascular plants we also identified the species. We found an increase in plant stature and cover over time, consistent with regional warming. Graminoid cover and height increased at both sites, with a 5-fold increase in cover in Atqasuk. At Atqasuk, the cover and height of shrubs and forbs increased. Species diversity decreased at both the sites. Year was generally the strongest predictor of vegetation change, suggesting a cumulative change over time; however, soil moisture and soil temperature were also predictors of vegetation change. We anticipate that plants in the region will continue to grow taller as the region warms, resulting in greater plant cover, especially of graminoids and shrubs. The increase in plant cover and accumulation of litter may negatively impact non- vascular plants. Continued changes in community structure will impact energy balance and carbon cycling and may have regional and global consequences.

AB  - Environmental change is a crucial driver shaping grassland biodiversity and stability. Both environmental change and stability contain multiple dimensions. Nonetheless, few studies examined multiple dimensions of stability in response to environmental change, especially under the combined effects of climatic variability and grazing intensity. Here, we conducted a 7-year field sheep grazing experiment, and we evaluated the impacts of grazing intensity (GI) and climate variability (temperature and precipitation variability) on plant community diversity and productivity and multi-dimensional stability using linear and structural equation models. Our results show that increasing grazing intensity significantly decreased temporal stability but did not affect resistance stability. Compared with the non-grazing (NG) treatment, grazing reduced temporal stability by 35.78%. The decline is primarily attributed to the grazing-induced reduction in evenness and weakening of species asynchrony, which in turn impairs insurance effects. The insignificant change in resistance stability was attributed to a trade-off between reduced interspecific competition and direct negative effects. Furthermore, temperature variability and precipitation variability exacerbate and mitigate the effects of grazing on temporal stability (negative) and resistance stability (positive), respectively. Overall, temporal stability is mainly influenced by temperature variability and GI, while resistance stability is mainly affected by GI. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the dimensions of stability and disturbance. Different dimensions of stability may respond differently to disturbance. Multiple disturbances may also interact synergistically or antagonistically on plant community stability.

AB  - Lichens are sensitive to competition from vascular plants, intensive silviculture, pollution and reindeer and caribou grazing, and can therefore serve as indicators of environmental changes. Hyperspectral remote sensing data has been proved promising for estimation of plant diversity, but its potential for forest floor lichen cover estimation has not yet been studied. In this study, we investigated the use of hyperspectral data in estimating ground lichen cover in boreal forest stands in Finland. We acquired airborne and in situ hyperspectral data of lichen-covered forest plots, and applied multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis to estimate the fractional cover of ground lichens in these plots. Estimation of lichen cover based on in situ spectral data was very accurate (coefficient of determination (r2) 0.95, root mean square error (RMSE) 6.2). Estimation of lichen cover based on airborne data, on the other hand, was fairly good (r2 0.77, RMSE 11.7), but depended on the choice of spectral bands. When the hyperspectral data were resampled to the spectral resolution of Sentinel-2, slightly weaker results were obtained. Tree canopy cover near the flight plots was weakly related to the difference between estimated and measured lichen cover. The results also implied that the presence of dwarf shrubs could influence the lichen cover estimates.

AB  - Understanding the effects of contemporary cattle grazing on herbaceous perennial communities in big sagebrush steppe is important for managing for wildlife habitat, plant diversity, and productivity, yet potentially complicated by legacy impacts of historic, often higher intensity, livestock grazing. Here, we evaluate whether recovery of herbaceous communities in eastern Oregon, USA, after the cessation of intense spring sheep grazing (1935) was affected by moderate cattle grazing in paired plots with or without grazing over the past 75 yr (1936-2011). We tested for the effects of cattle grazing on herbaceous community recovery, as indicated by changes over time in plant density, and composition, as measured by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. We also included current and prior to sampling year precipitation anomalies, to account for the weather effects, and a random term for pasture location of plot pairs to include potential subtle differences in abiotic environment and grazing management. We further tested whether time since cessation of intense sheep grazing and moderate cattle grazing were associated with convergence or divergence in community composition indicated by changes in evenness, richness, species relative abundance (rank order), and turnover or species appearance or disappearance. Total perennial herbaceous, forb, and grass density increased over time in sites grazed and ungrazed by cattle, though species varied in the direction of their response to contemporary cattle grazing. Community composition metrics indicated convergence over time including increasing evenness, decreasing Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, decreasing shifts in species relative abundance (rank order), and lower rates of species turnover (and gain and loss). Contemporary cattle grazing was not associated with convergence or divergence in composition. Precipitation anomalies for the current or prior water year were only occasionally significant in herbaceous density and community composition change models. Our results indicate similar long-term recovery trajectories occurred in sites with moderate cattle grazing or removal of all livestock following cessation of intense sheep grazing. Management planning and resource assessment focused on herbaceous perennial communities in sagebrush steppe should seek to separate the impacts of historic from contemporary livestock grazing practices.

AB  - Grazing is one of the principal drivers triggering woody invasion in grasslands and savannas worldwide, but evidence is opposing. Cattle can promote or limit woody establishment by direct and indirect mechanisms, like consumption, trampling or relaxing grass competition. Despite its increasing relevance, it is unknown if intensively managed cattle grazing can curb woody establishment. We evaluated the effect of cattle grazing with short cycles of high stocking rate and resting periods on Gleditsia triacanthos establishment, an invasive tree in grasslands. By two field experiments in pastures, we manipulated cattle grazing (with or without) and: Exp. (1) initial age-related size of G. triacanthos (small plants: 3 mo.; or large plants: 9 mo.), and Exp. (2) neighbouring vegetation (clipped or intact). Overall, grazing had a negative effect due to tree consumption and a positive effect by relaxing grass competition on tree establishment, but the first effect outweighed the second. Grazing reduced by 25% G. triacanthos survival and by 40% its biomass. Consumption was independent of plant size and neighbouring vegetation, but large plants had more resprouting capacity than small plants. Regardless of grazing, small plants had higher mortality than large plants. Intact neighbouring vegetation did not modify survival but decreased tree biomass which may affect middle or long-term tolerance and survival. Intensively managed rotational grazing with resting periods for pasture recovery may limit woody establishment, but this management strategy should be applied immediately after tree germination. The increasing intensification of production systems requires to evaluate the impact of management on invasion processes.

AB  - Human-induced habitat modification is among the main factors that threaten biodiversity on the planet. For highly specialized herbivorous insects, such as galling insects, anthropogenic disturbances that affect plants can have great effects on insects. In this sense, in the present study, we investigated the diversity of host plants and gall-inducing insects in anthropized and preserved remnants of Neotropical savannas in the Brazilian Cerrado. Sampling was performed in 30 plots (10 x 10 m) distributed in six study areas. Of these total, fifteen plots were in areas with anthropized vegetation and fifteen plots in areas with preserved vegetation. Overall, we recorded 67 species of gall-inducing insects and 39 species of host plants. We found that the diversity of both host plant species and gall-inducing insects differed significantly between areas, being higher in preserved plots than in anthropized plots. Our results revelated that changes in the species richness and composition of gall-inducing insects from preserved environments to anthropized environments were mediated by changes in the richness and composition of the plant species, respectively. Our study stands out as the first to demonstrate that plant diversity drives responses of gall-inducing insects to human disturbance in Neotropical savannas. Our findings indicate that the preservation of natural vegetation is important for the conservation of plant assemblages and their gall-inducing insects in urban environments.

AB  - There is well-established evidence that land use is the main driver of terrestrial biodiversity loss. In contrast, the combined effects of land-use and climate changes on food webs, particularly on terrestrial trophic networks, are understudied. In this study, we investigate the combined effects of climate change (temperature, precipitation) and land-use intensification on food webs using a process-based general mechanistic ecosystem model ('MadingleyR'). We simulated the ecosystem dynamics of four regions in different climatic zones (Brazil, Namibia, Finland and France) according to trait-based functional groups of species (ectothermic and endothermic herbivores, carnivores and omnivores). The simulation results were consistent across the selected regions, with land-use intensification negatively affecting endotherms, whereas ectotherms were under increased pressure from rising temperatures. Land-use intensification led to the downsizing of endotherms, and thus, to smaller organisms in the food web. In combination with climate change, land-use intensification had the greatest effect on higher trophic levels, culminating in the extinction of endothermic carnivores in Namibia and Finland and endothermic omnivores in Namibia. Arid and tropical regions showed a slightly higher response of total biomass to climate change under a high-emissions scenario with rising temperatures, whereas areas with low net primary productivity showed the most negative response to land-use intensification. Our results suggest that 1) further land-use intensification will significantly affect larger organisms and predators, leading to a major restructuring of global food webs. 2) Arid low-productivity regions will experience significant changes in community composition due to global change. 3) Climate changes appear to have slightly greater effects in tropical and arid climates, whereas land-use intensification tends to affect less productive environments. This paper shows how general ecosystem models deepen our understanding of multitrophic interactions and how climate change or land-use drivers affect ecosystems in different biomes.

AB  - Grasslands are endangered habitats through the world. Among its threats, land-use change has been recognized as one of the most important drivers of biodiversity decline. Sustainable livestock farming can be important conserving grasslands and preserving their biodiversity, and particularly in Uruguay are extensive and are carried out based on natural grasslands with little external management. However, in recent years there has been an increasing in land-use change, replacing natural grasslands with cultivated pastures, leading to a homogenization of the environments. Spiders are a model group for ecological studies, because they are good indicators of environmental change. Our goals were to evaluate the effect of land-use change (natural grasslands by annual pastures) in livestock systems of Uruguay on the spider community; and describe this community identifying conservation priority species and potential environmental indicators. We collected spiders seasonally during 1 year in three farms in Uruguay with a cattle and sheep full cycle production system. We found that substitution of natural grasslands by pastures in livestock systems implied a reduction in spider abundance and species richness. We found species considered of priority conservation for the country according to a local list and added new species to that list. Implications for insect conservation Our results highlight the importance of conservation of natural grasslands, even in productive systems, to reduce spider diversity loss, and contribute to preserve one of the most threatened environments in the region.

AB  - Biodiversity has critical phylogenetic and functional components, yet many prior studies of marine communities focus only on taxonomic diversity. Here, we surveyed intertidal crustacean communities across 11 sites in the Puget Sound (Washington state). We calculated taxonomic diversity (Shannon's H), functional diversity (functional evenness and Rao's Q), and phylogenetic diversity to examine how these indices were related and how they varied with environmental factors. A model selection approach (AIC) was used to examine which factors (habitat complexity, algal richness, salinity, and urbanization) were the best predictors for each index. Across sites, all four diversity indices were moderately correlated. Algal richness emerged as an important factor, occurring in well-supported models across all diversity indices: sites with more algal species had higher levels of taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity. Species diversity of both herbivores and non-herbivores was positively correlated with algal species richness, suggesting algae may be important for habitat as well as a food source. More species-rich algal communities had more phylogenetically diverse assemblages of herbivores, but algal richness was not correlated to non-herbivore phylogenetic diversity. Boulder size, but not other measures of habitat complexity, was positively correlated with functional diversity; most diversity in our samples was associated with boulders. Sites adjacent to higher levels of impervious surfaces (e.g., urbanization) had lower values of functional evenness. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that anthropogenic factors can have particularly strong effects on functional or phylogenetic diversity, and our study provides a number of tools for future investigations of crustacean diversity in this region.

AB  - Context It is important to understand the way in which wild herbivore grazing affects decadal vegetation dynamics after cessation of unnatural disturbances, especially in a context of climate change.Aims We investigated the decadal effects of different grazing regimes on treeless subalpine vegetation recovery from stock grazing and burning, on sites of different environmental character and initial state.Methods At each of four sites, two fenced areas that excluded mammalian herbivores, two that allowed in only rabbits and two grazed control plots were monitored every 5 years between 1991 and 2021. General linear models were developed to explain variation in change over the 30 years in different cover types. The years in which peak and trough values occurred were also determined, as were the incidence and direction of differences between treatments in sites and years.Key results There was marked variation in change over 30 years between the sites and lifeforms. Exclusion of mammalian herbivores increased the slow rate of revegetation. There was little effect from rabbits by themselves. Unexpectedly, the cover of both short and tall herbs was not promoted by grazing exclusion. Short term climatic variation affected some cover types, with many peaks and troughs in the dry year of 2001, but it was not possible to disentangle decades scale climate change effects from the process of recovery after disturbance.Conclusions The slight increase in revegetation rates in the absence of native herbivores and rabbits does not justify culling. Restoration interventions appear to be unnecessary. The prospect of increasing fire incidence and deer numbers suggests that it is desirable to continue monitoring the plots.
   Long-term monitoring on Tasmania's Eastern Central Plateau provides an opportunity to document the process of recovery from fire and stock grazing and the impacts of wild herbivores. After 30 years, vegetated ground cover has increased both inside and outside grazing exclosures. Although results between the four sites were variable, natural regeneration will occur without management intervention and in the absence of a catastrophic disturbance such as wildfire.

AB  - Context With the range expansion of invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in North America during the past decades, there has been an increasing concern with how wild pigs affect native species. An abundance of research on their impacts has been through the lens of damage to anthropogenic resources and plant communities. However, quantitative research on how wild pigs affect populations of native animal species is an understudied topic.Aims Our goal was to assess how wild pigs affect white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) at a population level by measuring changes in deer abundance as wild pigs are removed. White-tailed deer are an economically valuable game species in North America, and negative impacts of wild pigs on their populations could have trickle-down impacts on conservation funding for all wildlife.Methods On three treatment areas (34.07-55.31 km2) and one control area (25.10 km2), we used N-mixture models to compare data from camera-trap surveys of white-tailed deer before and after wild pigs were removed from treatment areas.Key results We removed 1851 pigs from the treatment sites between May 2019 and March 2021. We found that wild pigs did not significantly affect white-tailed deer abundance, but that white-tailed deer were 1.12 (1.02-1.23; 95% CL) times as likely to be detected when the number of pigs removed was equal to our baseline population estimates compared with when no pigs were removed. Although results from similar analyses on separate age and sex classes of white-tailed deer exhibited similar results, analyses of impacts on immature males differed.Conclusions Our overall results are congruent with those of other research that suggest that wild pigs affect white-tailed deer behaviour at a local scale, although eliminating pigs from an area does not appear to quickly lead to increased abundance of deer.Implications Although the interspecific interactions between white-tailed deer and wild pigs are unlikely to lead to a decline in the population of white-tailed deer, removing wild pigs may decrease the behavioural implications of these interactions.
   The recent range expansion of invasive wild pigs in North America has lead to increasing concerns of how they affect native species. This study aims to investigate how white-tailed deer respond to wild pig removals and found that, although relative abundance did not change, detection of white-tailed deer increased as wild pigs were removed. We suggest that wild pigs affect white-tailed deer behaviourally at a local scale and that behavioural changes may not result in population-level effects. Photograph by Matthew McDonough.

AB  - Human disturbance and climate change can impact populations by disrupting movement corridors and reducing important habitat. Characterizing how animals respond to such environmental changes is valuable for conservation as many species can experience reduced genetic diversity when deleterious habitat change occurs, leading to an increased likelihood of extirpation. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) exemplify this conservation challenge; their geographically isolated habitat can inhibit gene flow, making them susceptible to population declines in the face of anthropogenic-induced change. To facilitate biologically informed population management of mountain goats in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska, we characterized the fine-scale genetic population structure and examined how future climate change could impact population density. Our results indicated that three genetically distinct subpopulations exist in Glacier Bay and that the genealogical history is reflective of the historic landscape patterns. Climate modeling predicted that demographic productivity was likely to be reduced for all subpopulations; additionally, we found that climate change likely degrades the suitability of movement corridors that facilitate gene flow between subpopulations, ultimately increasing the cost of travel. Understanding such fine-scale patterns are key to managing subpopulations, particularly with impending changes to the landscape.

AB  - Grassland plant community structure and function are dependent on the type, timing, frequency and intensity of disturbance. Grazing systems employing dense herds of livestock for short periods of time (e.g. Adaptive Multi-paddock Grazing; AMP) are gaining popularity as a potentially sustainable practice. Effects of AMP systems on plant diversity and composition are unknown, though theory provides some expectations. Spatially homogeneous grazing used by AMP may be a uniform ecological filter, thereby lowering plant diversity; alternatively, the AMP practice of using multiple paddocks might enhance habitat heterogeneity. Maintaining plant diversity, particularly of native species, is a key aspect of sustainability. As such, an understanding of the real-world effects of AMP grazing is needed. We studied grasslands within 18 pairs of ranches across the northern Great Plains. Ranches managed under AMP were paired with a neighbouring ranch (N-AMP) using regionally representative grazing practices. We collected surveys of management practices and conducted 2 years of on-farm sampling to identify plant composition and diversity. Ranch management practices used by self-identified AMP ranchers differed significantly (p < 0.1) from those used on neighbouring ranches, with higher stocking densities (number of animals per area at a single time) but not stocking rates (total number of animals per unit time per area) on AMP relative to N-AMP ranches. There were fewer plant species in AMP grasslands at both the plot and landscape scales compared to N-AMP ranches despite no overall difference in plant community composition. Management type did not alter the variability of plant community composition (beta diversity) or plot-level species evenness. Although there were trends for lower diversity of native and introduced species at both spatial scales, a significant effect was found only for native species at the landscape scale. Synthesis and applications. The impacts of AMP grazing system management were limited to a minor reduction in plant diversity, with a modest decline in native species richness. We conclude that the benefits of AMP grazing in the northern Great Plains do not include the maintenance of plant diversity, and this system could hinder the conservation of remaining native plant species.

AB  - Land and wildlife managers use disturbance to reset forests to earlier successional stages and improve the quality and quantity of forage available to ungulates. However, management of vegetation communities to increase forage nutrition has additional implications for other non-forage vegetation. To evaluate responses of vegetation to management of fire and timber harvest, we measured and modeled 3 metrics of vegetative response in 3 forested areas in Montana, USA during 2017-2019: forage nutrition for mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), invasive species biomass, and floristic quality, a measure of plant communities' tolerance of disturbances and fidelity to particular environments using native species conservatism scores. We found differences in all 3 metrics of plant responses that were specific to disturbance type and study area, and associations between disturbance and vegetation outcomes that were both desirable and undesirable. Generally, deer forage nutrition and invasive species biomass both increased in disturbed areas, whereas floristic quality increased with disturbance in 2 study areas but decreased in the third. Biomass of particular invasive species varied according to both study area and disturbance type. Lastly, we used decision analysis to illustrate trade-offs and overall support for different management actions while also accounting for underlying differences among study areas. For example, management actions with the greatest increase in mule deer forage nutrition tended to also increase invasive species biomass. Compared to other management actions, low-severity harvest scored highly in 2 study areas due to its association with increased forage nutrition while also limiting invasive species biomass and maintaining floristic quality. However, different weighting schemes according to different management priorities among management outcomes alter the relative ranking of actions. Our data show area-specific trade-offs in vegetation outcomes that result from disturbance management, which can be combined with decision analysis to help managers balance objectives and compare potential management actions.

AB  - Human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation threaten biodiversity in the Eastern Himalayas, a crucial part of the Indo-Myanmar biodiversity hotspot. This study examines the distribution of 10 mammal species in Arunachal Pradesh using a multi-scale ensemble modeling approach, integrating Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and MaxEnt to assess habitat suitability. By analyzing 57 environmental predictor variables across multiple spatial scales, we found that elevation is a key determinant for carnivores such as the dhole and the Asiatic golden cat, while herbivores like the northern red muntjac and the mainland serow prefer broadleaf forests. Species distributions showed distinct patterns, with most carnivores concentrated in the south, except for the widely distributed yellow-throated marten. Dhole and leopard cat preferred elevated broadleaf forests, while the Asiatic golden cat favored mixed forests. Herbivores like the northern red muntjac and mainland serow were found at higher elevations, whereas the Indian wild pig preferred grasslands and degraded habitats near human settlements. While protected areas (PAs) exhibited higher species richness, significant suitable habitats also exist outside these regions, underscoring the need for landscape-level conservation strategies. Precipitation seasonality and human population density emerged as significant predictors, highlighting the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on habitat suitability. Our findings emphasize the necessity of conserving large, connected landscapes to mitigate human-induced pressures and climate change impacts on these species. By combining spatial modeling with ecological insights, this study provides a framework for prioritizing conservation efforts. Future research should expand data collection across broader temporal and geographic scales and incorporate climate change projections to anticipate species distribution shifts. These findings are critical for guiding effective conservation planning and habitat management in this ecologically rich yet vulnerable region.

AB  - Fire is one of the main factors shaping vegetation characteristics around the world, with deep and complex effects on higher levels of the food web and ecosystem functioning. Specialist insects tend to be more vulnerable to fire than generalists due to their higher dependency on host plants; however, fire effects on specialist insects are still not clearly known. Our aim was to understand how fire-induced changes in plant richness and floristic composition modulate community features of galling insects under different fire scenarios. Specifically, we address the following questions: Are changes in galling insect richness and herbivory explained by the variation in plant richness and floristic composition under different fire scenarios? Are species composition of vegetation and galling insect communities coupled under different fire scenarios? Species richness of plant and galling insect communities was higher in burned than in unburned plots, but the highest species richness was observed under different fire scenarios in both communities. Galling insect richness was better predicted by floristic composition than plant richness. Herbivory was similar under different fire scenarios and weakly related to plant richness and composition. Species composition of vegetation and galling insect communities was strongly coupled across different fire scenarios. The characteristics of galling insect communities were strongly affected by fire through vegetation changes, and were better explained by floristic composition than by plant richness. Our results highlight the importance of selecting areas under different fire scenarios to maximise biodiversity conservation.

AB  - 1. The value of non-commodity ecosystem services provided by forests is widely recognized, but intensive forest management practices are increasing, with uncertain consequences for a multitude of these services. Quantitative relationships among biodiversity conservation, timber production and other ecosystem services remain poorly understood, especially during the early-successional period of intensively managed forestlands.
   2. We manipulated management intensity in regenerating forest plantations to test the prediction that treatments aimed at maximizing timber production decrease biodiversity conservation and non-timber services. We measured species richness of 3 taxonomic groups and 13 proxies for provisioning, cultural and regulating services within stands randomly assigned to one of the three herbicide application intensities or an untreated control.
   3. Herbicides increased allocation of net primary production to crop trees, increasing projected timber volume and revenues at 40- and 60-year harvest ages. Commonly used herbicide prescriptions reduced culturally valued plants by 71%, wild-ungulate forage by 41%, avian richness by 20% and pollinator floral resources by 42%, the latter being associated with 38% fewer pollinator species. However, agriculturally valued bumblebees, pollination of blueberries, avian-mediated arthropod control, wild ungulate observations and regulation services tied to forest productivity appeared unaffected by increasing management intensity and timber production.
   4. Species richness and flora-provided services in young forest plantations exhibited strong trade-offs with projected timber production, whereas post-treatment vegetation regeneration and site-level variation likely maintained a range of other services. Although vegetation recovery is important for supporting wildlife and some ecosystem services on industrial forestlands, it is unlikely that any single prescription can optimize both timber and non-timber benefits to society across managed forest landscapes. Instead, producing different services in discrete portions of the landscape may be necessary.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We tested the effects of intensive forest management via herbicides on ecosystem services and found that biodiversity responses and services from early-successional vegetation trade-off against timber production. A number of services appeared to be compatible with timber production, although no single prescription optimized the full range of services. Stand-level biodiversity conservation and a variety of services could potentially be provided by treatment skips and less-intensive management on productive sites, although it is unlikely that all services can be optimized without landscape-level planning.

AB  - Permafrost thaw is projected to reinforce climate warming by releasing large stocks of stored carbon. Rewilding northern high latitude regions with large herbivores has been proposed as a climate mitigation strategy to protect frozen soils and increase ecosystem resilience to climate warming. We explored the impact of summer reindeer density on subarctic peatlands by comparing 17 peatlands differing in reindeer density in Fennoscandia. We used a combination of high-resolution image analyses and field assessments along 50 transects to assess microtopography, surface water cover, vegetation, summer albedo, permafrost presence, soil temperature, soil nutrients and snow depth. Our results show that high summer reindeer densities fragment the characteristic bumpy topography of the peatlands, reducing the insulating soil properties and the probability of keeping permafrost in elevated hummocks. As a result, waterlogged lawns with surface water increase in size and reduce summer albedo. Furthermore, high reindeer density peatlands were associated with an increase in tall inedible shrubs and thicker snow layers. These changes may favor summer warming and reduce winter cooling of the soil thus accelerating permafrost loss. Our results suggest that high reindeer densities may reduce resilience of the peatland permafrost to climate warming. High densities of large herbivores will likely have different effects in well-drained uplands, but in the lowlands we studied, the complex cascading effects of summer trampling may well offset any climate-protection gained by browsing. Optimal use of wildlife management to mitigate global warming will thus require tuning herbivore densities to different ecosystem types across high northern landscapes.

AB  - Longer-term perspectives-equivalent to the lifespans of long-lived trees-are required to fully inform perceptions of 'naturalness' used in woodland conservation and management. Stand-scale dynamics of an old growth temperate woodland are reconstructed using palaeoecological data. The study site is Cambusurich Wood, Scotland, a woodland designated for conservation due to its 'naturalness'. High temporal resolution palaeoecological records (pollen, plant macrofossils, non-pollen palynomorphs and charcoal analyses) are used to explore long-term human-woodland interactions and the drivers of stand-scale woodland dynamics. The results demonstrate stand-scale woodland responses to climatic changes and human-woodland interactions (increasingly) since 220 cal. BP (1730 CE). Periods of intense herbivore grazing and trampling altered the local vegetation composition and sediment accumulation. Greater vegetation diversity is associated with woodland disturbance through fire and moderate grazing. Subsequent cessation of localised burning and continued (long-term) grazing have had legacy effects on woodland composition and diversity. Synthesis and applications: The current woodland is identified as being compositionally and structurally distinct from past woodland conditions, and its perceived 'naturalness' can be considered a 'shifted baseline', highlighting the importance of longer-term perspectives to woodland management. Human-woodland interactions are important in shaping modern woodlands and should not be overlooked in future management strategies as human-induced disturbance can promote woodland diversity, resilience and valuable ecosystem characteristics.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - This study examines the impact of the extensive climatic and environmental changes associated with the Early Holocene on the feeding ecology of aurochs, European bison, red deer, and Eurasian elk in southern Scandinavia from radiocarbon dates and analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Molecular sex information is utilised in the study of aurochs to understand the underlying reasons behind observed intraspecific differences. Asynchronous diachronic changes in dietary palaeoecology were observed between the included taxa. The observed trends in foraging and habitat use among herbivores in our dataset can be attributed to the directional vegetation change from open landscape to forest. Our findings imply that environmental changes and/or interspecific competition contributed to the local extinction of European bison and impacted the niches of remaining species through niche overlap (cervids) and partitioning (between cervids and aurochs). Thus, our observations are consistent with the influence of multiple mechanisms that acted concurrently.

AB  - Wetlands are represented in Saudi Arabia in the form of mangrove, sabkha, and wadi (valleys) systems, and these habitats are considered as a sanctuary for biodiversity. The present study aimed to identify different vegetation groups in a wetland site in Wadi Hargan near Alqurainah, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and to relate different plant communities and plant diversity to soil moisture, salinity, and other soil properties. Floristic analysis and vegetation structure were investigated within 15 stands along the wadi and were subjected to correlation analysis with soil factors via multivariate analysis. The floristic survey revealed the presence of 111 plant species belonging to 39 families. The most represented families were Asteraceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Caryophyllaceae, and Papilionaceae, which accounted for the largest proportion (55.4%) of the total species. The therophytes were the dominant life form, where they were represented by 46.9% of the total number of species. The application of cluster analysis (TWINSPAN) to the importance value of each species based on the relative cover and density led to the recognition of four plant communities: (A) Phragmites australis-Tamarix nilotica community, (B) Zygophyllum coccineum-Acacia gerrardii community, (C) Lycium shawii-Zygophyllum coccineum community, and (D) Rhazya stricta community. The soil analysis and correlation test revealed significant variations in the content of salinity, moisture, CO3, Cl, SO4, Ca, Mg, and Na among the plant communities. It can be concluded that soil moisture and salinity factors were the fundamental driving forces for plant community structure in the studied wadi. The wadi was moderately grazed, mainly by camels; thereby, the invasive plant Rhazya stricta dominated the central region of the wadi. Also, human interference was observed at the end of the wadi, where some weeds sprouted such as Malva parviflora. The presence of those two rare wetland species, Adiantum capillus-veneris and Ficus salicifolia, in the study area, showed the unique properties of the studied wadi and necessitate an urgent biodiversity conservation action to protect its natural vegetation from overgrazing and human interference.

AB  - Aim For tens of millions of years, herbivorous megafauna were abundant across the globe, fulfilling important ecological roles including seed dispersal. Megafruits are very large fruits that are dispersed most effectively by megafauna. However, megafruits also occur in ecosystems where megafauna are extinct or were never present, emphasizing our incomplete understanding of megafauna-megafruit relationships. Here we use the complex biogeography of tropical Asia to investigate how megafruit diversity and traits are associated with the diversity of megafauna, smaller animals, and abiotic factors. Location Tropical Asia, from the Indian subcontinent in the west to tropical China in the north to the Maluku archipelago (Indonesia) in the east. Time period Late Pleistocene to the present day. Major taxa studied Megafauna (body weight > 500 kg) that consume fruits, including stegodons, elephants, rhinoceroses, giant tapirs, and large bovids. Fleshy-fruited plant species across the region with a fruit width > 40 mm (i.e., megafruits). Methods We compiled a list of all megafruits along with selected plant, fruit, and seed traits in 16 subregions across tropical Asia. We explored biogeographical patterns in megafruit diversity and traits in relation to the diversities of past and present megafauna, large- and medium-sized animals and abiotic factors (mean temperature, mean precipitation, precipitation seasonality, insularity). Results We identified 496 megafruits in tropical Asia. Megafruit diversity was highest in subregions with high megafaunal diversity, particularly extant species. Megafruit traits were influenced most strongly by abiotic factors (mainly temperature and land area), and weakly by megafauna and smaller dispersers. Main conclusions Our results are consistent with megafauna maintaining or responding to megafruit diversity, but variation in megafruit traits is primarily associated with abiotic factors. Given the massive megafaunal losses in tropical Asia since the Late Pleistocene, it is important to identify fruit traits that can increase megafauna-dependence and thus vulnerability to these losses.

AB  - Wildlife-habitat relationships reflect the behavioral choices made by species in response to perceived risks and rewards. Ungulates must often choose between habitats that provide forage and those offering concealment from predators, yet natural and anthropogenic disturbances create risky landscapes where tradeoffs may be difficult to navigate. Ungulate responses to forest disturbance may vary by sex and reproductive state, given that reproductive females with calves often prioritize predator avoidance. We investigated state-dependent habitat use by reproductive and solitary moose (Alces americanus) in response to salvage logging after a widespread infestation by spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) in the boreal forest of Yukon, Canada. We used camera traps and multistate occupancy models to examine moose occurrence in unsalvaged and salvage-logged forests at different regenerative stages (0-10 years and 11-25 years postlogging) and levels of tree retention after logging. We compared results to single-state occupancy models that did not account for reproductive status. As predicted, single-state models showed high use of stands with low canopy cover and maximum tree removal (i.e., clear-cuts). This suggested that moose capitalized on shrubby forage available in logged stands, regardless of regenerative stage. However, this result was overly simplistic. Multistate occupancy models revealed that forest age was the most important factor for female moose with calves, in contrast to solitary moose. Females with calves tended to avoid newly logged areas and preferred regenerating and unsalvaged forests with hiding cover, although estimates of effect size had low precision. Climate change is contributing to the rising frequency and severity of bark beetle outbreaks, and post-infestation salvage logging has been implicated in the decline of moose populations in western Canada. Our results support the need to maintain diverse, mixed-age forest landscapes to meet the food and cover requirements of moose in different demographic classes.

AB  - Habitat selection is a critical aspect of a species' ecology, requiring complex decision-making that is both hierarchical and scale-dependent, since factors that influence selection may be nested or unequal across scales. Elk (Cervus canadensis) ranged widely across diverse ecoregions in North America prior to European settlement and subsequent eastern extirpation. Most habitat selection studies have occurred within their contemporary western range, even after eastern reintroductions began. As habitat selection can vary by geographic location, available cover, season, and diel period, it is important to understand how a non-migratory, reintroduced population in northern Wisconsin, USA, is limited by the lack of variation in topography, elevation, and vegetation. We tested scale-dependent habitat selection on 79 adult elk from 2017 to 2020 using resource selection functions across temporal (i.e., seasonal) and spatial scales (i.e., landscape and home range). We found that selection varied both spatially and temporally, and elk selected areas with the greatest potential to influence fitness at larger scales, meaning elk selected areas closer to escape cover and further from "risky" features (e.g., annual wolf territory centers, county roads, and highways). We found stronger avoidance of annual wolf territory centers during spring, suggesting elk were selecting safer habitats during calving season. Elk selected habitats with less canopy cover across both spatial scales and all seasons, suggesting that elk selected areas with better access to forage as early seral stage stands have greater forage biomass than closed-canopy forests and direct solar radiation to provide warmth in the cooler seasons. This study provides insight into the complexity of hierarchical decision-making, such as how risky habitat features and land cover type influence habitat selection differently across seasons and spatial scales, influencing the decision-making of elk. Scale-dependent behavior is crucial to understand within specific geographic regions, as these decisions scale up to influence population dynamics.

AB  - Alien species are species that are introduced into an area where they are not naturally present. Some of them may exert negative ecological impacts, thus being defined as invasive. The aoudad or Barbary sheep Ammotragus lervia is a north-African ungulate commercialised and introduced for game hunting to Europe, South Africa, and America. As a generalist herbivore, the aoudad has a high capacity to adapt to new habitat conditions, possibly representing a threat to local biodiversity. We studied the aoudad population present in the Beigua Natural Regional Park in Liguria, northwestern Italy. By using historical data and camera trapping data, we reconstructed the colonization process and current distribution, estimated minimum abundance, assessed population trends over the years, and investigated habitat selection and activity rhythms. Aoudads most likely escaped from a game reserve in Ponzone Municipality, Piedmont, and settled in the park at least since 2009. The minimum number alive doubled in 10 years, from 9 to 23, and the population shows an increasing trend. Aoudads showed a preference for steep, rocky and woody areas in the southern and warmer part of the Beigua massif, especially at intermediate elevations. Some observations have recently occurred in the northern part of the Park, potentially due to geographical expansion. Aoudads show mostly diurnal activity, unlike native ungulates such as roe deer Capreolus capreolus and wild boar Sus scrofa which were most active at dawn, dusk and during the night, possibly reflecting anti-predator behaviour towards wolf Canis lupus. Our results are in line with other studies, though births occurred across a wider period of time compared with native populations. As the potential ecological impacts of this alien species in the study area have never been investigated, it will be important to monitor the population and evaluate its ecological effects to provide the most appropriate management solutions.

AB  - Question: Foraging-tunnel disturbances created by herbivorous mammals can influence the above-ground plant biomass of grassland communities. The plateau zokor (Eospalax baileyi) was considered a focal animal for investigating the effect of foraging-tunnel disturbances created by herbivorous mammals on the above-ground biomass and species richness of graminoids and forbs. Here, we ask how foraging-tunnel disturbances created by plateau zokors influences above-ground plant biomass and species richness of graminoids and forbs in alpine grasslands.Location: The study was conducted at three sites of alpine grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China.Methods: In this study, all vascular plants were divided into graminoids and forbs, and 30 paired quadrats were randomly selected from each site. In total, 90 tunnel quadrats and 90 non-tunnel quadrats were surveyed and sampled.Results: This study showed that foraging-tunnel disturbances decreased the plant species richness of the grassland community and forbs by 16.5% and 17.7% respectively, whereas the response of graminoid species richness to foraging-tunnel disturbance was different among the three sites, in which foraging-tunnel disturbance decreased the graminoid species richness at Maqu and Xiahe sites and had no impact on the graminoid species richness at Tianzhu site. Regarding forbs, some legumes identified in the non-tunnel quadrats were not observed in the tunnel quadrats. The foraging-tunnel disturbances resulted in an above-ground plant biomass decrease of 21.9% in the grassland community, 27.3% in forbs, and 17.2% in graminoids respectively. The percentage of graminoids in the above-ground plant biomass increased from 50.4% in non-tunnel quadrats to 55.5% in tunnel quadrats, a relative increase of 10.1% from the initial percentage.Conclusions: These results indicate that the foraging-tunnel disturbances seemed to improve the forage availability for livestock in tunnel quadrats due to a higher relative proportion of graminoids in the grassland plant community, despite a decrease in graminoid biomass. However, the tunnels not only decreased the above-ground plant biomass and species richness of forbs, but also might have a negative impact on soil nitrogen input because of the absence of some legumes. The findings of this study suggest that reseeding some legumes is an effective approach to maintaining plant diversity and soil fertility, which can compensate for the negative effect of foraging-tunnel disturbance on alpine grasslands.

AB  - Ungulates have undergone major declines in Central and West African forests as a result of bushmeat trade and habitat loss. Monitoring forest ungulate status is a critical conservation need. We undertook a systematic camera-trap survey of the 5260 km(2) Dja Faunal Reserve, Cameroon's largest protected area. We deployed cameras at 305 sites in eight grids across the reserve over 28,277 camera-trap days. We recorded 30,601 independent detections of 12 species of forest ungulate. The blue and Peters' duikers were the most abundant, accounting for 82% of all ungulate detections, both with occupancy >85% in all survey grids. The black-fronted duiker was relatively widespread but rare. The white-bellied duiker and water chevrotain were found mostly in the southern part of the reserve. There were very few detections of sitatunga, forest buffalo and bongo. Our results suggest ecological partitioning among the more abundant duikers based on activity pattern and body size. The reserve faces many pressures including illegal subsistence and commercial hunting. Community surveillance and partnerships, with improved law enforcement are among measures being implemented by the Cameroon government to enhance security and ensure retention of the reserve's World Heritage status.

AB  - Tree plantations worldwide often succumb to abandonment or little management due to shifting project goals and inconsistent funding. Whether natural regeneration in abandoned tree plantations can restore biodiversity remains imperative for conservation and restoration. To address this gap, we examined mammal community changes in a tree plantation-natural secondary forest mosaic landscape in the Qinling Mountains of China. We used camera trapping surveys spanning ten years and multispecies occupancy models to study how mammal communities change in abandoned Japanese larch plantations (Larix kaempferi). The results showed that abandoned plantations initially had lower mammal species richness when they were around 20-30 years old but recovered to a similar level as natural secondary forests after another decade of natural regeneration. Overall, herbivores showed a more pronounced recovery than carnivores and omnivores, but species responses varied. Most species were more likely to occur in older plantations, especially takins (Budorcas taxicolor), Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus), and Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana). The plantations and stand age showed a mixed effect on the co-occurrence of giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) and other species. Our findings manifest the potential of abandoned tree plantations to support mammal communities as they age if the natural secondary forests exist in the landscape matrix. Nonetheless, the recovery of native species in tree plantations also relies on the landscape effect and the dynamics in the surrounding natural forests. Future conservation should actively manage some tree plantations if natural regeneration is hindered within the plantation, such as selective logging.

AB  - Anthropogenic activities may alter felid assemblage structure, facilitating the persistence of tolerant species (commonly mesopredators), excluding ecologically demanding ones (top predators) and, consequently, changing coexistence rules. We aimed to determine how human activities influence intraguild relationships among top predators and their cascading effects on mesopredators, which remain poorly understood despite evidence of top carnivore decline. We used structural equation modeling at a continental scale to investigate how habitat quality and quantity, livestock density, and other human pressures modified the intraguild relations of the 3 species that are at the top of the food chain in the Neotropics: jaguars (Panthera onca), pumas (Puma concolor), and ocelots (Leopardus pardalis). We included presence-absence data derived from systematic studies compiled in Neocarnivores data set for these felid species at 0.0833 degrees resolution. Human disturbance reduced the probability of jaguar occurrence by -0.35 standard deviations. Unexpectedly, the presence of sheep (Ovis aries) or goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) and jaguars was positively related to the presence of pumas, whereas puma presence was negatively related to the presence of ocelots. Extent of forest cover had more of an effect on jaguar (beta = 0.23) and ocelot (beta = 0.12) occurrences than the extent of protected area, which did not have a significant effect. The lack of effect of human activities on puma presence and the positive effect of small livestock supports the notion that pumas are more adaptable to habitat disturbance than jaguars. Our findings suggest that human disturbance has the potential to reverse the hierarchical competition dominance among large felids, leading to an unbalanced community structure. This shift disadvantages jaguars and elevates the position of pumas in the assemblage hierarchy, resulting in the exclusion of ocelots, despite their relatively lower susceptibility to anthropogenic disturbance. Our results suggest that conservation efforts should extend beyond protected areas to encompass the surrounding landscape, where complexities and potential conflicts are more pronounced.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates are sensitive to environmental disturbances, however, the effects of human activities on macroinvertebrate community structures and functional traits in glacier-fed streams are concerning. To elucidate the effects of horse, cattle and sheep grazing, hot spring scenic development, and historic iron ore mine development on macroinvertebrate communities, we conducted a study in three glacier-fed streams of the Tianshan Mountains in northwest China in April 2021. Our results showed that the species richness and density significantly decreased due to grazing (p < 0.05). There were more taxa with resilience traits such as "small size at maturity" in the grazing stream. The EPT richness and density affected by hot spring scenic development significantly decreased compared to the undisturbed point (p < 0.05). There was a significant increase in taxa with resistance traits such as "bi-or-multivoltine" in the hot spring stream. The stream affected by historic mine development is currently in the self-recovery stage following the closure of the mine ten years ago. Additionally, the species richness, EPT richness, and density at the mining site were significantly higher than the source site (p < 0.05), reflecting that the habitat fragmentation caused by previous mining activities prevented the upward dispersal of macroinvertebrates. The taxa in the mining stream were also characterized by higher resistance traits such as "abundant occurrence in drift". These results were attributed to the impacts of human disturbance on habitat stability, habitat heterogeneity, water quality, and material cycling of stream ecosystems, indicating human disturbance on the efficiency of resource utilization and functional diversification. In addition, our results showed that functional indicators of macroinvertebrate communities are helpful for monitoring and evaluating habitat conditions.

AB  - Many wild animals perceive humans as predators, and human disturbance, especially in the form of hunting, triggers antipredatory behavior among prey. Yet, knowledge of how game species react to different types of human disturbance and adapt to repeated disturbances is limited. We investigated how disturbance in the form of a solitary human approacher (stalker) impacted behavior (flight response and short-term habitat use) of 28 GPS-collared red deer (Cervus elaphus) in two populations with contrasting population densities in Norway. We studied how the behavioral response differed: (1) with season (pre-hunting vs. hunting); (2) by consecutive approaches within a day; (3) among replicated experiments within the same season; and (4) between two regions with contrasting densities of red deer. The average flight initiation distance (FID) increased by 15% during the hunting season, and consecutive approaches within the same day caused the red deer to move 49% longer distances. Flight initiation distance was longer in the high-density population, while escape distance was longer in the low-density population. Red deer moved out of their weekly home range after 52% approaches, and after the onset of hunting season, time spent outside the home range increased by 89%. Red deer preferred denser resting sites after the disturbance and animal sites had shorter sighting distance and higher canopy cover than control plots. Tree density and canopy cover at animal sites increased at the onset of hunting season, from first to second approach within day, and after replicated experiments within season. Our results suggest that red deer preferred dense resting sites, especially in the hunting season. However, these animal sites had the same amount of the favorable forage plant bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), indicating no clear food-cover trade-off in selection of habitat. Our study showed that onset of hunting initiates stronger fear responses in red deer, which may in turn affect red deer distribution and harvesting efficiency.

AB  - Endemic island plant species under threat due to anthropogenic activities may be more susceptible to decline than their indigenous counterparts. Our study aimed to determine whether endemic and indigenous plant cover in Hawaiian forests have been differentially affected by resource availability, disturbance, and invasion over time. We resurveyed 25 plots (400 m(2) each) across gradients of elevation, precipitation, slope, and understory light availability in forested conservation areas on the island of O'ahu, Hawai'i, USA. We assessed how these abiotic factors relate to absolute cover (previous, current, and change over time) of endemic and indigenous Hawaiian plants, as well as that of non-native species. Endemic species had a net loss of cover (-45%) since previous surveys 27 to 45 years earlier, while indigenous species had a net gain (+ 29%), as did non-natives (similar to 1%). Endemic species cover was associated with higher elevations in both prior surveys and in 2018, and with steeper plot slopes in prior surveys. However, change in endemic cover over time was negatively correlated with slope, likely due to landslide disturbance or the proliferation of shade-tolerant invaders in low-light conditions where no disturbance was evident. Change in endemic species cover over time was not clearly related to resource availability (light and precipitation). Given the differences in responses of endemic and indigenous species to abiotic conditions, and that the endemic species in this study were more susceptible to decline than indigenous species, the results of this study indicate that generalizations about natives as a single group can be misleading.

AB  - Calcareous grasslands are of high conservation importance and have been maintained by livestock grazing over many centuries. Following the reduction in traditional livestock grazing (cattle and sheep) of semi-natural grassland during the twentieth century, conservation-based grazing management was introduced in order to conserve remaining grasslands. In UK semi-natural grasslands, grazing pressure has fluctuated over time due to changes in conservation funding and stock availability, whilst the time of year at which stock graze has also shifted. There is little quantitative data available to demonstrate the details of changed grazing patterns, or their long-term effects on the vegetation, thus the full impacts of these changes are not well understood. This study examines the response of a diverse calcareous grassland community to changes in grazing management between 1979 and 2010 at Martin Down National Nature Reserve, southern England, using historical vegetation surveys and grazing records collected and recorded by reserve staff. Historical data showed a shift in grazing regime, whereby grazing occurred across all seasons in the early period, but switched to predominately the autumn and winter in the present century. Despite this significant shift in management over time, the vegetation community did not change dramatically over this period, although small increases in species richness and diversity were detected. The richness of calcareous grassland indicator species remained largely consistent, suggesting the conservation value of the grassland persisted, and the community types also stayed fairly constant over the 31 years. Furthermore, weak evidence was found for impacts of grazing in particular seasons on vegetation community measures; species richness, species diversity, indicator richness, indicator abundance, grass abundance and forb abundance. This study suggests that these vegetation communities are robust to changes in grazing seasonality providing that sufficient grazing pressure is provided within the year. The compartmentalised grazing employed at Martin Down may be a useful method for ensuring this outcome. However more research is required, preferably using controlled field experiments before more reliable recommendations can be prescribed.

AB  - 1. In the plant community with a shrub-grass mosaic, the main types of litter include herbaceous litter and its mixed forms with shrub leaves and stems. However, the quantitative relationship between the litter composition type and the litter decomposition, as well as how these processes are influenced by grazing activities (e.g. excrement deposition), remains largely unexplored. 2. Herein, a three-year litter incubation experiment was conducted in a shrub-encroached alpine meadow. We aimed to elucidate the individual and interactive effects of litter type (solely grass litter (L), a mixture of grass litter and shrub leaves (L1) and a mixture of grass litter, shrub leaves and shrub stems (L2)) and yak excrement addition (no addition, addition of dung only, addition of urine only, addition of both dung and urine) on the litter decomposition rate and nutrients release. Additionally, the initial chemical quality of litter, soil microclimate, soil nutrients and soil microbial attributes were analysed to ascertain the underlying driving mechanisms. 3. We found that litter type and yak excrement had significant individual and interactive effects on litter decomposition. Specifically, litter type primarily affected litter decomposition by increasing initial carbon and lignin concentration and reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of the litter. In contrast, yak excrement positively impacted litter decomposition through enhancing soil pH and soil microbial activity. Crucially, low-quality litter (L2) mitigated the positive effects of yak excrement on litter decomposition. While the addition of yak excrement did not alter the overall direction of litter decomposition, it influenced the magnitude of the effects caused by litter mixing. Notably, temporary nitrogen immobilization was observed during the early stages of decomposition, and net phosphorus release patterns were evident throughout the decomposition process. However, the duration of nitrogen immobilization differed depending on the litter type and yak excrement treatment. 4. Our findings provide localized evidences that elucidate the interactive effects of litter type and yak excrement addition on litter decomposition and nutrient release processes. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of how grazing activity modulates nutrient cycling in shrub-encroached grassland ecosystems.

AB  - Aim Marine vertebrates play key functional roles on reef ecosystems. Despite their phylogenetic distance, different vertebrate lineages could play similar functions on reefs, which has been overlooked by current research on marine functional biogeography. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of the functional structure and inventory of ecosystem functions delivered by 224 vertebrates-marine mammals, sea turtles, sharks, rays and bony fish-in Atlantic Ocean reefs. Location Atlantic Ocean reefs. Methods We compiled six species-level traits and investigated geographical patterns of functional richness (FRic), functional uniqueness (FUn) and specialization (FSpe) in 83 assemblages. Additionally, we simulate the effects of marine vertebrate species' extinction on functional diversity metrics. Results Sharks, rays and bony fish species had the highest overlap in functional space (30.94%), while turtles overlapped mainly with bony fishes (1.76%). The functional structure of vertebrate assemblages is not homogeneous across the Atlantic. While functional richness peaks in the Caribbean (a "functional hotspot"), this region depicts low-to-intermediate functional uniqueness and functional specialization levels. Despite the large proportion of threatened top predator species (53.1%), mainly large-bodied sharks, it is the loss of mesopredator species that will severely impact (up to 94% of functional loss) the functional space of vertebrate assemblages in Atlantic Ocean reefs. Main conclusions Our study reveals that functional richness patterns of vertebrate assemblages differ across Atlantic Ocean reefs. Despite the low values of functional uniqueness and specialization in some reef assemblages, reef functioning can still be compromised due to species' extinctions. The impact of mesopredators' loss over the functional structure of vertebrate assemblages is worrisome since this group holds a considerable proportion of threatened species (20.1%) and is next in line considering the anthropogenic impacts over high trophic level species.

AB  - Large herbivores regulate ecosystem structure and functioning across Earth's biomes, but vegetation community responses to herbivory depend on complex interactions involving the timing and intensity of herbivory pressure and other, often abiotic, controls on vegetation. Consequently, reindeer-driven vegetation transitions in the Arctic occur heterogeneously between and even within landscapes. Here, we employed drone surveys to investigate drivers of spatial heterogeneity in vegetation responses to reindeer herbivory by mapping change comprehensively across a landscape at the fine scale inherent to plant-herbivore interactions. We conducted our surveys on the Yamal Peninsula, West Siberia in coordination with Indigenous Nenets mobile pastoralists managing a reindeer herd of hundreds of animals, including 13 animals with GPS collars. The surveys mapped the focal landscape immediately before the herd arrived, immediately after they had left the site, and one month after the herd's activity. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry in a novel workflow that accounts for spatially variable uncertainty in the SfM reconstructions, we detected significant decreases in canopy height over 0.4% of the site after the herbivory event and significant increases in canopy height over 3% of the site one month later. Vegetation responses diverged depending on the amount of herbivory pressure, which was derived from the collar GPS data. In areas with higher reindeer activity, there were initial decreases in canopy height strongly suggesting trampling and defoliation, including signs of browsing around the edges of erect shrubs, and subsequent growth instead predominantly in low-lying vegetation one month later. Areas with lower herbivory pressure within the same habitat types showed strikingly little change throughout the study period. Due to our spatially comprehensive approach, we were able to pinpoint immediate and lagged effects of an herbivory pulse, ultimately demonstrating how herbivory can shape the productivity and distribution of vegetation communities within a landscape.

AB  - Subterranean rodents can act as ecosystem engineers by shaping the landscape due to soil perturbation and herbivory. At the same time, their burrow density is affected by environmental conditions, vegetation and anthropogenic factors. Disentangling this complex interplay between subterranean rodents and their environment remains challenging. In our study, we analysed the interplay of abiotic conditions, vegetation patterns and human land-use and the burrow density of the giant root-rat (GRR; Tachyoryctes macrocephalus), a subterranean rodent endemic to the Afroalpine ecosystem of the Bale Mountains in south-east Ethiopia. Specifically, we examined the effects of GRR on plant species richness and vegetation cover and vice-versa, and how these reciprocal effects might be modulated by temperature, habitat wetness and grazing. Our results showed that increasing GRR burrow density led to decreased vegetation cover, and that effects of GRR on vegetation cover were slightly stronger than vice -versa. Considering the reciprocal causation models, we found that increasing plant species richness led to increased GRR burrow density, while GRR burrow density decreased as vegetation cover increased. Increases in habitat wetness and livestock grazing intensity also directly led to increased GRR burrow density. Our results stress the importance of subterranean ecosys-tem engineers on vegetation and highlight the vulnerability of these complex interactions to human activity.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Arid steppe rangelands in North Africa are highly significant ecosystems that are exceedingly sensitive to global warming and are also influenced by severe grazing and heavy utilization practices. Consequently, it is imperative to conduct extensive investigations regarding the impact of overgrazing due to increased sheep populations on plant diversity in these regions. The objective of this study is to examine the effect of two grazing managements (grazing-excluded vs. free-grazing) on floristic diversity in the arid steppe rangelands of North Africa. Sampling encompassed 10 sites, with 5 freely accessible to livestock and 5 protected from grazing. Within each site, three 200-m transects were established to survey and quantify plant species abundance. Alpha (species richness and diversity) and beta (qualitative and quantitative similarity analysis) biodiversity parameters were evaluated at both small and large spatial scales. The findings demonstrated a substantial disparity in plant diversity between grazing-excluded rangelands and free-grazed rangelands. Plant community diversity and stability parameters were notably higher in grazing-excluded areas. The taxonomic structure of plant communities also exhibited greater stability in grazing-excluded steppe areas. Specifically, the grazing-excluded sites displayed superior diversity metrics, including species richness (93), Shannon index (3.2), and Simpson reciprocal index (5.5), in comparison to severely grazed sites (61, 2.6, and 4.4), respectively). The influence of severe grazing had a more pronounced effect on ephemeral species rather than perennials, emphasizing the heightened vulnerability of these plants to overgrazing effect or inadequate grassland management practices. This effect coincided with heterogeneity in floristic composition between sites with free continuous livestock access and those protected from grazing. Furthermore, analysis of similarity at different spatial scales revealed an increase in diversity at small scales contrasted with a decrease at larger scales. Grazing exerted discernible effects on floristic composition, particularly affecting ephemeral species, albeit primarily at small scales. At larger scales, the impact of grazing was not detected. These findings underscore the complex relationship between grazing practices and plant diversity dynamics in arid steppe ecosystems, emphasizing the importance of sustainable management strategies to preserve biodiversity in these vulnerable habitats.

AB  - Early Neolithic communities penetrated in southwestern Transylvania and were established in the Mures Valley where they found suitable territories for domestic animal herds and probably plant cultivation. The present study tries to answer questions related to the beginnings of the neolithisation in this area, from an interdisciplinary perspective, valuing archeozoologically and archeobotanically the Starcevo-Cris site of Soimus-Teleghi (Hunedoara County), dating to the 7th-6th millennium BC. Animal skeletal remains and phytoliths are the proxies analysed in this paper, offering data about the palaeoeconomy and palaeoenvironment of the Early Neolithic settlement. In the archaeozoological samples, the remains coming from domestic mammals are the most frequent, being identified as cattle (Bos taurus), sheep/goat (Ovis aries/Capra hircus), pig (Sus domesticus), and dog (Canis familiaris). The fact that pig remains are almost absent in the samples is significant, suggesting a mobility of the evaluated communities. The skeletal remains of wild mammal species are rare, belonging to red deer (Cervus elaphus), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), aurochs (Bos primigenius), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and polecat (Mustela putorius). The strong dominance of grasses is attested through the phytoliths' assemblages. ELONGATE DENDRITIC phytoliths are well represented. This morphotype, which originates from the inflorescence or the husk of Poaceae, is most likely derived from cultivated plants (cereals such as wheat, barley, etc.). Archaeozoological and archaeobotanical data resulting from this study suggest an open environment around the Early Neolithic settlement, where communities of the Starcevo-Cris culture mainly raised herds of cattle and sheep/goat. Sporadically, hunting and gathering molluscs were practised by the inhabitants, as indicated by archaeozoological results.

AB  - Sasa spp., monocarpic dwarf bamboos, are known to form recalcitrant understories, lower species diversity, and hinder forest development. Sasa borealis distributed throughout Korea showed a phenomenon of synchronized dieback after large-scale synchronized flowering nationwide around 2015. Therefore, we conducted this study to take advantage of the rare event and add prevailing activity of wild boars and culm removal to elucidate whether they promote the regeneration of a long-term suppressed forest. We set permanent plots in forests with different understory types, and tracked the vegetation change in 5 years with respect to species composition, tree regeneration, and S. borealis reestablishment. This study focused on comparison between plots established after mass flowering. In flowering stands, we found the species diversity increased significantly with increase in species evenness, but not with recruitment of new species. Furthermore, the seeds of mass-produced bamboo germinated, and the seedling abundance was found to increase considerably. In stands rooted by wild boar, species diversity increased through the recruitment of new species, including tree species. It increased the abundance of shrub and perennial herbs, while it suppressed the reestablishment of S. borealis. Although rooting effect was independently significant regardless of flowering, the synergistic effect of rooting and flowering on forest regeneration was outstanding. Wild boar seemed to function as a remover of dead culms and a breaker of remaining underground mats as well as a seed disperser. Consequently, the species composition became similar to the reference stands. However, culm cutting caused negative effects by facilitating S. borealis to re-occupy or resprout. Overall, as the wild boar population increases, the positive effect can be expected to enhance. At landscape scale, considering several factors such as flowering and non-flowering, and population size of wild boar, the long-term suppressed forests by S. borealis are projected to regenerate with mosaic forests.

AB  - Trophic interactions between mobile animals and their food sources often vector resource flows across ecosystem boundaries. However, the quality and quantity of such ecological subsidies may be altered by indirect interactions between seemingly unconnected taxa. We studied whether emergent macrophytes growing at the aquatic-terrestrial interface facilitate multi-step aquatic-to-terrestrial resource flows between streams and terrestrial herbivores. We also explored whether aquatic animal aggregations indirectly promote such resource flows by creating biogeochemical hotspots of nutrient cycling and availability. We tested whether white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in eastern North America vector nutrient fluxes from streams to terrestrial ecosystems by consuming emergent macrophytes (Justicia americana) using isotope and nutrient analyses of fecal samples and motion-sensing cameras. We also tested whether mussel-generated biogeochemical hotspots might promote such fluxes by surveying the density and nutrient stoichiometry of J. americana beds growing in association with variable densities of freshwater mussels (Bivalvia: Unionoida). Fecal samples from riparian deer had 3% lower C:N and 20% lower C:P ratios than those in upland habitats. C and N isotopes suggested riparian deer ate both terrestrial and aquatic (J. americana) vegetation, whereas upland deer ate more terrestrial foods. Motion-sensing cameras showed deer eating J. americana more than twice as frequently at mussel-generated hotspots than non-mussel sites. However, mussels were not associated with variation in J. americana growth or N and P content-although N isotopes in J. americana leaves did suggest assimilation of animal-derived nutrients. Our findings suggest that white-tailed deer may conduct significant transfers of aquatic-derived nutrients into terrestrial habitats when they feed on macrophytes and defecate on land. Whether aquatic animal aggregations promote such resource flows by creating biogeochemical hotspots remains unresolved, but the nearly global distributions of the deer family (Cervidae) and of macrophytes suggest that cervid-driven aquatic-to-terrestrial nutrient flows may be widespread and ecologically important.

AB  - The influence of grazing activity, specifically excreta deposition, on the positive contributions of soil fauna to litter decomposition was not comprehensively examined. We conducted a 660-day field experiment to test the interactive effects of yak excreta and soil fauna on litter decomposition and underlying driving mechanisms. We found adding yak excreta further increased the positive effect of soil fauna on litter decomposition. The strengths, and mechanisms of this promoting effects varied depending on excreta type and decomposition stage. The changes in litter decomposition constants increased by 116.3% and 98.2% with dung addition alone and both dung and urine addition, respectively. The time required to achieve 75% mass loss was the shortest (129% in advance) under the conditions of interaction between yak excreta and soil fauna. Importantly, our findings suggested that yak excreta regulate the role of soil fauna in litter decomposition through nutrient deposition of excreta, physical breakdown by soil fauna, and trophic interaction. In the early decomposition stage, the primary determinants included soil nitrogen and soil moisture. Conversely, during the later decomposition stage, soil carbon and soil pH became the pivotal factors. This study improves our knowledge of how grazing and soil fauna affect nutrient cycling in grasslands ecosystems.

AB  - Large mammalian herbivores affect both plants and the small animals that live in and feed on those plants. The response of plant and animal communities to mammalian herbivory is variable worldwide, but rarely studied in North American salt marshes. We studied mammalian grazing (cattle, feral horses, and mowing as a type of "artificial grazing") on three barrier islands on the coast of Georgia, USA. The three grazing treatments differed in location, intensity, and type of herbivore. They all altered invertebrate community composition, but in different ways. Cattle grazing had the most negative impact on plant height, chlorophyll content, and leaf toughness, and on the density of invertebrates, while artificial grazing sometimes increased densities of planthoppers, herbivorous Chaetopsis spp. flies, and spiders. Although the responses to grazing of some plant traits and some invertebrate taxa were variable, plant height and katydid (Orchelimum fidicinium) density were consistently reduced by the three grazing types. In laboratory experiments, katydids (the easiest herbivore to work with in the laboratory) did not have a feeding preference for grazed versus ungrazed plants, but grew better on ungrazed plants. Our results indicate that moderate levels of grazing do not harm salt marsh invertebrates in this geographic area, and may even benefit some species. Heavy grazing, however, strongly suppresses both plants and marsh invertebrates. Future studies should evaluate both grazing intensity and the different responses of different invertebrate taxa to improve guidance to managers about vertebrate grazing in salt marshes.

AB  - The global urban population is expected to increase by 2.5 billion people over the next 30 years. Yet the doubling of urban landscapes in the last decades have already led to habitat loss and concomitant impacts to biodiversity. Nonetheless urban landscapes remain important for wildlife, and multi-city analyses have revealed that wealthy urban areas house more biodiversity (species richness), a 'luxury effect'. We researched some of the mechanisms for the luxury effect for urban black-tailed deer, a species of increasing concern in urban landscapes across the northwestern Nearctic. We hypothesized that deer were capitalizing on anthropogenic resource subsidies occurring in affluent housing and supported by urban green spaces such as parks and golf courses. In 2018-19 we satellite-collared twenty deer in an affluent urban landscape in British Columbia, Canada, with 13-hr fix rates. We used generalized models in an information-theoretic framework to weigh evidence for competing hypotheses about the role of tree cover, productivity, public green spaces, and wealth in explaining deer selection. Wealth, manifesting as housing lot size, emerged as the dominant predictor of deer space-use, which is highly concentrated into very small home-ranges. Other landscape elements stemming from affluence, including golf courses and parklands, were also strongly selected by deer. We show post-colonization landscape conversion from dry semi-arid savannah to well-watered high-productivity landscapes is supporting deer, with ramifications for the rest of the biotic community. With urban landscapes becoming an increasingly important for biodiversity conservation, understanding these mechanisms and incorporating them into urban planning can help to promote wildlife-human coexistence.

AB  - After the domestication of goats around 10,000 years before the present (BP), humans transported goats far beyond the range of their wild ancestor, the bezoar goat. This brought domestic goats into contact with many wild goat species such as ibex and markhor, enabling introgression between domestic and wild goats. To investigate this, while shedding light on the taxonomic status of wild and domestic goats, we analysed genome-wide SNP data of 613 specimens from 14 taxonomic units, including Capra hircus, C. pyrenaica, C. ibex (from Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Slovenia), C. aegagrus aegagrus, C. a. cretica, C. h. dorcas, C. caucasica caucasica, C. c. severtzovi, C. c. cylindricornis, C. falconeri, C. sibirica sibirica, C. s. alaiana and C. nubiana, as well as Oreamnos americanus (mountain goat) as an outgroup. To trace gene flow between domestic and wild goats, we integrated genotype data of local goat breeds from the Alps as well as from countries such as Spain, Greece, Turkiye, Egypt, Sudan, Iran, Russia (Caucasus and Altai) and Pakistan. Our phylogenetic analyses displayed a clear separation between bezoar-type and ibex-type clades with wild goats from the Greek islands of Crete and Youra clustered within domestic goats, confirming their feral origin. Our analyses also revealed gene flow between the lineages of Caucasian tur and domestic goats that most likely occurred before or during early domestication. Within the clade of domestic goats, analyses inferred gene flow between African and Iberian goats. The detected events of introgression were consistent with previous reports and offered interesting insights into the historical relationships among domestic and wild goats.

AB  - The effects of altered nutrient supplies and herbivore density on species diversity vary with spatial scale, because coexistence mechanisms are scale dependent. This scale dependence may alter the shape of the species-area relationship (SAR), which can be described by changes in species richness (S) as a power function of the sample area (A): S = cA(z), where c and z are constants. We analysed the effects of experimental manipulations of nutrient supply and herbivore density on species richness across a range of scales (0.01-75 m(2)) at 30 grasslands in 10 countries. We found that nutrient addition reduced the number of species that could co-occur locally, indicated by the SAR intercepts (log c), but did not affect the SAR slopes (z). As a result, proportional species loss due to nutrient enrichment was largely unchanged across sampling scales, whereas total species loss increased over threefold across our range of sampling scales.

AB  - Following a long-term herbivore-exclusion study (2003-2008) in the mid-eulittoral zone at Kalk Bay, Cape Town, South Africa, the post-herbivore-exclusion effect (12 years later) of the limpet Cymbula oculus, the dominant herbivore in the community, was examined after it had recolonised the area. Despite the limpet having recruited into all plots (previous exclusion plots and control plots), the species richness, percentage cover of sessile organisms, invertebrate densities and invertebrate biomass were all significantly higher in previous exclusion plots compared with in control plots. Cymbula oculus density was higher in previous exclusion plots (11.11 [SD 12.54] ind. m(-2)) than in control plots (9.26 [SD 7.97] ind. m(-2)) (p = 0.038); however, its biomass was similar between the previous exclusion plots and control plots (366.39 [SD 421.63] vs 367.96 [SD 285.44] g m(-2), p = 0.179), indicating that limpets outside exclusion plots were generally larger. This was likely because of younger C. oculus individuals, heightened interspecific competition, or insufficient space in previous exclusion plots. The observed differences might be attributed to a combination of factors, including the persistence of species that have achieved a size refuge from grazing and bulldozing by C. oculus, as well as the establishment of invasive mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis which offer secondary substrates and microhabitats for the establishment of macroalgae and other invertebrates. The recruitment of M. galloprovincialis into the previous exclusion plots is likely to be the cause of the alternative community state observed. Unless some extreme disturbance event occurs, the community from which C. oculus was previously excluded is unlikely to revert to its pre-C. oculus exclusion state.

AB  - The influence of grazing on soil seed bank (SSB) characteristics determines the management of rangelands in different climates. Here we studied the responses of SSBs to livestock grazing in three regions with different climates - arid, semiarid and subhumid - in northern Iran. In each region 30 pairwise SSB samples were collected on 1 m2 plots, 15 in intensely grazed areas and 15 in ungrazed areas. The total SSB densities, their diversity and species richness and the densities of functional groups were compared between the grazed and ungrazed plots and between the climatic regions. Both climate and grazing as well as their interaction affected SSB characteristics. Although the results of the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NoS) showed noticeable differences in SSB species composition between grazed and ungrazed plots in all three regions, the magnitude of the grazing effect on the SSB was different between climatic regions. In total, 119 species germinated from the soil samples: 33 species in semiarid, 39 species in arid and 61 species in subhumid samples. The highest total SSB density, diversity (Shannon index) and richness were found in subhumid climate with an average of 138.90 seeds/m2, H = 2.27 and 17.83 species/sample, respectively. In ungrazed areas the average SSB density was 26.60 seeds/m2, 46.06 seeds/m2 and 195.90 seeds/m2 in arid, semiarid and subhumid climate, respectively. In grazed areas the corresponding figures were 12.40 seeds/m2, 7.00 seeds/m2 and 110.40 seeds/m2. Averages of SSB diversity in ungrazed areas were 1.24, 1.60 and 2.42 in arid, semiarid and subhumid climates, respectively, as compared to 1.27, 0.97 and 2.20 in grazed areas. The averages SSB richness in ungrazed areas were 5.21 species/sample, 7.54 species/sample and 21.25 species/sample in arid, semiarid and subhumid climate, respectively, whereas in grazed areas 4.00 species/sample, 2.86 species/sample and 16.15 species/sample were found on average. Overall, intensive grazing was linked to lower SSB characteristics in all three climatic regions, but the size of the effect differed between the climatic regions. Thus, we concluded that the impact of grazing on SSB density, diversity and richness is climate-dependent. Hence, the climatic conditions have to be considered when evaluating the effects of grazing on soil seed banks.

AB  - A 42,000-year record of coprophilous fungal (Sporormiella, Podospora, Cercophora), fossil pollen and charcoal data assessed megafaunal use of woodland versus grassland settings in Central American landscapes by Pleistocene megafauna. The sedimentary record from Lake Peten-Itza showed that vegetation growing around the lake shifted between scrub grasslands, Pinus-dominated woodlands, Quercus-dominated woodlands, and tropical seasonal forest. A series of regression analyses and probabilistic models revealed that vegetation assemblages and temperature influenced the abundance of coprophilous fungus, a proxy for megafaunal abundance. We found that megafaunal populations were almost continuously present around Peten-Itza during the Pleistocene, and that the peak abundances appear to have been associated with cool, moist Quercus-rich parklands. In contrast, the lowest inputs of coprophilous fungi occurred during cold, dry events when scrub grasslands expanded. The dry grasslands may have been nutrient-limited, offering poor quality grazing for megafauna. The decline of the Pleistocene megafauna at Peten-Itzawas a multi-stage event, with a series of population collapses prior to an inferred local extirpation c. 13,600 years ago. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although livestock have been historically associated with land conversion and biodiversity loss, well-managed cattle grazing has been reported to contribute to conservation of open ecosystems. Knowing the balance between positive and negative effects of livestock (presence or exclusion) on different ecosystems is, therefore, crucial to support management decisions. We conducted an experiment in a secondary savanna with exotic grasses, used as pasture, to assess the effect of cattle presence in low density and cattle exclusion (in paired plots) on the trajectory of these ecosystems. Richness, composition and structure of the woody community, and exotic grass cover and biomass were compared between treatments in the beginning of the experiment and after 7 years. At the end of the experiment, we also compared composition, richness, and density of the native ground layer. We verified that (a) cattle exclusion accelerates the undesirable woody encroachment, changes the species composition and leads to huge grass fuel accumulation, while (b) cattle grazing/browsing hinders changes in savanna structure and composition and reduces the exotic grass cover and biomass, thus favoring native herbaceous plants. By decreasing the grass biomass, cattle grazing also reduces the system flammability and, therefore, the risk and intensity of wildfires. Together, the positive effects of cattle presence and the negative effects of cattle exclusion lead to the conclusion that cattle should be maintained in these systems. Low-intensity cattle grazing limits woody and exotic grass invasion, improves native forb biodiversity, and help to maintain composition and structural features of secondary savannas of the Cerrado.

AB  - Understanding free-ranging livestock-wildlife interactions in shared forest landscapes is critical for balancing the conflict between human exploitation of natural resources and wildlife conservation. However, little is known about the responses of ground-dwelling birds to grazing in temperate forests. We compiled a camera-trapping dataset of 1446 detections of 22 bird species over 6363 trap days from June to October 2020 at 25 cattlegrazed forest sites and 22 ungrazed sites, from which we assessed the relative impacts of cattle grazing, vegetation and predator (red fox Vulpes vulpes and leopard cat Prionailurus bengalensis) presence on the richness, site use, and diel activity patterns of understory birds (including frugivores and insectivores) in Northeast China. Our results revealed that ground-dwelling forest bird community assemblages were similar in both forest habitats; however, bird species richness was significantly greater in grazed forests than in ungrazed forests. The bird species richness increased with increasing plant diversity (Shannon index) in grazed forests and was positively associated with fox and leopard cat presence. The site use intensity of both frugivorous and insectivorous birds was positively associated with plant diversity in grazed forests, but negatively in ungrazed forest. Compared with insectivorous birds, frugivorous bird activities were significantly and positively associated with fox and leopard cat presence and an increase in leaf area index. Temporally, we found that diel activity significantly changed with increasing cattle grazing pressure for frugivorous birds. In contrast, insectivorous birds had similar daily activity patterns but shifted their activity peaks toward dawn in grazed forests. This work highlights that managing grazing practices and their effects on vegetation can positively affect temperate forest bird species richness and abundance.

AB  - There are ongoing debates among different stakeholders about which forest and ungulate management strategies will sustain high levels of timber and animal harvest and maintain important ecosystem functions under climate change. Ungulate-forest interactions are complex, including periods where forest regeneration is sensitive to browsing pressure, making it difficult to predict the consequences of a given strategy over time. To aid decision-making, we simulated the impacts of moose browsing on forest succession under 18 different combinations of moose (Alces alces) harvest rate levels and forest management scenarios in a boreal forest landscape in southern Sweden given projected changes in forest growth due to climate change. We found that the current management practices are important for sustaining a moose-forest system. Increasing moose harvest rates led to slightly smaller moose populations, larger estimates of landscape carrying capacity, and less biomass removal of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), a commercially valuable species. However, minor changes in the moose harvest were hardly affecting timber production. Increasing the timber harvest rotation time led to the highest estimates of Scots pine biomass, while thinning younger cohorts lead to the highest estimates of Norway spruce (Picea abies) biomass. These changes came without much effect to moose population dynamics. However, the increased broadleaf production scenario had a very large positive effect on total aboveground live biomass of deciduous species and on landscape carrying capacity and moose density. This scenario subsequently resulted in the greatest estimates of biomass removal of Scots pine, highlighting the tradeoffs associated with increased moose production.

AB  - As of the mid-1990 s, low impact seismic (LIS) line construction (<3 m wide) became common practice in western Canada and replaced construction of wider (5-10 m) conventional seismic lines, with the intention of mitigating the known negative environmental impacts (e.g., severe soil damage and minimal vegetation re-covery) of these long, narrow corridors used by the Oil and Gas (O&G) industry for exploration. Though the apparent disturbance severity on LIS lines is lower compared to conventional lines and it is expected that suc-cession would proceed more readily towards the conditions resembling pre-disturbance forested state in the upland boreal, there is little scientific evidence that supports this. Here, we assess environmental conditions, successional trajectories and potential edge effects extending into the adjacent forest from the LIS line edges three (2014) and eight (2019) years after their construction in 2011, in the southern upland boreal forest of Swan Hills region in northwestern Alberta, to determine if active restoration measures should be recommended. Soil moisture and light were higher on the lines compared to the adjacent forest. Bryophytes (particularly feath-ermosses associated with late-succession forests) recovered well within eight years of disturbance (attaining nearly 90 % cover in 2019, from a relatively low cover (-25 %) on the lines in 2014, compared to -80-90 % in the adjacent forest in both years), while the shrub and herbaceous layers recovered minimally, and tree species were still mostly absent on these lines. Herbaceous species also had a lower cover in the -2 m zone away from the line edges compared to the interior 75 m away, indicating edge effects in both years. Our results indicate that LIS lines appear to possess a unique combination of similarities and differences to other common boreal dis-turbances (fire, harvest), resulting in the equally unique successional trajectories that do not generally follow patterns known to occur in upland boreal forests. Long-term monitoring is imperative to determine whether LIS lines will eventually return to the pre-disturbance conditions or whether human intervention will be required to promote the growth of the canopy cover, especially as they constitute part of the habitat for Woodland caribou, an important threatened wildlife species.

AB  - Aim: There is increasing interest in open- ended restoration with the focus on restor -ing natural processes rather than static compositional goals. Here, we investigated vegetation dynamics in response to three decades of trophic rewilding with large herbivores in a recent anthropogenic, fertile 55- km2 landscape on reclaimed marine sediments. This site provides important insights into plant community assembly in re-wilded, young ecosystems.Location: Oostvaardersplassen, the Netherlands.Methods: Using field surveys and vegetation data spanning two decades, we investi -gate vegetation dynamics of the mesic grasslands in Oostvaardersplassen, a pioneer trophic rewilding site in the Netherlands. To identify the effects of grazing and other ecological processes, we include comparisons to an adjacent ungrazed control site and to the dark diversity, that is, missing species expected to be present given the environ-ment and geography.Results: The impact of large herbivores has led to a more open and homogenous vegeta-tion with higher plant species richness in the mesic grasslands of Oostvaardersplassen compared to the ungrazed control. Compared to species in the dark diversity, the spe -cies present are more common in the region, more stress- tolerant, and less competi-tive, in line with joint effects of grazing and immigrational lag.Conclusions: The changes in vegetation composition and structure show that rewild-ing with large herbivores promotes the prevalence of stress- tolerant and low- staturedplant species, which are in decline in the broader landscape while reducing the domi-nance of otherwise widespread, competition-adapted species. The absence of numer -ous rare species suggests that dispersal limitation poses an important constraint for the diversity build- up in anthropogenically isolated natural areas, necessitating active species introductions to mitigate this issue in the short to medium term

AB  - Natural disturbance shaped forest communities for millennia, but fire suppression and timber harvest declines have altered forest structure across the western United States, reducing the abundance of forage for ungulates. We evaluated quality and quantity of forage resources for lactating elk (Cervus canadensis) and their calves in relation to season, succession, and biogeoclimate, the latter indexed by potential vegetation (PV) zones, across 36,500 km2 in Idaho's Clearwater and St. Joe River basins. In 0.2-ha macroplots (n = 359), we measured characteristics of forest overstory, biomass of current annual growth of undergrowth vegetation (kg ha-1), and nutritional content of these plants. Using biomass, digestible energy (kJ g-1), digestible protein (DP, g per100 g forage), and prior knowledge of elk diet selection and nutritional constraints, we developed 8 forage resource metrics. The greatest abundance of undergrowth vegetation (500 to 1,000 kg ha-1) occurred during the first 20 years after stand-replacing disturbance and declined as the overstory closed in wetter PV zones. Digestible energy decreased, whereas DP increased as stands aged. Evidence of nutritional limitations for lactating elk increased markedly after mid-summer; early-seral, high-elevation spruce-fir forests on productive soils provided the best opportunity for lactating elk to satisfy their requirements in late summer. Our findings demonstrate the importance of disturbance regimes that maintain early-seral communities in mosaics with mid- and late-seral stages, and suggest that implementing stand-replacing disturbance in relatively moist forest zones at mid and high elevations provides the greatest improvement in forage resources for lactating elk and their calves in summer.

AB  - Forest fragmentation is one of the main factors leading to biodiversity loss and negatively affecting arthropod communities. We analyzed the effects of forest fragment size and habitat type (forest edge x interior) on the canopy arthropod diversity of Quercus deserticola in the Cuitzeo Basin in Mexico. Six forest fragments where Q. deserticola occurs were selected and classified as (i) small (<= 10 ha); (ii) medium (>= 25 ha); and (iii) large (>= 65 ha). In each forest fragment, ten trees were randomly selected: five at the edge and five in the interior of the fragment to sampled canopy arthropods using fogging techniques. We collected 12,739 arthropods representing 716 morphospecies grouped into 155 families and 16 orders. Differences in canopy arthropod community and species diversity were detected between fragment sizes. Canopy arthropod diversity was greater in Q. deserticola individuals from small fragments and the edges of fragments than in larger fragments and in the interior of fragments. Small fragments had highest phytophages diversity and lowest parasitoids and predator's diversity. The opposite pattern was observed in large fragments. Our results confirm that fragment size and edge effects modify canopy arthropod diversity of Q. deserticola, disrupting interactions between guilds and trophic levels probably by bottom-up and top-down forces. We highlight the importance to conserving large fragments to maintain the unique arthropod community that is sensitive to the disruption of ecological interactions and functions in Mexican temperate ecosystems, which constitute the main center of diversification and endemism of oaks in the northern hemisphere.

AB  - Biodiversity drives ecosystem functioning across grassland ecosystems. However, few studies have examined how grazing intensity affects ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) via its effects on plant diversity and soil microbial diversity in dry grasslands. We conducted a 12-year experiment manipulating sheep grazing intensity in a desert steppe of northern China. Through measuring plant species diversity, soil microbial diversity (bacteria diversity) and multiple ecosystem functions (i.e., aboveground net primary productivity, belowground biomass of plant community, temporal stability of ANPP, soil organic matter, moisture, available nitrogen and phosphorus, ecosystem respiration and gross ecosystem productivity), we aimed to understand how grazing intensity affected EMF via changing the diversity of plants and microbes. Our results showed that increasing grazing intensity significantly reduced EMF and most individual ecosystem functions, as well as the diversity of plants and microbes, while EMF and most individual functions were positively related to plant diversity and soil microbial diversity under all grazing intensities. In particular, soil microbial diversity in shallow soil layers (0-5 cm depth) had stronger positive correlations with plant diversity and EMF than in deeper soil layers. Furthermore, structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that grazing reduced EMF mainly via reducing plant diversity, rather than by reducing soil microbial diversity. Thus, plant diversity played a more important role in mediating the response of EMF to grazing disturbance. This study highlights the critical role of aboveand belowground diversity in mediating the response of EMF to grazing intensity, which has important implications for biodiversity conservation and sustainability in arid grasslands.

AB  - The functional ecology of macrobenthic communities, particularly their trophic structure, is crucial for understanding ecosystem response to disturbances. The present study provides the first characterization of the smallscale spatial distribution patterns of polychaete feeding guilds in the midlittoral and shallow infralittoral of a tropical coral reef. The aim of this study was to analyze the small-scale vertical distribution of polychaete feeding guilds at the interface between the midlittoral and shallow infralittoral of a reef environment, using artificial substrate units (ASUs). Our results indicated that the most dominant polychaete group was SR-He-mic (herbivore feeding on surface benthic microbiota), followed by SR-De (feeding on surface deposits). The distribution of guilds was influenced by tidal height, with trophic group richness increasing from the midlittoral to the infra- littoral. However, the distribution of organisms in the trophic groups was more equitable in the midlittoral zone, without the strong dominance of a single group. In contrast, tidal heights-0.3 m and-0.4 m were dominated by SR-De (feeding on surface deposits), showing slightly lower diversities although with high variation in values. Thus, trophic structure is expected to change significantly in the event of "drowning" (total or partial) of the reef ecosystem, with rising sea levels increasing the dependence of the ecosystem on deposited organic matter. This study highlights that the vertical zonation of the trophic structure of polychaetes plays a critical role in determining the vulnerability of the coral reef ecosystem to climate change, emphasizing the necessity and importance of mitigation actions to prevent significant changes in this ecosystem.

AB  - Ecosystem functioning depends on biodiversity at multiple trophic levels, yet relationships between multitrophic diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality have been poorly explored, with studies often focusing on individual trophic levels and functions and on specific ecosystem types. Here, we show that plant diversity can affect ecosystem functioning both directly and by affecting other trophic levels. Using data on 13 trophic groups and 13 ecosystem functions from two large biodiversity experiments-one representing temperate grasslands and the other subtropical forests-we found that plant diversity increases multifunctionality through elevated multitrophic diversity. Across both experiments, the association between multitrophic diversity and multifunctionality was stronger than the relationship between the diversity of individual trophic groups and multifunctionality. Our results also suggest that the role of multitrophic diversity is greater in forests than in grasslands. These findings imply that, to promote sustained ecosystem multifunctionality, conservation planning must consider the diversity of both plants and higher trophic levels.
   Research on biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships tends to focus on single trophic groups. This analysis of two biodiversity experiments, representing forests and grasslands, shows that plant diversity promotes ecosystem multifunctionality not only directly, but also by enhancing the diversity of other trophic levels.

AB  - Domestic livestock grazing is the dominant land use on much of the current range inhabited by greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) in the western United States. Nonnative feral horses (Equus ferus caballus) also inhabit important sage-grouse seasonal habitats. Overabundant feral horse populations and improper grazing by domestic cattle (Bos taurus) can impact the health of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) and desert shrub rangeland communities and native wildlife. These impacts to sage-grouse can be exacerbated when they affect late brood-rearing habitat, which provide the forbs and arthropods required to fledge broods. Managers require better information regarding the extent of these impacts. In 2020, we assessed the potential impact of feral horses and domestic cattle on sage-grouse late brood-rearing habitats in western Utah and eastern Nevada, USA. We acquired late brood-rearing location data from sage-grouse marked with global positioning system and very-high frequency radio-transmitters from 2016 to 2020 for North Utah data, 2017 to 2018 for South Utah data, and 1961 to 2017 for both east and west Nevada data to delineate late brood-rearing habitats. Using these location data, we compared 8 sites (4 pairs) within horse and non-horse use areas to assess sage-grouse habitat quality characteristics between areas that have been predominantly horse and cattle grazed versus sites that have been predominantly cattle grazed. For each pairing, 1 site was located within and the other outside of a Bureau of Land Management herd management area boundary, and both sites shared similar habitat characteristics (i.e., topography, dominant vegetation, soils, and climate) and selection probability for broods. We collected vegetation and dung count data at each site to assess characteristics related to habitat quality for sage-grouse brood-rearing, based on ungulate presence. We used a mixed model analysis of variance to detect differences between each paired site comparison (a < 0.01). Horses or evidence of horse presence (i.e., dung) were not detected at our non-horse sites allowing for an unbiased comparison between paired sites. Cattle presence was noted at all our paired sites. Average annual grass frequency was 0.74 in horse and 0.17 in non-horse use areas (P = 0.20), and average annual grass cover was 4.0% compared to 0.2% in horse use areas (P = 0.32). Average annual grass biomass was 0.45 kg/ ha in horse and 0.04% in non-horse use areas (P = 0.34). Vegetation height was 44.2 cm in non -horse compared to 34.5 cm in horse use areas (P = 0.23). These results suggest that increased ungulate grazing and year-long use of late brood-rearing habitat by feral horses coupled with livestock grazing may impair habitat suitability, particularly considering ecological impacts from invasive plant species. Our results suggest that managing late brood-rearing habitats to reduce the frequency and intensity of year-long grazing by feral horses can be best accomplished by reducing horse numbers and the seasonal distribution of grazing by domestic livestock.

AB  - This study examines the impact of ungulate browsing on the understory dynamics of the Cansiglio Forest, the only European beech high forest in the Southern Limestone Alps. Utilizing seven pairs of fenced versus unfenced forest stands established over two decades, we assessed how fencing affects understory structure and tree regeneration. Significant differences were found in cover, height and vascular species composition in both tree regeneration and shrub layers. Fenced areas showed a significantly higher number and greater average height of young trees, supporting the hypothesis that ungulate browsing negatively impacts tree regeneration. Despite previous studies attributing the lack of silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) regeneration primarily to red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758) browsing, our findings did not show a significant association of this species with fenced conditions. While Rubus abundance was higher inside fenced areas, overall vascular species richness did not differ. Our results highlight the evident effects of ungulate browsing and suggest the need to consider other factors influencing forest regeneration and understory development. Future research should establish additional study replicates, balanced across diverse site and stand structure conditions, to further explore these dynamics.

AB  - In 2021, a large transect with 281 10 x 10 m grid cells was re-surveyed in a limestone European beech forest (Hordelymo-Fagetum lathyretosum) on the plateau of the Gottingen Forest after surveys in 1981, 1991, 2001, and 2011. The stand, which has not been managed by forestry since the beginning of the permanent plot study, initially showed an increasing cover of the tree layer and, as a consequence of game-proof fencing until 2005, also an increasing cover of the shrub layer. Since 2011, the tree layer cover has decreased due to small openings after drought years and winter storms. Also, the shrub layer cover declined significantly since 2011, mainly due to ash dieback and the growing impact of deer browsing. In both vegetation layers, Fagus sylvatica was able to expand its dominant role. In the herbaceous layer, the sharp decline and loss of numerous species is striking, among them typical forest species that have been classified as characteristic for species-rich European beech forests on limestone (e. g., Lathyrus vernus, Mercurialis perennis). The large number of losers (27 species) is matched by only a small number of winners (5 species) between 1981 and 2021. Especially Allium ursinum and Hedera helix, but also the two Orchidaceae Epipactis helleborine and Neottia nidus-avis have increased significantly since 1981. The increase of the highly competitive Allium ursinum, probably due to an earlier start and a longer lasting vegetation period, is accompanied by an increasing share of beech in the tree layer. At the same time, the species diversity decreased, and the herb layer composition became more homogeneous across the transect. Hedera helix seems to have benefited mainly from climate change (lack of severe winter frosts, CO2 increase), but also from the temporary exclusion of roe deer browsing. Based on the analysis of mean indicator values shade-tolerant, oceanic-distributed species, as well as nitrogen and moisture indicators have increased, while more light demanding species continuously decreased between survey years. Compared to intensively managed stands with massive thinning and/or soil disturbances, as in coppice-with-standards or large shelterwood systems, these species suffered from a closed canopy after management abandonment. The small-scale disturbances caused by drought and windthrow in the period 2012-2021 are obviously not sufficient to provide favourable conditions for these species, including a large number of species that have been classified as typical for European beech forests on limestone and that have been present in the beginning of the long-term study. Thus, the presented time series indicates that eutrophic beech forests without forest management are species poorer than previously reported.

AB  - Understanding competitive interactions is essential to properly inform management strategies, in particular in the context of livestock-wildlife conflict across a degraded land, such as the case of wild guanacos in Patagonia. Guanacos are historically perceived by ranchers as livestock's main competitors, and there is a growing demand for reducing their numbers. However, both competition theory and available evidence suggest a more complex interaction than the one assumed by the current management approach. This study aimed to test the occurrence of competitive exclusion of guanacos by domestic sheep at intra-ranch scale. We assessed the spatial segregation of guanacos and sheep and compared guanaco occupancy patterns within a sheep ranch with those recorded within an adjacent protected area free from livestock. The probability of a group of herbivores being sheep instead of guanacos increased in bottom valleys and smaller paddocks and decreased as the distance to water increased. These results agree with the expected patterns of sheep habitat use resulting from physiological restrictions and grazing behaviour. Occupancy patterns within the ranch showed a higher proportion of guanacos in ridges, away from water sources and in larger paddocks, opposing those observed in the sheep-free area where guanacos occupied mostly bottom valleys, irrespective of the distance to water. Areas used consistently by guanacos showed a higher per cent cover of preferred forage and basal-plant cover, indicating a better range condition than those used predominately by sheep. Our results add to the solid body of evidence on spatial segregation of these species at coarser spatial scales, support the competitive exclusion of guanacos by sheep and suggest that intra-ranch coexistence is possible because guanacos occupy areas underused or inaccessible to sheep. Under these conditions, it is unlikely that guanaco culling will improve sheep production and the empirical verification of the assumptions underlying current management initiatives becomes crucial.

AB  - Human land use often alters community composition that affects many related ecosystem functions. However, intermediate-intensity land use, such as agroforestry, can be a refuge for biodiversity and can maintain ecosystem functions and services in working landscapes. We quantified how the alpha and beta diversity of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) vary with human land use in the Kodagu region of the Western Ghats, India, across four land use types (forests, forest fragments, and two types of coffee plantations with either native or non-native shade trees). We studied ants, as they perform a wide range of ecological functions such as predation, herbivory, seed dispersal, and decomposition, etc., in such landscapes. We also assessed the functional diversity of ants and estimated the interactions between their traits and the environment. We found that the plantations, on average, had 26% lower species richness than forests and forest fragments, and functional richness was 31% lower in non-native plantations. However, plantations showed higher beta diversity than forests at both taxonomic and functional levels. Interestingly, turnover was higher in non-native than native plantations by 32% and 24% at taxonomic and functional levels, respectively. Plantations also had weak and few ants' trait-and-environment interactions, suggesting that environmental filters may not be influential in structuring ant communities under human land use, compared to forests. Overall, while ant communities under human land use differ from those in forests, they can be heterogeneous and able to perform similar functions. Our findings highlight the importance of agroforestry as working landscapes which can maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functions.

AB  - Many wildlife species face the risks of habitat loss, habitat fragmentation or local extinction in response to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Moose (Alces alces) in Northeast China is on the southernmost edge of the geographical range of Eurasian moose, the distribution of this population is retreating, and population number has been declining for the last several decades. However, little is known about its habitat suitability over a large spatial scale, which hinders further effective conservation of the moose in China. It is critical to explore the moose -habitat relationships and habitat suitability to understand moose habitat requirements, poten-tial land use impacts, and effective management. In this paper, we combined remote sensing -derived predictors and machine learning methods (down-sampling random forests) to explore the moose-habitat associations and map moose habitat suitability. Results showed that our model performed well to excellently in terms of three evaluation metrics (AUCROC, AUCPR, CBI), which indicates the advantages of the combination of remote sensing and machine learning methods in predicting moose habitat. We identified the main factors driving moose distribution in Northeast China are the human footprint index, the mean monthly maximum temperature of the late spring, the percentage of coniferous forest, the minimum dynamic habitat index, the minimum tem-perature of the coldest month, and the distance from town. Moose responds to these variables nonlinearly. Generally, variables related to human disturbance and heat stress are the main drivers of moose occurrence and are negatively associated with moose occurrence probability. High suitability areas are mainly distributed in eastern and northern Greater Khingan Mountains. Highly suitable habitat covers only a small proportion of the study area. We identified 67,400 km2 of suitable habitat covering 13.6% of the study area. Our study can provide critical information for decision-makers when designing conservation and management strategies for the moose in China and other regions of the world with similar conditions.

AB  - Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are challenged energetically in arid southwestern North American habitats; hence, identifying habitats that provide for their requirements is important to guide habitat management. We used resource-area-dependence analysis, which relates home range size to composition of home ranges, to determine habitats most associated with decreasing home range sizes (i.e., increasing quality) for pronghorn in south-central New Mexico, USA. Grama grasslands were most associated with home range quality for pronghorn, likely because grama grassland provided more forbs than other habitats, and forbs were the only forage class positively associated with pronghorn diet quality. Grama grassland also provided a diversity of browse, and the low structure facilitates visual detection of threats. Pinyon-juniper woodlands were marginally associated with home range quality of females, again because of relatively high diversity of forbs and browse. Pronghorn could benefit from management that increases diversity and abundance of forbs, such as burning during late-winter or early-spring to favor forbs over grasses and rejuvenate browse; this can also maintain an open canopy in woodlands. While precipitation will always be important for productivity and survival of pronghorn in arid southwestern environments, management that facilitates forbs could allow better forage responses to timely precipitation.

AB  - The strength of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships varies within and across studies, depending on the investigated ecosystem function and diversity facet (e.g., species richness or functional composition), limiting our ability to translate BEF results into recommendations for management and conservation. The variability in BEF relationships is particularly high when considering complex multitrophic communities and can be explained by food web contexts. Here we examine how different plant diversity facets affect biomass stocks and energy flows of each trophic group depending on their position in the trophic network. We used coupled aboveground-belowground multitrophic networks of energy dynamics, assembled across the experimental gradients of grassland plant species richness, functional diversity, and presence of plant functional groups. We compared the strengths of these diversity effects between trophic groups, trophic levels, aboveground versus belowground subnetworks, and types of ecosystem functions. Plant species richness, functional trait diversity, and the presence of legumes and grasses were influential drivers of ecosystem energetics. The effects of plant species richness across the food web often operated through mechanisms of plant functional-trait diversity. The effects of plant species richness attenuated across trophic levels. Legume presence strengthened the top-down control (predation) of primary consumers. We found an overall mismatch in the strength of diversity effects on flows versus stocks. Some trophic groups showed even contrasting direction in responses of their stocks and flows to plant diversity. This indicates that plant diversity constrains consumer functioning by means other than only altered consumer biomass. Responses of flows and stocks to plant diversity differed between trophic groups, and aboveground versus belowground parts. Individual stocks and energy flows were responsive to different biodiversity facets, highlighting the importance of the explicit consideration of individual functions and diversity facets for a comprehensive multitrophic understanding. For example, legume presence increased aboveground processes but reduced plant carbon uptake and belowground plant production. Plant communities containing legumes lost more biomass to herbivores, had faster decomposition, and channeled less energy to soil detritus. An important implication of these results is that targeted grassland management would profit from focusing on specific plant diversity facets depending on the ecosystem function or service of interest.

AB  - An accurate assessment of shrub-herb interactions is challenging because shrubs can facilitate herb growth as nurse plants and negatively affect herbs as competitors. As responses to the effects of neighbors are often trait dependent, the impact of shrubs on grassland communities may differ with a variation in herb functional traits. In 2020, we surveyed the structure and functional pattern of 160 Qinghai-Tibet alpine grassland communities under the canopy of four dominant shrub species and their surrounding open areas. We found an overall negative effect of shrubs on grassland productivity, species diversity, and individual abundance, suggesting that interspecific resource competition, rather than facilitation, dominated the effect of shrubs on herb growth. The negative effect was weakest for small deciduous shrub species, implying that seasonal defoliation and low shading conditions could reduce the light competition of shrubs on herbs. Shrubs generally increased grassland functional diversity of vegetative traits, especially leaf economic traits, but decreased that of reproductive traits, especially seed traits, demonstrating that shrubs affected grassland community assembly by offering benign microhabitats to protect herbaceous species with stress-intolerant or fast-acquisition vegetative traits and setting physical barriers to prevent the entry of species with specific reproductive traits. Moreover, as canopy transmittance increased, positive shrub effects on leaf size diversity became more pronounced. However, an increase in canopy size intensified the negative effects of shrubs on the diversity of plant height and some reproductive traits. Results illustrated that the structuring of alpine grassland communities by shrubs depends on their type (semi-evergreen or deciduous) and size.

AB  - Large carnivores strongly shape ecological interactions within their respective ecosystems, but experience significant conflicts with humans across their range due to their specific ecological resource requirements. The Tiger (Panthera tigris) typifies the challenges faced by large carnivore species globally. India retains the majority of the global Tiger population with a substantial number occurring outside protected areas where they are prone to conflict through livestock predation and injury or death to people and Tigers. Tiger food habits was investigated across the Indian part of the Terai-Arc Landscape (TAL), a globally important Tiger conservation landscape, to understand Tiger prey selection patterns and hotspots of livestock predation-related conflict. 510 genetically confirmed Tiger feces were collected across the landscape and 10 wild ungulates and livestock as prey species were identified. Large-bodied species (Sambar, Swamp Deer, Nilgai, Chital, Wild Pig, and livestock) comprised similar to 94% of the diet, with Sambar, Chital, and livestock having the highest relative proportions. Habitat-specific (Shivalik-Bhabar and Terai) analyses indicate that prey selection is driven by prey abundance and body weight but not determined by protection status (protected areas vs non-protected areas). Results also suggest that PAs and non-PAs in the Terai region were more prone to livestock predation-related conflict. Careful management interventions with community involvement should be utilized to reduce such threats. In this study, we suggest long-term conservation plans including prey abundance estimation outside PAs, reduction of grazing pressures, and detailed records of Tiger mortalities with causal investigations to ensure future conflict-free Tiger persistence across TAL.

AB  - 1. The implementation of agri-environmental schemes (AES) is a major tool to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services in European agricultural landscapes. The benefit of different types and features of novel biodiversity measures needs to be assessed in order to successfully conserve insect communities in agroecosystems.2. We set up trap nests in 3 x 3 km landscapes in Germany, in which farmers implemented different novel biodiversity measures. We tested the effect of different features of the closest three biodiversity measures (i.e. distance to measures, measures' area, measures' quality) and of the proximity to forest and oilseed rape and of landscape connectivity on the abundance and species richness of cavity nesting bees, wasps and their natural enemies.3. We found total cavity-nesting insect abundances to increase with measures' quality and to decline with increasing distance to oilseed rape and forest. Parasitism and mortality rates declined with edge density.4. Cavity-nesting bees were not affected by biodiversity measures. Total wasp and herbivore-predating wasp abundances increased in proximity to biodiversity measures. The abundance and species richness of all wasps, natural enemies and spider predating wasps declined with increasing distance to forest.5. Cavity-nesting wasps benefit from biodiversity measures, while effects on solitary bees might only be detectable after several years after measure establishment. The proximity to forest is a major factor promoting insects as forest edges provide food, nesting sites and shelter. We emphasise the need for long-term insect monitoring and an increasing focus of future AES on the creation of nesting habitats for effective insect conservation.

AB  - Herbivorous insects acquire microorganisms from host plants or soil, but it remains unclear how the diversity and functional composition of host plants contribute to structuring herbivore microbiomes. Within a controlled tree diversity setting, we used DNA metabarcoding of 16S rRNA to assess the contribution of Lepidoptera species and their local environment (particularly, tree diversity, host tree species, and leaf traits) to the composition of associated bacterial communities. In total, we obtained 7,909 bacterial OTUs from 634 caterpillar individuals comprising 146 species. Tree diversity was found to drive the diversity of caterpillar-associated bacteria both directly and indirectly via effects on caterpillar communities, and tree diversity was a stronger predictor of bacterial diversity than diversity of caterpillars. Leaf toughness and dry matter content were important traits of the host plant determining bacterial species composition, while leaf calcium and potassium concentration influenced bacterial richness. Our study reveals previously unknown linkages between trees and their characteristics, herbivore insects, and their associated microbes, which contributes to developing a more nuanced understanding of functional dependencies between herbivores and their environment, and has implications for the consequences of plant diversity loss for trophic interactions.

AB  - Habitat destruction have been increasingly driven by climate change and land-use modifications in recent years. In assessing the future impact of environmental changes, most attention has been paid to climatic parameters, and the simultaneous impact of climate change and land use change has received less attention. This research examines habitat changes for four mammals-Bezoar ibex, Urial sheep, Afghan pika, and Tolai hare-under both current and projected climate and land-use scenarios for 2050. Using the BIOMOD framework, we implemented an ensemble of five species distribution models (SDMs) to delineate suitable habitats for both time periods. We quantified key landscape metrics, reflecting alterations in patch size and configuration. Additionally, we tracked shifts in habitat patches' center of gravity, analyzing their movement across elevational and latitudinal gradients. We found a significant habitat contraction for Bezoar ibex, Urial sheep, and Afghan pika. These species are projected to shift their distributions upward in elevation to compensate for habitat loss. In contrast, Tolai hare is expected to experience a relatively smaller reduction in habitat, with a notable range shift towards higher latitudes. Suitable habitats for Bezoar ibex, Urial sheep, and Afghan pika are likely to become increasingly fragmented and isolated under future environmental conditions, while habitat connectivity of Tolai hare may improve. This study identifies landscape ecology-based indicators as essential tools for quantifying biodiversity vulnerability to climate and land use change. The findings emphasize the need to enhance habitat connectivity, particularly in relation to protected areas, to support species movement and reduce fragmentation.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances, such as mining, significantly modify landscapes and can have negative effects on ecosystems and the wildlife therein. Here, we investigate the ecological impacts of mining camps (semi-urban accommodation areas in mining landscapes) on wildlife communities, including for species composition and diversity, ecosystem function, predator-prey networks, and temporal activity. Using a distributed control-impact design, we deployed camera traps at mining camps and ecologically similar reference landscapes across Western Australia's Pilbara region. We found a marked difference in species composition at mining camps, suggesting the formation of novel assemblages. Lower functional dispersion at mining camps suggests that the ecological functions being performed by species here are less varied, although ecosystems at mining camps have high functional redundancy, likely buffering the effects of future disturbance. Predator-prey networks at mining camps had similar overall structure to reference landscapes despite major differences in species composition. However, lower network connectance at mining camps suggests that food webs are more vulnerable to future disturbance or species loss. Behavioural animal responses included altered temporal activity by some animal groups, shifting predator and competition pressures at mining camps. Certain animal groups (e.g., dingoes, feral herbivores) were more resilient to disturbance, while localised effects at mining camps highlight the differing influences of disturbance at different scales. These results demonstrate the complex impacts of human disturbance on animal communities and ecosystems, and the need to consider community-wide approaches when undertaking management in modified landscapes.

AB  - The impact of deadwood in ecosystems is dependent on its longevity, as determined by decay rates controlled by decay agents. Despite the importance of macroclimate, significant variation of decay rates within a given macroclimatic envelope has been reported. Such variation may be driven by local-scale microenvironmental conditions as regulated by the plant community structure as well as the presence of specific biotic and abiotic decay agents, decoupling the relation between macroclimate conditions and deadwood decay rates. In this study, we evaluated the relation between local-scale variation in plant community structure with the decay rates of deadwood and the relative importance of biotic and abiotic decay agents in deadwood decay in Neotropical Cerrado. For this, we performed a wood mass loss experiment using Pinus taeda wood which was installed at three sites in three vegetation types differing in canopy cover-grasslands, savannas and woodlands; wood was divided into treatments according to deadwood exposure to decay agents-microorganism, termite and solar radiation. Across sites, we found termites and microbes decomposed wood twice as fast as microbes alone, while solar radiation was not a strong driver of deadwood decay in our sites. Additionally, local-scale variation in plant community structure affected deadwood decay, as decay rates and frequency of wood blocks discovered by termites were lower in woodlands than in grasslands and savannas. Our study highlights the interactive effects of local-scale variation in plant community structure and termites on deadwood turnover, mainly due to differences in termite foraging behaviour among vegetation types and highlights the key role of termites in deadwood decay throughout Neotropical savannas.

AB  - Catch per unit effort (CPUE) is used as an index of fish abundance under the premise that changes in CPUE result from changes in true density. However, catchability may also vary based on environmental conditions that affect observed CPUE. We developed a hierarchical model for estimating common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) relative abundance with electrofishing survey data from six shallow lakes in northwest Iowa, USA, between 2018 and 2020. Common carp catchability was negatively associated with lake perimeter but unrelated to lake surface area, water depth, Secchi depth, temperature, and month of sampling. Bigmouth buffalo catchability was negatively associated with Secchi depth and water temperature and unrelated to other environmental variables. Hierarchical model posterior distributions of bigmouth buffalo density were less precise than Schnabel estimates, whereas common carp posterior distribution abundance estimates were more precise than Schnabel estimates. Our results indicate that hierarchical models can be a viable substitute for labor-intensive capture-mark-recapture methods to estimate unknown latent variables like relative abundance, and could be applied to other species, sampling gears, and management frameworks.

AB  - Background Monitoring the behavior of wild animals in situ can improve our understanding of how their behavior is related to their habitat and affected by disturbances and changes in their environment. Moose (Alces alces) are keystone species in their boreal habitats, where they are facing environmental changes and disturbances from human activities. How these potential stressors can impact individuals and populations is unclear, in part due to our limited knowledge of the physiology and behavior of moose and how individuals can compensate for stress and disturbances they experience. We collected data from collar-mounted fine-scale tri-axial accelerometers deployed on captive moose in combination with detailed behavioral observations to train a random forest supervised classification algorithm to classify moose accelerometer data into discrete behaviors. To investigate the generalizability of our model to collared new individuals, we quantified the variation in classification performance among individuals.
   Results Our machine learning model successfully classified 3-s accelerometer data intervals from 12 Alaskan moose (A. a. gigas) and two European moose (A. a. alces) into seven behaviors comprising 97.6% of the 395 h of behavioral observations conducted in summer, fall and spring. Classification performance varied among behaviors and individuals and was generally dependent on sample size. Classification performance was highest for the most common behaviors lying with the head elevated, ruminating and foraging (precision and recall across all individuals between 0.74 and 0.90) comprising 79% of our data, and lower and more variable among individuals for the four less common behaviors lying with head down or tucked, standing, walking and running (precision and recall across all individuals between 0.28 and 0.79) comprising 21% of our data.
   Conclusions We demonstrate the use of animal-borne accelerometer data to distinguish among seven main behaviors of captive moose and discuss generalizability of the results to individuals in the wild. Our results can support future efforts to investigate the detailed behavior of collared wild moose, for example in the context of disturbance responses, time budgets and behavior-specific habitat selection.

AB  - Ungulate (deer) browsing threatens forest diversity and tree regeneration, but without efficient and reliable methods, we cannot monitor these impacts. Traditional methods mostly measure the size, density or growth rates of seedlings/saplings, all of which respond sensitively to local conditions, inflating variation and potential bias. The twig age method uses bud scale scars to estimate the time interval between bouts of browsing. The original method measured browse only on maples (Acer) at a single site. Here, I here extend the method using twig age data from 12 tree species distributed across 60 sites in the Upper Midwest, USA to assess its efficiency and compare how deer browse impacts vary across an exclosure fence, among species, across sites, and over time. Because deer prefer to browse on certain species, I develop and compare two methods to adjust for deer preferences to ensure accurate comparisons among sites that differ in species compositions. The twig age method is highly efficient, requiring less than an hour and minimal equipment to obtain an informative sample (90+ saplings). Exclosures confirm that twig ages respond sensitively and rapidly to deer browsing with more power than methods based on seedling/sapling size. Twig ages also covary with height under deer browsing, adding another indicator. To adjust for differential browsing among species, one can use either ratios of twig ages to an internal standard (e.g. Acer saccharum) or 2-way models to adjust for species effects when comparing sites. These approaches yield identical results. These adjusted twig age data provide a reliable and accurate way to measure differences in deer browse impacts over species, sites and time. Twig ages provide a powerful tool to sensitively track variation in local deer impacts over time and across sites and habitats. Its efficiency means forest and wildlife managers can rapidly expand deer impact monitoring programs at low cost. Applying this method broadly over successive years should soon identify adjusted twig age thresholds for predicting successful sapling recruitment and tree regeneration.
