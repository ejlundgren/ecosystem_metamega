AB  - Social relationships are important to many aspects of animals' lives, and an individual's connections may change over the course of their lifespan. Currently, it is unclear whether social connectedness declines within individuals as they age, and what the underlying mechanisms might be, so the role of age in structuring animal social systems remains unresolved, particularly in non-primates. Here we describe senescent declines in social connectedness using 46 years of data in a wild, individually monitored population of a long-lived mammal (European red deer, Cervus elaphus). Applying a series of spatial and social network analyses, we demonstrate that these declines occur because of within-individual changes in social behaviour, with correlated changes in spatial behaviour (smaller home ranges and movements to lower-density, lower-quality areas). These findings demonstrate that within-individual socio-spatial behavioural changes can lead older animals in fission-fusion societies to become less socially connected, shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes structuring wild animal populations.
   Using 46 years of individually monitored data for European red deer, the authors show that older individuals become less socially connected, with correlated changes to their spatial behaviour.

AB  - An increasing share of urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused by extraintestinal pathogenicEscherichia coli(ExPEC)lineages that have also been identified in poultry and hogs with high genetic similarity to human clinical isolates. Weinvestigated industrial food animal production as a source of uropathogen transmission by examining relationships ofhog and poultry density with emergency department (ED) visits for UTIs in North Carolina (NC). ED visits for UTI in2016-2019 were identified by ICD-10 code from NC's ZIP code-level syndromic surveillance system and livestockcounts were obtained from permit data and aerial imagery. We calculated separate hog and poultry spatial densities(animals/km2) by Census block with a 5 km buffer on the block perimeter and weighted by block population to esti-mate mean ZIP code densities. Associations between livestock density and UTI incidence were estimated using areparameterized Besag-York-Mollie (BYM2) model with ZIP code population offsets to account for spatial autocorrela-tion. We excluded metropolitan and offshore ZIP codes and assessed effect measure modification by calendar year, ZIPcode rurality, and patient sex, age, race/ethnicity, and health insurance status. In single-animal models, hog exposurewas associated with increased UTI incidence (rate ratio [RR]: 1.21, 95 % CI: 1.07-1.37 in the highest hog-densitytertile), but poultry exposure was associated with reduced UTI rates (RR: 0.86, 95 % CI: 0.81-0.91). However, the ref-erence group for single-animal poultry models included ZIP codes with only hogs, which had some of the highest UTIrates; when compared with ZIP codes without any hogs or poultry, there was no association between poultry exposureand UTI incidence. Hog exposure was associated with increased UTI incidence in areas that also had medium to highpoultry density, but not in areas with low poultry density, suggesting that intense hog production may contribute toincreased UTI incidence in neighboring communities.

AB  - Pollen data has been obtained from archaeological horizons in cave and rock shelter deposits, on the high plateaux (the Yaila) and the slopes of the Crimean Mountains. This data, supported by geochronometry and lithology, indicate multiple environmental oscillations during the Late Glacial and Holocene. These had a significant impact on changes in the Final Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic. Pollen assemblages from Late Glacial deposits indicate the existence during the last glacial of refugia of a broad-leaved flora on the lower mountain slopes. During the Late Glacial interstadials, the tribes of the Shan-Koba culture hunted forest game indicative of a temperate climate. From the Younger Dryas into the Greenlandian (11,500-10,300 cal BP) the Swiderian hunters were visitors to the treeless Crimean yailas from the northern Ukraine. During the Greenlandian, two warm and humid phases, when the forests extended, alternated with cool and arid phases when the woodland shrank and xeric herbs became important in the yailas. The Shpan culture that existed later during the Greenlandian (between c. 10,600 and 9100 cal BP) was influenced by migrations of steppe hunters from the Crimean plain area, and they hunted game that included more animals of open ecotopes. During the end of Greenlandian and the beginning of Northgrippian (9000-7500 cal BP), broad-leaved woodlands appeared at the yaila edges, with such warmth-loving species as Rhus coronaria, Cornus mas and Hedera taurica, and mesophytic steppe occupied the yailas. The tribes of the Late Mesolithic Murzak-Koba culture and the Neolithic Tash-Air culture were hunters of the game living in the broad-leaved forests, particularly wild pig. Nevertheless, the Tash-Air tribes continue to exist during a cool and arid phase after 7500 cal BP. The second half of the Meghalayan (since 2600 BP) had a humid climate: they were times showing a larger extension than before of pine and juniper onto the yaila, though an arid phase occurred at 2900-2600 cal BP. After 1000 BP, broad-leaved trees almost completely disappeared near the yaila and ferns spread enormously (due to the impact of cold winters in the Little Ice Age or to forest clearance). The role of arboreal vegetation and broad-leaves trees, as well as xeric herbs, changed cyclically during different phases of the Late Glacial and Holocene on the yailas, but mesophytic steppe always remained the dominating vegetation type there.

AB  - Road edge effects consist of changes in abiotic and biotic conditions resulting from the new artificial boundaries on the vegetation that are created by a road. It is known that edge effects can have variable direct and indirect influences on the biota, can be species-specific and also site-specific. However, edge effects for most plant species and most of their respective reproductive components have not been assessed yet, especially for anemochoric plants, which can directly influence the ecosystem structure. Here we evaluated directly and indirectly road edge effects on plant reproductive components (floral visiting bees, fruiting, diaspore herbivory, and diaspore dispersal) of three abundant and sympatric Malpighiaceae anemochoric species in a Brazilian savanna (Cerrado) reserve. We showed that (i) there are direct and indirect road edge effects on the reproductive components of the three anemochoric species; (ii) the road edge effects were not species-specific for all reproductive components, except for floral visiting bees; and (iii) edge influences in plants reproductive components in the cerrado sensu stricto area are restricted to 30 m from the road, except for fruit production. Our results suggest that anthropogenic changes in the landscape should be assessed in detail, as changes that are often considered to be negligible and that are believed to not cause negative damage to the structure of ecosystem, may have impacts on it. A mitigating measure is to avoid fragmentation of forest areas, such as the construction of dirt roads that cross preserved areas.

AB  - Adult green turtles are known to display either preference in their foraging habits or fidelity to their foraging sites which, in turn, influences their migrations and the availability of forage. With an abundant supply of seagrass and algae, the lagoons of the Lakshadweep Archipelago off the Indian west coast serve as significant feeding grounds for green turtles. In the last 2 decades, the numbers of foraging green turtles have varied across islands, leading to speculation about their foraging patterns and movements. We collated secondary data and conducted periodic surveys between 2013 and 2019 to record trends in green turtle abundance and seagrass characteristics and investigate relationships between them. Over the last decade, green turtle abundances have fluctuated widely with increases followed by sharp declines within different lagoons. Our results also show that a reduction in seagrass density, particularly Thalassia sp. and Cymodocea sp., coincided with the decline in green turtle abundance. Moreover, turtle presence was observed at sites with higher seagrass density and canopy height. Our findings indicate that green turtles appeared to forage in particular lagoons until their preferred resources declined, before moving to other islands within the Archipelago or other unknown locations. Therefore, to devise effective management strategies, it is crucial to understand how this green turtle population will adapt to the decline in foraging resources. The declining seagrass populations also suggest the need for an ecosystem approach towards green turtle conservation.

AB  - As biodiversity loss outpaces recovery, conservationists are increasingly turning to novel tools for preventing extinction, including cloning and in vitro gametogenesis of biobanked cells. However, restoration of populations can be hindered by low genetic diversity and deleterious genetic load. The persistence of the northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) now depends on the cryopreserved cells of 12 individuals. These banked genomes have higher genetic diversity than southern white rhinos (C. s. simum), a sister subspecies that successfully recovered from a severe bottleneck, but the potential impact of genetic load is unknown. We estimated how demographic history has shaped genome-wide genetic load in nine northern and 13 southern white rhinos. The bottleneck left southern white rhinos with more fixed and homozygous deleterious alleles and longer runs of homozygosity, whereas northern white rhinos retained more deleterious alleles masked in heterozygosity. To gauge the impact of genetic load on the fitness of a northern white rhino population restored from biobanked cells, we simulated recovery using fitness of southern white rhinos as a benchmark for a viable population. Unlike traditional restoration, cell-derived founders can be reintroduced in subsequent generations to boost lost genetic diversity and relieve inbreeding. In simulations with repeated reintroduction of founders into a restored population, the fitness cost of genetic load remained lower than that borne by southern white rhinos. Without reintroductions, rapid growth of the restored population (>20-30% per generation) would be needed to maintain comparable fitness. Our results suggest that inbreeding depression from genetic load is not necessarily a barrier to recovery of the northern white rhino and demonstrate how restoration from biobanked cells relieves some constraints of conventional restoration from a limited founder pool. Established conservation methods that protect healthy populations will remain paramount, but emerging technologies hold promise to bolster these tools to combat the extinction crisis.

AB  - In the current paper, we present the description of five new species of pseudotanaids sampled off the Bass Strait during two campaigns (SLOPE), which took place in 1986/8 and 1994 from the upper continental margin (slope) at depths 200-1550 m, hopefully starting to fill a gap in the knowledge of this major habitat. From five species, two occurred off eastern coast between Gippsland and Jervis Point and three others on the southern coast between Great Otway (Otway Point) and Kangaroo Island. These five species bring the total number of described pseudotanaid species 94 and to six in Australian waters.

AB  - Complete ammonia oxidizers (Comammox, CMX) are a newly discovered and important component of the nitrogen cycle. While CMX Nitrospira has been detected in various ecosystems, few studies so far have focused on the relative contribution and co-occurrence network of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA), bacteria (AOB), and CMX Nitrospira in artificial forest ecosystems (tree plantations). We evaluated the dynamics of composition, co occurrence patterns and contribution of soil microbial nitrifiers to nitrification in soil of various tree species with different ages in the Qilian Mountains employing the space for time substitution approach, quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing technology. Generally, plantation development significantly reduced soil potential nitrification rates. Inhibition experiments and modular analysis showed that AOA played leading roles in nitrification of abandoned farmland and 17-year-old Hippophae rhamnoides, whereas CMX Nitrospira dominated in 36-year-old Picea crassifolia, 36-year-old Picea crassifolia and Larix gmelinii mixed plantation, and 50-year-old Picea crassifolia. The dominant AOA and CMX Nitrospira lineages in all samples were Group I.1b and Clade B, respectively. The assembly of nitrifier community was governed by stochastic processes, in which dispersal limitation made a significant contribution. The nitrifiers coexist in a mutualistic manner, albeit with possible functional redundancy, while the modular analysis revealed the aggregation pattern of the four modules in different artificial forests' soil. The Mantel test showed that modular formation is mainly affected by NH4+ and SOM. These results broaden our current understanding of the relation between CMX Nitrospira and canonical ammonia oxidizers in terrestrial ecosystems, and provide empirical evidence for not only niche differentiation, but also the relative contribution and co-occurrence patterns of nitrifying communities in an artificial forest ecosystem.

AB  - Both natural and anthropogenic forces can play a substantial role in the demographic history and current structure of a wildlife population. Species with strict habitat requirements are especially susceptible to these impacts. Mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) in Alaska are of particular interest in this regard due to their influence on alpine ecosystems, importance to human cultures, and enigmatic history in some areas. Here, we used genetic tools to examine the population structure and demographic history of mountain goats in Alaska. We genotyped 816 mountain goats at 18 microsatellites, identified the number of genetically distinct subpopulations, and assessed their genetic diversity. We used Bayesian methods to investigate demographic history relative to the known geologic and human history of Alaska, and we simulated human-mediated translocation events onto islands to address the hypothesis that Baranof Island harbored an extant population prior to an early 20th-century introduction. We showed that Alaska has 4 genetically distinct subpopulations of mountain goats. The main demographic split between Southcentral and Southeast Alaska occurred following the retreat of ice after the Last Glacial Maximum. Simulations of translocation events largely aligned with expected genetic diversity patterns of current subpopulations except for Baranof Island which showed greater diversity than the simulation, consistent with the hypothesis of an endemic population prior to the translocation. This study highlights the value of considering both natural and anthropogenic forces when assessing the biogeographic history of a species and provides new insights about the complex demographic history and biogeography of mountain goats in Alaska.
   We investigate the biogeographic and anthropogenic impacts on Mountain Goat distribution and genetic diversity in Alaska. We found that patterns are tied to vicariance following the Last Glacial Maximum. Translocation analysis revealed high genetic diversity on Baranof Island, suggesting that mountain goats inhabited the island prior to the translocation.

AB  - ContextTopographic ruggedness has been examined in thousands of ecological studies and is a popular variable for characterizing habitat selection. Despite widespread adoption, ruggedness metrics are often applied uncritically and require systematic and thorough testing using both artificial landscapes and real-world applications.ObjectivesIn this paper we introduce a technique that removes the correlation of topographic ruggedness with curvature in order to more accurately represent fine-scale surface ruggedness.MethodsWe test our modified version of several ruggedness metrics against traditional ruggedness metrics using three ideal ruggedness criteria in artificial landscapes. We further tested our modified ruggedness measures using 449 real mountain ranges in Nevada, USA. Using desert bighorn sheep as a case study, we tested both modified and uncorrected ruggedness measures and slope in a multiscale context in order to examine habitat selection by female bighorn sheep.ResultsThe modified versions of the metrics passed all three criteria of the ideal ruggedness test and was able to accurately capture surface ruggedness. Modified versions of ruggedness differed from uncorrected versions by containing fewer highly rugged cells along ridgelines and drainages. Habitat relationships of desert bighorn sheep with ruggedness were scale-dependent, such that female sheep selected for steep slopes at fine spatial scales and ruggedness at moderate spatial scales.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that there are three components to ruggedness: elevation variation, aspect diversity, and surface ruggedness representing first, second, and third generation ruggedness indices. Our technique for removing underlying topographic variation provides an improved mapping of surface ruggedness and augments the other two generations of ruggedness metrics.

AB  - We analyze a spatially extended version of a well-known model of forest-savanna dynamics, which presents as a system of nonlinear partial integro-differential equations, and study necessary conditions for pattern-forming bifurcations. Homogeneous solutions dominate the dynamics of the standard forest-savanna model, regardless of the length scales of the various spatial processes considered. However, several different pattern-forming scenarios are possible upon including spatial resource limitation, such as competition for water, soil nutrients, or herbivory effects. Using numerical simulations and continuation, we study the nature of the resulting patterns as a function of system parameters and length scales, uncovering subcritical pattern-forming bifurcations and observing significant regions of multistability for realistic parameter regimes. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of extant savanna-forest modeling efforts and highlight ongoing challenges in building a unifying mathematical model for savannas across different rainfall levels.

AB  - While it is well established that humans develop stronger relationship bonds when they share stressful experiences, there is little known on how shared stressful experiences may influence relationship bonding in animals. Here, we present a study looking at social proximity between individuals in small groups of Merino ewes following a shared stressful experience compared with control sheep that were not exposed to stress. Some sheep were familiar to each other. Analyses of social proximity using real-time-kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) on-animal devices showed sheep preferred to be closest to familiar individuals, but across the study duration they also developed a preference for the individuals they shared the stressful experience with, relative to their proximity to control individuals. These results contribute to limited research on what factors may instigate the development of bonds between unfamiliar sheep. Between-individual bonds may develop as a means of socially mediated stress buffering. Social bonding following a shared stressful experience aligns with human social relationships and increases our understanding of how animals perceive their conspecifics in relation to stressful environmental change.

AB  - Previous studies have highlighted ecosystem-based management (EBM) related pro-environmental behaviors. EBM is based on the engagement of local communities in disaster-affected areas. However, few studies have explored the association between residents' health conditions and their perceptions of and capacities for EBM in post-disaster community development. Residents' health and psychological well-being is essential to maintaining their EBM-related motivations. Thus, this article investigated whether the awareness of personal health and Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) can be reflected in pro-environmental behaviors in the health belief model (HBM) in post-disaster contexts. As part of a case study in a disaster-affected rural community in Japan's Miyagi prefecture, a survey was conducted and the hypotheses were tested using a structural equation model (SEM). The Great East Japan Earthquakes and Tsunami in 2011 affected the study site, in the Maehama community, the Camellia Forest Project was initiated following this disaster as part of the ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) and ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) initiatives for post-disaster development. The empirical results confirmed the indirect influence of Eco-DRR factors and health perceptions on proenvironmental behaviors. In particular, the analysis showed that among HBM's perceived factors, perceived benefits of health promotion, Eco-DRR perceptions, social cohesion were positively associated with residents' ordinary green management. It also showed that green self-efficacy positively affected ordinary green management. Mowing/weeding experience was a significant representative cue to action and had a positive effect on residents' green management. Thus, this article shows that practicing a healthy lifestyle through green management, integrating Eco-DRR development benefits the sustainability and environmental health of resilient communities.

AB  - The suborder Heteroptera (order Hemiptera) is one of the most interesting groups of Rynchota. It is found in various ecosystems around the world and belongs to predators, parasitous (in particular hematophagous), mycetophagous and herbivorous types. Species with mixed nutrition are common. The study is aimed to describe the fauna and distribution of hemipteran insect species in the Republic of Mordovia (the central part of the European part of Russia). The study was conducted from 2004 to 2022. Specimens were collected using traditional hemipteran insect collecting methods (manual collecting, light trap, entomological net, Malaise trap, Merike plates, window and soil traps). We examined 4895 specimens of Hemiptera. Species diversity of Heteroptera (order Hemiptera) of Republic of Mordovia accounts for 363 species from 34 families. Of these, 15 species ( Campylosteira verna, Allorhinocoris flavus, Grypocoris sexguttatus, Acetropis gimmerthalii, Geocoris grylloides, Platyplax salviae, Emblethis ciliatus, Aellopus atratus, Rhyparochromus quadratus, Parapiesma quadratum, Berytinus montivagus, Pyrrhocoris marginatus, Enoplops scapha, Dybowskyia reticulata, Ventocoris halophilus ) are listed for the region for the first time. Twenty-three species ( Agramma femorale, Adomerus biguttatus, Aelia acuminata, Carpocoris fuscispinus, Coreus marginatus, Dolycoris baccarum, Eurydema oleracea, Gerris lacustris, Graphosoma lineatum, Kleidocerys resedae, Labops sahlbergii, Lopus decolor, Lygus pratensis, Nithecus jacobaeae, Palomena prasina, Polymerus unifasciatus, Prostemma aeneicolle, Pyrrhocoris apterus, Rhyparochromus pini, Stenodema calcarata, Cymus glandicolor, Eremocoris plebejus, Aphanus rolandri ) constitute the main population of the Heteroptera fauna given in the dataset. The species diversity of Heteroptera of the Republic of Mordovia is roughly similar in number of species to that of neighbouring regions.

AB  - We evaluated whether knowledge of zoonotic diseases is related to beliefs about the threat of those diseases in wood bison. An online questionnaire of Alberta hunters (n = 239) was primarily conducted through the provincial government's hunter licensing system. Respondent knowledge of bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis in Canada was limited and non-linearly related to threat beliefs. Higher knowledge was associated with believing the diseases are or are not a threat to human health rather than being unsure. Respondents were clustered based on their agreement that the diseases are threats to personal health. The Strongly Disagree cluster had significantly higher knowledge than the Neutral cluster. The Higher Agreement cluster had higher knowledge than the Neutral and lower knowledge than the Strongly Disagree clusters, but these differences were not significant. Results highlight how conflict could arise if increasing disease knowledge is assumed to lead to specific changes in disease threat-related beliefs.

AB  - Sheep prion protein (PRNP) is the major host genetic factor responsible for susceptibility to scrapie. We aimed to understand the evolutionary history of sheep PRNP, and primarily focused on breeds from Turkey and Ethiopia, representing genome-wise ancient sheep populations. Population molecular genetic analyses are extended to European, South Asian, and East Asian populations, and for the first time to scrapie associated haplotypes. 1178 PRNP coding region nucleotide sequences were analyzed. High levels of nucleotide diversity driven by extensive low-frequency replacement changes are observed in all populations. Interspecific analyses were conducted using mouflon and domestic goat as outgroup species. Despite an abundance of silent and replacement changes, lack of silent or replacement fixations was observed. All scrapie-associated haplotype analyses from all populations also showed extensive low-frequency replacement changes. Neutrality tests did not indicate positive (directional), balancing or strong negative selection or population contraction for any of the haplotypes in any population. A simple negative selection history driven by prion disease susceptibility is not supported by the population and haplotype based analyses. Molecular function, biological process enrichment, and protein-protein interaction analyses suggested functioning of PRNP protein in multiple pathways, and possible other functional constraint selections. In conclusion, a complex selection history favoring excessive replacement changes together with weak purifying selection possibly driven by frequency-dependent selection is driving PRNP sequence evolution. Our results is not unique only to the Turkish and Ethiopian samples, but can be generalized to global sheep populations.

AB  - A positive school climate can directly influence the relationships and social interactions among students while also contributing to the development of socio-emotional skills. Simultaneously, the school climate depends on these said skills. Despite this close relationship, emotional education and school climate improvement programmes have traditionally been studied separately. This study describes and evaluates the effectiveness of a new programme, OKAPI (Organisation, Cooperation, Positive Environment, Participation and Emotional Intelligence), for the development of socio-emotional skills and the improvement of classroom climate for primary school students using a cooperative learning methodology. The total sample comprised 86 students aged 9-11 years. A quasi-experimental design with pre-test and post-test measures with a control group was used. The results show that the program's implementation is effective both for the improvement of the classroom climate and the acquisition of training in the field of emotional intelligence, as well as for the development of cooperative competences. Among the fundamental pillars of the OKAPI programme are its simplicity and transversality, so that teachers are responsible for its application and monitoring; thus, the programme becomes an agent of change in their educational practice.

AB  - This paper evaluates the impact of the forest environment on aggressive manifestations in adolescents. A remedial educative programme was performed with 68 teenagers from institutions with substitute social care with diagnoses F 30.0 (affective disorders) and F 91.0 (family-related behavioural disorders), aged 12-16 years. Adolescents observed patterns of prosocial behaviour in forest animals (wolves, wild boars, deer, bees, ants, squirrels and birds), based on the fact that processes and interactions in nature are analogous to proceedings and bonds in human society. The methodology is based on qualitative and quantitative research. Projective tests (Rorschach Test, Hand Test, Thematic Apperception Test) were used as a diagnostic tool for aggressive manifestations before and after forest therapies based on Shinrin-yoku, wilderness therapy, observational learning and forest pedagogy. Probands underwent 16 therapies lasting for two hours each. The experimental intervention has a statistically significant effect on the decreased final values relating to psychopathology, irritability, restlessness, emotional instability, egocentrism, relativity, and negativism. Forest animals demonstrated to these adolescents ways of communication, cooperation, adaptability, and care for others, i.e., characteristics without which no community can work.

AB  - Current global change scenarios demand knowledge on how anthropogenic impacts affect ecosystem functioning through changes in food web structure. Frugivorous mesocarnivores are a key link in trophic cascades because, while their abundance and behaviour are usually controlled by apex predators, they can provide high-quality seed-dispersal services to plant communities. Thus, the recent rewilding of large carnivores worldwide can trigger cascading effects for plants. We investigated the top-down effects of an apex predator (Iberian lynx Lynx pardinus) on seed-dispersal services mediated by two mesocarnivore species (red fox Vulpes vulpes and stone marten Martes foina) at the plant community level by comparing areas with and without lynx in a Mediterranean mountain range in Southern Spain. We collected scats of mesocarnivores (n = 1575) to assess frugivory and seed dispersal of 15 plant species over two consecutive fruiting seasons and two habitat types (open and forest). Specifically, we assessed the effect of lynx presence on (i) seed occurrence and fleshy-fruit biomass per scat, (ii) number of scats containing seeds and (iii) diversity of dispersed seeds. The quantity and diversity of dispersed seeds drastically decreased under predation risk for both mesocarnivore's species. Seed dispersal by stone martens was negatively affected by the presence of lynx, with a marked reduction in the number of scats with seeds (93%) and the diversity of dispersed seeds (46%). Foxes dispersed 68% fewer seeds in open habitats when coexisting with lynx, probably leading to differential contributions to seed-dispersal effectiveness among habitats. Our study reveals a novel trophic cascade from apex predators to plant communities. The behavioural responses of frugivorous mesocarnivores to predation risk and the reduction in the intensity of their faecal deposition pattern are probably related to their lower abundance when co-occurring with apex predators. While rewilding apex predators is a successful conservation tool, attention should be paid to cascading effects across food webs, particularly where frugivore megafauna is missing and mesocarnivores provide unique services to plants.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.
   El escenario actual de cambio global demanda m & aacute;s conocimiento sobre c & oacute;mo los impactos antr & oacute;picos afectan al funcionamiento de los ecosistemas a trav & eacute;s de cambios en la estructura de la red tr & oacute;fica. Los mesocarn & iacute;voros frug & iacute;voros son un eslab & oacute;n clave en las cascadas tr & oacute;ficas ya que, si bien su abundancia y comportamiento suelen estar controlados por los superdepredadores, pueden proporcionar servicios de dispersi & oacute;n de semillas de alta calidad a las comunidades de plantas. As & iacute;, la reciente recuperaci & oacute;n de grandes carn & iacute;voros en todo el mundo puede desencadenar efectos en cascada para las plantas. Investigamos los efectos en cascada de un superdepredador (lince ib & eacute;rico Lynx pardinus) sobre los servicios de dispersi & oacute;n de semillas mediados por dos especies mesocarn & iacute;voras (zorro rojo Vulpes vulpes y gardu & ntilde;a Martes foina) a nivel de toda la comunidad de plantas y comparando & aacute;reas con y sin lince en las monta & ntilde;as mediterr & aacute;neas del sur de Espa & ntilde;a. Recolectamos excrementos de mesocarn & iacute;voros (n = 1575) para evaluar la frugivor & iacute;a y la dispersi & oacute;n de semillas de 15 especies de plantas durante dos temporadas de fructificaci & oacute;n consecutivas y en dos tipos de h & aacute;bitat (abierto y forestal). Espec & iacute;ficamente, evaluamos el efecto de la presencia de linces sobre (i) la presencia de semillas y la biomasa de frutos por excremento, (ii) el n & uacute;mero de excrementos que conten & iacute;an semillas y (iii) la diversidad de semillas dispersadas. La cantidad y diversidad de semillas dispersadas disminuyeron dr & aacute;sticamente bajo el escenario de riesgo de depredaci & oacute;n para ambas especies de mesocarn & iacute;voros. La dispersi & oacute;n de semillas por las gardu & ntilde;as se vio afectada negativamente por la presencia del lince, con una marcada reducci & oacute;n en el n & uacute;mero de excrementos con semillas (93%) y la diversidad de semillas dispersadas (46%). Los zorros dispersaron un 68% menos semillas en h & aacute;bitats abiertos cuando coexistieron con el lince, lo que probablemente condujo a una contribuci & oacute;n diferente en la efectividad de la dispersi & oacute;n de semillas entre h & aacute;bitats. Nuestro estudio revela una nueva cascada tr & oacute;fica desde los superdepredadores hasta las comunidades de plantas. Las respuestas comportamentales de los mesocarn & iacute;voros frug & iacute;voros al riesgo de depredaci & oacute;n y la reducci & oacute;n de sus patrones de marcaje fecal probablemente est & eacute;n relacionados con su menor abundancia cuando coexisten con los superdepredadores. Aunque la recuperaci & oacute;n de los superdepredadores es una herramienta de conservaci & oacute;n exitosa, se debe prestar atenci & oacute;n a sus efectos en cascada en las redes tr & oacute;ficas, particularmente en escenarios donde la megafauna frug & iacute;vora ha desaparecido y los mesocarn & iacute;voros brindan servicios & uacute;nicos a las comunidades de plantas.

AB  - A recent paper highlighted the need for increased attention towards species that have vanished from scientific literature and proposed a new nomenclature in view of needed conservation actions, based on the time interval since their disappearance. Here, we propose to implement this concept by showcasing a taxonomic perspective that is often overlooked in conservation studies. In recent decades, research on vertebrates showed that, in several cases, species considered as undescribed were, in fact, first discovered and already named a long time ago. Quite often they fell into oblivion while being considered synonyms of other taxa until they were re-evaluated in subsequent taxonomic revisions. In this context, we are proposing the concept of "long-lost synonymized" species, asking for greater attention to the discipline of taxonomy, the relevance of specimen-based taxonomy and the value of natural history collections within conservation and academic communities.

AB  - Memory disruption commonly follows chronic stress, whereas acute stressors are generally benign. However, acute traumas such as mass shootings or natural disasters-lasting minutes to hours and consisting of simultaneous physical, social, and emotional stresses-are increasingly recognized as significant risk factors for memory problems and PTSD. Our prior work has revealed that these complex stresses (concurrent multiple acute stresses: MAS) disrupt hippocampus-dependent memory in male rodents. In females, the impacts of MAS are estrous cycle-dependent: MAS impairs memory during early proestrus (high estrogens phase), whereas the memory of female mice stressed during estrus (low estrogens phase) is protected. Female memory impairments limited to high estrogens phases suggest that higher levels of estrogens are necessary for MAS to disrupt memory, supported by evidence that males have higher hippocampal estradiol than estrous females. To test the role of estrogens in stress-induced memory deficits, we blocked estrogen production using aromatase inhibitors. A week of blockade protected male and female mice from MAS-induced memory disturbances, suggesting that high levels of estrogens are required for stress-provoked memory impairments in both males and females. To directly quantify 17 beta -estradiol in murine hippocampus we employed both ELISA and mass spectrometry and identified significant confounders in both procedures. Taken together, the cross-cycle and aromatase studies in males and females support the role for high hippocampal estrogens in mediating the effect of complex acute stress on memory. Future studies focus on the receptors involved, the longevity of these effects, and their relation to PTSD-like behaviors in experimental models.

AB  - DNA methylation-based biomarkers of ageing (epigenetic clocks) promise to lead to new insights into evolutionary biology of ageing. Relatively little is known about how the natural environment affects epigenetic ageing effects in wild species. In this study, we took advantage of a unique long-term (>40 years) longitudinal monitoring of individual roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) living in two wild populations (Chize and Trois-Fontaines, France) facing different ecological contexts, to investigate the relationship between chronological age and levels of DNA methylation (DNAm). We generated novel DNA methylation data from n = 94 blood samples, from which we extracted leucocyte DNA, using a custom methylation array (HorvathMammalMethylChip40). We present three DNA methylation-based estimators of age (DNAm or epigenetic age), which were trained in males, females, and both sexes combined. We investigated how sex differences influenced the relationship between DNAm age and chronological age using sex-specific epigenetic clocks. Our results highlight that old females may display a lower degree of biological ageing than males. Further, we identify the main sites of epigenetic alteration that have distinct ageing patterns between the two sexes. These findings open the door to promising avenues of research at the crossroads of evolutionary biology and biogerontology.

AB  - In tree canopies, incoming solar radiation interacts with leaves and branches to generate temperature differences within and among leaves, presenting thermal opportunities and risks for leaf-dwelling ectotherms. Although leaf biophysics and insect thermal ecology are well understood, few studies have examined them together in single systems. We examined temperature variability in aspen canopies, Populus tremuloides, and its consequences for a common herbivore, the leaf-mining caterpillar Phyllocnistis populiella. We shaded leaves in the field and measured effects on leaf temperature and larval growth and survival. We also estimated larval thermal performance curves for feeding and growth and measured upper lethal temperatures. Sunlit leaves directly facing the incoming rays reached the highest temperatures, typically 3-8 degrees C above ambient air temperature. Irradiance-driven increases in temperature, however, were transient enough that they did not alter observed growth rates of leaf miners. Incubator and ramping experiments suggested that larval performance peaks between 25 and 32 degrees C and declines to zero between 35 and 40 degrees C, depending on the duration of temperature exposure. Upper lethal temperatures during 1-h heat shocks were 42-43 degrees C. When larvae were active in early spring, temperatures generally were low enough to depress rates of feeding and growth below their maxima, and only rarely did estimated mine temperatures rise beyond optimal temperatures. Observed leaf or mine temperatures never approached larval upper lethal temperatures. At this site during our experiments, larvae thus appeared to have a significant thermal safety margin; the more pressing problem was inadequate heat. Detailed information on mine temperatures and larval performance curves, however, allowed us to leverage long-term data sets on air temperature to estimate potential future shifts in performance and longer-term risks to larvae from lethally high temperatures. This analysis suggests that, in the past 20 years, larval performance has often been limited by cold and that the risk of heat stress has been low. Future warming will raise mean rates of feeding and growth but also the risk of exposure to injuriously or lethally high temperatures.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides L. is extensively distributed throughout China and plays a pioneering role in combating desertification and soil erosion in northern regions. H. rhamnoides contains abundant nutrients and is of medical and economic value. However, there has been a lack of research on sea buckthorn seeds, both domestically and internationally, particularly regarding the mechanisms governing their growth and germination. Therefore, to explore the growth of sea buckthorn seeds, this study analyzed and studied the molecular mechanism of seed germination process of sea buckthorn. To better understand the molecular mechanism underlying seed germination in sea buckthorn, we used transcriptomics to compare gene expression before and after seed germination in H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis Rousi. We identified 9,988 differentially expressed genes (5,593 upregulated and 4,395 downregulated). A bioinformatics-based analysis revealed that changes in plant hormone signal transduction and starch and sucrose metabolism-related gene expression may regulate seed germination in this species. Notably, the levels of auxin (IAA), cytokinin (CTK), and brassinosteroids (BR) increased during seed germination while those of ABA decreased. Exogenous application of IAA, CTK, and BR promoted sea buckthorn seed germination, while ABA inhibited it. These findings suggested that hormones play an important role in the process of sea buckthorn seed germination. This study provides preliminary information about the seed germination mechanism in sea buckthorn, offering an essential reference for improving seed breeding and germplasm and laying the foundation for further resistance research on the molecular mechanism of seed germination of sea buckthorn in this species.

AB  - Understanding space-use patterns in parrotfish (Scarini) is especially important for coral reefs, where herbivores play a key role in maintaining reef health. However, we lack the long-term high-resolution data needed to understand parrotfish space-use patterns over time. We examine long-term space-use dynamics in parrotfish (median duration: 359 days) by tracking 23 terminal-males of three species along a coral reef in the Northern Red Sea Gulf of Aqaba. We used acoustic telemetry to track horizontal movement along the reef, depth, and activity (through tri-axial accelerometers), and quantify the effect of environmental factors such as water temperature and algal abundance on long-term patterns. We found that in the species examined, nearly all individuals maintained a highly consistent spatial pattern throughout the study duration, in which they repeatedly moved along a distinct route between nighttime sleeping areas and spatially constrained daytime areas. Individual patterns were surprisingly conserved over time, despite seasonal changes and variation in resource abundance. Individuals differed considerably in their daily travel distance, with some traveling up to 2000 m along the reef, while others moved only between deep and shallow areas. Activity levels consistently peaked around mid-day, regardless of the location of their daytime areas, which behavioral surveys confirm are associated with feeding activities. We also detected peaks in activity during early mornings when surveys detect that parrotfish interacted in large aggregates (typically 30-60 individuals). Our findings indicate that space-use patterns vary among individuals but are extremely conservative within individuals over long time periods. This in turn may have important consequences to the health of reefs, as individual parrotfish may be less likely to alter foraging patterns as conditions change. Furthermore, the high fidelity to limited sleeping and daytime areas may be a source of concern, as local small-scale disturbances may strongly disrupt individual space-use patterns.

AB  - There is little information about the changes in the abundance of mammalian species in South America during the late Quaternary, which is a key parameter to understanding past ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Here, we describe a conspicuous increase in the abundance of the gray brocket deer (Subulo gouazoubira G. Fisher, 1814; Mammalia) during the late Quaternary in Brazil based on paleontological evidence. We studied the material retrieved from pitfall deposits in Cuvieri Cave (Brazil) representing three time intervals (Late Pleistocene, Pleistocene/Holocene transition, and Holocene). The deposits in this cave were previously characterized in terms of facies composition, chronology, and overall taxa and taphonomy. We combined previous data with taxonomic identification at the species level for deer (morphological and ancient DNA analyses), quantification of the number of individuals for large mammals (>10 kg), taphonomic analyses, and stratigraphic distribution of specimens. Our results show that while in the Late Pleistocene gray brocket deer corresponded to up to 18% of 38 individuals, in the Holocene they represented at least 82% of 78 individuals. We interpret this change in frequency as a considerable increase in abundance in the surroundings of the cave, after excluding major taphonomical biases. The causes for this phenomenon are uncertain but could have involved a surplus of food availability and predation release due to the late Quaternary extinction event.

AB  - Bark stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) is one of the most acute instances of damage wrought by these animals in a forest. Because of its location, bark stripping causes damage to the thickest and most valuable part of the tree trunk, which lowers the quality of the wood due to technical flaws. The research was conducted in 25 sampling sites of pine stands aged 35 years in a mixed, fresh forest habitat in south-western Poland. The study was aimed at assessing the influence of bark damage by deer on biometric parameters of pine stands (Pinus sylvestris L.). The assessment involved the diameter at breast height, height, basal area and volume of the tree stands. The results revealed a strong deer-specific pressure on the analysed pine stands. The share of bark stripped trees ranged from 65% to 96%. The number of bark damage instances (NBDI) on a given tree was found to significantly affect its diameter at breast height. The strip-damaged trees had breast height diameters lower by 23% on average, and their mean height was lower by 8.7% as compared with the trees without damage. The mean reduction in basal area increments (G(1.3)) of the trees was identified at 39%. In a similar way to the diameter at breast height and the basal area, the losses in tree stand volume growth caused by deer stripping were significant and oscillated at 41%.

AB  - This paper discusses the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates in the northeastern part of the Kanin Peninsula (67 degrees 50 ' 47 '' N, 46 degrees 20 ' 40 '' E) based on the results of their census conducted in July 2021. In total, 1 amphibian species, 1 reptile species, 57 bird species, and 6 mammal species have been recorded. The following bird species have been recorded in the tundra zone of the Kanin Peninsula for the first time: tufted duck (Aythya fuligula L.), common eider (Somateria mollissima L.), pallid harrier (Circus macrourus S.G. Gmelin), and common sandpiper (Actitis hypoleucos L.). A distinct feature of the vertebrate fauna inhabiting this region located in the low-growing dwarf-birch tundra belt is the presence of boreal species, including common frog (Rana temporaria L.), viviparous lizard (Zootoca vivipara Lichtenstein), tufted duck, common goldeneye (Bucephala clangula L.), Eurasian crane (Grus grus L.), common sandpiper, brown bear (Ursus arctos L.), and European elk (Alces alces L). So far, this is the northernmost known habitat of the viviparous lizard. The following factors are favorable for the presence of boreal species in this area: its location on the southern slope of the plateaulike Kanin Kamen Ridge and ruggedness of its relief, including deep river valleys with well-heated slopes protected from winds. It is established that the spatial density of the Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus L.) brood burrows has decreased ten times when compared with the 1940-1950s due to the activation of cryogenic processes in permafrost that destroy the burrows dug by this predator in loose soils.

AB  - Aim Species interactions are assumed to be stronger closer to the equator. However, numerous studies provided conflicting results and considerable controversy exists concerning the latitudinal patterns in the intensity of biotic interactions. Thus, the question of whether biotic interactions are stronger near the equator remains open. Here, we provide a global evaluation of latitudinal trends in nest predation in songbirds and their explanations. Location Worldwide. Taxon Songbirds (Aves: Passeriformes). Methods We collected published data on nest predation in 1297 populations of 659 species across the globe (124,958 nests). We quantified latitudinal trends in the intensity of nest depredation (daily predation rate, DPR) and in potential demographic impacts of nest depredation (the proportion of nests destroyed by predators). We also quantified the latitudinal trend in the proportion of failed nests destroyed by predators and assessed how nest depredation and latitudinal trends differed across nest types. We aimed at explaining spatial variation in nest predation by productivity and species richness of potential nest predators. Results All measures of nest predation increased towards the equator and the increase was stronger in the northern hemisphere. Nest predation also increased with time, and it was higher in open nests than in cavities. Nest predation increased with productivity (indexed by NDVI), independently of latitude. It also increased with species richness of potential nest predators, but this effect was confounded with latitude. Main conclusions Tropical songbirds faced both higher intensity of nest predation (higher DPR) and more detrimental demographic outcomes of nest depredation (higher proportion of nests lost to predators). Moreover, the proportion of nest failure caused by predators also increased towards the equator. Our results support the view that birds are subject to strong biotic interactions close to the equator. Nest predation increased with productivity and tended to increase with species richness of potential nest predators.

AB  - Social media are being used increasingly by the science community to share research output with a wide audience and to seek feedback. They are also used as alternatives to the traditional citation-based assessment of the impacts of scientific products and even to inform employment decisions in academia. One of these media platforms, ResearchGate, is a popular application with more than 20 million users who share and discuss scientific products. We report on a remarkably high level of interest in one of our publications on ResearchGate about the Eurasian wild pig Sus scrofa in Iran, a poorly studied species in a conservation priority region. The number of reads of our publication was c. 1,500 times higher than the mean per publication for scientists from a range of American and Asian universities. Comparison with other ResearchGate statistics and reader feedback indicates these reads resulted from data-gathering processes unrelated to the details of the research. Although this raises questions regarding the ability of ResearchGate and similar platforms to measure research interest and impacts reliably, we use the popularity of our article as an opportunity to advocate for conservation research in an understudied region and on an understudied species.

AB  - Soil and water resources are vital for sustaining life on earth. Nevertheless, they are under threat deterioration causing severe erosion despite the fact little attention is given to their effects. The study aimed assess soil-water conservation measures for landscape restoration and factors affecting its adoption in Bure district of southwest Ethiopia. The study employed cross-sectional survey design and mixed approach to attain the intended objectives. Through multistage sampling procedures, 151 households were selected to conduct the survey. Data were collected using survey questionnaires, key informant interview, focus group discussion and field observation. The study utilized binary logistic regression model to assess factors affecting the adoption soil-water conservation measures in the study area. The result revealed that there are various indigenous and adopted soil-water conservation practices in the area. Among these, fallowing, manuring, mulching, contour plowing, crop rotation, traditional waterways are indigenous practices, whereas terracing, soil and stone bund, fanjuu, vetiver and elephant grass are the adopted soil-water conservation practices. The result of binary logistic regression indicated that sex, age, family size, educational status, distance of farmland from residence, participation in the training significantly affects the decision of households' adoption of soil-water conservation practices at P < 0.05 significance level in the area. It was found that soil-water conservation measures played noteworthy role in retaining and/or restoring soil fertility, regulating temperature, upturn soil moisture, upholding agricultural production, reducing soil erosion, restoring vegetation cover and mitigating anthropogenic land degradation in the study area. Conclusively, concerned stakeholders should collaborate strengthen and maintain the process of implementing soil-water conservation measures for sustainable land resource management of the area.

AB  - BackgroundThe distribution of resources can affect animal range sizes, which in turn may alter infectious disease dynamics in heterogenous environments. The risk of pathogen exposure or the spatial extent of outbreaks may vary with host range size. This study examined the range sizes of herbivorous anthrax host species in two ecosystems and relationships between spatial movement behavior and patterns of disease outbreaks for a multi-host environmentally transmitted pathogen.MethodsWe examined range sizes for seven host species and the spatial extent of anthrax outbreaks in Etosha National Park, Namibia and Kruger National Park, South Africa, where the main host species and outbreak sizes differ. We evaluated host range sizes using the local convex hull method at different temporal scales, within-individual temporal range overlap, and relationships between ranging behavior and species contributions to anthrax cases in each park. We estimated the spatial extent of annual anthrax mortalities and evaluated whether the extent was correlated with case numbers of a given host species.ResultsRange size differences among species were not linearly related to anthrax case numbers. In Kruger the main host species had small range sizes and high range overlap, which may heighten exposure when outbreaks occur within their ranges. However, different patterns were observed in Etosha, where the main host species had large range sizes and relatively little overlap. The spatial extent of anthrax mortalities was similar between parks but less variable in Etosha than Kruger. In Kruger outbreaks varied from small local clusters to large areas and the spatial extent correlated with case numbers and species affected. Secondary host species contributed relatively few cases to outbreaks; however, for these species with large range sizes, case numbers positively correlated with outbreak extent.ConclusionsOur results provide new information on the spatiotemporal structuring of ranging movements of anthrax host species in two ecosystems. The results linking anthrax dynamics to host space use are correlative, yet suggest that, though partial and proximate, host range size and overlap may be contributing factors in outbreak characteristics for environmentally transmitted pathogens.

AB  - Climate change is likely to affect both the productive and reproductive functions of Murrah buffaloes, the major milch breed of India. Hence, in the present study, weekly modules of Temperature Humidity Index (THI) based climate services were prepared and disseminated to the farmers of experimental villages of Haryana, a state of North-Western part of India through either WhatsApp, Text SMS, and Mobile Application. Difference-in- Difference (DiD), a quasi-experimental research design was used to study the impact of climate services on operational decision-making as well as the economic outcome of the farm. The findings of the study revealed that the climate services had a positive effect on the number of farmers adopting the practices like use of oil cakes, minerals, and feed additives in the animal diet. Treatment effect was found to be significant on quantity of oilcake (0.39, 0.45 and 0.51 kg/animal/day); concentrates during both summer (0.48, 0.56, 0.59 kg/animal/ day) and in winter (0.35, 0.40 and 0.42 kg/animal/day); and mineral mixture (9.47, 12.34 and 13.08 gm/animal/day) in Text SMS, WhatsApp and MobileApp group, respectively. The treatment effect of climate services on economic outcome indicators such as summer milk yield was also found to be significant (0.38, 0.44, and 0.50 L/ animal) from Text SMS, WhatsApp, and MobileApp, respectively. Overall, the benefit-to-cost ratio of climate services was found to be 1:1.8. Hence, the exclusive climate services developed for Murrah buffalo farmers were found to be an effective adaptive mechanism for helping vulnerable dairy farming to adapt to the climate of today and of the future.

AB  - This study explores area use of beef cows (Bos taurus) free ranging in boreal production forest of south-eastern Norway. The forests in this region serve multiple purposes, with forestry being the predominant industry. Understanding cattle's area use is crucial for implementing resource management strategies that balance ecological and economic sustainability of these forests. The aim of the study was to examine how extrinsic factors (stocking density, forage quality, road presence, and herd size) and intrinsic factors (reproductive status and breed) influence variations in seasonal and weekly home range sizes of beef suckler cows. The study also investigated changes in home range size over time. The study was conducted over three summers, using GPS collars programmed to record positions at 5 and 10-minute intervals on 75 cows of early and late maturing beef cattle breeds. The cows were allowed to roam freely in two areas, one with a high stocking density and the other with a low stocking density. The seasonal home ranges were found to be surprisingly large, averaging 3979 +/- 344 ha and 2554 +/- 246 ha ( +/- SE) in the low and high stocking density areas, respectively. Both seasonal and weekly home range sizes positively correlated with the proportion of poor-quality vegetation types within the home range. In the low stocking density area, road density was negatively related to seasonal and weekly home range size. Weekly home ranges were largest in the low stocking density area and showed a slight increase throughout the grazing season. No correlation was found between home range size and cattle breed or reproductive status. In line with previous studies on area use by wild herbivores, vegetation quality significantly influenced the size of their home range. Therefore, vegetation mapping in grazing areas is an essential tool for livestock management in non-arable areas. The difference of home range size between the study areas may be due to factors other than stocking density. This finding should therefore be interpreted with caution, despite previous studies on wild herbivores confirming a negative correlation between population densities and home range size. Cows grazing in boreal forests use large areas and even larger when released to areas with poor forage quality, few roads and small stocking densities. This entails considerable movement throughout the grazing season, spanning across numerous habitats. This extensive area use can pose challenges for other stakeholders in the boreal forest and complicate the monitoring of cattle.

AB  - Urbanized coral reefs are often chronically affected by sedimentation and reduced light levels, yet many species of corals appear to be able to thrive under these highly disturbed conditions. Recently, these marginal ecosystems have gained attention as potential climate change refugia due to the shading effect of suspended sediment, as well as potential reservoirs for stress-tolerant species. However, little research exists on the impact of sedimentation on coral physiology, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we investigated the transcriptomic response to sediment stress in corals of the family Merulinidae from a chronically turbid reef (one genet each of Goniastrea pectinata and Mycedium elephantotus from Singapore) and a clear-water reef (multiple genets of G. pectinata from the Gulf of Aqaba/Eilat). In two ex-situ experiments, we exposed corals to either natural sediment or artificial sediment enriched with organic matter and used whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) to quantify gene expression. Analysis revealed a shared basis for the coral transcriptomic response to sediment stress, which involves the expression of genes broadly related to energy metabolism and immune response. In particular, sediment exposure induced upregulation of anaerobic glycolysis and glyoxylate bypass enzymes, as well as genes involved in hydrogen sulphide metabolism and in pathogen pattern recognition. Our results point towards hypoxia as a probable driver of this transcriptomic response, providing a molecular basis to previous work that identified hypoxia as a primary cause of tissue necrosis in sediment-stressed corals. Potential metabolic and immunity trade-offs of corals living under chronic sedimentation should be considered in future studies on the ecology and conservation of turbid reefs.

AB  - Heat stress will be an increasing problem for plants and pollinators. Some Romneya coulteri flowers self-shade reproductive parts with vertically oriented petals; this keeps pistils 3-8 degrees C cooler. A previous study conducted outside of the plant's native range found that self-shading flowers experienced higher seed set than flowers with petals that were experimentally forced to all be horizontal (open) or vertical (shaded). Hand-pollinated flowers had higher seed set which negated the effect of petal orientation, suggesting that insect pollination may have driven seed set. In this study, we observed insect visitors and their effects on seed set in R coulteri's native range. Plant performance was again limited by pollen such that experimentally adding outcross pollen increased seed set. Native and introduced bees showed no proclivity toward either petal orientation. However, the most common visitor, a native beetle (Lytta auriculata), was strongly biased toward approaching and ultimately accepting flowers with vertical petals that provided shade. Beetles were covered with R. coulteri pollen. Flowers bagged with only beetles for 24 h produced as many seeds as controls left open to all visitors. However, beetles also consume pollen and chew petals. Flowers with vertical petals received more beetle damage and damaged flowers produced 35% fewer seeds than those without chewed petals. Despite the potential role of beetles as pollen vectors, flowers with vertical petals did not experience higher seed production. The outcome of beetle visitation on seed set is likely context-dependent. Petals that affected microclimate were attractive to at least one potential pollinator.

AB  - Animals at risk of predation select habitat that enhances security from predators. Two properties of cover related to security are concealment (i.e., habitat structure that blocks an individual from detection by others) and visibility (i.e., visual information accessible relative to habitat structure). Although these properties are often negatively correlated, they are not always inverse; animals in habitat with heterogeneous structure may be able to select for both. We investigated habitat use by pygmy rabbits ( Brachylagus idahoensis) at 2 scales (patch and microsite) to evaluate the influence of both structural properties of cover and visual properties (concealment and visibility) on habitat use by prey. We contrasted vegetation structure at paired used and unused patches. At each patch, we measured concealment and viewshed (i.e., visibility) in 3 orientations (i.e., aerial, terrestrial, and overall) and structural density using lidar. We also measured heights of the 3 tallest shrubs. Additionally, within used patches, we assessed the density of fecal pellets as an index of intensity of use and also measured distance to nearest burrow. At the patch scale, rabbits selected for structural properties of cover (dense vegetation and tall shrubs), but not visual properties of cover. Pygmy rabbits more intensively used microsites associated with high terrestrial concealment and in proximity to burrows. Our results suggest that pygmy rabbits may perceive greater threat from terrestrial as opposed to aerial predators at both scales, and they also indicate a nuanced relationship between properties of cover and habitat use.

AB  - A good understanding of the utilisation of energy in fish diets is important for accurate feed formulation in aquaculture. One of the primary reasons for differences in the utilisation of digestible energy between fish species are differences that exist in the composition of growth (fat versus protein gain). However, it has also been observed that composition of growth can differ between genetic strains within a single fish species. The main focus of the current experiment was to investigate whether the genetic background of different strains of rainbow trout affects the relationship between digestible energy intake and retained energy. To test this, two different commercial trout strains were selected based on their differences in body fat content (a Lean-Strain and Fat -Strain) and therefore expected differences in composition of growth. Furthermore, this research investigated whether such a potential strain difference in the relationship between digestible energy and retained energy was dependent on the type of non-protein energy in the diet (a Carb-Diet versus a Fat-Diet). Three feeding levels were used in order to estimate the utilisation efficiency of digestible energy for retained energy, leading to a 2 by 2 by 3 factorial design. The results of this study showed that the relationship between digestible energy and retained energy was affected by both strain and diet, but not by an interaction effect between these two factors. Firstly, it was observed that the utilisation efficiency of digestible energy for growth (kgDE) was higher in the Fat-Strain (72% in the Lean-Strain versus 87% in the Fat-Strain) which may be related to a higher potential for fat deposition. This higher kgDE in the Fat-Strain was however balanced by a higher maintenance requirement (47 kJ/kg0.8 per day versus 28 kJ/kg0.8 per day) leading to a similar retained energy between strains in the current trial. Secondly, it was shown that the exchange of dietary carbohydrates for dietary fat on an isoenergetic basis also increased kgDE (74% for the Carb-Diet versus 85% for the Fat-Diet). The lack of an interaction effect between strain and diet showed that kgDE in both strains was affected by the exchange of carbohydrates for fat on an isoenergetic basis in a similar way. The results of the current trial demonstrated that both dietary macronutrient composition and the composition of growth of specific trout strains should be accounted for in calculating the true net available energy for fish in feed formulation.

AB  - Chichankanab is a small, shallow, similar to 8,000-year-old, tropical lake where the adaptive radiation of seven sympatric Cyprinodon species have been described. Since the variation in size, morphology, and diet play a key role in facilitating niche partitioning, this study aims to determine if the sympatric species can be independently identified by their variation in size, morphology, and diet and to understand the role of those variables in the ongoing diversification. To fulfill our aim we gathered, from fish collections, an updated sample of the seven sympatric species and the sister species Cyprinodon artifrons from whom we took their size and photographs to develop geometric morphometric analyses, and collected information on their diet. According to our results, size range allows the separation of Cyprinodon beltrani as the largest species, geometric morphometric allows the segregation C. beltrani, Cyprinodon simus, Cyprinodon suavium, and Cyprinodon labiosus, and a morphotype of three species, Cyprinodon esconditus, Cyprinodon verecundus, and Cyprinodon maya, which can be segregated by body measurements and the size of the species. The diet can help to segregate C. beltrani herbivore, C. maya piscivore/omnivore, C. simus zooplanktivore/detritivore, C. suavium and C. verecundus carnivore/molluscivore, and C. esconditus and C. labiosus carnivores. The ongoing hybridization and the changes in the lake are driving the diversification and decrease of these species. According to our results, there is not one character that differentiated all the species, differentiation was only possible through their specific variation in one character or by a specific combination of characters. It is important to monitor and keep updating information on these evolving species since all seven are listed in the IUCN as vulnerable and near threatened, and according to official Mexican categories as in danger of extinction.

AB  - Well-stocked natural tree regeneration is critical to sustainable management of northern hardwood forests (NHF) by selection silviculture, but explicit goals and stocking criteria for sapling recruit size classes are lacking. For stems 0-2 in. (0-5.1 cm), we define 171 and 691 stems ac(-1) (422.5 and 1,707.5 ha(-1)) as lower and upper full stocking thresholds for basic NHF management goals (wood and biomass productivity) and overabundant/pest-pathogen-challenged species. We define component stocking targets as 15% of full stocking targets for six additional wildlife (e.g., nut producers) and resilience (e.g., pest-pathogen) goals and individual species representation. Applying our system to 141 managed stands in Michigan, USA, we found several areas of concern. At low threshold, 33% of stands were understocked for biomass and wood goals, whereas 67% were fully stocked with overabundant/pest-pathogen-challenged species. Among goals, component stocking (low threshold) was as low as 5% (nut producers), with more than half the stands component stocked for <= 2 goals and <= 2 individual species. Stocking varied geographically and decreased with increasing site quality, overstory basal area, and deer use. Study Implications The stocking goals and density criteria we developed can help managers objectively identify areas where current silvicultural practices are ineffective and need modification. Our system is based on an interactive platform that can be readily modified to accommodate new information and management goals. Several management suggestions emerged from applying our system to selection-managed NHF stands in Michigan. First, highest quality sites have the greatest stocking challenges. Stocking outcomes could likely be improved via more intense overstory harvests and mitigation of deer impacts. Second, most stands meeting stocking goals are vulnerable to future changes in climate and pest-pathogen outbreaks, given stocking is often dominated by a small subset of candidate species. Planting, including the incorporation of assisted migration species candidates could help ameliorate this problem, as species could be evaluated based on their contribution to multiple component stocking goals.

AB  - Water quality can be improved by fencing off streams from livestock. However, the remedial effect of fencing can fail as livestock trample near stream areas. Water samples were taken every 3-4 wk, and flow was monitored over time in a headwater stream from 2003 to 2019. In November 2005, the stream edge and an area near the stream used for wallowing by farmed red deer was fenced off and planted in native trees, shrubs, and grasses. Contaminant (nitrogen and phosphorus species, sediment, and the fecal indicator bacteria Escherichia coli) concentrations decreased after fencing until at least 2013 (55-84%). However, nitrate concentrations more than doubled owing to the use of a portion of the catchment for a grazed winter forage crop in 2013. Most concentrations remained low after fencing, but sediment concentrations slowing increased (3% yr(-1)), which was attributed to animal tracking near the fence line. The presence of stock in the catchment enriched stormflow losses but prevented losses during baseflow. These data indicate that, when implemented well, fencing and planting could potentially sustain good water quality for decades in farmed red deer systems.

AB  - Dominance hierarchies help to reduce unnecessary fights and associated costs during the mating season. Fallow deer, Dama dama, typically have high levels of male-male competition and strong reproductive skew. Nevertheless, how male dominance and daily fight rates affect mating success is still uncertain. We used a 2-year data set from a large population of tagged fallow deer (620-689 individuals), to calculate male dominance ranks based on their agonistic interactions prior to the mating season ('prerut'), to then examine how rank is related to fight rates and mating success during the mating season ('rut'). Overall, higher-ranked males fought at least twice a day on a higher proportion of days during the start and peak of the rut and secured more matings than lower-ranked males. Males engaging in more than 10 fights per day were less likely to secure a mating that same day, and those males exceeding 15 fights per day secured no matings at all. Nevertheless, males with the highest numbers of fights (i.e. 15 - 21 fights per day) and higher proportion of won fights on a given day had higher mating success on the next day compared to those males fighting fewer than 15 fights per day. Although higher-ranked males secured most matings during the rut, their fight rates decreased towards the end. We propose that engaging in more fights negatively affects daily individual mating success but may benefit mating success on the following day and potentially increase long-term fitness benefits. Additionally, engaging in more fights as the rut progresses probably allows lower-ranked males to secure some matings before the availability of oestrous females ends for almost a year.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Elephant rope (Sterculia villosa Roxb.) is a threatened plant species in Bangladesh. To conserve this threatened tree, research should be carried out on improvement of germination and early growth. Therefore, the objective of the study was to explore the effects of pre-sowing seed treatments on germination behavior and to assess the possibility of increasing the germination rate of Sterculia villosa. The seeds were subjected to nine pre-sowing treatments viz., T0: Seeds with no treatment (Control), T1: Seeds scrapping with sand paper at the distal end, Seeds immersed in T2: room temp. water for 24 hours, T3: hot water for 1 minute, T4: 10% concentrated H2SO4 for 1 minute, T5: 10% concentrated H2SO4 for 3 minutes, T6: 10% concentrated HCL for 1 minute, T7: 10% concentrated HCL for 3 minutes, T8: 200ppm GA3 for 24 hours, T9: Fungicide (Autostin 50 WDG) for 24 hours. The study conducted in the propagation house, revealed that pre-sowing treatments significantly (p<0.05) enhanced seed germination parameters of Sterculia villosa. Seed germination started within 2 days after seed sowing and continued up to 15 days. The highest germination percentage (50%) was observed in T8 and the lowest (20%) in T0, T3, and T7. The highest germination Index was found in T8 and the lowest in T0. T8 was found more effective in respect to faster germination, high germination percentage, germination index, seedling vigor index, speed, and energy of germination. In case of seedling growth parameters, the highest shoot length (62 cm) was found in T1 and the lowest (33 cm) in T3. Here, T1 was found more effective in case of shoot length, leaf number, leaf length, and leaf width.

AB  - An individual's future behaviour and fitness are strongly in fluenced by early life experience. Within the suite of factors that underpin juvenile development, sleep plays a particularly important role, ful filling vital physiological and cognitive functions. Sleep ontogeny is the process by which sleep time becomes shorter and more consolidated into fewer bouts from in utero development to adulthood; however, how sleep quantity, fragmentation and quality develop in neonates in the wild is unknown. We investigated this question in 19 free-ranging fallow deer fawns, Dama dama , during the first 5 weeks of life. Specifically, we examined how sleep developed, how it differed between and within individuals, and how it was affected by environmental conditions, using accelerometer-derived estimates of sleep and a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach. We showed that sleep duration rapidly decreased and became more consolidated, quickly approaching an adult-like condition. Moreover, fawns exhibited consistent individual differences in sleep quantity, fragmentation and quality, as well as in the rate at which sleep developed. Finally, environmental conditions affecting thermoregulation mediated sleep behaviour; sleep time was reduced and was of lower quality on warmer days, and sleep quality was further compromised in more humid conditions but was higher with greater rainfall. While sleep ontogeny in free-ranging fawns is partially shaped by the environment, our study reveals previously unknown individual differences in sleep behaviour present from birth, and in the rate of sleep development. We suggest that such individual differences may represent pace-of-life syndromes and may have important consequences for individual fitness later in life. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - In this work, we report an analytical procedure to investigate the lipid compositions of sheep and goat milk. This approach is based on an ion mobility-high-resolution mass spectrometric method to facilitate the identification of complex lipid species and their regiochemistry. A common triacylglycerol profile was observed for sheep and goat milk samples, while a higher abundance of medium-chain fatty acids was observed at the sn-2 position for sheep milk. Furthermore, differences can be also observed in the levels of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids at the sn-2 position. In terms of lipid classes, goat milk showed higher levels of triacylglycerols, phosphatidylinositols and ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamines, while sheep milk showed higher levels of free fatty acids, lysophosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphocholines and non-hydroxy fatty acid-dihydrosphingosine ceramides when compared with goat milk.

AB  - Pinus radiata (radiata pine or Monterey pine) is threatened in its native range in California and, at the same time, one of the most widely-planted tree species worldwide, especially in the southern hemisphere. It is affected by a wide range of plant-feeding insects both in its native range and in regions where it is planted as an introduced tree. In addition, there are many invasive insects that have colonised P. radiata, in some cases causing major damage. Here, our objectives were to provide a complete and up-to-date over-view of all insect species recorded from P. radiata worldwide, to summarise where these insects are native and which countries or regions they have invaded, to categorise them according to their impacts as dam-aging species or as vectors of plant pathogens, and to examine border interceptions to determine whether pathways exist that would allow these species to enter and potentially invade additional regions. Our com-pilation of insects feeding on P. radiata provides a list of 649 species (and an additional 11 species identi-fied at the genus level only). Coleoptera is the most represented order in the list (299 species), followed by Lepidoptera (224 species) and Hemiptera (65 species). We classified 28 species as high-impact, including 12 true bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), eight Lepidoptera, five other Coleoptera, two Hymenoptera and one Hemiptera. These species can cause substantial direct damage or act as vectors of highly-damaging plant pathogens. Other species cause only occasional damage, rarely requiring man-agement (classified as 'low-medium impact') or they are generally benign ('negligible impact'). Hemiptera and Scolytinae have a high proportion of species established outside their native range. The Nearctic and Neotropic regions have been invaded by the most high-impact species, mainly by species native to Europe. Border interceptions of 185 species (29% of those on our list) were recorded during import inspections between 1995-2021, indicating considerable potential for further invasions. The findings of our study can be used to identify potential high-impact invaders and the pathways that may require more phytosanitary attention. Furthermore, our analyses provide useful insights into the insect-plant interactions resulting from the global distribution of a tree species and the native and non-native insects feeding on it.

AB  - Anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change on biodiversity requires a comprehensive understanding on key habitats utilized by species. Yet, such information for high mobile marine megafauna species remains limited. Here, we compile a global database comprising published satellite tracking data (n = 1035 individuals) to spatially delineate foraging grounds for seven sea turtle species and assess their thermal stability. We identified 133 foraging areas distributed around the globe, of which only 2% of the total surface is enclosed within an existing protected area. One-third of the total coverage of foraging hotspots is situated in high seas, where conservation focus is often neglected. Our analyses revealed that more than two-thirds of these vital marine habitats will experience new sea surface temperature (SST) conditions by 2100, exposing sea turtles to potential thermal risks. Our findings underline the importance of global ocean conservation efforts, which can meet climate challenges even in remote environments.

AB  - Investigating the relationship between the physical environment and organismal adaptation is crucial to understanding the selective pressures that drive mammalian evolution. Of the varied approaches to exploring this relationship, macroscopic tooth wear analyses have become widely used due to their economic and simple methodologies. However, more work is needed to understand how assessments of wear patterns operate within finer levels of dietary and environmental contexts. It is specifically unclear if and how tooth wear differs inter- and intraspecifically between geographically widespread, large-bodied mammalian populations. This project characterizes molar hypsodonty indices and mesowear scores of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) populations across North and Central America, investigating if and how molar wear and morphology vary over the deer's large and ecologically variable geographic distribution. While mesowear scores generally do not strongly track environmental signals within and between Odocoileus species, hypsodonty indices reveal a strong correlation between crown height and aridity, which likely represents an adaptive response to abrasive diets in areas with low precipitation.

AB  - Plants are hosts for above- and belowground insect communities that can influence each other via above-belowground plant-physiological dynamics. To mediate interactions, plants produce secondary metabolites, including terpenoids, and mixtures can differ intraspecifically. While intraspecific variation in plant chemistry gained increased interest, the extent to which intraspecific differences in plant chemistry mediate above-belowground interactions of herbivores remains unclear. We used a full factorial design with six distinct terpenoid chemotypes, differing in their chemical diversity of tansy (Tanacetum vulgare). We exposed these to the aboveground herbivore Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria (Hemiptera: Aphididae), the belowground herbivore Agriotes sp. (Coleoptera: Elateridae), no herbivore or both herbivores, to determine if chemotypes or the chemical diversity of plant compounds affected aphid performance and if the interactions between herbivores were mediated by the chemical profile. We found that aphid colony size differed between chemotypes, with the strongest colony increase over time in a mixed chemotype, and the weakest in a beta-thujone chemotype. Root herbivory had no effect on aphid colony size, regardless of the chemotype. Aphid colony size was positively correlated with terpenoid evenness, but not with terpenoid Shannon diversity, terpenoid richness, or relative terpenoid concentration. Tansy chemotypes differed in their morphological responses (final plant height and final plant dry weight) and average leaf chlorophyll content to aboveground herbivory, whereas belowground herbivory exerted minimal impacts. Overall, our results show that intraspecific variation in terpenoid profiles directly modify ecological interactions on a plant, with plant chemistry mediating aphid performance and chemotypes differing in their morphological responses to herbivory.

AB  - Dietary DNA metabarcoding enables researchers to identify and characterize trophic interactions with a high degree of taxonomic precision. It is also sensitive to sources of bias and contamination in the field and laboratory. One of the earliest and most common strategies for dealing with such sensitivities has been to remove all low-abundance sequences and conduct ecological analyses based on the presence or absence of food taxa. Although this step is now often perceived to be necessary, evidence of its sufficiency is lacking and more attention to the risk of introducing other errors is needed. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that common strategies to remove low-abundance sequences can erroneously eliminate true dietary sequences in ways that impact downstream inferences. Using real data from well-studied wildlife populations in Yellowstone National Park, we further show how these strategies can markedly alter the composition of dietary profiles in ways that scale-up to obscure ecological interpretations about dietary generalism, specialism, and composition. Although the practice of removing low-abundance sequences may continue to be a useful strategy to address research questions that focus on a subset of relatively abundant foods, its continued widespread use risks generating misleading perceptions about the structure of trophic networks. Researchers working with dietary DNA metabarcoding data-or similar data such as environmental DNA, microbiomes, or pathobiomes-should be aware of drawbacks and consider alternative bioinformatic, experimental, and statistical solutions.

AB  - The San Joaquin pocket mouse (Perognathus inornatus) is endemic to California and currently includes three subspecies (P. i. inornatus, neglectus, and psammophilus). P. inornatus from the western Mojave Desert have been assigned to the subspecies neglectus based on similar morphology. During the course of live-trapping projects between 1990 and 2017, we captured P. inornatus at several locations in the Mojave Desert and gathered information on habitat associations, relative abundance, seasonal activity, and field identification. P. inornatus was found at elevations ranging from 668-1,109 m above mean sea level in creosote bush scrub, allscale scrub, Joshua tree woodland, rubber rabbitbrush scrub, spinescale scrub, and California juniper woodland. The capture locations and our review of museum specimens indicate that, at a minimum, the species' range in the Mojave Desert encompasses approximately 7,000 km2 primarily in the Antelope Valley, extending at least as far north as the Rand Mountains, east to the vicinity of Hinkley, south to Palmdale, and west to near Gorman. P. inornatus capture rates were typically low relative to other nocturnal rodents, and it was not found consistently at localities at which it had been captured previously. Adults were sexually dimorphic, with males significantly larger than females. P. inornatus was significantly larger than the sympatric little pocket mouse (P. longimembris) for length of head-body, total length and body mass, and possessed a relatively shorter tail. We collected 15 specimens of P. inornatus from nine localities in the western Mojave Desert for cytogenetic analysis and each possessed the same karyotype, characterized by a diploid complement of 52 chromosomes, which has not been previously described for the genus. We argue that the 52-chromosome form should be considered distinct for conservation purposes, because it occupies a relatively small geographic area that is being subjected to increasing habitat loss and fragmentation due to residential, commercial, and renewable energy development.

AB  - Rising global temperatures can affect host plants and insects in a variety of ways. Species interactions can be disrupted as temperatures increase, particularly when members of different trophic levels show differential responses to thermal stress. In agricultural systems, parasitoids are frequently used as biological control agents to reduce crop damage by herbivores, so understanding the effects of thermal stress on multiple trophic levels is imperative for effective management. We experimentally tested the effects of increased temperatures (ambient: 23-30 degrees C; hot: 27-34 degrees C) on the multi-trophic interaction involving three varieties of cultivated Brassica oleracea (L.) (Brassicaceae) (cabbage, kale, or broccoli), the caterpillar pest Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), and its primary parasitoid Diadegma insulare (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). We found that performance metrics of both the caterpillar and parasitoid were consistent among host plants. We found decreased development time and reduced pupal weights at higher temperatures in both the caterpillar and the parasitoid, but no effect of temperature on mortality of either the herbivore or its parasitoid. Development time was more accelerated in the caterpillar than the parasitoid, and pupal weights declined more in parasitoids than caterpillars. Caterpillars behaviorally mitigated temperature stress by pupating beneath leaves, resulting in sublethal effects for both hosts and parasitoids. Kale plants growing under higher temperatures had higher foliar nitrogen, but caterpillar performance data suggested that this was due to increased chemical defenses rather than increased nutrition. Together, these results suggest that biological control of P. xylostella could be disrupted by climate change, especially as lower pupal weights are correlated with reduced fecundity, which could reduce parasitoid population densities; however, as the effects of increased temperature are largely consistent across host plants, similar management practices can be used on different host plants.

AB  - The high-osmolarity glycerol response (HOG) pathway is pivotal in environmental stress response, differentiation and virulence of Alternaria alternata. The synthetic high osmolarity sensitive sensor Sho1 has been postulated to regulate the HOG pathway. To determine the regulatory role of transmembrane protein Sho1 on vegetative growth, secondary metabolism and infection structure formation, a gene (AaSho1) encoding Sho1 was cloned and characterized from A. alternata (JT-03). Sequence analysis showed that AaSho1 has all four characteristic transmembrane domains and the SH3 domain present in another Sho1 gene from several filamentous fungal. The quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that fruit wax extract significantly up-regulated AaSho1 gene expression in vitro. Pharmacological experiments showed that A. alternata treated with nystatin, a specific AaSho1 inhibitor, had no significant effect on the morphology of A. alternata and the invasive growth in pear fruit. However, nystatin treatment signifi-cantly reduced spore germination rates on different wax-coated hydrophobic surfaces, with 58.00, 46.70 and 83.72% reduced for fruit wax, beeswax and paraffin coated. Meanwhile, the secondary metabolism altenuene (ALT), tentoxin (TEN) toxin, and melanin content were also affected by nystatin treatment. These findings suggest that AaSho1 is required for the infection structure differentiation and secondary metabolism of A. alternata in response to physiochemical signals on the host surfaces.

AB  - Sea turtles are an iconic group of marine megafauna that have been exposed to multiple anthropogenic threats across their different life stages, especially in the past decades. This has resulted in population declines, and consequently many sea turtle populations are now classified as threatened or endangered globally. Although some populations of sea turtles worldwide are showing early signs of recovery, many still face fundamental threats. This is problematic since sea turtles have important ecological roles. To encourage informed conservation planning and direct future research, we surveyed experts to identify the key contemporary threats (climate change, direct take, fisheries, pollution, disease, predation, and coastal and marine development) faced by sea turtles. Using the survey results and current literature, we also outline knowledge gaps in our understanding of the impact of these threats and how targeted future research, often involving emerging technologies, could close those gaps.

AB  - To illustrate the impact of genetically modified (GM) Bt maize on the natural enemy communities in the Huang-Huai-Hai summer maize-growing region in China, the abundance of 7 common predator taxa (Geocoris pallidipennis Costa, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), lacewings, Orius sauteri (Poppius), Propylea japonica (Thunberg), spiders, and Staphylinidae) was quantitatively evaluated by comparing Bt-Cry1Ab DBN9936 and Bt-Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj Ruifeng 125 events to their near non-Bt isolines during the growing season from 2016 to 2019. A total of 10,302, 19,793, 13,536, and 5,672 individuals were observed during 4 years, and the abundance of each taxa on Bt maize varied between sample dates among those arthropod taxa. Shannon-Wiener diversity index of predator communities from 7 taxa showed very similar temporal dynamics and principal response curve analyses to examine community-level effects showed no significant differences in predator abundance in Bt maize compared with non-Bt maize. We conclude that the 2 Bt maize hybrids did not adversely affect the predator community in the Huang-Huai-Hai summer maize-growing region of China.

AB  - The source-filter theory of voice production is widely used on mammal vocal communication research allowing a better understanding of individual and context variations. Generally, mammals with less complex repertoires have received little attention regarding the influence of different factors on their vocal characteristics. Acoustic cues appear to be crucial for mutual recognition from a distance in sheep. During stressful situations such as separation from the offspring and social isolation, sheep produce mainly high-pitched bleats, which can be influenced by many factors including breed, individuality, sex or body size. The aim of the present study was to analyze high-pitched bleats produced during a short isolation period from four dairy sheep breeds (38-42 days post-partum) and to investigate if breed, number of offspring, presence of sibling, sex, height, activity levels and context (short temporary or complete absence of kids), affect their vocal characteristics. Ewes (n = 49) of four different dairy breeds namely Chios, Karagouniki, Orino Epirus and Synthetic breed (50% Orino Epirus, 25% Chios breed, 25% East Friesian breed) were isolated from their suckling offspring (n = 65) and vocalizations and behavioural response of each ewe and lamb(s) were recorded. In order to examine the effect of different context on the vocal characteristics of bleats, the experiment was repeated for 11 of the above tested ewes in dry period and thus, without suckling lamb(s). Principal component analysis followed by linear mixed model analyses showed significant (p < 0.05) differences in the vocal parameters between the examined breeds in both ewes and lambs. Interestingly, ewes differentiated their bleat characteristics in regard to the number of offspring. In addition, differences were observed in acoustic characteristics of lambs that had a sibling, which produced bleats with higher mean format frequencies. Furthermore, the behaviour of ewes appeared to be related to vocal parameters. Body size affected lambs' vocal parameters related to fundamental frequency disturbance. In addition, ewes' acoustic parameters related to fundamental frequency and F0 disturbance were observed to differ between contexts. Finally, individuality in both ewes and lambs was also observed in regard to their vocalizations during the studied separation period. The study provides valuable novel information about sheep high-pitched bleats as well as for future development of in-situ livestock applications.

AB  - Human activities and climate change threaten seabirds globally, and many species are declining from already small breeding populations. Monitoring of breeding colonies can identify population trends and important conservation concerns, but it is a persistent challenge to achieve adequate coverage of remote and sensitive breeding sites. Southern giant petrels (Macronectes giganteus) exemplify this challenge: as polar, pelagic marine predators they are subject to a variety of anthropogenic threats, but they often breed in remote colonies that are highly sensitive to disturbance. Aerial remote sensing can overcome some of these difficulties to census breeding sites and explore how local environmental factors influence important characteristics such as nest-site selection and chick survival. To this end, we used drone photography to map giant petrel nests, repeatedly evaluate chick survival and quantify-associated physical and biological characteristics of the landscape at two neighboring breeding sites on Humble Island and Elephant Rocks, along the western Antarctic Peninsula in January-March 2020. Nest sites occurred in areas with relatively high elevations, gentle slopes, and high wind exposure, and statistical models predicted suitable nest-site locations based on local spatial characteristics, explaining 72.8% of deviance at these sites. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of drones as a tool to identify, map, and monitor seabird nests, and to quantify important habitat associations that may constitute species preferences or sensitivities. These may, in turn, contextualize some of the diverse population trajectories observed for this species throughout the changing Antarctic environment.

AB  - Over-compensatory growth of plants after disturbance is generally preferred by grassland users and managers because of more forage. How the grassland productivity and the plant growth condition before disturbance affect the compensatory growth are important for grazing management and the understanding of grassland degradation, yet they are not well understood. A clipping experiment was conducted on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to understand the compensatory growth and conditions for the occurrence of over-compensatory at alpine meadows with different degradation status. Results showed the competition for light constrains the plant growth post-clipping at non-degraded and slightly degraded alpine meadows, while the reduction of soil nitrogen limits it at heavily degraded alpine meadow. The biomass accumulated post-clipping was positively correlated with the growing season biomass in unclipped plots and the biomass at clipping in clipped plots. When the aboveground biomass at clipping was less than 40.10 g m(-2) and the growing season biomass was between 38 and 97 g m(-2), the over-compensatory growth of alpine meadow could occur. Higher clipping rate is required for the alpine meadow with high productivity but the maximum clipping rate should be less than 0.71 to induce the over-compensatory growth. Equal-compensatory occurred at non-degraded and slightly degraded, while over-compensatory growth was observed at moderately degraded and a marginally significant over-compensatory growth at heavily degraded alpine meadow. The over-compensatory growth occurred at moderately degraded alpine meadow is mainly due to the performance of forbs. Our results suggest that grazing at moderately degraded alpine meadow may induce the over-compensatory growth at the community level, but the over-compensatory growth of forbs at moderately degraded alpine meadow may aggravate the alpine meadow degradation.

AB  - Domestic buffalo production plays an economically important role in the Brazilian Amazon, but they are susceptible to many diseases favored by the tropical climate and annually flooded habitats, including ocular diseases. In this context, it is important to select genotypes that maximize innate ocular immunity in Amazonian herds. We aimed to characterise, for the first time, gene expression profiles of the innate immune system in the conjunctival membrane of buffalo. Ocular conjunctival tissue samples were collected from 60 clinically healthy slaughtered animals in the northern Brazilian state of Amapa. The samples were histologically processed for classification into three groups according to the quantitative degree of lymphoid tissue associated with the conjunctiva (discrete, G1; slight, G2; and moderate, G3 presence of lymphoid tissue). RT-PCR was used to quantify gene expression of inflammatory cytokine (IL6, IL10, TNFA, IFNG), Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and Defensin beta 110 (DEFB110), relative to the endogenous GAPDH gene. G1 animals presented low expression for IL6, IL10, TNFA, and DEFB110, while G2 exhibited high expression for IL6, IL10, IFNG, and TLR4. All G3 animals showed high expression for all tested genes. These results suggest a greater resistance to pathogenic microorganisms of buffalos in the G3 group, and the proportion of lymphoid tissue associated with the conjunctiva may be related to the immune resistance of individuals.

AB  - 'The Blob', a mass of anomalously warm water in the Northeast Pacific Ocean peaking from 2014 to 2016, caused a decrease in primary productivity with cascading effects on the marine ecosystem. Among the more obvious manifestations of the event were seabird breeding failures and mass mortality events. Here, we used corticosterone in breast feathers (fCort), grown in the winter period during migration, as an indicator of nutritional stress to investigate the impact of the Blob on two sentinel Pacific auk species (family Alcidae). Feathers were collected from breeding females over 8 years from 2010 to 2017, encompassing the Blob period. Since Pacific auks replace body feathers at sea during the migratory period, measures of fCort provide an accumulated measure of nutritional stress or allostatic load during this time. Changes in diet were also measured using delta N-15 and delta C-13 values from feathers. Relative to years prior to the Blob, the primarily zooplanktivorous Cassin's auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) had elevated fCort in 2014-2017, which correlated with the occurrence of the Blob and a recovery period afterwards, with relatively stable feather isotope values. In contrast, generalist rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) displayed stable fCort values across years and increased delta N-15 values during the Blob. As marine heatwaves increase in intensity and frequency due to climate change, this study provides insight into the variable response of Pacific auks to such phenomena and suggests a means for monitoring population-level responses to climatological variation.

AB  - Accurately estimating body weight is crucial for managing water buffalo health and optimizing feeding strategies. This study explored the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting body weight based on body measurements. Principal component analysis was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify the most relevant features. Subsequently, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms were utilized to predict body weight using the reduced data set. The Gradient Boosting algorithm demonstrated superior performance compared to the Random Forest algorithm. These findings suggest that the combination of principal component analysis and Gradient Boosting offers a reliable and effective method for estimating body weight in water buffaloes. This approach holds promise for improving animal production and health management practices. Future research could focus on enhancing the applicability and generalizability of these models to diverse water buffalo populations across various geographical regions. This study aims to use advanced machine learning techniques supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to estimate body weight (BW) in buffalos raised in southeastern Mexico and compare their performance. The first stage of the current study consists of body measurements and the process of determining the most informative variables using PCA, a dimension reduction method. This process reduces the data size by eliminating the complex structure of the model and provides a faster and more effective learning process. As a second stage, two separate prediction models were developed with Gradient Boosting and Random Forest algorithms, using the principal components obtained from the data set reduced by PCA. The performances of both models were compared using R-2, RMSE and MAE metrics, and showed that the Gradient Boosting model achieved a better prediction performance with a higher R-2 value and lower error rates than the Random Forest model. In conclusion, PCA-supported modeling applications can provide more reliable results, and the Gradient Boosting algorithm is superior to Random Forest in this context. The current study demonstrates the potential use of machine learning approaches in estimating body weight in water buffalos, and will support sustainable animal husbandry by contributing to decision making processes in the field of animal science.

AB  - Epididymal sperm shows higher cryoresistance than ejaculated sperm. Although the sperm proteome seems to affect cell cryoresistance, studies aiming at identifying proteins involved in sperm freezing-tolerance are scarce. The aims of this study were to investigate differences of sperm freezability and proteome between epididymal and ejaculated sperm in three mountain ungulates: Iberian ibex, Mouflon and Chamois. Sperm samples were cryopreserved in straws by slow freezing. Tandem mass tag-labeled peptides from sperm samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer in three technical replicates. The statistical analysis was done using the moderated t-test of the R package limma. Differences of freezability between both types of sperm were associated with differences of the proteome. Overall, epididymal sperm showed higher freezability than ejaculated sperm. Between 1490 and 1883 proteins were quantified in each species and type of sperm sample. Cross species comparisons revealed a total of 76 proteins that were more abundant in epididymal than in ejaculated sperm in the three species of study whereas 3 proteins were more abundant in ejaculated than epididymal sperm in the three species of study (adjusted P < 0.05; vertical bar log(2)vertical bar fold-change > 0.5). Many of the proteins that were associated with higher cryoresistance are involved in stress response and redox homeostasis. In conclusion, marked changes of sperm proteome were detected between epididymal and ejaculated sperm. This work contributes to update the sperm proteome of small ruminants and to identify candidate markers of sperm freezability.

AB  - Direct competition for resources is especially fierce among predators, leading to disproportionately strong effects on fitness and functional roles. These competitive effects are exacerbated in complex predator guilds with dominance hierarchies that have clear winners and losers. The direct costs of losing these competitions are well understood, but the drivers of such interactions, and their indirect effects on prey, are not. We evaluate the drivers of interference competition for cougars, and how such competition affects cougar-prey dynamics, by leveraging 23 years of cougar predation data from Yellowstone National Park, USA. We show that the effect of prey size is context-dependent, negatively affecting how often cougars kill ungulate prey but positively affecting how often wolves/bears find and steal cougar kills. Further, cougars increasingly kill smaller prey as larger, primary prey density decreases. Handling time is shorter for smaller prey, leading to less kleptoparasitism by wolves and bears when primary prey density is lower. Our study counters the theory suggesting that interference competition should increase at kills when prey density declines, interspecific competitor density increases, or kill rates increase. We demonstrate that predator, competitor, and prey traits drive the strength of and even dampen interference competition, possibly increasing coexistence in complex communities.

AB  - In the Anthropocene, algal turfs are expected to replace macroalgal forests and coral cover as the dominant benthic state. These turf seascapes play a key role in regulating ecosystem processes through sediment retention, which carries significant ecological and socio-economic implications. However, our understanding of sediments trapped by turf on coastal reefs, particularly in oceanic islands, remains limited. In this study, we quantified turf seascape architecture (algal composition and mean height) and sediment properties (total particulate load, grain size distribution, and organic content) across a warm-temperate oceanic island. We further decoupled the role of geomorphological, anthropogenic, and turf algae structural predictors in explaining spatial variation in turf sediment properties. Our results revealed significant spatial variation in turf sediment loads, varying by three orders of magnitude (similar to 1 g/m(2) to 2000 g/m(2)), while organic load varied by two orders of magnitude (similar to 1 g/m(2) to 100 g/m(2)). Human pressure and turf algal composition were the strongest predictors of turf sediment load, highlighting the role of local human stressors in modulating sediment dynamics in emerging turf seascapes. Our study provides baseline information on the patterns and drivers of turf sediments in oceanic islands, a critical area to develop management plans that target the resilience of core ecosystem functions under altered reef configurations in the Anthropocene.

AB  - Insect herbivore abundances in agricultural fields partly depend on surrounding landscape compositional heterogeneity (e.g., landscape complexity). Landscape complexity can directly (e.g., dilution of host crops) and indirectly (promoting herbivore biocontrol) regulate herbivores in agricultural fields. While much is known about direct (e.g., resource concentration) and indirect effects (i.e., promoting biocontrol) of landscape complexity on herbivore populations, more work is needed to study whether landscape complexity can regulate herbivore populations by mediating within field multi-species interactions among herbivores and their shared natural enemies. During 2019 and 2020, we estimated Bemisia tabaci and Aphis gossypii abundances, their dominant predators (coccinellids, spiders, Orius spp., and Geocoris spp.), and their interaction (using molecular analysis) in 38 cotton fields along a gradient of landscape diversity across Georgia, USA. Within cotton fields, we assessed the effect of predator abundances, their frequency of feeding on herbivores, and the correlation between herbivore abundances (B. tabaci and A. gossypii) on the B. tabaci and A. gossypii abundance. At the landscape scale, crop diversity and different cover types influenced the abundance of B. tabaci and A. gossypii within cotton fields. We found a complex interaction among pests at the field scale, with higher aphid abundance correlated with decreased whitefly abundance. Our results support crop diversification for improving suppression of generalist pests in cotton landscapes through promoting biocontrol and diluting host crop area. Our result further suggests that the landscape complexity effect on whiteflies can indirectly mediate aphid abundance in cotton fields, indicating the importance of within field species interactions.

AB  - Phylogenetic diversity of plant communities can influence the interaction between plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies. Plant communities with phylogenetically distant species tend to present a wide variety of functional traits and ecological niches, which in turn can influence competitive interactions among plants as well as food and habitat quality for herbivores and their natural enemies. To assess some different mechanisms by which phylogenetic diversity of plant communities can influence herbivores and their natural enemies, we established 12 experimental plots of tropical trees with two treatments: high and low phylogenetic diversity. We measured plant growth and anti-herbivore defenses, herbivore foliar damage, and predator activity in seven species that were present in both treatments. We found significant differences in the expression of plant traits as a function of species identity and their life history, but also depending on the phylogenetic context in which they grew. Pioneer species had higher growth and produced more phenolics in plots with high phylogenetic diversity versus plants in plots with low phylogenetic diversity. Accordingly, herbivore damage in these species was greater in plots with low phylogenetic diversity. Finally, predator activity on caterpillar clay models placed on plants was greater within the low phylogenetic diversity treatment, but only for non-myrmecophytic species. These results suggest that plant phylogenetic diversity can influence the expression of growth and defensive traits and further modify the interaction between plants, herbivores, and their natural enemies. However, such effects depend on plant life history and the presence of mutualistic interaction with ants.

AB  - For many species, behavioral modification is an effective strategy to mitigate negative effects of harsh and unpredictable environmental conditions. When behavioral modifications are not sufficient to mitigate extreme environmental conditions, intrinsic factors may be the primary determinant of survival. We investigated how movement behavior, and internal (i.e., nutrition and age) and external (i.e., food availability and snow depth) states affect survival over winter of a long-lived and highly faithful species (mule deer; Odocoileus hemionus). We first tested whether animals changed their behavior during winter based on internal and external states; we subsequently investigated how behavior and state interacted to influence survival in the face of extraordinary winter conditions. Movement behavior changed minimally as a function of age and nutrition; yet, movement behavior affected survival-animals that exhibited more restricted movements were more likely to succumb to mortality overwinter than animals with less restricted movements. Additionally, nutrition and cumulative snow depth had a strong effect on survival: animals that were exposed to deep snow and began winter with low fat were much less likely to survive. Behavior was an effective tool in securing survival during mild or moderate winters, but nutrition ultimately underpinned survival during harsh winters.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the use of camera-traps has revolutionized our ability to monitor populations of wild terrestrial mammals. While methods to estimate abundance from individually-identifiable animals are well-established, they are mostly restricted to species with clear natural markings or else necessitate invasive and often costly animal tagging campaigns. Estimating abundance or density from unmarked animals remains challenging. Several models recently developed to deal with this issue are promising, but are not widely used by field ecologists. Here, we developed a framework for applying the Space-To-Event (STE) model-originally designed to be used with time-lapse images-on motion-triggered camera-trap data. Our approach involves performing bootstrap resampling on the photographic dataset to generate multiple datasets that are then used as input to the STE model. We tested our approach on 29 datasets, including 17 ungulate species from eight sites, in six different countries and various ecosystems. Then, we conducted a regression analysis to evaluate how variations in ecological and sampling conditions across studies affected the bias and precision of our STE density estimates. Our study shows that with a bootstrap resampling approach and information on animal activity and effective detection distances to animals, the STE model can be used to analyze motion-trigger datasets and provide population density estimates that are similar to those from other methods. We found that measuring the camera viewshed was critical to prevent major negative biases in density estimates. Moreover, using a 1-s sampling window was important to avoid the positive bias that results from violating the instantaneous-sampling assumption. We found that precision increased with greater sampling effort and higher density populations. Based on these results, we highlight several issues from past studies that have applied the original timelapse-based STE to motion-trigger datasets, issues that our bootstrap resampling approach addresses. We caution that the STE model, whether applied to timelapse or motion-triggered datasets, relies on strict assumptions. Any violations of these assumptions, such as non-instantaneous sampling or the application of angle and distance of detection provided by the camera manufacturer, can cause biases in multiple directions that may be difficult to differentiate.

AB  - Wolves play a crucial role in shaping ecological communities as an apex predator in the thy-open forests of semi-arid landscapes in India. Large scale habitat loss pertaining to human expansion and retaliatory killing by human caused severe decline in the wolf population across its range. The estimated wolf population size is close to 2000-3000 individuals in India; however, these estimates were decades old and the present status of the wolf in the semi-arid landscape is largely unknown. We assessed the distribution of wolves in Kailadevi Wildlife Sanctuary, Rajasthan using occupancy models and identified important factors associated with habitat-use by wolves. Occupancy modelling shifts the focus from individual animal to a site, while accounting for detection probability. To assess the habitat-use we used sign-based surveys that rely on data collected from adjacent sampling sites (replicates). The habitat-use was assessed across 672.82 km(2) surveying 48 grid cells, each measuring 14.44 km(2). Estimated habitat-use Psi (SD) was found to be 0.82 (0.14). Our findings suggested that availability of agriculture land had the significant positive influence on the habitat-use of wolves. Other factors such as availability of water, scrubland, and wild prey (nilgai and chinkara) also had a positive effect on the habitat use of wolves, but it was not significant. Forest cover has a negative influence on the habitat use of wolves. This study is the first rigorous assessment of the Indian grey wolf habitat-use at the level of wildlife reserve with potential conservation value that can be applied to other areas in India.

AB  - Understanding of non-geniculate coralline algal (NGCA) diversity, prevalence, and distribution in the tropical western North Atlantic is currently limited by reliance on morphological and anatomical features that are inadequate for species identifications. Reef surveys from two study sites, the Florida Keys (Florida, USA) and Roat & aacute;n (Honduras), provided prevalence data for the main benthic organisms as well as relative abundance for NGCA genera. NGCA collected during these surveys and from additional sites and depths were identified using DNA sequences from two plastid genes, psbA and rbcL, and two nuclear genes, SSU and LSU, and supported by morphological and anatomical descriptions. Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses, along with species delimitation and genetic distance methods, resolved 11 genera within two orders. Within the Corallinales, the genera Dawsoniolithon, Porolithon and Spongites each had one species, Harveylithon and Lithophyllum had two, Titanoderma three, Hydrolithon four, Neogoniolithon eight, and an unknown genus within the subfamily Neogoniolithoideae had 11 putative species. Within the Hapalidiales, the genera Phymatolithon and Roseolithon each had one species. This study reinforces the inability of morphological and anatomical features to distinguish NGCA species in the tropical western North Atlantic, resulting in substantial underestimations of species richness and diversity.

AB  - Ungulate species have experienced severe declines over the past centuries through overharvesting and habitat loss. Even if many game species have recovered thanks to strict hunting regulation, the genome-wide impacts of overharvesting are still unclear. Here, we examine the temporal and geographical differences in genome-wide diversity in moose (Alces alces) over its whole range in Sweden by sequencing 87 modern and historical genomes. We found limited impact of the 1900s near-extinction event but local variation in inbreeding and load in modern populations, as well as suggestion of a risk of future reduction in genetic diversity and gene flow. Furthermore, we found candidate genes for local adaptation, and rapid temporal allele frequency shifts involving coding genes since the 1980s, possibly due to selective harvesting. Our results highlight that genomic changes potentially impacting fitness can occur over short time scales and underline the need to track both deleterious and selectively advantageous genomic variation.
   Collection and analysis of 200 years of Swedish moose genomes reveals regional differences in genetic load, candidate regions for positive selection and an overall limited impact on human-driven bottlenecks on today's moose population.

AB  - Overpopulation in conservation areas with large populations of elephants reduces the diversity of the thicket vegetation of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Monitoring species' specific impacts is a difficult task for reserves. This study investigates whether the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can be used to evaluate the health of thicket in the Addo Elephant National Park successfully. To achieve this, different browsing intensities of elephants were used to establish a gradient of the full range of utilisation levels on thicket. These were obtained at different distances from the nearest available water sources for Mesic and Valley Thicket types. NDVI values were correlated to an elephant utilisation gradient, which was, in turn, directly related to distance from a water source. The lowest NDVI values (< 0.2) were observed adjacent to watering holes where vegetation was completely degraded due to trampling by the daily congregation of animals. The highest NDVI values (> 0.5 representing the densest stands of thicket vegetation) were obtained at distances exceeding 7 km from a water source where elephant densities were the lowest within the park. NDVI values could, therefore, be used to identify and monitor gradients of elephant impact on the integrity of thicket.

AB  - The alternative prey hypothesis supposes that predators supported by a primary prey species will shift to consume alternative prey during a decrease in primary prey abundance. The hypothesis implies that during declines of one prey species, a predator modifies their behavior to exploit a secondary, or alternative, species. Despite occurring in many systems, the behavioral mechanisms (e.g., habitat selection) allowing predators to shift toward alternative prey during declines in the abundance of their primary prey are poorly understood. We evaluated habitat selection and use by a generalist predator with respect to two prey species during a dramatic decrease in the abundance of primary prey. Further, we evaluated how spatial variation in access to primary prey affected habitat selection, and assessed similarity and overlap between habitats used by each prey species. Coyotes (Canis latrans) exhibited decreasing selection for cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.; primary prey) during population decreases but did not shift habitat selection toward neonate mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; alternative prey). Use of rabbit habitat remained high even during historically low rabbit abundance, while mule deer habitat was used in proportion to its availability. Coyotes seemingly do not make large shifts in habitat selection toward alternative prey following spatial and temporal decreases in the abundance of primary prey, but instead, take advantage of habitat overlap to facilitate prey-switching behavior. Our work extends previous research conducted under the alternative prey hypothesis by explicitly evaluating the influence of habitat overlap between prey species and variation in access to prey habitat as factors affecting prey-switching behaviors in predators.

AB  - Prey populations significantly influence the distribution of top predators. The sika deer (Cervus nippon), a key prey species for the Amur tiger in Northeast China, plays a critical role in the recovery and dispersal of Amur tiger populations. Reintroduction is a pivotal strategy for restoring prey populations, but it presents challenges, especially in terms of adaptation to the natural environment during the natural training process before animals are released. In this study, we sampled six adult and six sub-adult sika deer and employed high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to investigate changes in gut microbial diversity, composition, and function during natural training. The results showed that adult sika deer had higher gut microbiota diversity compared to sub-adults. However, as natural training progressed, the gut microbial diversity in sub-adults approached that of adults. Additionally, beneficial, fiber-digesting bacteria associated with adaptation to the natural environment tended to increase during nature training in both adult and sub-adult sika deer, while pathogenic bacteria tended to decrease. We also compared the metabolic function of the gut microbiota in adult and sub-adult sika deer, which showed that the carbohydrate metabolic function of both adults and sub-adults decreased significantly with natural training, declining more rapidly in sub-adults. Conversely, the lipid metabolic function in sub-adults increased significantly with natural training. Overall, a period of nature training is necessary before reintroducing animals to their natural habitats, and sub-adult sika deer, in particular, exhibit greater adaptability to environmental changes as reflected by their gut microbiota dynamics. These findings offer valuable insights for the reintroduction of sika deer and other ungulates. We recommend incorporating natural training in reintroduction programs and prioritizing sub-adult animals for reintroduction.

AB  - Increased stress on coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs, seagrasses, kelp forests, and other habitats, can make them shift toward degraded, often algae-dominated or barren communities. This has already occurred in many places around the world, calling for new approaches to identify where such regime shifts may be triggered. Theoretical work predicts that the spatial structure of habitat-forming species should exhibit changes prior to regime shifts, such as an increase in spatial autocorrelation. However, extending this theory to marine systems requires theoretical models connecting field-supported ecological mechanisms to data and spatial patterns at relevant scales. To do so, we built a spatially explicit model of subtropical coral communities based on experiments and long-term datasets from Rapa Nui (Easter Island, Chile), to test whether spatial indicators could signal upcoming regime shifts in coral communities. Spatial indicators anticipated degradation of coral communities following increases in frequency of bleaching events or coral mortality. However, they were generally unable to signal shifts that followed herbivore loss, a widespread and well-researched source of degradation, likely because herbivory, despite being critical for the maintenance of corals, had comparatively little effect on their self-organization. Informative trends were found under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions but were determined by the type of direct neighbor interactions between corals, which remain relatively poorly documented. These inconsistencies show that while this approach is promising, its application to marine systems will require detailed information about the type of stressor and filling current gaps in our knowledge of interactions at play in coral communities.
   El actual aumento de las presiones sobre los ecosistemas costeros como los arrecifes de coral pueden conducir a un cambio repentino hacia un estado degradado, a menudo dominado por alga o roca desnuda. La elevada occurrencia de esta rapida degradacion a escala global destaca la necesidad de nuevas aproximaciones para la prediccion de tales cambios de estado. Los trabajos teoricos predicen que cambios en la estructura espacial de las especies creadoras de habitat deberian preceder los cambios repentinos de estado, por ejemplo con un aumento de la autocorrelacion espacial. Sin embargo, aplicar tal aproximacion requiere modelos que vinculen documentados mecanismos ecologicos con patrones especiales a las escalas adecuadas. En este trabajo proponemos un modelo espacialmente explicito de comunidades subtropicales de coral basado en trabajos a largo plazo en Rapa Nui (Isla de Pascua, Chile), para evaluar si los indicadores espaciales de cambios de estado repentinos pueden funcionar como indicadores tempranos en estos ecosistemas. Los resultados muestran que indicadores espaciales preceden la degradacion abrupta de comunidades de coral debido a un aumento de la mortalidad coralina, o de la frequencia de episodios de blanqueamiento. Sin embargo, no aparecen capaces de senalar cambios repentinos tras la perdida de herbivoros, un tipo de estres comun en comunidades coralinas. Se encontraron tendencias informativas tanto en condiciones de equilibrio como fuera de equilibrio, pero estas dependen del tipo de interaccion local entre corales, lo cual sigue poco documentado. Esta variacion en las tendencias destaca la necesidad de un conocimiento detallado tanto de las presiones como de las interacciones locales entre corals para llegar a una aplicacion informativa de los indicadores de cambios repentinos en ecosistemas marinos.

AB  - In mammals, the increase in cranial suture complexity throughout postnatal ontogeny has been linked to mechanical forces that load on the skull, including compression forces from mastication and the presence and use of cranial appendages in ungulates. Suture complexity, or interdigitation, provides a large absorptive capacity for mechanical stress. Deer are unique among ungulates by the presence of antlers only in males. In particular, Neotropical species exhibit a great diversity in terms of morphology, weight, sexual size dimorphism (absence or presence), and ecology. To evaluate the relationship of suture interdigitation with the mechanical stress produced by antlers, we quantified the complexity of the interfrontal and coronal sutures using fractal dimension (D) in six Neotropical deer species. Utilizing the occlusal tooth area (OTA) of the first upper molar as a proxy of age, we analyze changes of D throughout postnatal ontogeny and test for sexual dimorphism. In all species, ontogenetic series indicate an increase of complexity of both sutures with OTA. Overall, the species with a significant sexual dimorphism in body size and antlers with more than one tine show the more complex sutures, with the presence of greater interdigitation in adult males than in females, regardless of the existence of intraspecific fights during the rut. This is the first study where sexual dimorphism in cranial suture complexity in relation to the presence of antlers in deer is reported, suggesting the role of the interfrontal and coronal sutures on the dissipation of mechanical stress forces produced by the presence of antlers.

AB  - Historically, the excavation in the 1970s and publication in the 80s of Rhinoceros sinensis hayasakai (now known as Nesorhinus hayasakai) represents a milestone in vertebrate paleontology in Taiwan. However, the type materials (including 22 syntypes) are missing after the 1984 publication due to the lack of proper curation and management and reflect the undervalued vertebrate paleontology in Taiwan. Here we found five original specimens out of 22 in two collections ( National Taiwan University and Tainan City Zuojhen Fossil Park). The original 22 specimens were recovered from two geographical localities and geological horizons: northern (Taoyuan, Tunghsiao Formation: Early Pleistocene) and southern (Tainan, Chiting Formation: Middle Pleistocene) Taiwan. Our rediscovery of long-forgotten type materials emphasizes the importance of proper specimen curation. Similarly, by clarifying the historical issues and collecting more fossils, vertebrate paleontology from Taiwan promises to offer novel perspectives to understand the origin of modern biodiversity and large-scale extinctions along the eastern margin of Eurasia.

AB  - Simple Summary: The aim of this study was to investigate the adaptability of ten recently introduced European bison (Bison bonasus) in Lille Vildmose. Populations from Bornholm, Denmark, and Bialowie.za Forest, Poland, were used as a reference. We investigated the adaptability of the European bison through analysis of their dietary diversity and parasitic load during twelve months after translocation. From March 2021 to February 2022, fecal samples were collected from the herds. In Lille Vildmose, a significant difference in egg per gram feces (EPG) was observed for June when compared to the months during autumn and winter (October-February). Metabarcoding of 63 bison dung samples collected during March-September in Lille Vildmose identified eight species of nematodes in the gastrointestinal tract of the European bison, with Haemonchus contortus being most frequently observed. Furthermore, 79 plant taxa were identified in the diet of the European bison. The broadest diet was observed in March suggesting that the bison quickly adapted to their new habitat. Additionally, the results suggested a seasonal shift in their diet, with this being most apparent from March to April.
   For the purpose of nature management and species conservation, European bison (Bison bonasus) are being increasingly reintroduced into nature reserves across Europe. The aim of this study was to investigate European bison's adaptability to new areas through the study of their parasite-EPG (eggs per gram feces) and dietary diversity during twelve months after translocation. We compared the parasite-EPG from introduced European bison in Lille Vildmose, Denmark, with the parasite-EPG from populations from Bornholm, Denmark, and Bialowiez. a Forest, Poland. From March 2021 to February 2022, fecal samples were collected from three populations. Samples from Lille Vildmose were examined through flotation, sedimentation, the Baermann technique, and nanopore sequencing. Fecal samples from Bornholm and Bialowie.za were examined through flotation and sedimentation. Nanopore sequencing of DNA from 63 European bison's fecal samples collected during March-September in Lille Vildmose identified 8 species of nematodes within the digestive tract of the European bison, with Haemonchus contortus being the most frequently observed. In Lille Vildmose, a significantly higher excretion of nematode-EPG was observed during the summer period than in the spring, autumn, and winter. In addition, monthly differences in the excretion of nematode eggs were found, with this being significantly higher in June than in the months during autumn and winter (October-February). Significant differences in the nematode-EPG were only found between the excretion of nematode eggs in Bialowie.za Forest when compared to that of Lille Vildmose, with significantly higher excretion in Lille Vildmose (October-November). The results indicate that the development rates for nematodes may be affected by changes in temperature, with increasing temperatures speeding up their development time. Independent of this study design, wildlife vets together with the gamekeepers managing the herd found it necessary to treat the herd with antiparasitics for practical and animal welfare reasons in relation to translocation. Furthermore, 79 plant taxa were identified in the diet of the European bison. The broadest diet was observed in March suggesting that the European bison quickly adapted to their new habitat. The results suggest a seasonal shift in their diet, with this being most apparent from March to April.

AB  - Phytogenic mounds are usually formed under plants that intercept wind and runoff-borne sediment in semiarid environments. These mounds may affect the water source-sink relationship between vegetation patches and interspace patches. However, the impact of phytogenic mound on this relationship and the associated hydrological processes between patches are not well understood. This study aims to assess the effects of phytogenic mound on overland flow pathways, flow hydraulics and soil water redistribution at the patch scale. Upslope inflow experiments were conducted on three different patchy slopes ( Caragana korshinskii (CK), Hippophae rhamnoides (HR), and Artemisia gmelinil (AG)) in the Loess Plateau. Results indicated that, compared to soil physicochemical properties, the shape and size of the mounds played a more crucial role in the hydrological processes within the patches. Redundancy analysis and hierarchical partitioning analysis revealed that the most significant factors are mound height (11.16 %) and downslope angle of mound (13.77 %). Most mound parameters exhibited a significant negative correlation with water flowpath width. The effects of mound parameters on runoff hydraulics were highly complex and largely dependent on the flow pathways. The relationships between mound parameters and soil water variables were negative at the upper, middle and lower parts of the mound, but positive at the left part. Differences in soil water between before and after runoff experiments and soil water storage (SWS) at the upper and left parts of the mound were greater than at the middle and lower parts. Average SWS of AG (16.24 +/- 3.48 mm) with smaller mound size was found to be greater than that of HR (14.27 +/- 3.99 mm) and CK (13.25 +/- 2.24 mm). With increasing mound size, the spatial differences in SWS among the four parts increased. Consequently, the water source-sink relationship between the interspace patch surrounding the mound and the vegetation patch on the mound weakened as the mound size increased.

AB  - Interactions between herbivores and their predators are shaped, in part, by plant phenotype. Consequently, ubiquitous symbionts of plants below-ground, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), may influence interactions above-ground between predators and their prey by altering plant phenotype. However, the ecological relevance of below-ground organisms on predator-prey interactions under field conditions remains unclear.
   We assessed how AMF influence herbivore-predator interactions through a field experiment.
   We planted two milkweed species (Asclepias curassavica and Asclepias incarnata) provided with different amounts of AMF inoculum (zero, medium, and high) in a randomized block design. We added aphids to plants and reduced predator pressure weekly for 5 weeks to evaluate effects of AMF on predator recruitment. We then allowed herbivore-predator interactions to re-establish naturally for the remainder of the season to examine whether AMF-mediated variation in predator recruitment influenced the suppression of aphid populations.
   Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi availability in soils mediated interactions between predaceous aphid midge flies Aphidoletes aphidimyza and their aphid prey Aphis nerii, but the effects were plant species-specific. On A. curassavica, by mid-season, midges were recruited most strongly on plants under medium AMF availability and least on plants under high AMF availability. In contrast, each midge killed fewer aphids with increasing aphid density on medium AMF plants, but killed more aphids with increasing aphid density on high AMF plants. In combination, aphid mortality rates imposed by midges were greatest on medium AMF plants, followed by high and zero AMF plants. By comparison, on A. incarnata, the recruitment of midges was strongest on high AMF plants and weakest on medium AMF plants. AMF had no effect on the number of aphids killed per midge, relative to aphid density, so mortality rates of aphids imposed by midges mirrored recruitment. Rates of decline in aphid populations following predator recolonization were associated with midge densities, as well as lacewing and syrphid densities, which were unaffected by AMF availability. Therefore, the effects of AMF on aphid population decline were not a simple function of AMF-midge interactions.
   Our findings demonstrate that the availability of AMF in soils has pervasive, but complex, effects on predator-herbivore dynamics in the field.

AB  - Background Ancient tea plantations with an age over 100 years still reserved at Mengku Town in Lincang Region of Yunan Province, China. However, the characteristic of soil chemicophysical properties and microbial ecosystem in the ancient tea plantations and their correlation with tea-leaves chemical components remained unclear. Tea-leaves chemical components including free amino acids, phenolic compounds and purine alkaloids collected from modern and ancient tea plantations in five geographic sites (i.e. Bingdao, Baqishan, Banuo, Dongguo and Jiulong) were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), while their soil microbial community structure was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, respectively. Additionally, soil microbial quantity and chemicophysical properties including pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic matter (SOM), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available phosphorous (AP) and available potassium (AK) were determined in modern and ancient tea plantations. Results Tea-leaves chemical components, soil chemicophysical properties and microbial community structures including bacterial and fungal community abundance and diversity evaluated by Chao 1 and Shannon varied with geographic location and tea plantation type. Ancient tea plantations were observed to possess significantly (P < 0.05) higher free amino acids, gallic acid, caffeine and epigallocatechin (EGC) in tea-leaves, as well as soil fertility. The bacterial community structure kept stable, while fungal community abundance and diversity significantly (P < 0.05) increased in ancient tea plantation because of higher soil fertility and lower pH. The long-term plantation in natural cultivation way might significantly (P < 0.05) improve the abundances of Nitrospirota, Methylomirabilota, Ascomycota and Mortierellomycota phyla. Conclusions Due to the natural cultivation way, the ancient tea plantations still maintained relatively higher soil fertility and soil microbial ecosystem, which contributed to the sustainable development of tea-leaves with higher quality.

AB  - American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) is a globally desired medicinal plant that is becoming increasingly difficult to study due to harvest-induced rarity. Thus, this species' conservation could be greatly improved via species distribution models, making it a model organism for studying sampling bias. In an attempt to refine a state-derived distribution model for ginseng in Virginia, we conducted additional surveys in a biologically diverse yet under-sampled region of the state-the Cumberland Mountains-thereby increasing the number of documented ginseng occurrences in this region thirteen-fold (N-1 = 16, N-2 = 214). Our surveys resulted in the model predicting an increased probability of American ginseng occurrence not only statewide (mu(1) = 0.099, mu(2) = 0.104) but particularly so in the Cumberland Mountains (mu(1) = 0.170, mu(2) = 0.278), highlighting a consistently overlooked hotspot for biodiversity in Southern Appalachia. We suggest that more geographically balanced surveys and reduced overrepresentation of heavily protected and managed areas such as National Parks-in addition to heeding local knowledge-can be an effective method of mitigating geographic bias in predictions from species distribution models.

AB  - The Mycoplasma Immunoglobulin Binding/Protease (MIB-MIP) system is a candidate 'virulence factor present in multiple pathogenic species of the Mollicutes, including the fast-growing species Mycoplasma feriruminatoris. The MIB-MIP system cleaves the heavy chain of host immunoglobulins, hence affecting antigen-antibody interactions and potentially facilitating immune evasion. In this work, using -omics technologies and 5'RACE, we show that the four copies of the M. feriruminatoris MIB-MIP system have different expression levels and are transcribed as operons controlled by four different promoters. Individual MIB-MIP gene pairs of M. feriruminatoris and other Mollicutes were introduced in an engineered M. feriruminatoris strain devoid of MIB-MIP genes and were tested for their functionality using newly developed oriC-based plasmids. The two proteins are functionally expressed at the surface of M. feriruminatoris, which confirms the possibility to display large membrane-associated proteins in this bacterium. However, functional expression of heterologous MIB-MIP systems introduced in this engineered strain from phylogenetically distant porcine Mollicutes like Mesomycoplasma hyorhinis or Mesomycoplasma hyopneumoniae could not be achieved. Finally, since M. feriruminatoris is a candidate for biomedical applications such as drug delivery, we confirmed its safety in vivo in domestic goats, which are the closest livestock relatives to its native host the Alpine ibex.

AB  - For small ectotherm species, dealing with microclimatic variation during sensitive stages of their development is a critical component of their ecological interactions within and among different landscape settings. However, it is often unknown whether the use of habitats in different landscape settings may affect microclimatic conditions at the level of microhabitats (e.g., at host plants for herbivorous insects). As opposed to standard ecological monitoring experiments, we aim to identify the microclimatic variables that accurately represent the environment in which a small arthropod spends most of its life. As a case study, we selected grassy sites that corresponded to the microhabitat of grass-feeding insects in general, and larvae of the butterfly Pararge aegeria in particular, as this insect recently expanded its habitat use from forest (edges) to agricultural and urban environments. We tested the extent to which local microclimates and microclimatic buffering capacity differed between tufts of grass in forest and in two anthropogenic (i.e., agricultural and urban) landscape settings by measuring microclimatic variables with sensors at the level of the grasses. We compared temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) during an exceptionally warm and dry summer period with parallel data from weather stations and tested for differences between microclimatic profiles among the three landscape settings. Microclimatic conditions correspond only partly to variables based on weather station data. Differences are particularly significant for relative humidity and VPD, but not for day and night temperatures. Effects of canopy openness on the variability of microclimatic variables are landscape-specific. Host plants in agricultural settings experience strong microclimatic fluctuations and low short-term variability in VPD. In urban settings, urban heat island effects increase night temperature but also show microclimatic buffering effects similar to the ones in forest settings. Our findings stress the functional implications of landscape-specific microclimatic profiles at the appropriate organism-centered scale. We discuss the significance of such microclimatic profiles for ecological studies dealing with ectotherms under climate and land use change.

AB  - This review provides information on the influence of the ration composition, botanical composition of the pasture grass, and the type and quality of the silages on the release of methane emissions in livestock farming. Modeling rumen fermentation is the most important method to optimize feed utilization, ensure maximum microbial protein synthesis, increase productivity, and limit released methane emissions as a result of the digestion processes. There is a limited number of studies on the effect of feeding systems and feeding regimes, as well as the extent of methane emissions released from the digestion of sheep, goats, buffalo, and other ruminants. Feeding strategies need to be revised and developed, which should minimize ruminant energy loss and lead to increased productivity by reducing the number or activity of methanogens. Although methane production can be reduced by current strategies, due to the variety of adaptive mechanisms, they may only be effective temporarily. Therefore, further research is needed to study the effect of rations and rumen fermentation inhibitors with particular attention to methane production and changes in methanogenic microorganisms.

AB  - The winter tick (Dermacentor albipictus) is a cervid-targeting parasite that poses serious conservation concerns for moose (Alces alces) in North America. Described as a greater "enemy"of moose than wolves, bears, and cougars, winter tick parasitism causes moose to excessively groom during nutritionally limited periods, leading to lethal combinations of malnutrition and wound-infections. We construct two mathematical models using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by the empirical literature to simulate in silico the seasonal relationships between winter ticks and moose - ultimately producing the first application of mathematical models to this phenomenon. We then use our mathematical models to forecast the stability of this parasitic relationship as season lengths fluctuate due to climate change. Finally, we test the high -risk conservation hypothesis that limited, seasonal harvesting can improve moose population stability in the face of these challenges. Our model identifies the parameters (i.e. select vital rates) that give rise to cyclic and sustained epizootics and suggests that delayed first-frosts due to climate change pose a serious threat to maintaining moose populations, but that moderate winter and/or autumn harvesting strategies can reduce the threat of extirpation and stabilize population trajectories.

AB  - Sa similar to o Tome ' (Gulf of Guinea, Central Africa) is a 854 km2 tropical island that had a pivotal role in early European colonial expansion through the Atlantic between the 15th and 16th centuries. Historical sources suggest that native vegetation has been heavily impacted since human arrival (1470 CE) due to monoculture economies and the introduction of mammals and plants, some of which now have established wild populations. The Afro-montane forest of Sa similar to o Tome ', located above 800 m.a.sl., is particularly rich in endemic plant species and has remained relatively unaffected by direct human impacts. Here, we explore how environmental change influenced this forest through the study of a sedimentary sequence from the volcanic crater of Lagoa Ame ' lia (1340 m a.s.l.), a palustrine system located at the boundary between submontane (800-1400 m a.s.l.) and mist forest (above 1400 m a.s.l.). We used fossil pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, sedimentology and charcoal to determine forest dynamics from the Late Pleistocene to the present. From 14,000 to 12,500 cal yr BP the forest was dominated by taxa from higher altitudes, adapted to cooler and drier climates (e.g. Afrocarpus mannii trees and Psychotria nubicola). After 12,500 cal yr BP, a potential uphill migration was identified by an increase in taxa like the trees Symphonia globulifera and Craterispermum cerinanthum. From 11,200 cal yr BP through the rest of the Holocene taxa from lower altitudes became dominant (e.g. Prunus africana, Polyscias, and Sabicea), except at c. 8500 cal yr BP when rapid cooling led to forest opening. Charcoal showed that fires were frequent during the Late Pleis-tocene (14,000 to 11,200 cal yr BP), becoming rare during the Holocene until anthropogenic fires started at c. 220 cal yr BP. Other recent anthropogenic impacts detected in Lagoa Ame ' lia included the appearance of pollen of introduced plant species (e.g., Cestrum), and the increase in pollen of economically important species (Elaeis guineensis, Zea mays) and in fungal spores related to introduced herbivores. Our results reveal that climate changed the altitudinal distribution of the Afromontane forest in Sa similar to o Tome ' during the Late Pleistocene, as observed on the African continent, and that this ecosystem was also strongly impacted by human arrival, through fire, farming, and introduced species.

AB  - The present work was a part of pre conservation treatment investigation. Micro-Raman Spectroscopy has been used for the characterization of a specimen belonging to the frame of the Gilcrease Museum oil painting "White Man's Buffalo" by the artist Charles M. Russell. The main components of the Van Dyck Brown pigment (VDK) such as hematite (Fe2O3), alpha-goethite (alpha-FeOOH), amorphous carbon, and humic substances were identified by using two different excitation sources (514 and 633 nm). Traces of hematite and intercalated barite (BaSO4) were found and could come from the Armenian Bole that is commonly used in the water gilding technique of gold leaf. The use of a protein-organic binding medium such as rabbit-skin glue was indicated.

AB  - Predictive models can improve the efficiency of wildlife management by guiding actions at the local, landscape and regional scales. In recent decades, a vast range of modelling techniques have been developed to predict species distributions and patterns of population spread. However, data limitations often constrain the precision and biological realism of models, which make them less useful for supporting decision-making. Complex models can also be challenging to evaluate, and the results are often difficult to interpret for wildlife management practitioners. There is therefore a need to develop techniques that are appropriately robust, but also accessible to a range of end users. We developed a hybrid species distribution model that utilises commonly available presence-only distribution data and minimal demographic information to predict the spread of roe deer (Capreolus caprelous) in Great Britain. We take a novel approach to representing the environment in the model by constraining the size of habitat patches to the home-range area of an individual. Population dynamics are then simplified to a set of generic rules describing patch occupancy. The model is constructed and evaluated using data from a populated region (England and Scotland) and applied to predict regional-scale patterns of spread in a novel region (Wales). It is used to forecast the relative timing of colonisation events and identify important areas for targeted surveillance and management. The study demonstrates the utility of presence-only data for predicting the spread of animal species and describes a method of reducing model complexity while retaining important environmental detail and biological realism. Our modelling approach provides a much-needed opportunity for users without specialist expertise in computer coding to leverage limited data and make robust, easily interpretable predictions of spread to inform proactive population management.

AB  - Wildlife is known to serve as carriers and sources of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Due to their unrestricted movements and behaviors, they can spread antimicrobial resistant bacteria among livestock, humans, and the environment, thereby accelerating the dissemination of AMR. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is one of major concerns threatening human and animal health, yet transmission mechanisms at the wildlife-livestock interface are not well understood. Here, we investigated the mechanisms of ESBLproducing bacteria spreading across various hosts, including cattle, feral swine, and coyotes in the same habitat range, as well as from environmental samples over a two-year period. We report a notable prevalence and clonal dissemination of ESBL-producing E. coli in feral swine and coyotes, suggesting their persistence and adaptation within wildlife hosts. In addition, in silico studies showed that horizontal gene transfer, mediated by conjugative plasmids and insertion sequences elements, may play a key role in spreading the ESBL genes among these bacteria. Furthermore, the shared gut resistome of cattle and feral swine suggests the dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes at the wildlife-livestock interface. Taken together, our results suggest that feral swine may serve as a reservoir of ESBL-producing E. coli.

AB  - Dryland restoration is becoming increasingly challenging in arid and semiarid regions, such as in the southwestern United States, due to rapid land degradation, the spread of non-native species, and climate change. The development of strategies to enhance restoration of native species, particularly culturally and ecologically important native plants like Palmer's agave (Agave palmeri), is particularly critical in southeastern arid lands where scarce rainfall, herbivory, and invasive species dominance pose unique challenges to land management. In a large field experiment in southeastern Arizona, U.S.A., we assessed the utility of several management techniques to promote restoration and revegetation outcomes for Palmer's agave survival and growth, including protection from solar insolation and herbivory, and reduction in the competitiveness of Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana). We found that the combination of herbivory protection and shade resulted in the highest survival of planted agaves, while the shade treatment alone resulted in the largest agaves. In fact, our results suggest that dense Lehmann lovegrass cover protects agaves from direct sunlight and predation. If land managers are challenged by widespread Lehmann lovegrass, they can opt to mechanically reduce it. However, if population recovery of Palmer's agave is a priority and fire hazard is minimal, our work suggests that stakeholders concerned with population recovery of Palmer's agave can forgo removing existing vegetation and plant agaves in a matrix of (and/or under the canopy of) existing vegetation.

AB  - Background Nowadays, the restoration of abandoned mines has gained more attention due to its significance in vegetation recovery and ecological security Although some studies have indicated the sexual dimorphism of dioecious plants in response to the environmental adaptability, sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.), a diecious species widely used in afforestation and soil conservation, has not been studied the effects of sexual interactions on degraded ecosystem restoration;Methods In situ experiment, the physiological responses and rhizosphere soil changes of sea-buckthorn seedlings from different sex combinations were investigated in an abandoned Lead-Zinc mine;Results The two sexes from intra- and inter-sexual combinations showed differences in chlorophyll content, antioxidant activities, carbohydrates, proline, nutrient elements and zinc content in plants, and total organic carbon, nutrient elements and enzyme activities in rhizosphere soils. The males from the inter-sex combination had stronger antioxidant capacity and more osmoregulatory substances in plants and soil nitrogen contents as well as significantly higher activities of protease and urease with the increases of 139%, and 56%, respectively. In the intra-sex combination, compared with male plants, female plants showed higher contents of total N, Zn, soluble sugar and starch in the roots increased by 30.3%, 75%, 41.5% and 93.7% respectively, as well as higher soil available phosphate and potassium.Conclusions Sexual combinations significantly affected plant responses and soil properties of H. rhamnoides in the abandoned mine, male plants showed better adaptability than female plants in inter-sex combination, while females showed better rhizosphere responses than male plants in same-sex combination, which suggests that sexual interactions of dioecious species should be considered in the restoration of degraded ecosystem.

   In the current study, we investigated the prevalence rate of Oestrus ovis (O. ovis) larvae in heads of sheep and goats obtained from abattoirs in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was found that season did not have any significant effect on the characteristics of the larvae that affect sheep, except for the length of larva, for which those collected in spring differed from those collected in winter and autumn. In goats, the L3 instar number was significantly higher during summer. Oestrus ovis larvae were detected in sheep and goats by molecular analysis and they were most closely related to O. ovis larvae recovered from GenBank.
   Heads of sheep (n = 600) and goats (n = 800) slaughtered at Al-Aziziah Abattoir in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were inspected for the presence of O. ovis larvae (L). Heads were split along the longitudinal axes, and larvae (L1, L2, and L3) were gathered. The infestation rate was significantly higher in goats (44.5%; 356/800) than that in sheep (22.3%; 134/600). Out of the 151 collected larvae from sheep, 0% were L1, 1.3% were L2, and 98.7% were L3. Out of the total of 468 larvae from goats, 0% were L1, 1.2% were L2, and 98.8% were L3. The infestation rate was significantly higher in males than that in females. Myiasis-causing larvae collected from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, were authenticated as O. ovis, according to morphological characteristics. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of a partial fragment (600 bp) of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene further confirmed the species. Phylogenetic analysis based on the partial mtCOI gene sequence demonstrated that 23 unique sequences showed high similarity based on nucleotide pairs of O. ovis accessions retrieved from GenBank.

AB  - Background The Arunachali yak (Bos grunniens) is an important breed native to the northeastern Himalayas of India. Understanding its genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships with other bovine species is crucial for effective conservation and breeding strategies. This study investigates the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) D-loop region of Arunachali yak and compares it with other bovines to elucidate these relationships. Methods We collected blood samples from 18 Arunachali yak individuals and isolated genomic DNA. The partial mtDNA D-loop region was amplified using PCR and sequenced. Sequences were compared with those from Bos frontalis, Bos gaurus, Bos indicus, Bubalus bubalis, and Capra hircus available in GenBank. Phylogenetic relationships were assessed through Neighbor-Joining trees and median-joining networks. Genetic diversity indices and neutrality tests were applied to evaluate population genetic characteristics. Results Phylogenetic analysis identified three distinct clades, with Arunachali yak clustering closely with Bos indicus, and forming a separate branch from other bovine species. Median-joining networks revealed six haplogroups, with Arunachali yak uniquely representing Hap_3. Genetic diversity analysis showed no polymorphism within Arunachali yak, indicating very low genetic variation in the selected animal samples. AMOVA demonstrated significant genetic differentiation among populations (Fst = 0.30053, P < 0.001), with a substantial portion of variation occurring within populations. Conclusions The Arunachali yak exhibits a close genetic relationship with Bos indicus, reflecting recent divergence. The study underscores the distinct genetic profile of Arunachali yak and highlights its limited genetic variability. These findings enhance our understanding of bovine evolutionary relationships and emphasize the need for targeted conservation measures to preserve the genetic integrity of Arunachali yak.

AB  - Illegal hunting is a pervasive menace for many carnivore species in livestock-wildlife shared lands. Carnivore conservation under such socio-ecological context demands a comprehensive understanding of hunting drivers as well as alternatives for problem resolution. To contribute overcoming retaliation against carnivores we developed a holistic approach to address ranchers' non-compliance by understanding together: the context, magnitude, effectiveness, and motivations underlying illegal hunting. We surveyed sheep ranches across southern Chilean Patagonia where culpeo fox, chilla fox and puma cooccur and prey upon sheep. Sheep depredation occurred in 85 % ranches, accounting for 3.5 % of total holdings. Other sources of sheep mortality emerged equally sizeable or even higher than predation. Culpeo fox was the main predator across the region, and the most persecuted. Although hunting was significantly related to its perceived effectiveness, livestock guardian dogs conversely were asserted as the most effective tool for protecting the herds. Ranches where hunting is applied suffered significantly more predation than those where LGDs are deployed. Personal norms, perception towards carnivores, damage levels and ranchers' characteristics significantly related to hunting likelihood, yet their effects varied between species. Our approach advances in demonstrating clear opportunities for livestockcarnivores coexistence arising from a comprehensive understanding of the full context of the predationretaliation problem, and the multiple drivers of hunting in a species-by-species basis. Such opportunities lie fundamentally in acknowledging all sources of livestock loss, the encouragement to adopt LGDs, and fostering pro-carnivore attitudes based on the ecological benefits they provide in rangelands.

AB  - Brown bears are one of the few large carnivore species that survived the final Pleistocene wave of extinctions, perhaps in part owing to their wide ecological plasticity, variety of forms and polyphagia. Although the brown bear has become a well-studied system, many questions remain regarding the ecological, trophic and genetic diversity throughout their distribution. For example, knowledge about Asiatic Russian brown bears from the Late Pleistocene arctic tundra steppe, an ecosystem with no analogue in modern times, is sparse. Here we compared diets, morphometry and genetic affinities of Late Pleistocene bears based on broadly sampled subfossil remains from Asiatic Russia. Collecting sites included the Ural Mountains, the lower reaches of the Irtysh River, the upper reaches of the Ob River, the Altai Mountains of western Siberia, the Indigirka-Kolyma Lowlands and northwestern Chukotka. An extremely large bear specimen from the middle Indigirka (41 090 C-14 a BP) that lived in landscapes of treeless shrubs and wet meadows had a diet composed principally of large herbivorous mammals. A bear from western Chukotka (25 880 C-14 a BP), much smaller in size, had a diet close to that of modern brown bears. These two Late Pleistocene NE Russian brown bears may comprise a previously undiscovered, but extinct, genetic lineage. At the end of the Pleistocene (MIS 3 and MIS 2), the brown bears from the Ob River Valley and Urals lived in periglacial forest-steppes and those from the southern Urals in conditions of periglacial steppe. Brown bears from the Ob River valley and Urals, as well as ancient Altai bears, were characterized by a varied diet, from polyphagia to vegetarianism. In living brown bears, the proportions of different dietary foods are primarily related to food availability, which depends on the geographical zone and climatic conditions. We conclude that the same was true for Late Pleistocene brown bears of NE Siberia.

AB  - Agriculture is the main contributor to anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions. Therefore, mitigation options are urgently needed. In contrast to carbon dioxide, eddy covariance measurements of N2O and CH4 fluxes are still scarce, and thus little is known how environmental and biotic drivers as well as management affect the net N2O and CH4 exchange in grasslands. Thus, we investigated the most important drivers of net ecosystem N2O and CH4 fluxes in a temperate grassland, and continued a N2O mitigation experiment (increased clover proportion vs. fertilization with slurry). Random forest gap-filling models were able to capture intermittent emission peaks, performing better for half-hourly N2O than for CH4 fluxes. The unfertilized clover parcel (parcel B) continued to show lower N2O emissions (4.4 and 2.7 kg N2O-N ha � 1 yr � 1) compared to the fertilized parcel (parcel A; 6.9 and 5.9 kg N2O-N ha � 1 yr � 1) for 2019 and 2020, respectively. Tier 1 nitrogen (N) emission factors of 2.6 % and 1.9 % were observed at the fertilized parcel during the study period. Lower soil N concentrations indicated a lower N leaching risk at the clover than at the fertilized parcel. Annual CH4 emissions (including periods with sheep grazing) were similar from both parcels, and ranged from 25 to 38.5 kg CH4-C ha- 1. The most important drivers of both N2O and CH4 fluxes were lagged precipitation and water filled pore space, but also management (for N2O from parcel B; CH4 from parcel A). Biotic variables such as vegetation height and leaf area index were important predictors for the N2O exchange, while grazing temporarily increased CH4 emissions. Overall, reducing N fertilization and increasing the legume proportion were effective N2O reduction measures. In particular, adjusting N fertilization to plant N demands can help to avoid high N2O emissions from grasslands.

AB  - Homogenous spatial distribution of fermentation characteristics, local anaerobic conditions, and large amounts of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions are common problems in large-scale aerobic composting systems. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a semi-membrane covering on the spatial homogeneity and efficiency of fermentation in aerobic composting systems. In the covered group, the pile was covered with a semi-membrane, while in the non-covered group (control group), the pile was uncovered. The covered group entered the high-temperature period earlier and the spatial gradient difference in the group was smaller compared with the non-covered group. The moisture content loss ratio (5.91%) in the covered group was slower than that in the non-covered group (10.78%), and the covered group had a more homogeneous spatial distribution of water. The degradation rate of organic matter in the non-covered group (11.39%) was faster than that in the covered group (10.21%). The final germination index in the covered group (85.82%) was higher than that of the non-covered group (82.79%) and the spatial gradient difference in the covered group was smaller. Compared with the non-covered group, the oxygen consumption rate in the covered group was higher. The GHG emissions (by 30.36%) and power consumption in the covered group were reduced more significantly. The spatial microbial diversity of the non-covered group was greater compared with the covered group. This work shows that aerobic compost covered with a semi-membrane can improve the space homogeneity and efficiency of fermentation.

AB  - Nutrient recycling by marine megafauna is a key ecosystem service that has been disturbed by anthropogenic activity. While some hypotheses attribute Southern Ocean ecosystem restructuring to disruptions in micronutrient cycling after the elimination of two million great whales, there is little knowledge of trace metal lability in whale excrement. Here we measured high concentrations of dissolved iron and copper in five baleen whale fecal samples and characterized micromolar levels of organic metal-binding ligands as a proxy for their availability. The iron-ligand pool consisted of weakly-binding ligands and intermediate-binding ligands which enhanced iron stability and potential bioavailability. In comparison, 47 novel strongly-binding metallophores dominated copper-binding, curtailing its potential toxicity. These results illustrate how marine megafauna transform prey biomass into highly-labile micronutrients that they inject directly into the surface ocean, a mechanism whaling reduced by over 90%. Thus, the rapid restructuring of pelagic ecosystems through overharvesting may cause large biogeochemical feedbacks, altering primary productivity and carbon sequestration processes in the ocean.

AB  - The Wallaby-Cuvier Escarpment is a 700 km long, NW-SE trending linear geological feature that marks the southern boundary of the Cuvier Plateau. The Plateau rises from the adjacent 5500 m deep abyssal plain to a topographical high of 3000 m, approximately 450 km off the coast of Western Australian. In 2021, a 50 km long segment of the escarpment, covering an area of 1700 km2, was mapped by a high-resolution full-ocean depth multibeam echosounder. The habitat of the study area was explored during two video surveys undertaken using the crewed submersible Limiting Factor. Using Benthic Terrain Modeler (BTM), we classified the seabed into five geomorphological classes; flat plains, depressions, broad slopes, steep slopes, and crest. Video footage was used to classify habitat types and to record benthic megafauna occurrences which revealed highly heterogeneous and rapidly changing habitats. Six habitats were proposed based on the nature of geomorphology, slope, and sub-strate textures. A total of 202 organisms comprising 52 morphotaxa were scored during 198 min of survey that included at least eight phyla and 29 families. Despite a high number of morphotaxa, the total abundance of organisms is considered low which we attribute to oligotrophic surface waters. However, the distribution of organisms and their feeding strategies were well-aligned with habitat type. This study documents faunal dis-tribution and habitat diversity of a rarely explored type of deep-sea geomorphological feature, and in a largely unexplored area and depth of the Indian Ocean.

AB  - Conventional pyrolysis of agricultural wastes may emit considerable amounts of greenhouse gases that affect negatively the surrounding environment. A trial was done to capture the emitted gases through connecting a small water jacket with the pyrolysis unit. This plant was then used for production of biochars from two waste materials i.e. nutshell (NS-BC) and date-palm seed (DP-BC). The biochars manufactured from the aforementioned waste materials were then evaluated for their applicability vs pig manure (each amendment was applied at rates of 1, 2.5, 5 and 10%; w/w) to improve growth of Brassica chinensis grown on a sandy soil under greenhouse conditions. Collected liquefied smokes were also tested for enhancing germination of Lactuca sativa (lettuce) seeds using different concentrations (0%-5%, v/v). Results revealed that produced biochars decreased significantly soil pH where the highest reduction (14.30%) was occurred due to addition of 10% DP-BC. Moreover, NS-BC and DP-BC decreased significantly soil salinity from 0.21 dS m(-1) (control) to 0.13 and 0.14 dS m(-1), respectively; on the other hand, pig manure raised significantly soil salinity (10% application rate). Residual organic matter was higher in biochar amended soils than its corresponding values in pig manure treated ones. Generally, all investigated amendments improved considerably the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Moreover, they increased chlorophyll pigments in leaves and enhanced plant growth parameters upon their application at rates up to 2.5% with superiority for NS-BC versus DP-BC. Liquefied smoke also improved lettuce seed germination and growth, but only up to 0.25% application rate. Our results highlighted the success of the adopted technique for recycling NS and DP wastes and sustaining the environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Financial institutions are indirectly exposed to risks associated with the impacts and dependencies on natural capital and ecosystem services of the companies that they invest in, lend to, and insure. This is particularly true for banks lending to agriculture: a sector with both significant impacts and critical dependencies on natural capital. Bank lending is a vital source of new finance for the sector, which is essential to achieve sustainable intensification targets. Yet current credit decision-making practice is still based on conventional financial and management indicators, lacking any systematic assessment of natural capital risks, especially those associated with dependencies. Operationalising natural capital risk assessment requires practicable indicators and data to evaluate the most material natural capital risks for a given sub-sector and geography, but it is unclear to what extent these are available. We assess the practicability of natural capital dependency risk indicators and data sources for a critical case study of Australian sheep production. We find that at least moderately practicable indicators and data sources are available to assess the 11 major dependency risks that are material for this industry. Challenges remain in determining risk thresholds for most indicators, and quantifying risk impacts on profitability.

AB  - Warming climate and increasing desertification urge the identification of genes involved in heat and dehydration tolerance to better inform and target biodiversity conservation efforts. Comparisons among extant desert-adapted species can highlight parallel or convergent patterns of genome evolution through the identification of shared signatures of selection. We generate a chromosome-level genome assembly for the canyon mouse (Peromyscus crinitus) and test for a signature of parallel evolution by comparing signatures of selective sweeps across population-level genomic resequencing data from another congeneric desert specialist (Peromyscus eremicus) and a widely distributed habitat generalist (Peromyscus maniculatus), that may be locally adapted to arid conditions. We identify few shared candidate loci involved in desert adaptation and do not find support for a shared pattern of parallel evolution. Instead, we hypothesize divergent molecular mechanisms of desert adaptation among deer mice, potentially tied to species-specific historical demography, which may limit or enhance adaptation. We identify a number of candidate loci experiencing selective sweeps in the P. crinitus genome that are implicated in osmoregulation (Trypsin, Prostasin) and metabolic tuning (Kallikrein, eIF2-alpha kinase GCN2, APPL1/2), which may be important for accommodating hot and dry environmental conditions.

AB  - Pig farming plays an important role in the Brazilian economy, but it may trigger environmental issues, especially regarding the contamination of water resources. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the deposition of effluents from a pig farm on the phytoplankton assemblage composition and limnological parameters at different spots of the Divisa River - Fazenda Sao Luis, Aparecida de Minas/MG, Brazil. Over six months, we analyzed several variables at three different sampling sites on the surface of a coastal zone. We registered seventy-four phytoplankton genera, with Chlorophyceae and Cyanophyceae representing the most abundant classes, and Cryptophyceae and Cyanophyceae displaying the highest densities. The PERMANOVA analysis revealed dissimilarity between sampling sites P1 x P3 and P2 x P3, and the SIMPER analysis showed that Cryptophyceae and Cyanophyceae contributed to the observed dissimilarity. The correspondence canonical analysis (CCA) allowed the organization of sampled sites in three groups, in which the phytoplankton composition was distinguished according to trophic gradients. We concluded that pig farming effluents discharged without previous treatment into water bodies exert influences in both the phytoplankton community and the dynamics of its assemblage, by increasing total phosphorus and contributing for increased abundances of Cryptophyceae and Cyanophyceae in the last evaluated site (P3).

AB  - Climate change is responsible for increased frequency, intensity, and duration of extreme events, such as marine heatwaves (MHWs). Within eastern boundary current systems, MHWs have profound impacts on temperature-nutrient dynamics that drive primary productivity. Bull kelp (Nereocystis luetkeana) forests, a vital nearshore habitat, experienced unprecedented losses along 350km of coastline in northern California beginning in 2014 and continuing through 2019. These losses have had devastating consequences to northern California communities, economies, and fisheries. Using a suite of in situ and satellite-derived data, we demonstrate that the abrupt ecosystem shift initiated by a multi-year MHW was preceded by declines in keystone predator population densities. We show strong evidence that northern California kelp forests, while temporally dynamic, were historically resilient to fluctuating environmental conditions, even in the absence of key top predators, but that a series of coupled environmental and biological shifts between 2014 and 2016 resulted in the formation of a persistent, altered ecosystem state with low primary productivity. Based on our findings, we recommend the implementation of ecosystem-based and adaptive management strategies, such as (1) monitoring the status of key ecosystem attributes: kelp distribution and abundance, and densities of sea urchins and their predators, (2) developing management responses to threshold levels of these attributes, and (3) creating quantitative restoration suitability indices for informing kelp restoration efforts. Meredith McPherson et al. use a 34-year time series of satellite and in situ derived data to study bull kelp forests of northern California and demonstrate the ecosystem shifts following a marine heatwave event between 2014 and 2016. The results show that increased herbivory by sea urchins due to the loss of a predator reduced bull kelp forest resistance to fluctuating environmental conditions and point to the importance of ecosystem-based and adaptive management strategies.

AB  - Western North America is experiencing remarkable human population growth and land-use change. Irrigation and associated cultivation have led to colonization of urban-wildland interface (UWI) environments by mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and consequently, cougars (Puma concolor). In the wake of these changes, human-wildlife conflicts have increased in tandem with questions about long-term species conservation. To address these concerns, we fit 79 cougars with radio-telemetry collars in the Oquirrh Mountains near Salt Lake City, Utah (2002-2010). Our goal was to evaluate variation in cougar habitat selection, diet, and cause-specific mortality in a landscape dominated by urban, military, and industrial activities. We used radio-telemetry data in concert with Resource Selection Functions to address three hypotheses: (1) that cougars would select wildland over UWI land-uses; (2) prey composition would reflect differences in land-use; and (3) mortality would be predominantly human-caused. Cougars largely selected wildland habitats associated with seasonal mule deer presence, but contrary to expectation, they also selected habitats closer to urban and mined areas. Prey composition in the UWI did not differ from wildland habitats. Domestic ungulates represented only 2% of 540 recovered prey items and were found primarily in wildlands. Native ungulates comprised > 90% of the total kill, irrespective of season or land-use, suggesting that use of UWI habitats was linked to mule deer presence. Cougar mortality was disproportionately due to natural causes in wildlands, but individuals that died of human causes in UWI habitats were more likely to be inexperienced hunters, supporting young kittens, or compromised by physical handicaps. In general, presence of mule deer was the key predictor of cougar habitat use, even in this highly disturbed, anthropogenically altered landscape. As such, management designed to reduce conflict and ensure conservation will need to focus on urban deer, land-use planning, and targeted education campaigns to reduce food subsidies.

AB  - There are multiple ways in which fossil mammal communities can be used to reconstruct palaeoenvironments, but their relationship to paleoclimate conditions is less clear. In this study, we used a database of mammal species present at 167 modern localities across the tropical zone to construct niche profiles in which each taxon is assigned to a locomotor and diet behaviour category. Cluster analysis identifies significantly different groups of localities on the basis of these profiles, driven by their relative proportion of terrestrial herbivores, terrestrial animalivores, arboreal frugivores, and terrestrial frugivores. These groups are shown to vary according to climate, particularly to aspects of precipitation. We added three Plio-Pleistocene fossil localities to our analytical model to reconstruct their palaeoclimates based on their niche exploitation profiles: Esquina Blanca (Uqu & iacute;a Formation), Argentina, Laetoli, Tanzania, and Thum (Tham) Wimam Nakim (Snake Cave), Thailand. In accordance with independent studies, we show Esquina Blanca to have had a low rainfall and seasonal climate and Laetoli a moderately low rainfall climate. Thum Wimam Nakim falls in a moderate rainfall, moderate temperature climate cluster, but is likely to be a non-analog community.

AB  - Agromining describes the technique of growing plants to "mine" metals present in naturally enriched or contaminated soils. This technique comprises a series of processes including improvement of soil quality and production of biomass in order to obtain metals from the ash of harvested hyperaccumulators, which can be considered bio-ore. The aim of this study was to evaluate different agronomic practices for Ni agromining of the hyperaccumulator species Odontarrhena chalcidica by analyzing (i) Ni yields and (ii) parameters related to soil fertility, biodiversity, and Ni availability. We tested various types of fertilizers including farmyard manure and assessed cultivation of the hyperaccumulator in either continuous monoculture or cropping in rotation with the legume Vicia ervilia. A 2-year field experiment was established on typical ultramafic Vertisols in eastern Albania. The current study presents the results obtained in the second year of cultivation. After 2 years of agromining, fertilization with animal manure or rotation with the legume improved several soil properties and increased the yield of phytoextracted Ni by four and five times, respectively, relative to non-fertilized plots. The fertilization treatments did not affect the bacterial diversity indexes but significantly impacted the bacterial community structure. We suggest a fertilization regime including the application of pig or chicken manure (at doses equivalent to NPK 260:105:260; 260:390:260, respectively) every 2 years or the implementation of crop rotation with legumes as effective strategies for developing Ni agromining on Vertisols.

AB  - Simple Summary This study shows that automated computer vision techniques are highly effective when used to analyze images and to extract valuable information from them. We trained an algorithm with a set of 1600 images obtained from a study where wildlife approaching wild boar carcasses were monitored. This enabled the model to detect different classes of animals automatically in their natural environment with a mean average precision of 98.11%.Abstract Camera traps are becoming widely used for wildlife monitoring and management. However, manual analysis of the resulting image sets is labor-intensive, time-consuming and costly. This study shows that automated computer vision techniques can be extremely helpful in this regard, as they can rapidly and automatically extract valuable information from the images. Specific training with a set of 1600 images obtained from a study where wild animals approaching wild boar carcasses were monitored enabled the model to detect five different classes of animals automatically in their natural environment with a mean average precision of 98.11%, namely 'wild boar', 'fox', 'raccoon dog', 'deer' and 'bird'. In addition, sequences of images were automatically analyzed and the number of wild boar visits and respective group sizes were determined. This study may help to improve and speed up the monitoring of the potential spread of African swine fever virus in areas where wild boar are affected.

AB  - BACKGROUND A high dose/refuge combination is the main tactic recommended for mitigating resistance selection of target herbivore species in crops expressing insecticidal proteins of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (i.e. Bt proteins). The tactic consists of the simultaneous use of Bt crops expressing high levels of the Bt protein associated with neighboring areas of refuge of the same non-Bt crop species. Nonetheless, the approach faces controversy regarding its effectiveness and scale of adoption, at least in some regions. One concern focuses on its potential impact on the arthropod community, including its short-term and spatially dependent impact considering the likely biota spillover effect between Bt and non-Bt neighboring areas. Thus, the eventual spillover of Bt maize targeted and non-targeted arthropods was surveyed along transects extending from the refuge border to the center of the Bt maize area.
   RESULTS Arthropods were collected throughout the maize vegetative and reproductive stages. A total of 85 arthropod species were collected, but their richness and abundance did not vary with distance from the refuge. By contrast, cultivation season played a significant role in distinguishing the arthropod communities. Refuge distance from the sampling point within Bt-fields did not significantly affect the food web metrics, unlike season, which affected the number of nodes integrating each food web. Winter maize cultivation exhibited higher arthropod diversity and combined values of species numeric abundance and biomass at each trophic level.
   CONCLUSIONS No arthropod spillover was evident between the refuge edge and Bt maize, adding further controversy to the tactic currently subjected to lower usage in the region with a disputed cost-benefit relationship, because not even the target and its interdependent species were affected.

AB  - In this study, the effects of covering the compost pile with a semi-permeable membrane in combination with intermittent aeration on the gas emissions during aerobic composting from the solid fraction of dairy manure at industrial scale were investigated. A large-scale composting experiment was carried out to compare a membrane-covered (CT) group with a control (CK) group. The results indicated that the CT group could maintain a suitable aerobic and positive micro-pressure environment. The carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ammonia emissions outside the membrane during the aeration interval were reduced by 64.23%, 70.07%, 54.87%, and 11.32%, respectively, compared with that inside the membrane. It was also determined that the methane and nitrous oxide emissions from the CT group were reduced by 99.89% and 60.48% relative to the CK group, confirming that the combined process represented a novel strategy for reducing gas emissions during dairy manure composting.

AB  - Wide-ranging carnivores experience tradeoffs between dynamic resource availabilities and heterogeneous risks from humans, with consequences for their ecological function and conservation outcomes. Yet, research investigating these tradeoffs across large carnivore distributions is rare. We assessed how resource availability and anthropogenic risks influence the strength of lion (Panthera leo) responses to disturbance using data from 31 sites across lions' contemporary range. Lions avoided human disturbance at over two-thirds of sites, though their responses varied depending on site-level characteristics. Lions were more likely to exploit human-dominated landscapes where resources were limited, indicating that resource limitation can outweigh anthropogenic risks and might exacerbate human-carnivore conflict. Lions also avoided human impacts by increasing their nocturnal activity more often at sites with higher production of cattle. The combined effects of expanding human impacts and environmental change threaten to simultaneously downgrade the ecological function of carnivores and intensify human-carnivore conflicts, escalating extinction risks for many species.
   A meta-analysis performed with data from 31 study sites indicate that lions reduce their space use and increase nocturnal activity where human disturbance is high, but less so when resources are scarce.

AB  - Hybridization of mule deer (Oclocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (O. virgin(anus) appears to be a semi-regular occurrence in western North America. Previous studies confirmed the presence of hybrids in a variety of sympatric habitats, but their developing molecular resources limited identification to the earliest, most admixed generations. For this reason, estimates of hybrid production in wild populations often rely on anecdotal reports. As well, white-tailed deer populations' continued encroachment into historically mule deer-occupied habitats due to changes in land use, habitat homogenization, and a warming climate may increase opportunities for interspecific encounters. We sought to quantify the prevalence and extent of hybrid deer in the prairies of western Canada using a SNP assay with enhanced discriminating power. By updating the available molecular resources, we sought to identify and characterize previously cryptic introgression. We also investigated the influence of various parameters on hybridity by way of logistic regression. We observed overall hybridization rates of similar to 1.0%, slightly lower than that reported by previous studies, and found white-tailed-like hybrids to be more common than their mule deer-like counterparts. Here, we build upon past studies of hybridization in North American deer by increasing hybrid detection power, expanding sample sizes, demonstrating a new molecular resource applicable to future research and observing asymmetrical directionality of introgression.

AB  - In a time of global change, having an understanding of the nature of biotic and abiotic factors that drive a species' range may be the sharpest tool in the toolbox of conservation and management of threatened species. However, such information are lacking for most tropical and epiphytic species due to the complexity of life history, the roles of stochastic events, and the diversity of habitat across the span of a distribution. In this study, we conducted repeated census across the core and peripheral range of Trichocentrum undulatum, a threatened orchid that is found throughout the island of Cuba (species core range) and southern Florida (the northern peripheral range). We used demographic matrix modeling and stochastic simulations to investigate the impacts of herbivory, hurricanes, and logging (in Cuba) on projected population growth rates (lambda and lambda(s)) among sites. Our study indicates that the Florida population is under high extinction risk and most populations in the core range show less interannual variability, but, with the exception of one population, are also in decline. The peripheral population experienced higher herbivory damage than did the core populations, by a native inflorescence-crippling fly, Melanagromyza miamensis, and an invasive, mortality-triggered scale, Diaspis boisduvalii. The latter was found in the Florida population only. Hurricanes increased levels of mortality and had a negative effect on lambda. However, lambda increased following hurricane events due to increased recruitment and decreased herbivory. Life table response experiments suggest that higher adult survival was the largest contributor to the higher lambda observed in the growing Cuba populations, as compared with the population in Florida. Logging simulations in Cuba indicate that populations can maintain stability only if selective logging of host trees occurs at low frequency. Reintroduction of the species in its northern peripheral habitat is needed to ameliorate the threats from sea-level rise and invasive herbivorous insects to secure the current species' northern, continental range margin. Our study exhibits how vital rates and ecological interactions vary across a species distribution and respond under differing stochastic events.

AB  - This case-control study sought to confirm and investigate in more depth protective associations previously found of bovine (cattle and water buffalo) ownership with reduced risk of both pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in humans. The study recruited male and female PTB cases from a diagnostic centre and a frequency-matched community-based control group in Kaski District, Nepal. Controls were tested for LTBI status and a separate nested case-control study was conducted based on LTBI status. Data were collected on participant household animal ownership. Using logistic regression, animal ownership was investigated for associations with both PTB and LTBI. Data were obtained from 570 PTB cases and 1,224 controls, the latter group providing 396 LTBI-positive and 692 LTBI-negative subjects. Results provided evidence of decreased odds of both PTB and LTBI positivity associated with owning bovines. The evidence was strongest for protection against infection, rather than activation of infection to PTB. Effects were strongest in women, who usually manage the animals in Nepal, and there were exposure-response relationships with numbers of bovines owned. Results suggest that exposure to bovines is protective against LTBI and PTB. A possible mechanism involves boosting the effect of BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccination, particularly in protecting against tuberculous infection. Additional studies with more extensive data collection are needed to confirm the observed associations.

AB  - Given the scale of the current biodiversity loss, setting conservation priorities is essential to direct scarce resources to where they will be most effective. Many prioritization schemes have been described by using a wide range of criteria that vary across taxonomic groups, spatial scales, and ecological, socio-economic, and governance contexts. Currently, there is no single prioritization process applicable to all situations, nor is there a list of agreed metrics. The IUCN SSC Antelope Specialist Group and the Small Mammal Specialist Group recently performed species prioritization exercises based on a similar approach. The variables used included biological, socio-political, and feasibility criteria. The two exercises contained both common and some unique variables, arranged in a matrix for the target species (29 threatened antelopes and 19 critically endangered Mexican small mammals, respectively). The ASG framework provided a global summary of the antelope priorities, which can be updated and adapted to the national level. The SMSG matrix was applied in a regional workshop to select species for which the likelihood of implementing conservation actions was high and led to conservation action plans being developed for six species. The framework we jointly developed in theory can be applied to other taxa, certainly all mammals and perhaps most vertebrates.

AB  - The correlates of mammal species richness and community associations along elevation gradients have resulted in conflicting results within tropical systems. We surveyed the terrestrial mammal and gallinaceous bird community (>200 g body size) along transects at 4 mountain sites in Malaysian Borneo using camera traps to assess structuring of the mammal community along the elevation gradient. Between 2015 and 2021, we surveyed Bukit Lanjak (elevation 1,300 m) in Sarawak (Lanjak Entimau Wildlife Sanctuary; LEWS) and Mts. Kinabalu, Tambuyukon, and Magdalena (up to 2,400 m) in Sabah, with a total sample effort of 20,600 camera nights. We detected 48 species of mammals and 9 species of large terrestrial birds. There was mostly a common species pool across the sites, with only 9 species detected solely in LEWS and 5 species only in Sabah. Over our limited elevation range, no species were detected across the entire elevation range and no common species were confined to the highest elevation sites in Sabah or LEWS (>1,000 m). A species richness curve for each location indicated a slight peak at similar to 1,000 m for LEWS, but the mid-elevation peak was not evident at Sabah. The individual response curves of relative abundance to the elevation gradient for 15 species with sufficient detections were similar across sites (1 exception-Malaysian Porcupine) with 6 species showing no correlation with elevation, while 4 species increased and 4 species decreased in detections with elevation. A multivariate analysis of species detections found herbivores at lower elevations and mesocarnivores at higher elevations, while species of the same foraging guilds differed in body size at the same elevation. As opposed to studies focused on smaller vertebrate species (i.e., rodents, songbirds), larger mammal and terrestrial bird communities in these mountains did not form unique communities along the elevation gradient but did structure according to the functional traits of foraging guilds and body size.

AB  - Resource pulses are brief and temporary events of high resource availability in an ecosystem, such as water, nutrients, or food, which can significantly affect population dynamics and species interactions. This study examined the predation of artificial duck nests in the Tablas de Daimiel National Park, aiming to identify predator species and assess their impact on the availability of these resources. To achieve this, 30 artificial nests containing six eggs each were placed and monitored for 28 days using camera traps. The analysis of the obtained images allowed for the identification of predator species, while a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to evaluate differences in predation times among species. The results revealed that 73.3% of the nests were predated, with partial predation occurring in 20% of the cases. Identified predator species included the red fox, wild boar, Eurasian badger, Egyptian mongoose, magpie, and western marsh harrier. The red fox and wild boar were the fastest predators to locate and consume the nests, with average predation times of 3.6 and 7.7 days, respectively, while the magpie took longer (11.9 days). Nocturnal mammals, such as the wild boar and badger, primarily predated at night, while diurnal birds and mammals acted during the day. These findings highlight the need to consider predator temporal activity and resource availability in the design of conservation strategies.

AB  - As the climate changes, populations must overcome more frequent and more extreme exposure to a wide range of stressors. However, our knowledge of how locally-adapted populations respond to combinations of stressors remains incomplete. Recent studies show that elevated temperatures can interact with nutrition to accentuate the negative effects of a poor diet, suggesting higher costs of nutritional stress when individuals experience temperatures outside of their locally-adapted conditions. This can translate into reduced nutrient optima under thermal stress in life-history trait landscapes, a hypothesis that remains to be tested. Here, we used the Geometric Framework for Nutrition to test this hypothesis using two locally-adapted populations of Drosophila melanogaster from opposing ends of a well-characterised adaptive gradient along the east coast of Australia (tropical vs. temperate). We found that the negative effects of nutritional stress were significantly greater in the tropical population under warmer temperatures. In contrast, the temperate population was able to utilise a broader nutritional space to maintain high viability and a large wing size across the range of fluctuating temperatures. Our findings reveal the ways in which local adaptation impacts how populations navigate and explore the nutritional space in response to increasingly stressful thermal conditions. These data suggest that certain populations may be better able to cope with increasingly stressful and variable environments, while others may be more vulnerable to local extinctions.

AB  - Insect herbivory influences ecosystem nutrient cycling and energy flow, and is sensitive to global change drivers. Nitrogen (N) enrichment would stimulate grassland insect herbivory by increasing insect abundance and changing plant community. However, it remains unknown whether such impacts of N enrichment would depend on grassland management practices, such as mowing. With a field experiment in temperate steppe after eight years treatments, we examined the role of mowing in mediating the impacts of N addition on insect herbivory at both species and community levels. Nitrogen addition significantly increased insect herbivory at the community level from 2.55 % to 9.36 %, while mowing decreased that from 9.49 % to 2.42 %. The positive impacts of N addition on herbivory were much stronger under unmown than mown condition, resulting in a significant interaction between N addition and mowing. Nitrogen addition enhanced herbivory by reducing plant C:N and increasing insect abundance. In contrast, mowing showed opposing effects on those two variables, and consequently led to lower herbivory. Mowing reduced the magnitude of N-induced herbivory in grasslands. Our results demonstrate that grassland management status should be given full consideration when assessing the impacts of eutrophication on insect-mediated transfer of nutrients and energy between plant and insect communities.

AB  - Globally, sewage water is considered a cheap and effective alternative source of irrigation and nutrient supplement. For example, in Faisalabad, Pakistan untreated sewage water loaded with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) is being routinely used to grow fodder crops in the peri-urban areas, where PTEs accumulate at different trophic levels and contaminate the food chain. Trophic transfer, bioaccumulation, and biomagnification of hazardous metals in food chains had toxic implications for human health. Currently, the major concern is associated with the consumption of PTEs contaminated fodder by animals and the subsequent translocation into humans via consumption of milk and meat from these animals. This study thus analyzed the concentration of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in sewage water, sewage irrigated soil, fodder is grown on such soils and the milk of cows and buffalos to calculate the transfer through water and fodder to animal milk. Overall, concentrations and bioaccumulation factors of Cd and Cu in buffalo milk were higher than the cow milk, whereas it was inverse for the concentration of Zn. Non-significant difference in the bioaccumulation factor for Pb in both buffalo and cow milk was observed. Calculation of the estimated daily intake indicated that there was no health risk associated with the consumption of tested milk samples. However, given the widespread exposure of infants to milk, continuous monitoring of milk quality is recommended to preclude a child's exposure to elevated levels of PTEs.

AB  - Encounters between flowers and invertebrates are key events for the functioning of tropical forests. Assessing the structure of networks composed of the interactions between those partners leads to a better understanding of ecosystem functioning and the effects of environmental factors on ecological processes. Gathering such data is, however, costly and time-consuming, especially in the highly diverse tropics. We aimed to provide a comprehensive repository of available flower-invertebrate interaction information for the Atlantic Forest, a South American tropical forest domain. Data were obtained from published works and "gray literature, " such as theses and dissertations, as well as self-reports by co-authors. The data set has similar to 18,000 interaction records forming 482 networks, each containing between one and 1061 interaction links. Each network was sampled for about 200 h or less, with few exceptions. A total of 641 plant genera within 136 different families and 39 orders were reported, with the most abundant and rich families being Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Rubiaceae. Invertebrates interacting with these plants were all arthropods from 10 orders, 129 families, and 581 genera, comprising 2419 morphotypes (including 988 named species). Hymenoptera was the most abundant and diverse order, with at least six times more records than the second-ranked order (Lepidoptera). The complete data set shows Hymenoptera interacting with all plant orders and also shows Diptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera to be important nodes. Among plants, Asterales and Fabales had the highest number of interactions. The best sampled environment was forest (similar to 8000 records), followed by pastures and crops. Savanna, grasslands, and urban environments (among others) were also reported, indicating a wide range of approaches dedicated to collecting flower-invertebrate interaction data in the Atlantic Forest domain. Nevertheless, most reported data were from forest understory or lower strata, indicating a knowledge gap about flower-invertebrate interactions at the canopy. Also, access to remote regions remains a limitation, generating sampling bias across the geographical range of the Atlantic Forest. Future studies in these continuous and hard-to-access forested areas will yield important new information regarding the interactions between flowers and invertebrates in the Atlantic Forest. There are no copyright restrictions on the data set. Please cite this data paper if the data are used in publications and teaching events.

AB  - Environmental practitioners must understand those they collaborate with to implement programs that are both socially and ecologically effective. Practitioners who understand decision-makers' perspectives are better able to collaborate to lower political, financial, and cultural obstacles. In this study, we surveyed decision-makers involved with a voluntary environmental program in Iowa, USA. Iowa counties can choose to manage their roadside vegetation using an ecological approach, called integrated roadside vegetation management. Key decision-makers who decide whether a county has a roadside program are the county board of supervisors and the county conservation board. We used a mixed-mode design to survey the conservation board directors and chairs of the board of supervisors in each county. Our main goals were to understand the decision-makers' perceived benefits and barriers to having a roadside program in their counties, as well as the key factors influencing their decisions about roadside vegetation management. Safety, maintenance cost savings, and erosion control were the main factors that influenced decision-making, while pollinators and other wildlife received the least consideration. However, decision-makers in counties with a roadside vegetation manager were more influenced by pollinators and other wildlife compared to their counterparts in counties without a roadside vegetation manager. The main barriers to having a program include a lack of resources or other concerns being a higher priority. Emphasizing safety, cost savings, and erosion control benefits of roadside programs, and identifying ways to lower startup costs may increase buy-in with county decision-makers.

AB  - Aerial surveys are increasingly used for assessing the presence and abundance of many large faunal species. However, detection rates often suffer significant sightability errors. Using sensors that capture thermal infrared can sometimes improve the detectability of fauna by increasing the contrast of target animals against their surrounds. However, there are several situations where this does not work well. Submerged fauna in marine environments are one example, and where the detection error can be substantial. To identify what wavelength selection might enhance detectability rates beyond standard cameras, we used a drone-based hyperspectral sensor to measure the reflectance of 64 animals and their corresponding surrounds. Fauna included white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus), and various other species of ray (Rhinoptera neglecta, Aetobatus narinari, Rhynchobatus australiae) and fish (Seriola lalandi). Data were analysed using Generalized Additive Mixed-Models (GAMM) to compare the difference in spectral reflectance between fauna and their surrounds. The GAMMs showed little difference between submerged fauna groups, but indicated that a band of wavelengths between 514 and 554 nm provided the greatest contrast between fauna and their surrounding backgrounds. This was also consistent across the range of environmental conditions. We contend that restricting the spectral input to a standard high-resolution camera, or focusing on the channels that accentuate the green colours in post-processing, will likely result in increased accuracy in the detection of submerged fauna. This approach may also be applied to fauna surveys in other landscapes, particularly where the use of thermal sensors is not appropriate.

AB  - Among factors that threaten wild populations of African megafauna, wildlife trade has gained prominence as a global policy issue, with concerted international campaigns aiming to influence the trade of species such as elephants, rhinos and lions. Trade policy is strongly contested, confounding attempts to develop coherent approaches across jurisdictions and through international mechanisms such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This undermines conservation efforts. Understanding the drivers of such conflict may help to address this problem. Scholars of political science increasingly recognise the power of ideas as drivers within policy processes. Guided by this literature, we developed an analytical framework and conducted a thematic analysis to examine the ideas driving wildlife trade policy conflict. Our nested case study approach examined debates over trade policy toward African elephants, rhinos and lions at two levels: the international policy arena of CITES and within a single country, South Africa. Informed by earlier literature, we tracked the evolution of international trade policy debates over a 4-year period (2016-2019) and analysed submissions to a national policy review process in South Africa that took place during 2020. During the study period, state and non-state actors contributed to vigorous trade policy debates within seven key thematic issues across the case study species. Arguments were driven by both cognitive ideas, which specify cause-and-effect relationships, and normative ideas, which are values-based and especially salient elements of anti-trade stances. Fusing these cognitive and normative ideational elements, we identified three distinct overarching narratives relating to wildlife trade policy. These three narratives align with broader environmental policy and political narratives and elucidate inherent tensions within the CITES arena. They also reveal differing ethical interpretations and perceptions of risk and precaution. Policy implications. Wildlife trade policy conflict is driven at least in part by competing ideological visions, which may be entrenched by the CITES Appendix listing system. The structural role of CITES in perpetuating this polarisation-and the consequences thereof-warrants further research.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Chondrichthyans form an important part of marine food webs as top predators and mesopredators. However, little is known about chondrichthyans in Namibian waters and the roles they play in ecosystem function. During efforts to disentangle Cape fur seals Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus from fishing gear or plastic debris, 11 incidents of seals impaled by the dorsal spines of St Josephs Callorhinchus capensis (order Chimaeriformes) were recorded. These observations overlapped with mass die-offs of the seals owing to food shortages, as indicated by large numbers of emaciated seals and widespread miscarriages of seal foetuses. This suggests that the St Joseph is not a desirable prey species for Cape fur seals, though this chimaera may provide a source of food, especially when preferred prey species are unavailable. This is the first published record of Cape fur seals feeding on chondrichthyans in Namibian waters. Documenting these types of food-web linkages between pinnipeds and chondrichthyans will allow for a better understanding of how impacts on their populations may more broadly affect Namibia's marine ecosystems.

AB  - Context. Livestock depredation is a major medium-and large-carnivore conservation challenge around the globe, causing a substantial economic loss to small-scale agricultural communities in the Wolaita Highlands, southern Ethiopia, and often leading to retaliatory killing. In the Wolaita Highlands, southern Ethiopia, livestock depredation rates are increasing because of conversion of wild habitats into grazing lands. Various studies have examined the interactions between humans and carnivores in time and space and the prey preference of carnivores with regard to livestock type. Aim. This study aimed to assess livestock depredation by large carnivores in time, space, season and prey preference by carnivores and economic losses by farmers with regard to livestock depredation in the highlands of Wolaita, southern Ethiopia. Methods. In total, 384 herders who are heads of households were interviewed and an information-theoretic approach was used to analyse the factors influencing self-reported livestock losses to spotted hyena, leopards and jackal. Key results. The economic loss associated with livestock depredation by spotted hyena, leopard and jackal amounted to an average loss of US$33.3 per herder and year. We found that spotted hyena had a preference for sheep, goat and donkey; leopard for goat and sheep; and jackal for goat and poultry. Livestock depredations by the three carnivores were mainly during the night-time and more severe during the dry season. Conclusion. The number of livestock owned by a household, night-time, dry season and the availability and preferences of the type of livestock by carnivores had the strongest influence on livestock losses. Implications. To mitigate wild carnivore conflicts in the highlands of Wolaita, southern Ethiopia, we make recommendations that the farmers should be trained and equipped in order to build a better wild-carnivore management strategies and to scale up their mitigating strategies.

AB  - Pituophis ruthveni (Louisiana Pine Snake) occurs in parts of western Louisiana and eastern Texas and was recently listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. It is considered a diet specialist because it mostly feeds upon Geomys breviceps (Baird's Pocket Gopher). which make up similar to 75% of its estimated total prey biomass. Diet specialization is rare among vertebrates. One factor that can influence dietary diversity is the availability and abundance of prey items. To gain more insight on the Louisiana Pine Snake's diet, we sampled terrestrial and subterranean small mammals across 3 study sites within the range of this snake species in Louisiana to determine their relative abundance and availability. We compared these results to diet studies of the Louisiana Pine Snake to determine if any small mammal species were consumed more often than expected. The total of 59 small mammals captured consisted of Baird's Pocket Gopher, Sigmodon hispidus (Hispid Cotton Rat), Peromyscus spp. (deer mice), and Reithrodontomys spp. (harvest mice). Baird's Pocket Gopher had significantly higher relative abundances and biomass than terrestrial small mammals. When compared to proportions of actual consumed prey species, the Louisiana Pine Snake preyed upon Baird's Pocket Gopher significantly more than expected based on their availability in the environment. Finally, Chesson's prey selection index determined that the Louisiana Pine Snake positively selected Baird's Pocket Gopher, while the other species were either randomly or negatively selected. The results of this research provide some insight into the factors affecting the diet choices of the Louisiana Pine Snake.

AB  - The co-evolutionary arms race between herbivores and plants forces plants to evolve protection strategies that reduce the palatability of the plant modules attacked by the herbivores. These characteristics of traits have consequences for both the survival of plant individuals and the composition of plant communities. Thus, correlating traits of for instance leaves with herbivory is an important step toward understanding the dynamics of plant populations and communities. Traits can either be measured using conventional lab methods or recently developed spectral sensing techniques. We examined whether leaf traits of trees are related to herbivory in a multispecies approach. Furthermore, we explored whether leaf traits characterized by spectral sensing provide similar relations to herbivory as lab-based leaf traits. We established nine 1-ha square plots evenly distributed over three different forest types in Ecuadorian tropical montane rainforests where we estimated herbivory as the leaf area loss (in square centimeters) of 20 (+/- 5) leaves sampled from the canopies of 380 tree individuals belonging to 51 tree species (7 +/- 1 individuals/species) using lab- and spectral-sensing-based methods. For each methodological approach, we ran 100 linear mixed-effects models with all respective leaf traits as predictor and herbivory as response variables for data subsets containing one randomly selected tree individual of each species to estimate the range of the regression coefficients for each trait. Automated stepwise backward selections determined the frequency of each trait having an important influence on herbivory. We found no clear relations between leaf traits and herbivory for neither lab- nor spectral-sensing-based traits. A nested variance component analysis demonstrated that the observed variability was mainly due to the variation in trait concentrations between tree individuals of a species. Our results suggest that snapshot data lead to a mismatch between herbivory and the concentrations of traits during the peak of herbivory. Another explanation could be that environmental conditions or processes along the food web are more important in structuring herbivory than leaf traits.

AB  - State of the art Theory predicts that herbivore pressure should be weaker on islands than on the mainland, owing to lower herbivore abundance and diversity because of dispersal constraints and environmental filtering. As a result, plants on islands should invest less in defences against herbivory. Although early empirical studies supported these predictions, recent systematic island-mainland comparisons have questioned this paradigm, with some studies reporting either no difference between islands and mainland or higher herbivory and plant defences on islands. Current data therefore appear to be unsupportive of predictions on insularity effects on plant-herbivore interactions, calling for more research to reassess predictions and to test underlying mechanisms for observed patterns. Research opportunities To meet this challenge, a renewed research programme based on the accrual of studies with specific features is needed. These should include more robust experimental designs with replication within and across systems, integrative and more nuanced assessments of plant defensive phenotypes and herbivory, a food web approach that considers the multi-trophic context in which plant-herbivore interactions are embedded, and a consideration of historical factors (e.g., island origin and biogeographical factors, defensive anachronisms). Outlook This new research programme will require integration of evolutionary ecology research on plant-herbivore interactions with island biogeography, palaeoecology and community ecology to understand the influence of factors acting at different scales, from local factors driving herbivory and plant defences to historical processes and regional drivers of species composition determining species traits and their interactions.

AB  - With the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, vehicle-mounted mobile monitoring systems have become increasingly integrated into wildlife monitoring practices. However, images captured through these systems often present challenges such as low resolution, small target sizes, and partial occlusions. Consequently, detecting animal targets using conventional deep-learning networks is challenging. To address these challenges, this paper presents an enhanced YOLOv7 model, referred to as YOLOv7(sr-sm), which incorporates a super-resolution (SR) reconstruction module and a small object optimization module. The YOLOv7(sr-sm) model introduces a super-resolution reconstruction module that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to reconstruct high-resolution details from blurry animal images. Additionally, an attention mechanism is integrated into the Neck and Head of YOLOv7 to form a small object optimization module, which enhances the model's ability to detect and locate densely packed small targets. Using a vehicle-mounted mobile monitoring system, images of four wildlife taxa-sheep, birds, deer, and antelope -were captured on the Tibetan Plateau. These images were combined with publicly available high-resolution wildlife photographs to create a wildlife test dataset. Experiments were conducted on this dataset, comparing the YOLOv7(sr-sm) model with eight popular object detection models. The results demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP), with YOLOv7(sr-sm) achieving 93.9%, 92.1%, and 92.3%, respectively. Furthermore, compared to the newly released YOLOv8l model, YOLOv7(sr-sm) outperforms it by 9.3%, 2.1%, and 4.5% in these three metrics while also exhibiting superior parameter efficiency and higher inference speeds. The YOLOv7(sr-sm) model architecture can accurately locate and identify blurry animal targets in vehicle-mounted monitoring images, serving as a reliable tool for animal identification and counting in mobile monitoring systems. These findings provide significant technological support for the application of intelligent monitoring techniques in biodiversity conservation efforts.

AB  - Diet specialization may affect the population genetic structure of pollinators by reducing gene flow and driving genetic differentiation, especially in pollen-specialist bees. Colletes gigas is a pollen-specialist pollinator of Camellia oleifera, one of the most important staple oil crops in China. Ca. oleifera blooms in cold climates and contains special compounds that make it an unusable pollen source to other pollinators. Thus, C. gigas undoubtedly plays a key role as the main pollinator of Ca. oleifera, with biological and economic significance. Here, we use a population genomic approach to analyze the roles of geography and climate on the genetic structure, genetic diversity, and demographic history of C. gigas. A total of 1,035,407 SNPs were identified from a 582.77 Gb dataset. Clustering and phylogenetic analyses revealed a marked genetic structure, with individuals grouped into nine local clusters. A significant isolation by distance was detected by both the Mantel test (R = .866, p = .008) and linear regression (R-2 = .616, p < .001). Precipitation and sunshine duration were positively and significantly (R >= .765, p <= .016) correlated with observed heterozygosity (H-o) and expected heterozygosity (H-e). These results showed that C. gigas populations had a distinct phylogeographic pattern determined by geographical distance and environmental factors (precipitation and sunshine duration). In addition, an analysis of paleogeographic dynamics indicated that C. gigas populations exhibited patterns of glacial expansion and interglacial contraction, likely resulting from post-glacial habitat contraction and fragmentation. Our results indicated that the peculiar phylogeographic patterns in C. gigas populations may be related to their specialization under long-term adaptation to host plants. This work improves our understanding of the population genetics in pollen-specialist bees. The distinct genetic clusters identified in this study should be taken into consideration for the protection and utilization of this specialized crop pollinator.

AB  - Hydrologic dysfunction associated with desertification of grazing lands likely depends on two opposing biophysical drivers, compaction by livestock and bioturbation by plant roots and soil biota. To understand which is most important, we conducted a long-term field experiment. We tested the effects of phytobiomass (control vs. herbicide treated) and three ungulate disturbance treatments (none, once, and twice disturbed) on soil water transport in northern mixed-grass prairie. Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (i.e., infiltration) was primarily reduced by the most severe (twice disturbed) ungulate disturbance treatment. To a lesser degree, ungulate disturbance and phytobiomass interacted, and similar levels of hydrologic dysfunction were detected for plots annually treated with herbicide and disturbed by a single livestock disturbance event (and while soils were dry and resistant to compaction) and naturally vegetated plots that had been twice disturbed (including while soils were wet and susceptible to compaction). Our findings suggest hydrologic dysfunction in grazing lands is mainly due to compaction by ungulates, especially when grazing at high stocking rates and while areas are vulnerable to compaction (e.g., fine soils, wet soils, not well vegetated).

AB  - At present, in Central Yakutia on the right bank of the Lena River, the northern border of the distribution of the Siberian musk deer has advanced to the mouth and lower reaches of the Aldan River; on the left bank, it reaches to the settlement of Elanka and the Keteme River. The northernmost points of entry along the left bank of the Lena River were noted 150 km from Yakutsk. The movement of musk deer populations reveals an association with climate warming and an increase in the snow cover height. Musk deer settle in many regions of relatively little snow like Central Yakutia, which includes taiga-alas landscapes with a large number of settlements and significant areas of hay, arable, and pasture lands. This is the first manifestation of the ability of the species to settle locally in agricultural regions with a relatively high density of the human population. At this stage, the expansion of the Siberian musk deer range to the north did not reach the southern border of the distribution of the Verkhoyansk subspecies. The issues of the effect of hunting pressure and predators on the number of musk deer and the effect of fires on the territorial redistribution of this species are discussed in this article.

AB  - Mammal remains preserved in the permafrost zone often bear traces of postmortem transformations, reflecting aspects of the palaeoenvironment and the processes that took place during the accumulation of host sediments. Multidisciplinary studies including radiocarbon dating, infrared spectroscopy, and microfossil analyses and grain size of infilling sediments from remains allow recognition of their stratigraphical and palaeogeographical origins and facilitate reconstructions of taphonomic pathways and the pre-burial environments. Here, as exemplified by skulls of woolly rhinoceros, cave lion, and ancient bison, some distinct features of postmortem changes such as nonpyrogenic charring and vivianite encrustation indicate that the remains have undergone a complex range of burial processes in aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the Pleistocene landscapes of Arctic northeastern Russia. We hypothesize that these processes were mainly confined to the warmer intervals in the Late Pleistocene.

AB  - Wildlife management on a landscape scale is often complex, particularly where different land use practices occur in the same region. This is particularly so for the management of overabundant grazing species (both domestic and native) in a modified landscape, where anthropogenic activities and climatic drivers can influence their distribution and abundance beyond sustainable levels. In Australia's arid rangelands, macropods benefit from pastoral activities including improved pastures, artificial watering points and the removal of apex predators. This paper addresses some of the challenges associated with managing Red Kangaroo (Osphranter rufus) in a conservation context on the privately managed Boolcoomatta Station conservation reserve in the South Australian arid rangelands. We reflect on the history of the region and how anthropogenic activities, associated with an unpredictable climate, have made macropod management so complex. Ecological monitoring at Boolcoomatta Station suggests that, along with the influence of rainfall, grazing by overabundant Red Kangaroo had a negative impact on vegetation and resident avifauna of chenopod plains. Fenced exclosures further demonstrate the grazing impact of Red Kangaroo, with perennial grasses found only where grazing was excluded. The closure of waterpoints (dams) failed to reduce Red Kangaroo impacts on the reserve, despite some evidence that persistence of Red Kangaroo near fenced dams may be reduced in the long term. Results of monitoring and management outcomes at Boolcoomatta highlight the need for an improved framework to manage Red Kangaroo. This should include consideration of improved regional stock management practices in the face of climate change; improving our understanding of the role of apex predators in agricultural landscapes; developing and setting grazing impact thresholds to instigate macropod management; improving and standardizing monitoring methods for assessing impacts; and lastly, consideration of the mental health and social well-being of land managers in these areas.

AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution, abundance and structure of isopod assemblages in Bizerte Lagoon (SW Mediterranean Sea) were studied at 22 stations selected from seagrass and macroalgae sampled during four seasons in 2017. A total of 6808 indi-viduals and 17 species of isopods belonging to 5 suborders, 7 families and 12 genera were identified. Six new species were record-ed on Tunisian coasts. In addition, and compared to previous studies, nine isopod species were collected for the first time in this lagoon. Analysis of the trophic structure revealed that the majority of stations are strongly dominated by herbivore-deposit feeders (78.3%), followed by deposit-suspension feeders (13.6%) and carnivores (8.01%). Three isopod assemblages were identified (G1, G2 and G3). The distribution of isopod assemblages is influenced by the nature and structure of the substrates. The seasonal variations in the isopod community patterns at 22 stations showed maximum abundance and diversity during spring, whereas the lowest ones were recorded during winter.

AB  - Herbivory pressure is an important ecological aspect to determine quantitative variation in plant defenses, such as the number of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and their nectar amount and quality. Extrafloral nectaries can attract ants, which can be considered a type of induced plant defense. Besides, plants tend to invest more in defense when they are more vulnerable to herbivores. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate if Stryphnodendron adstringens (Fabaceae), a common Cerrado tree species, when subjected to damage (by manual leaf cutting and experimental fire) would produce a greater number of EFNs and changes its nectar quality on newly produced leaves in comparison with plants not subjected to these treatments. Leaf damage was performed artificially directly on the plant branches and at the entire plant canopy (by means of scissors or fire events). Extrafloral nectary density was higher in new leaves produced after the treatment application (artificial herbivory and fire) in comparison with plants under control treatment. The amount of nectar was also higher under treatments in comparison with control, with a significant change on nectar quality in plants subjected to the treatments of artificial herbivory. The results provided support for the hypothesis that EFNs are an inducible defensive strategy in S. adstringens, confirming the existence of phenotypic plasticity given environmental pressures.

AB  - Species reintroductions have the potential to cause genetic bottleneck events resulting in increased genetic drift, increased inbreeding, and reduced genetic diversity creating negative fitness consequences for populations. Roosevelt elk (Cervus canadensis roosevelti Erxleben, 1777) are "at risk" in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Once widespread along the west coast, Roosevelt elk were likely extirpated from the mainland by 1900 and experienced a substantial population bottleneck on Vancouver Island at that time, and again in the 1950s. Reintroduced to the mainland from Vancouver Island in the 1980s, this re-established population became the source for subsequent mainland translocations. To understand the effects of reintroduction strategy on genetic diversity, we analyzed genetic variation in 355 Roosevelt elk from Vancouver Island and mainland BC. Using mitochondrial DNA and 10 microsatellite loci, molecular analyses showed overall reduced genetic diversity relative to other extant elk populations, genetic isolation of the southern Vancouver Island population, and increased genetic drift among reintroduced herds. Four reintroduced populations were found to have increased levels of inbreeding. Results of this study contribute to our knowledge of reintroduction biology and can be used to guide continued conservation and management of at-risk species.

AB  - In many ecosystems, consumers respond to warming differently than their resources, sometimes leading to temporal mismatches between seasonal maxima in consumer demand and resource availability. A potentially equally pervasive, but less acknowledged threat to the temporal coherence of consumer-resource interactions is mismatch in food quality. Many plant and algal communities respond to warming with shifts toward more carbon-rich species and growth forms, thereby diluting essential elements in their biomass and intensifying the stoichiometric mismatch with herbivore nutrient requirements. Here we report on a mesocosm experiment on the spring succession of an assembled plankton community in which we manipulated temperature (ambient vs. +3.6 degrees C) and presence versus absence of two types of grazers (ciliates and Daphnia), and where warming caused a dramatic regime shift that coincided with extreme stoichiometric mismatch. At ambient temperatures, a typical spring succession developed, where a moderate bloom of nutritionally adequate phytoplankton was grazed down to a clear-water phase by a developing Daphnia population. While warming accelerated initial Daphnia population growth, it speeded up algal growth rates even more, triggering a massive phytoplankton bloom of poor food quality. Consistent with the predictions of a stoichiometric producer-grazer model, accelerated phytoplankton growth promoted the emergence of an alternative system attractor, where the extremely low phosphorus content of the abundant algal food eventually drove Daphnia to extinction. Where present, ciliates slowed down the phytoplankton bloom and the deterioration of its nutritional value, but this only delayed the regime shift. Eventually, phytoplankton also grew out of grazer control in the presence of ciliates, and the Daphnia population crashed. To our knowledge, the experiment is the first empirical demonstration of the "paradox of energy enrichment" (grazer starvation in an abundance of energy-rich but nutritionally imbalanced food) in a multispecies phytoplankton community. More generally, our results support the notion that warming can exacerbate the stoichiometric mismatch at the plant-herbivore interface and limit energy transfer to higher trophic levels.

AB  - Past research has documented livestock grazing patterns and dynamics across pastoral landscapes. We used spatial locations of domestic range sheep (Ovis aries) obtained from Global Positioning System collars to study habitat selection on summer mountain habitat North of Scofield Reservoir Utah, United States. Data were collected between the months of July to September 2020. We developed a resource selection function to determine the influence of slope, distance to water, aspect, ruggedness, elevation, and vegetation types on habitat selection by sheep while grazing on summer mountain habitat. We found sheep selected for sites closer to water, with more gentle terrain, higher in elevation, and north-facing slopes. Vegetation types were less predictive, ostensibly due to the lack of species composition information in available geographic information system layers and the possibility of sheep being herded to avoid areas of overuse. Although it is often assumed that sheep use slopes more than their heavier and larger cattle counterparts, overall they tended to avoid steep slopes compared with all other predictor variables. This information on selection for higher elevations and avoidance of steep slopes can be used to improve livestock management practices including flock management that increases sheep foraging patterns and energy efficiency.

AB  - The chinkara (Gazella bennettii, Sykes 1831) exhibits a broad distribution from Iran to India and has been categorized into five species: G. bennettii, G. christyi, and G. salinarum representing the Indian chinkara, and G. fuscifrons and G. shikarii pertaining to the Iranian chinkara (jebeer). This classification within the "Gazelle bennettii group" is solely based on morphological data, lacking genetic information. To investigate the potential presence of multiple species within the group and to determine subspecific variations, we sampled jebeer in Iran and conducted phylogenetic analyses using cytochrome b, COI, and sequences from two nuclear introns (CHD2 and ZNF618). Our mitochondrial data revealed a significant divergence within the "Gazelle bennettii group," identifying two lineages: the Iranian lineage (jebeer) and the Indian lineage (chinkara). Estimates of divergence time suggest that the split between jebeer and chinkara occurred approximately 0.895 million years ago, possibly associated with a vicariant event caused by the Indus River. These findings have important implications for assessing species conservation statuses on the IUCN Red List because an endangered lineage (jebeer) is currently grouped together with a non-threatened one (chinkara) under the same global assessment, which underestimates the true endangered status of jebeer. In Iran, the haplotype distribution map of the jebeer can serve as a fundamental genetic framework guiding conservation efforts across Iranian protected areas and captive breeding centers. Therefore, we recommend any future management plan should be based on these findings and treat these two lineages separately.

AB  - Catastrophic megafires can increase extinction risks; identifying species priorities for management and policy support is critical for preparing and responding to future fires. However, empirical data on population loss and recovery post-fire, especially megafire, are limited and taxonomically biased. These gaps could be bridged if species' morphological, behavioural, ecological and life history traits indicated their fire responses. Using expert elicitation that estimated population changes following the 2019-20 Australian megafires for 142 terrestrial and aquatic animal species (from every vertebrate class, one invertebrate group), we examined whether expert es-timates of fire-related mortality, mortality in the year post-fire, and recovery trajectories over 10 years/three generations post-fire, were related to species traits. Expert estimates for fire-related mortality were lower for species that could potentially flee or shelter from fire, and that associated with fire-prone habitats. Post-fire mortality estimates were linked to diet, diet specialisation, home range size, and susceptibility to introduced herbivores that damage or compete for resources. Longer-term population recovery estimates were linked to diet/habitat specialisation, susceptibility to introduced species; species with slower life histories and shorter subadult dispersal distances also had lower recovery estimates. Across animal groups, experts estimated that recovery was poorest for species with pre-fire population decline and more threatened conservation status. Sustained management is likely needed to recover species with habitat and diet specialisations, slower life histories, pre-existing declines and threatened conservation statuses. This study shows that traits could help inform management priorities before and after future megafires, but further empirical data on animal fire response is essential.

AB  - One of the central problems in ecology is how to scale from small-scale observations and experiments to large-scale patterns and processes. One approach to such upscaling is to use dynamic simulation models, but their application to large scales relevant for management is limited by computational costs, and their outputs are difficult to analyse without a systematic strategy. Our general objective is to propose such a strategy. The idea is to approximate the dynamics of detailed simulation models through a set of states, external drivers, and transition matrices, and then use Markov chain and network analysis of the resulting transition matrices to gain insights into the dynamics of the underlying detailed model. We used the individual-based model COIRON, which simulates the dynamics of semiarid grass steppes in Patagonia (Argentina) under alternative grazing management, as example. Our specific objectives are to identify pathways of degradation and rehabilitation, as well as critical grazing thresholds and early-warning vegetation states to guide sustainable grazing management in these steppes. Our results indicate nonlinear effects of stocking rate and grazing season on steppe dynamics. Markov chain analysis suggests benefits of seasonal over continuous grazing at intermediate stocking rates, and network analysis of recovery and degradation trajectories shows that intermediate stocking rates maximize differences between grazing seasons. Finally, our analysis identified specific vegetation states as early warning signals that indicate a high risk of irreversible vegetation changes. Patagonian grass steppes should ideally be managed with multi-paddock grazing at moderate stocking rates around 0.5 sheep ha-1. The transition matrices summarize the relevant key features of the detailed model for larger scales, and applying Markov and network theory provides a systematic strategy to analyse its dynamics to respond to biological questions, both are often difficult to obtain by direct analysis of the detailed model.

AB  - The Epivillafranchian and the transition to the Galerian (1.2-0.9 Ma) was a period marked by environmental fluctuations and faunal turnover. Homo arrived into Europe around 1.4 Ma. ago, and was established in Iberia during the Epivillafranchian, as evidenced by the oldest sites with hominin fossils located in the Iberian Peninsula. The Iberian ecosystems offered a variety of trophic resources to hominins, including the opportunity to scavenge carcasses of large ungulates killed by a diverse predatory guild, especially due to the presence of two sabre-toothed cats. It has been claimed that the presence of Pachycrocuta brevirostris, a strong competitor for carrion, prevented hominins from exploiting abandoned carcasses as a reliable meat and fat resource. However, computer simulation experiments suggest that the coexistence of P. brevirostris and hominins competing for carrion was ecologically viable in the Epivillafranchian. Nevertheless, the faunal turnover of the Epivillafranchian-Galerian transition drastically changed the composition of the large carnivore fauna. The changes include the extinction of the sabre-toothed felid Megantereon, frequently considered a key provider of partially consumed carcasses, and the demise of the hyperscavenger P. brevirostris. All these changes modified the ecological scenario and the opportunities for hominins and other facultative scavengers. Computer simulation experiments using the agent-based model SCAVCOMP-ABM are used here to evaluate the viability of the coexistence of hominins and giant hyenas in the Epivillafranchian-Galerian transition. Different ecological scenarios defined by the composition of the predatory guild, ecosystem productivity, and competition pressure from other scavengers are evaluated. Results suggest that hominins and giant hyenas could coexist during the Epivillafranchian with different carnivore guilds, but a disruption of the scavenging niche likely occurred in the transition to the Galerian, coinciding with the extinction of P. brevirostris. A low ecosystem productivity during the cold intervals, maintenance of a high competition for carrion with other facultative scavengers, and a hypothetical social behaviour of the sabre-toothed cat Homotherium latidens appear as key factors to explain the changes in the scavenger guild at the Epivillafranchian-Galerian transition.

AB  - The Kangaroo Island glossy black-cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus lathami halmaturinus) is an endangered subspecies that feeds almost entirely on the kernels of drooping sheoak (Allocasuarina verticillata). Hence, it is highly susceptible to changes in the quantity or quality of A. verticillata. Fire has the potential to severely impact glossy black-cockatoo feeding habitat on the island, but since A. verticillata is serotinous, it is partially reliant on fire for regeneration. Here, we quantified the effects of time-since-fire (over a 60-year period) on cone quality for C. lathami halmaturinus. Cone quality in A. verticillata woodlands with a range of fire histories was examined using three measures of cone profitability: the ratio of seed-to-cone mass (Clout's Index), the ratio of kernel-to-cone mass (Kernel Ratio) and the proportion of seeds containing kernels (Seed Fill). We then mapped the fire history of A. verticillata woodlands on Kangaroo Island before and after the 2019/20 bushfire season. We found that time-since-fire had a significant negative impact on Clout's Index, as well as a negative but non-significant impact on Seed Fill and Kernel Ratio. This suggests that trees that have not experienced fire in over 60 years may have cones that are of lesser value to C. lathami halmaturinus. This is concerning, because up to 94% of A. verticillata woodlands not impacted by the 2019/20 bushfires are likely of a similar age class, having had no fire in over 60 years. Our findings highlight the need for ongoing assessment and management of critical habitat for this endangered subspecies. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. CC_BY_NC_ND_4.0

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous zoonotic parasite with a wide range of warm-blooded animals as intermediate hosts, where the transmission primarily occurs through ingesting T. gondii oocysts in the environment. Hence, animals inhabiting a wide geographical range can be sentinels for the environmental contamination of T. gondii oocysts. The aim of this study was to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii in two generalist ungulates in the Republic of Korea (ROK), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus), and identify the risk factors associated with this infection. Commercial ELISA kits confirmed a seroprevalence of 34.9% in wild boar (170/487, 95% CI: 30.7-39.3%) and 29.9% in Korean water deer (135/452, 95% CI: 25.7-34.3%). In both species, the seroprevalence was highest in winter, and showed no sex-related differences. In wild boars, the seroprevalence showed steep reduction in 2020 and increased with body mass. Meanwhile, in Korean water deer, seroprevalence did not show significant association with any of the tested variables, although an increase in seroprevalence was observed in 2020 compared to previous years. This study documents the widespread yet heterogeneous nature of T. gondii prevalence in its intermediate host population. Hence, the constant monitoring of T. gondii prevalence in its host species, both definitive and intermediate, while simultaneously considering risk factors would be necessary to identify the drivers behind the fluctuating pattern of T. gondii prevalence.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in wildlife surveying, including estimation of population densities. It is essential that we evaluate and test new survey methods to guide optimal sampling strategies. This study aimed to assess the accuracy of using a UAV-mounted thermal infrared (TIR) camera to count red deer Cervus elaphus populations, and how this was influenced by flight season, height and velocity, in order to help guide future census design. We flew 57 flights across a captive population of red deer in a 13 ha deer park enclosure of semi-natural habitat, representative of the species' range in northern Germany. Flights and image assessments were performed with no prior knowledge of actual population size. Accuracy was quantified by comparing real population size (known only to deer park staff) and independently estimated population sizes from UAV TIR images. Accuracy was significantly influenced by ecological season (early and late winter, spring and early summer) and height. Across all seasons, lower flights (100 m) performed better than higher ones (120 m), with lower flights in early winter and early summer being on average accurate to within 1% of actual population counts. For the season where we had the largest range of temperatures between flights (late winter) we found that accuracy was highest when temperatures were lowest. Flights were also able to identify all five stags (defined as a male deer >= 2 years old) present in early summer, but not in spring. Deer appeared to avoid the landing/take-off area, but there were no noted behavioural responses to drones flying over animals when at constant height and velocity during surveys. Our results indicate that UAV-mounted TIR camera have the potential to accurately count populations of large ungulate species, but that flight season, height and potentially temperature need to be taken into account to maximise accuracy. This approach has the potential to be scaled up to more accurately estimate densities of wild populations compared to existing approaches.

AB  - Global and regional degradation and loss of aquatic systems can negatively affect wetland-dependent waterbirds. The Wilderness Lakes Complex in South Africa, which incorporates the Wilderness Ramsar site, supports populations of 68 waterbird species including eight which periodically occur in globally significant (>1% population) numbers. The study aimed to document long-term spatial and temporal (including seasonal) patterns of abundance of herbivorous waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes Complex, and where possible identify potential causes for observed trends. The abundance of waterbirds on these wetlands was determined biannually from 1992 to 2019, with counts conducted from a boat following a standardised route. Historical abundance data from the 1980s was also used to describe long-term abundance changes. Observed seasonality of four herbivorous waterbirds differed from published accounts. Long-term abundance trends indicated a combination of declining, increasing and stable populations which, in several instances, differed from regional (southern African) assessments. Significant long-term decreases have occurred in five herbivorous species in the lakes complex (Common Moorhen Gallinula chloropus, Red-knobbed Coot Fulica cristata, Yellow-billed Duck Anas undulata, Cape Shoveler Anas smithii, Cape Teal Anas capensis), whereas increases have occurred in two species (Spurwinged Goose Plectropterus gambensis, Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiaca). Similar types of change occurred across multiple waterbodies, and in different seasons. The similarity of trends in spatially separated wetlands suggested either high interconnectivity of populations between wetland systems and/or some drivers of change of mobile species being broad scaled and regional, rather than system specific. Local reasons for changes potentially include increasing extent of cultivated fields, a proliferation of emergent macrophytes and loss of open sandbanks, changing food availability, increasing disturbance, and disease.Conservation implications: The fundamental character of the Wilderness Ramsar site has changed, with reduced abundance of several previously abundant herbivorous waterbirds. Drivers of change in species abundances are multifaceted, complex, and frequently poorly understood. Recommended local corrective actions include the management of emergent macrophytes, avian diseases, disturbance, and water quality.

AB  - Understanding species habitat use and factors affecting changes in their distributions are necessary to promote the conservation of any biological community. We evaluated the changes in wetland use of the non-breeding waterbird community. Based on long-term citizen-science data (1988-2020), we tested the hypotheses that wetland use is associated with species diet and potential range-shift drivers (the tendency to occupy the same sites in consecutive years-site affinity-and the species' average temperature across its wintering range-species temperature index). We analysed species-specific wetland use of 25 species of waterbirds wintering in Czechia over a period of 33 years. The analyses explained variability in trends in numbers of the studied waterbird species across four inland wetland types: reservoirs; fishponds; industrial waters created by flooding of former mining sites; and running waters. Trends in waterbird abundance positively correlated with species' diet on fishponds, industrial and running waters. Among the diet groups, invertivores showed the largest increase in abundances on industrial waters, closely followed by herbivores. Herbivores showed the largest increase in abundances in fishponds, and piscivores did so in running waters. Regarding range-shift drivers, species with higher site affinity showed higher abundances on running waters, while species with low species temperature index (i.e. wintering on average in sites with lower temperature) were more abundant on reservoirs. The abundance of both warm-dwelling and species with low site affinity increased on fishponds and industrial waters. Our findings suggest that the increased importance of the wetland types considered here for wintering waterbirds is likely to be linked to diet related changes in habitat use and changes in species distributions; and highlight that wintering waterbirds are expected to select sites with higher availability of food, higher energy content, and lower foraging cost. Recent and rapid changes in species distributions may lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of national and international conservation efforts. When planning conservation measures, it should be kept in mind that climate change does not only imply large-scale north/north-eastwards shifts of entire waterbird distributions, but can also modify the use of the habitats by waterbird species inside their traditional wintering range.

AB  - Estuaries are highly productive habitats that support fisheries production. However, the importance of mangrove carbon to estuarine consumers can differ considerably among systems. In this study, we used stable isotopes (delta C-13, delta N-15) to investigate the importance of mangrove carbon as an energy source to estuarine consumers in the Atrato River Delta, Colombia, an area where fringing mangroves dominate the coastline and where other productive coastal habitats that may otherwise support the food web are absent. Basal resources and consumers were collected from mangrove and nearshore habitats during the rainy season. Results revealed a food web with a maximum length of 4.6 trophic positions. Bayesian mixing models indicated that most consumers used a mixture of basal sources, which suggests intertwined energetic pathways. However, mixing models also indicated that some species relied more heavily on some basal sources than others and revealed trophic pathways (food chains). Mangrove carbon directly supported herbivorous crabs (Sesarmidae) and indirectly supported planktivorous fish (Engraulidae) and piscivorous fish. Mangrove carbon also contributed significantly to the diet of 2 of the most common fish species in the local artisanal fishery: Centropomus undecimalis (mean: 46 %; credibility interval [CI]: 1-80%) and C. pectinatus (mean: 33 %; CI: 1-78 %). Our findings highlight that mangrove carbon can be an important food source in areas without other productive coastal habitats and can play an important role in sustaining the production of fisheries.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal, which will lead to ecosystem contamination, threatening the life of grazing animals. Goats are an important grazing animal biomarker to evaluate Cd toxicity, but the effect of short-term and high-concentration Cd toxicity on goat liver function and its latent mechanism is still unclear. A total of ten male Guizhou black goats were randomly divided into two groups: CON group, sterilized tap water (no CdCl2), and Cd group (20 mg Cd center dot kg(-1)center dot BW, CdCl2 center dot 2.5H(2)O). The test lasted for 30 days. In this study, we found that Cd poisoning in drinking water affected significantly the distribution of Cd in the goat offal and tissues, and damaged the goat's immune function of the liver. With a metabolomics approach, 59 metabolites were identified. Metabolomics analysis suggested that Cd affected lipid and amino acid metabolism of the goat liver. Collectively, our results confirmed the effect of Cd on liver function and liver metabolism, and provided insights on the molecular basis for early warnings of Cd poisoning in goats.

AB  - Although composting is a very effective way to dispose agricultural wastes, its development is greatly limited by the low compost quality and greenhouse gas emissions. At present, there is a lack of effective means to solve these two problems simultaneously. Here, the effects of three additives of compound microbial agent, biochar and biochar carried microbial agent on the composting performance, nitrogen transformation, greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions, and bacterial communities were investigated in sheep manure composting during 28 days. Results showed that biochar carried microbial agent prolonged the thermophilic stage and promoted compost maturity. At the same time, it was confirmed by the increase of the decomposition of organic nitrogen and the transformation of NH4+-N to NO3--N. Besides, adding biochar carried microbial agent decreased CH4, NH3 and N2O emissions by 65.23%, 42.05% and 68.64%, respectively. The gas emissions were mainly correlated to Chloroflexi, Myxococcota, Acidobacteriota, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadota. Redundancy analysis showed that EC and TKN were closely related to bacterial community. Therefore, biochar carried microbial agent is recommended as an effective additive to enhance compost quality and reduce gas emissions during sheep manure composting.

AB  - The rumen is a critical organ that facilitates nutrient digestion in ruminant animals. However, the biological mechanisms by which rumen microbiota and its metabolites enable Lactobacillus to modulate rumen structure and maintain functional homeostasis under fattening feeding conditions remain poorly understood. In this study, 80 male Pamir yaks were selected, and a 170-day data collection phase was implemented. Correlation phenotypic data and multi-omics analyses (rumen microbial sequencing and rumen epithelial metabolomics) were conducted to investigate the regulatory effects of Lactobacillus supplementation on rumen microbiota and metabolic processes in a concentrate-based rearing yak model. The results demonstrated that feeding a high-energy diet may impair yak ruminal histomorphology, microbiota composition, and function while negatively modulating rumen microbiota-metabolic profiles associated with specific ruminal microbial communities and functions. Lactobacillus intervention treatment optimized the yak ruminal microbiome composition (mucous layer maturation was promoted, Prevotella and Ruminococcus abundance were reduced, and Fibrobacter and Muribaculaceae abundance were increased), thereby altering metabolite concentrations involved in various metabolic pathways under a high-energy feeding pattern (fatty acid metabolism pathways were upregulated). These alterations elucidated the beneficial impacts of the Lactobacillus supplementation strategy on yak ruminal health without compromising the high-energy intensive rearing pattern. Furthermore, the regulated ruminal microbiome metabolites may serve as potential biomarkers for future investigations into the functional impacts of Lactobacillus intervention treatment on healthy feeding strategies for yaks.

AB  - Implications of the differences in leaf life span are still subject to debate in the field of ecophysiology. Since leaf traits associated with these differences may be decisive for determining the distribution of tree species, this topic is particularly relevant in the context of climate change. This study analyzes the effects of the differences in leaf life span on premature losses of leaf area owing to insect herbivory and to abiotic stress. Loss of leaf area may be an important determinant of total leaf carbon assimilation. Seven Mediterranean tree species, distributed on four sites with different climates were studied. The species exhibited strong differences in leaf life span and in leaf traits, especially leaf mass per unit area. Premature leaf area losses were estimated in response to insect herbivory and summer drought over two years. The results revealed that, despite having older leaf cohorts with more damage, species with longer leaf duration had lower area lost to herbivores and less damage due to accelerated senescence during the summer drought. With respect to the predicted increase in water stress, deciduous species are at a disadvantage due to their high premature loss of leaf area and thus loss of photosynthetic capacity.

AB  - Forest insects are among the most important factors of disturbance in European forests. The increase in and duration of drought stress events due to climate change not only increase the vulnerability of rural and urban forests but also predispose weakened stands to insect pest calamities. In this context, many German and European forest research institutes and environmental institutions report an increase in the densities and calamity developments of the oak processionary moth (Thaumetopoea processionea L.) not only in oak and mixed-oak forests but also in smaller areas where oak trees regularly occur, e.g., parklands, urban areas, copses, avenues, recreational forests, etc. It is expected that the oak processionary moth (OPM) will benefit from the overall weakened vitality of both individual oaks and oak stands in the future and that mass outbreaks will occur at an increased frequency. This paper reports on the effects that the OPM can have on tree performance for rural forest and urban oak trees by applying the chlorophyll fluorescence non-destructive diagnostic method for the identification and quantification of damage to oak leaves. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of OPM frass activity on tree leaf health using chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, comparing infested host oaks with non-infested oaks in urban and forest environs. The study assessed: 1. the quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PS II), which counts as an indicator for leaf conditions, 2. the performance index, which indicates the efficiency of the photosynthetic light reaction, 3. the energy loss of the photosynthetic reaction, which is an indicator for cell damage, and 4. the degree of open reaction centers in PS II, which indicates how well light energy can be absorbed for photosynthesis. Infested urban and rural oaks showed a significantly reduced quantum yield of PS II by up to 10% compared to non-infested oak leaves. The leaf performance was significantly reduced by up to 35% for infested urban oaks and by up to 60% for infested forest oaks, respectively. The energy losses were two times higher for infested urban and forest oaks. However, OPM infestation led to a higher reduction in the photosynthetic performance in the leaves of forest oaks compared to that of urban oaks. In order to avoid permanent damage, suitable countermeasures must be taken quickly, as, immediately after pest infestation, the performance decreases significantly. A lower performance means a significant loss in biomass production as well as in tree vitality.

AB  - Knowledge of the morphological and physiological responses of trees to planting density is important for adjusting plantation establishment practices to attain the desired size and characteristics of wood products. In this review, we provide an overview of how planting density is managed as a silvicultural practice and summarize recent advances, trends, and gaps to guide future research in this field. We applied a PRISMA methodology to select papers published between 1981 and 2020 that tested how monospecies planting density affects the morphological and physiological characteristics of planted trees; we observed an increasing trend in the number of relevant publications over this period. These studies focused mainly on species used for timber production (Eucalyptus and Pinus), and research was concentrated in the United States, China, and Brazil. In general, the 255 selected studies identified that planting density has a major impact on stem diameter and volume, resulting in greater stand productivity of high-density stands, especially for trees having a smaller individual volume. Studies evaluating the physiological response of trees to planting density also showed that species ecology, solar radiation, water requirements, and site-specific characteristics have a greater influence on plant growth than planting density. Considering the physiological aspects in high-density plantations, water relations based on transpiration and water use efficiency are the main aspect guiding plants growth rate. Despite major advances in intensive silviculture around the world, there remains a knowledge gap for tree species grown for their leaves, fruits, or seeds and a lack of data related to the physiological response of trees to planting density. The results of this literature survey can improve forest management decisions in regard to forest stand use and develop novel study avenues for silviculture.

AB  - Browsing by alien vertebrate herbivores can have both positive and negative impacts on plant invasion. We studied the European hare (Lepus europaeus) diet and foraging behavior focusing on interactions with two invasive non-native shrub species, Cytisus scoparius and Rosa rubiginosa. Fecal pellets were used for microhistological analysis of diet and seed identification. Foraging use of both species was evaluated by browsing rankings. The diet consisted of 28 items, predominating native grasses such as Poa spp. and Festuca pallescens. Among the non-native species, the grasses Hordeum spp. leaves and stems of the shrub C. scoparius, and seed fragments of Rumex acetosella, and rosehip stand out. Fecal pellets contained 431 whole seeds from nine plant species, predominating non-native species. In diet analysis, a portion of damaged rosehip seeds was observed; however, a significant number of viable seeds were previously extracted. This suggests that consumption of R. rubiginosa fruits contributes to seed dispersal, facilitating its spread. In contrast, the browsing of L. europaeus on the vegetative parts of C. scoparius juveniles significantly reduced their cover, which could slow their growth or prevent their spread. These results are an important input for management decisions to prevent or delay the spread of these invasive species.

AB  - Fungal endophytes can alter plant resistance against herbivores by indirectly influencing plant secondary metabolism or through direct effects of their own metabolism. However, the role of fungal endophytes in conifer defences to insect herbivores remains largely unknown. We characterised the endophytic fungal communities and terpene concentrations of 30 white spruce families across two sites. We determined the effects of fungal endophytes on a defoliating insect, eastern spruce budworm, by testing the budworm responses to media amended with fungal endophytes or exposing them to their volatile organic compounds. We further examined whether the changes in the endophytic fungal communities and abundance alter the terpene concentrations of white spruce by inoculating seedlings with endophytic fungi. Terpene and fungal community compositions in mature trees varied among families and sites. The bioassays showed fungal endophytes can kill budworms or reduce their fitness due to the toxicity of fungal mycelium or volatile compounds. The inoculation experiments demonstrated that the changes in fungal communities and abundance can alter the terpene concentrations in seedlings. We developed a "Plant Partnership Hypothesis" to reflect the role of fungal endophytes in plant resistance to insect herbivores, demonstrating a co-evolutionary relationship among fungal endophytes, tree defences, and insect herbivores.

AB  - Context Reduced connectivity across grassland ecosystems can impair their functional heterogeneity and negatively impact large herbivore populations. Maintaining landscape connectivity across human-dominated rangelands is therefore a key conservation priority. Objective Integrate data on large herbivore occurrence and species richness with analyses of functional landscape connectivity to identify important areas for maintaining or restoring connectivity for large herbivores. Methods The study was conducted on a landscape with a mosaic of multiple land uses in Laikipia County, Kenya. We used occupancy estimates for four herbivore species [African elephant (Loxodonta africana), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata), plains zebra (Equus quagga), and Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi)] and species richness estimates derived from aerial surveys to create resistance surfaces to movement for single species and a multi-species assemblage, respectively. We validated single-species resistance surfaces using telemetry data. We used circuit theory and least cost-path analyses to model linkage zones across the landscape and prioritize areas for connectivity restoration. Results Resistance layers approximated the movements of our focal species. Results for single-species and multi-species connectivity models were highly correlated (r(p) > 0.9), indicating similar spatial patterns of functional connectivity between individual species and the larger herbivore assemblage. We identified critical linkage zones that may improve permeability to large-herbivore movements. Conclusion Our analysis highlights the utility of aerial surveys in modeling landscape connectivity and informing conservation management when animal movement data are scarce. Our results can guide management decisions, providing valuable information to evaluate the trade-offs between improving landscape connectivity and safeguarding livelihoods with electrified fences across rangelands.

AB  - The management of international students has become a new challenge that China and most countries in the world must face in the context of the "Belt and Road Initiative" (BRI) and the globalization of higher education. In this paper, we conducted an empirical study on international students in China (ISC) based on a combination of spatial econometric models and analytical methods such as BCG, GeoDetector, and DDCAM, trying to provide a basis for "evidence-based decision-making" by the government in the management of international students and talents. Quantitative analyses revealed significant diversity and spatial effects in the spatio-temporal dynamics of ISCs, with the emergence of star, gazelle, cow, and dog types, suggesting that the scientific management of ISCs requires both local adaptation (spatial differentiation and heterogeneity) and regional collaboration (spatial correlation and autocorrelation). There were many factors affecting the spatio-temporal dynamics of ISCs, and the force of different factors varied considerably, with the key factor more than 0.5 but the auxiliary factor being less than 0.2. Moreover, the factors had significant interaction effects, and a large number of super-interacting factor pairs emerged, with a joint force of more than 0.9, twice the force of a single factor. Generally, the factors had a complex driving mechanism, suggesting that ISC management requires identifying the key and important factors, while attaching emphasis to the synergistic effects among different factors. The recommendation is that China should manage ISCs in spatial zones and introduce differentiated development strategies and policies in different zones. In conclusion, this paper proposes a technical route integrating "dynamic analysis-driving mechanism-policy design" for international students, which is applicable to China, while providing a reference for the management and spatial planning design of international students in other countries in the world.

AB  - Simple Summary The wild boar, found on all the continents except Antarctica, is among the most valuable game species worldwide. However, the recent increase in their numbers has caused negative impacts, such as biodiversity loss, crop destruction, vehicle collisions, and disease transmission. Therefore, wildlife managers need to apply appropriate strategies to achieve three goals: providing sufficient game, mitigating impacts, and securing viable populations. Such efforts cannot be successful without the consent and participation of key stakeholders such as wild boar hunters. We asked 134 hunters of the Evros Prefecture in Greece, a wild boar stronghold, about their practice of hunting and their motivation for hunting. Hunting is carried out in groups, while the number of days out, kilometers traveled, and weekly expenses for hunting in a hunting season suggest the strong attachment of hunters to their game. Hunting is mostly considered a recreational activity (offering contact with nature and excitement, enjoyment of wildlife, bonding with fellow hunters and their dogs, and an opportunity for improving physical shape and reducing stress), although utility is also an important motivation (feeling useful for the family, helping wild boar control and the local economy). Hunters with strong recreation and utility motivations want wild boar populations to further increase. This information can be incorporated into education and outreach programs, to educate hunters about the risks with which increased wild boar numbers are associated. Educated hunters will then offer valuable contributions to effectively manage the situation.Abstract The wild boar (Sus scrofa) is a widespread ungulate, the populations of which have recently increased throughout most of its range. This increase has caused negative impacts on ecosystems, biodiversity, and society. Nowadays, the wild boar is considered both a valuable game and a pest. Wildlife managers need to know the habits and motivations of wild boar hunters, a key stakeholder group, for effectively managing this controversial mammal. We carried out face-to-face interviews with 134 wild boar hunters in the Evros Prefecture, in the Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, northern Greece to determine their hunting habits and their motivation for hunting. Most hunters owned a hunting dog (84.3%), hunted in groups of eight to nine people for 48 days, traveled 60 km, stayed outdoors for 4 nights, and spent weekly EUR 61 on average in each hunting season. Two motivations for wild boar hunting were prominent among the hunters (assessed on a 5-point scale; 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree): a strong recreation motivation (hunting as a recreational activity; mean score 4.159 +/- 1.144 SD) and a considerable utility motivation (hunting for its use values; 3.404 +/- 1.11). Both recreation and utility motivations were positively associated with the preference for further increases in wild boar populations. Sociodemographic characteristics and hunting habits variously affected motivations and preferred future population trends. The findings revealed specific habits and strong motivations among hunters. Such findings will be useful for designing and implementing education and outreach programs for informing hunters about the negative impacts of wild boars and the need for their control. The participation of hunters in the management process will be critical for its success.

AB  - Wildfires have been an important process affecting forests and rangelands worldwide. In the Mediterranean region, wildfires burn about half a million hectares of forest and scrubland every year. Fuel loads are the main factor controlling fire risk and its propagation. The reduction of fuel loads by grazing could help to decrease the spread and intensity of wildfires in this region. This study aims to assess the contribution of sheep grazing on fuel load management and their role to the mitigation of wildfire greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The methodological approach is based on a simulation of the grazing pressure required to reduce a given quantity of fuel, under the assumption that if it is not consumed, it becomes fuel. Following, a simulation model was designed to estimate the total GHG emissions prevented through grazing, by reducing the risk of fire. These emissions were estimated based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework. The accumulated fuels were estimated to be 3126.65 kg dry matter (DM) ha(-1) and the biomass potentially consumed by sheep was 1416.03 kg DM ha(-1 )yr(-1), corresponding to 45.29% of accumulated fuel loads. Our findings suggest a value of 3.88 sheep ha(-1 )day(-1) as the ideal to reduce 4833.63 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1 )yr(-1) of emissions, distributed between CO2 (-2221.76 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1 )yr(-1); 45.96%), NOx (-1873.41 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1 )yr(-1); 38.76%), CO (-454.55 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1 )yr(-1); 9.40%), CH4 (-186.35 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1 )yr(-1); 3.86%) and N2O (-97.56 kg CO(2)eq ha(-1 )yr(-1); 2%). The results of this study also underline that livestock can help to mitigate climate change in areas prone to wildfires.

AB  - Transboundary wildlife species like the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) requires a comprehensive regional approach to monitoring and effective conservation. This requires a thorough understanding of their ecology, ranging behaviour and the distribution of suitable habitats. In diverse landscapes, the management and conservation of the African savannah elephant are critical, particularly in dry protected areas where water and food resources are limited. The use of innovative Geographic Information Science (GIS) and remote sensing tools is revolutionising the understanding of the ranging behaviour and habitat dynamics of the African savannah elephant. When adopting GIS and remote sensing tools, park managers and conservationists must remember that: (i) the African savannah elephant has a determinate movement pattern and clusters around dominant vegetation types, (ii) the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) performs better relative to other indices in modelling the distribution of the African savannah elephant in arid areas, (iii) cellular automata-artificial neural network (CA-ANN) is a robust technique in modelling future landscapes, (iv) landscapes or environments near water points are significantly utilised by the African savannah elephant and vegetation performance is usually better far from the piosphere, (v) significant difference in the size of the home ranges and habitat selection by the African savannah elephant is mostly influenced by vegetation type and seasonal variations of resources, (vi) hyperslender stems in forest gaps confirms minimal damage in African savannah elephant dominated landscapes (satellite data confirms evidence of high tree regeneration) and (vii) the dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Model (dBBMM) is a smart technique for home range and utilisation distribution construction in different protected zones.

AB  - Environmental heat stress is implicated in various animal health issues in ruminants, including reproduction rates, mortality rates, and animal physical quality. During extremely hot weather, there is often no overnight equilibration of animal temperature with its cooling effect, and the accumulated heat load becomes an important factor in animal health for ruminants such as sheep. Using the heat load index (HLI), a heat load model is used as an indicator of heat stress on an hourly basis and annually, using downscaling models for temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed, in both spatial and temporal cases, across several example sites in regional Victoria. Analysis is provided on the performance of the downscaling models and various adaptation and mitigation options are discussed and tested. These options include using different tree planting patterns to modify solar radiation exposure and wind effects, with mixed results because adding shading structures may also diminish the effect of wind-based cooling. The modelling experiments indicated that (1) heat stress is likely to increase under future climate conditions and could represent a serious threat to the health of small ruminants; (2) adaptation measures by means of tree planting to provide shade may not be sufficient to alleviate projected heat stress; and (3) other adaptation measures will need to be considered. Indicative results for heat stress under potential future environments are provided for 2030, 2050, and 2070. Also discussed is the performance of wind speed modelling, and the effect of heat stress on animal growth and ram fertility.

AB  - Large herbivores possess high dispersal rates and require vast areas to roam due to their ecology. This will make them susceptible to anthropogenic threats such as vehicle-collisions. Persian onager (Equus hemionus onager), as the only representative of Artiodactyla in Iran, is not an exception. Persian onager-vehicle collision can not only be lethal for themselves but also for motorists. Given the importance of this twofold issue, an important step being taken to reduce collisions was the installation of signs that warn motorists of the high probability of onagervehicle collisions. We developed a questionnaire to (1) assess the effectiveness of warning signs from motorists' perspective, and (2) to identify the most important factors affecting motorist beliefs in the effectiveness of warning signs. We solicited responses to our questionnaire from motorists on a road with a high Persian onager-vehicle-collision rate in Southern Iran (Hassan Abad-Meshkan Road). To identify factors affecting motorists' beliefs in the effectiveness of warning signs we used logistic regression and for classifying motorists' beliefs in the effectiveness of warning signs we used decision tree. Our result showed that motorists' driving speed, lack of adequate safety equipment on the road (e.g. light, police camera), using cellphone while driving, and concern about wildlife damage while driving on the road were the significant factors affecting motorists' beliefs toward the effectiveness of Persian onager warning signs. It is necessary to increase road safety equipment, install standard warning signs at the Persian onager crossing points, and study the behavior of motorists and the rate of road casualties after the mitigation methods to protect this species.

AB  - In this study, we explore the interplay of seasonal insect assemblages and carcass weight change to refine the estimation of minimum post-mortem interval (PMImin), a key variable in forensic investigations. By integrating these parameters, we shed light on their combined influence on decomposition stages, thus paving the way for a more robust method of PMImin estimation. Our approach relies on rigorous field studies examining pig carcasses across spring, summer and autumn, with comprehensive measurements of carcass weight and detailed documentation of insect succession. We observed distinct insect assemblages and weight-change trends characteristic of each season, underlining the influence of seasonal variability on decomposition dynamics. To further enhance the reliability of our model, we combined the novel parameter of carcass weight change with the conventional total body score (TBS) method, ensuring a more objective assessment of decomposition stages. Although our study indicates promising advancements, it also acknowledges the limitations of using a single pig carcass per season, suggesting future research should incorporate larger sample sizes.

AB  - Florida Key deer (Odocoileus virginianus clavium) are an endangered subspecies of white-tailed deer endemic to the Lower Florida Keys. The New World screwworm (Cochliomyia hominivorax) infestation in July 2016 and Hurricane Irma on 10 September 2017 both caused the Key deer population to decline. Our objective was to estimate current Key deer population abundance using traditional distance sampling and a mark-resight methodology applicable for citizen scientist participation. For mark-resight efforts, deer were marked with hand sprayers using water-based livestock dye on Big Pine (BPK) and No Name keys (NNK). Biologists conducted road surveys between 9-13 March 2020 on BPK and NNK and collected data for mark retention, mark-resight, and distance calculations concurrently. Our mark-resight estimate (n = 748) was nearly 300 deer lower than the traditional distance estimate likely because of distance sampling's sensitivity to increased deer visibility along survey routes. Compared to historic data, our mark-resight population estimate indicated increased deer abundance compared to post-Hurricane Irma estimates (n = 573), but slightly below post-screwworm outbreak estimates (n = 860). Based on mark-retention data, we recommend all resight surveys be completed within 5 days of the first mark placement for the most dependable mark detection. We recommend our mark-resight method be used in future Key deer surveys as it is simple, efficient, and can be reliably completed with the assistance of volunteers therefore allowing for more regular monitoring.

AB  - Ecological afforestation is a positive measure to increase the absorption of carbon dioxide and curb global warming. Ant Forest, a successful example of an 'Internet + voluntary tree planting' gamified app with more than 500 million users, has contributed to substantial progress on ecological afforestation in China. It represents a new model of transforming the environmental awareness and low-carbon actions of users (e.g. walking, sharing bikes, and reducing plastics and papers) into actual environmental benefits via planting trees. The implications of Ant Forest can provide useful references for linking ecosystem restoration with the internet worldwide. However, the spatial distribution and quantitative effects on the carbon sink of Ant Forest on a finer scale are not fully understood. In this study, 588 Ant Forest blocks with a total area of 136 314 ha were identified based on area of interest data using the web crawler approach. The forest blocks involved 20 cities in 7 provinces and included 11 varieties of trees. More than 90% of these forest blocks were located in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Gansu Provinces, and mostly shrubs were planted. Based on the Carnegie Ames Stanford approach model, the net primary productivity (NPP) of Ant Forest blocks was estimated. The simulated total annual NPP of all Ant Forest areas was 1.06 x 10(11) gC, and an obvious increasing trend in NPP from 2016 to 2020 was observed, indicating effective carbon sequestration. We found that Hippophae rhamnoides and Caragana korshinskii had carbon sink advantages over other shrubs due to their higher NPP values per unit area. By strengthening individuals' low-carbon awareness for reducing carbon emissions and increasing forest NPP to enhance the carbon sink, Ant Forest uses a representative and inspirational 'Internet plus Ecology' framework that has much significance for achieving carbon neutrality in China and tackling global climate change.

AB  - The environmental and climatic evolution of the late Middle Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene of the Garraf Massif (northeastern Iberia) is determined for Marine Isotope Stage 7 (MIS 7) to MIS 3 on the basis of a study of the small-vertebrate (amphibian, squamate reptile, insectivore, bat and rodent) assemblages. This paper provides a synthesis of three previously published and one partially published sets of environmental and climatic data from the Middle to Upper Paleolithic sites of Cova del Rinoceront, Cova del Gegant, Cova del Coll Verdaguer and Terrasses de la Riera dels Canyars, all of which are located in the Garraf Massif mountain range. Using the habitat weighting and mutual ecogeographic range methods to reconstruct the environmental and climatic parameters, the results show great variability in the landscape and climate of the area. However, although the human occupation is not intense in the analyzed sites, the various layers of the sites in which the human presence is relatively more intense coincide with landscapes dominated by woodland formations in mild climatic conditions. A comparison of our results with those from other sites with studies of small vertebrates in Greece, Italy, southern France, and the Iberian Peninsula reveals the same pattern, showing that the hominins that inhabited the western Mediterranean region in the late Middle Pleistocene and Late Pleistocene were closely related to forested areas. 0 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Ungulate behavior is often characterized as balancing selection for forage and avoidance of predation risk. Within partially migratory ungulate populations, this balancing occurs across multiple spatial scales, potentially resulting in different exposure to costs and benefits between migrants and residents. We assessed how availability and selection of forage and risk from predators varied between summer ranges of migrant and resident mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; a species in which individual migratory strategies are generally fixed for life) in 3 study areas in western Montana, USA, during summers 2017-2019. We hypothesized that mule deer would face a tradeoff between selecting forage and avoiding predation risk, and that migration and residency would pose contrasting availability of forage and risk at a broad (summer range) spatial scale. We hypothesized deer exposed to lower forage at a given spatial scale would compensate for reduced availability by increasing selection of forage at the cost of reduced avoidance of predators, a mechanism whereby migrants and residents could potentially achieve similar exposure to forage despite disparate availability. We compared the availability of forage (kcal/m(2)) and predation risk from wolves (Canis lupus) and mountain lions (Puma concolor) between summer ranges of each migratory strategy, then assessed how selection for those factors at the home range (second order) and within-home range (third order) scales varied using resource selection functions (RSFs). As forage availability increased among mule deer summer ranges and individual home ranges, selection for forage decreased at the second-order (P = 0.052) and third-order (P = 0.081) scales, respectively, but avoidance of predators varied weakly. In 1 study area, summer range of residents contained lower forage and higher risk than summer range of migrants, but residents compensated for this disadvantage through stronger selection of forage and avoidance of risk at finer spatial scales. In the other 2 study areas, summer range of migrants contained lower forage and higher risk than residents, but migrants did not compensate through stronger selection for beneficial resources. The majority of mule deer in our study system were migratory, though the benefits of migration were unclear, suggesting partial migration may persist in populations even when exposure to forage and predation risk appears unequal between strategies.

AB  - The omnipresence of microplastic (MP) particles in environmental matrices of rivers is on the rise and has become a focal point of aquatic research. The study investigated the spatiotemporal distribution of MPs and adsorption of heavy metals (HMs) in the Buffalo River of South Africa. The findings of the study showed that a sum of 874 MPs was enumerated from the samples collected in the river system. The MP particles ranged between 0.35-0.75 particles<middle dot>L-1 during the dry winter and 0.3-0.9 particles<middle dot>L-1 in wet summer seasons in surface water. The range in sediments was 3-32 particles<middle dot>kg(-1) and 2-23 particles<middle dot>kg(-1) during the dry winter and wet summer seasons, respectively. The results showed that temporal rainfall patterns had a significant (p = 0.009 < 0.05) influence on MP abundances in sediments. Fibers and fragments were the main shapes, while polyethylene and polypropylene were ubiquitous. HMs such as nickel, copper, and iron with concentrations of 36.49 +/- 3.96, 14.33 +/- 0.87, and 356.47 +/- 73.66 <mu>g<middle dot>g(-1) were adsorbed on surfaces of the microplastics, with iron being strongly correlated with the 3 mm and 1 mm size fractions and copper with the 2 mm fraction. The study has provided insights into the influence of climatic conditions on MP abundances and how plastics adsorb chemical pollutants such as HMs in environmental conditions. Moreover, the study has yielded baseline data on MP pollution in Buffalo River, which is helpful to the relevant authorities of the country's ongoing River Health Program.

AB  - Globalization has led to a significant increase in the establishment of forest plantations with exotic species and to the accidental introduction of forest insects worldwide. Cumulatively, these factors contribute to the increased occurrence of novel associations between phytophagous insects and trees, leading to new interactions between species that have not historically co-occurred. Here, we reviewed the patterns of novel associations between herbivorous insects and pines and eucalypts at a global scale and identified factors that could favor the occurrence of novel associations and their impacts on forestry. We recorded 766 novel associations of insects with pines and 356 with eucalypts, involving 852 species of herbivorous insects. Most of the novel associations occurred in the Neotropic, Austro-Pacific, and Palearctic regions. In all biogeographic regions, novel associations involved mostly native insects on exotic trees, except for the Nearctic, where exotic insects were dominant. Generalist insects were more frequently involved in novel associations, but specialist ones caused higher damage levels. Foliage feeders and wood and phloem feeders were the most frequent feeding guilds involved in new associations, while sap feeders, shoot feeders, and fruit and seed feeders were rare. For pines, non-native insects were more frequently associated with trees phylogenetically related to hosts in their native range, and native insects were more frequently associated with unrelated hosts. However, for both exotic and native insects, novel associations with eucalypts primarily involved hosts that are unrelated to hosts in their native range. The significance of extensive forest plantations with non-native species and the biogeographic context are emphasized as factors associated with the occurrence of novel associations between insects and trees. This study highlights the importance of international collaboration in forest insect monitoring and surveillance programs to facilitate the early detection of novel associations as an important first step toward minimizing their impact.

AB  - Context Habitat loss and fragmentation are major threats to global biodiversity, especially for wide-ranging apex carnivores. The Persian leopard (Panthera pardus saxicolor) is an endangered species. Although populations of Persian leopards are declining, the species remains widely distributed across large areas of Iran. Aims This study aimed to determine habitat suitability for Persian leopards in the Khaeiz and Sorkh protected area of south-western Iran and to identify the most significant factors influencing their habitat use/selection and spatial distribution. Methods We performed species distribution modelling in two stages: First, we ran the model with three abiotic predictors: slope; aspect; and distance from water resources. In the second stage, modelling was conducted using three ecological predictors: caracal distribution; wild goat distribution; and livestock distribution. Ensemble modelling was applied based on five replicates of eight SDMs (species distribution models; GLM, CTA, FDA, GBM, ANN, MARS, RF and MaxEnt). Key results We observed only minor differences in habitat suitability between the abiotic and ecological models. Habitat suitability for Persian leopards was higher in steeper areas, close to water resources and near the distribution of caracals, livestock and wild goats. The ecological model predicted 2.03% (329 ha) more suitable habitat than the abiotic model did. Conclusions Most habitat suitability models focus on abiotic variables, but we found that ecological variables offer similar predictive power for determining the habitat suitability of Persian leopards. Implications Habitat suitability models for Persian leopards can be used to guide conservation and management decisions. They are also useful indicating where conflicts between predators and humans may occur.

AB  - Despite the ongoing collapse of native mammal populations across northern Australia, the paucity of robust estimates of population density limits our capacity to identify and understand population change. Here we aimed to provide the first estimates of native mammal density on the Tiwi Islands one of Australia's largest remaining refuge areas for native mammals. We conducted intensive live-trapping at four sites that represent varying combinations of fire frequency, feral cat density and feral herbivore presence. We used spatially-explicit capture-recapture models to investigate the density of common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula) and northern brown bandicoot (Isoodon macrourus). Compared with mainland northern Australia, populations of common brushtail possum and northern brown bandicoot have remained relatively healthy on the Tiwi Islands. Common brushtail possum density was significantly higher on Bathurst Island (1.06 possum ha(-1)) compared with Melville Island (0.32 possum ha(-1)), whereas northern brown bandicoot density varied across all four sites (ranging from 0.04 to 0.34 bandicoot ha(-1)). Unexpectedly, the very frequently burnt Ranku site (Bathurst Island) continues to support healthy populations of both species. These density estimates provide critical information for identifying and understanding future population change for two species that have suffered marked declines across the Australian monsoon tropics. Although the lack of replication limits our ability to draw conclusions regarding the ecological constraints of these mammal populations, our density observations align with a recent conceptual model postulating that the persistence of native mammal populations across northern Australian savannas reflects a complex, but spatially-variable interplay of 'bottom-up' and 'top-down' processes.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate if Sargassum-associated herbivorous amphipods Cymadusa filosa Savigny, 1816 and Sunamphitoe pelagica (H. Milne Edwards, 1830) present differences in their population parameters at sites located at different distances from a state marina, which is the main source of pollution (especially heavy metals) in an impacted bay. The study was conducted at four beach sites within Flamengo Bay, Ubatuba municipality, northern coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The beaches are Lamberto and Ribeira close to the pollution source and Flamengo and Santa Rita, which are more distant. We observed the predominance of juveniles in the populations of C. filosa and S. pelagica, followed by females, with the sex ratio for both species being favored toward females, and the highest densities of individuals were observed during the summer. Sunamphitoe pelagica presented lower density, smaller ovigerous females and egg volumes at Lamberto beach, indicating a possible higher sensitivity to metal pollution for this species. Cymadusa filosa showed no clear alteration of density, number of ovigerous females and egg volumes between sites. Our results emphasize the importance of studying the life history and reproductive parameters of herbivorous amphipods, showing how these parameters can be altered in contaminated areas.

AB  - The socio-economic aspects of the people who directly share space with elephants not only influence the occurrence of human-elephant conflict (HEC) but also shape their sentiments towards coexistence with elephants. The objectives of this paper are to (i) assess the demographic situation and map people's sentiments towards elephants in the HEC hotspot villages of the Keonjhar forest division in India and (ii) rank the most suitable policy instruments and the urgency of mitigation strategies. The results indicated that cultivation and marginal agriculture were positively related with HEC incidences, whereas literacy and employment were negatively associated. Despite being severely affected by human-elephant conflict, many of the respondents (78%) in the HEC hotspot regions still had positive sentiments towards elephants. According to expert opinions, strengthening of laws regarding land use facilitation and interlinking conservation values to socio-cultural aspects need urgent implementation in order to balance infrastructural development and protection of ecosystems by enhancing community participation. Communal crop guarding, chilly-dung and honeybee fencing, accompanied by tracking and maintaining an elephant locational database are suggested as the HEC mitigation methods with highest urgency.

AB  - Understanding how human activity can influence species distributions and spatial niche partitioning between sympatric species is a key area of contemporary ecology. Extirpations of large mammalian populations, the result of a 15-year civil war, within the Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique, have been followed by an extended period of restoration. The species-specific recovery of these populations has provided an ideal system to identify how niche partitioning between coexisting species is altered as a consequence of extreme disturbance events. Here, we aimed to understand how distribution patterns of grazing herbivores, as well as spatial niche overlap between them, changed between the pre- and post-war scenarios. We focused on the following four grazer species: buffalo (Syncerus caffer); sable (Hippotragus niger); waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus); and zebra (Equus quagga). Using long-term aerial survey data, we quantified range size for each species, as well as spatial niche overlap between each species pair, for pre- and post-war periods. Range size of buffalo and zebra decreased drastically from the pre-war period; with both species inhabiting subsets of their historical distribution in the park. Sable and waterbuck have both colonised historically avoided habitat, with waterbuck doubling their pre-war range size. Spatial overlap between all four grazers pre-war was significantly high, indicating niche similarity; however, this decreased in the post-war period, with some species pairs displaying spatial niche dissimilarity. Our findings highlight how population responses to anthropogenic disturbance can result in significant alterations to species' distributions, with consequences for patterns of niche similarity.

AB  - Camera trapping has revolutionized wildlife ecology and conservation by providing automated data acquisition, leading to the accumulation of massive amounts of camera trap data worldwide. Although management and processing of camera trap-derived Big Data are becoming increasingly solvable with the help of scalable cyber-infrastructures, harmonization and exchange of the data remain limited, hindering its full potential. There is currently no widely accepted standard for exchanging camera trap data. The only existing proposal, "Camera Trap Metadata Standard" (CTMS), has several technical shortcomings and limited adoption. We present a new data exchange format, the Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP), designed to allow users to easily exchange, harmonize and archive camera trap data at local to global scales. Camtrap DP structures camera trap data in a simple yet flexible data model consisting of three tables (Deployments, Media and Observations) that supports a wide range of camera deployment designs, classification techniques (e.g., human and AI, media-based and event-based) and analytical use cases, from compiling species occurrence data through distribution, occupancy and activity modeling to density estimation. The format further achieves interoperability by building upon existing standards, Frictionless Data Package in particular, which is supported by a suite of open software tools to read and validate data. Camtrap DP is the consensus of a long, in-depth, consultation and outreach process with standard and software developers, the main existing camera trap data management platforms, major players in the field of camera trapping and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Under the umbrella of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), Camtrap DP has been developed openly, collaboratively and with version control from the start. We encourage camera trapping users and developers to join the discussion and contribute to the further development and adoption of this standard.
   We present a new data exchange format for camera trap data, the Camera Trap Data Package (Camtrap DP; ), designed to allow users to easily exchange, harmonize and archive camera trap data at local to global scales. Camtrap DP is being developed under the umbrella of the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), and through outreach and collaboration, it is now supported by GBIF. Importantly, Camtrap DP is the consensus of a long, in depth consultation process among the main existing camera trap data management platforms, as well as some of the major global players in the field of camera trapping. As an open, evolving standard for the FAIR exchange and archive of camera trap data, Camtrap DP represents an important step towards a global data sharing workflow with rapid results and thus more timely science based wildlife management recommendations.image

AB  - Communities are shaped by a variety of ecological and environmental processes, each acting at different spatial scales. Seminal research on rocky shores highlighted the effects of consumers as local determinants of primary productivity and community assembly. However, it is now clear that the species interactions shaping communities at local scales are themselves regulated by large-scale oceanographic processes that generate regional variation in resource availability. Upwelling events deliver nutrient-rich water to coastal ecosystems, influencing primary productivity and algae-herbivore interactions. Despite the potential for upwelling to alter top-down control by herbivores, we know relatively little about the coupling between oceanographic processes and herbivory on tropical rocky shores, where herbivore effects on producers are considered to be strong and nutrient levels are considered to be limiting. By replicating seasonal molluscan herbivore exclusion experiments across three regions exposed to varying intensity of seasonal upwelling, separated by hundreds of kilometers along Panama's Pacific coast, we examine large-scale environmental determinants of consumer effects and community structure on tropical rocky shores. At sites experiencing seasonal upwelling, grazers strongly limited macroalgal cover when upwelling was absent, leading to dominance by crustose algae. As nutrients increased and surface water cooled during upwelling events, increases in primary productivity temporarily weakened herbivory, allowing foliose, turf and filamentous algae to replace crusts. Meanwhile, grazer effects were persistently strong at sites without seasonal upwelling. Our results confirm that herbivores are key determinants of tropical algal cover, and that the mollusk grazing guild can control initial stages of macroalgal succession. However, our focus on regional oceanographic conditions revealed that bottom-up processes regulate top-down control on tropical shorelines. This study expands on the extensive body of work highlighting the influence of upwelling on local ecological processes by demonstrating that nutrient subsidies delivered by upwelling events can weaken herbivory in tropical rocky shores.

AB  - Many types of livestock waste can be treated with insect larvae; however, in-depth research on the decomposition ability of Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis (PBS) larvae and the characteristics of manure after treatment with PBS is extremely limited. Therefore, this study examined the decomposition ability and survival rates of different instars of PBS larvae and their effects on the characteristics and pathogen counts of pig manure. Two treatments were designed: 1 kg of second instar or third instar PBS larvae per 10 kg of pig manure. Pig manure did not affect the decomposing capacity and survival rates of the two PBS larval instar groups (P > 0.05). However, the decomposition abilities of the different PBS larval instar groups on days 2, 7 and 8 significantly differed (P < 0.05). Over time, the changes observed in pH, moisture, total nitrogen, acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and hemicelluloses did not significantly differ (P > 0.05) between treatments using second or third instar PBS larvae. On day 15, both total nitrogen and NDF significantly differed (P < 0.05) between the two treatment groups. During the experimental period, no significant (P > 0.05) change in Escherichia coli or Salmonella counts was observed in pig manure treated with different PBS larval instars. Our findings suggest that the decomposition abilities and survival rates of larvae and pig manure characteristics and pathogen counts do not differ for different PBS larval instar stages.

AB  - Seagrass-herbivore interactions play a principal role in regulating the structure and function of coastal food webs, which were affected by nutrient enrichment. Seawater nutrient enrichment might change seagrass palatability by altering seagrass physical and chemical traits, consequently modulating herbivory patterns, but this remains elusive. In this study, the dominant tropical seagrass Thalassia hemprichii was cultured in different ammonium concentrations to examine the response of seagrass nutritional quality, deterrent secondary metab-olites, and leaf toughness, as well as the subsequent effect of the changed physical (e.g., leaf toughness) and chemical traits (e.g., nitrogen content; total phenol) on the grazing activity of the herbivorous snail Cerithidea rhizophorarum. Ammonium enrichment enhanced seagrass nutritional quality and decreased physical defence. Low ammonium enrichment increased total phenol content, while high ammonium enrichment reduced it. Both low and high ammonium enrichment enhanced the grazing intensity of C. rhizophorarum on seagrass. Interest-ingly, nutritional quality mostly determined the herbivory preference of C. rhizophorarum on the intact seagrass having physical structure, with a chemical deterrent (total phenol) playing a secondary role. In contrast, chemical deterrent mainly determined the grazing intensity on agar seagrass food which was made artificially to exclude physical structure. This indicated that seagrass leaf physical structure might hinder phenol compounds from deterring herbivores. Overall, the results presented here demonstrate that ammonium enrichment remarkably increased seagrass palatability and subsequently induced higher susceptibility to herbivory, which might induce seagrass loss.

AB  - Although annual return of litter occurs in tea (Camellia sinensis L.) plantations, the level of soil organic carbon (SOC) therein remains relatively low. The exact impacts of pruned litter on soil and its association with SOC accumulation in tea plantations remain unclear. In this study, we prepared C-13-labeled tea plant material and incubated it with soils collected at a tea plantation. Carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux and its sources were measured and distinguished based on the C-13 isotopic method. Soil microbial community and the utilization of litter C were assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis combined with a stable isotope probing (SIP) technique. Litter incorporation initially significantly increased CO2 efflux. The majority of CO2 production (>90%) arose from native SOC mineralization, which was reflected by a strong positive priming effect (PE) that decreased over time. During the incubation period, beta-glucosidase activity significantly decreased in both the control and litter-amended soil. A significant difference in the microbial community was observed between control and litter-amended soil, in which litter incorporation significantly increased the biomass of each microbial group relative to control soil. Based on PLFA-SIP, 78% of the C incorporated into individual microbes was derived from native SOC, while only 22% was derived from litter. Additionally, partial least squares regression path modeling (PLS-PM) revealed that the microbes associated with native SOC mineralization directly affected the changes in SOC (Delta CSOC+litter), whereas microbes related to litter degradation exhibited an indirect effect on Delta CSOC+litter by affecting beta-glucosidase activity under litter incorporation. Taken together, SOC accumulated less in the tea plantation system despite the annual return of pruned litter to the field.

AB  - In 2001 and 2002, 52 elk (Cervus canadensis; 21 males, 31 females), originally obtained from Elk Island National Park, Alberta, Canada, were transported and released into Cataloochee Valley in the northeastern portion of Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM, Park), North Carolina, USA. The annual population growth rate (lambda) was negative (0.996, 95% CI = 0.945-1.047) and predation by black bears (Ursus americanus) on elk calves was identified as an important determinant of population growth. From 2006 to 2008, 49 bears from the primary elk calving area (i.e., Cataloochee Valley) were trapped and translocated about 70 km to the southwestern portion of the Park just prior to elk calving. Per capita recruitment (i.e., the number of calves produced per adult female that survive to 1 year of age) increased from 0.306 prior to bear translocation (2001-2005) to 0.544 during years when bears were translocated (2006-2008) and lambda increased to 1.118 (95% CI = 1.096-1.140). Our objective was to determine whether per capita calf recruitment rates after bear removal (2009-2019) at Cataloochee were similar to the higher rates estimated during bear removal (i.e., long-term response) or if they returned to rates before bear removal (i.e., short-term response), and how those rates compared with recruitment from portions of our study area where bears were not relocated. We documented 419 potential elk calving events and monitored 129 yearling and adult elk from 2001 to 2019. Known-fate models based on radio-telemetry and observational data supported calf recruitment returning to pre-2006 levels at Cataloochee (short-term response); recruitment of Cataloochee elk before and after bear relocation was lower (0.184) than during bear relocation (0.492). Recruitment rates of elk outside the removal area during the bear relocation period (0.478) were similar to before and after rates (0.420). In the Cataloochee Valley, cause-specific annual calf mortality rates due to predation by bears were 0.319 before, 0.120 during, and 0.306 after bear relocation. In contrast, the cause-specific annual mortality rate of calves in areas where bears were not relocated was 0.033 after the bear relocation period, with no bear predation on calves before or during bear relocation. The mean annual population growth rate for all monitored elk was 1.062 (95% CI = 0.979-1.140) after bear relocation based on the recruitment and survival data. Even though the effects of bear removal were temporary, the relocations were effective in achieving a short-term increase in elk recruitment, which was important for the reintroduction program given that the elk population was small and vulnerable to extirpation.

AB  - The Asian subterranean termite (AST), Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann), is a major structural pest in the world's humid tropics. After its 1999 discovery in Key West, Florida, a survey of buildings infested with AST was initiated. By 2021, a total of 1,703 terrestrial AST encounters were accumulated and used to assess the spatio-temporal spread of AST throughout Key West and adjacent Stock Island between 2005 (which consolidates sightings between 1999 and 2005) and 2021. A lattice-based simulation model was run using selected ecological parameters to predict the infestation locations of AST on Key West from initial encounter points. The distances between annual AST encounters and the nearest marine dockage were compared with the distances between random locations in built areas and the nearest marine dockage. Results show that for the majority of the first ten years up to 2014, the median distance between AST encounters and nearest dockage was significantly smaller than between random points and nearest dockage, but after 2016 encounters became significantly larger for most years. This supports the hypothesis that AST infestations originated from marine dockage (i.e., infested boats). The gradual spread to inland infestations on the island was reflected by a shift of the annual centroid locations westward where domicile density is the greatest. The simulation underestimated the actual extent of infestation in 2021, suggesting secondary non-marine infestation foci. It was concluded that infested trees, for which no records were available, were probably the secondary source of AST spread, and that cryptic tree infestations may have facilitated this accelerated spread. The gradual growth and spread of infested areas were reflected in an increased radius of gyration for annual infested point locations, which also indicated that the AST sites reached saturation and stabilized during the last few years of analysis.

AB  - In high-transmission endemic regions, local populations of Plasmodium falciparum exhibit vast diversity of the var genes encoding its major surface antigen, with each parasite comprising multiple copies from this diverse gene pool. This strategy to evade the immune system through large combinatorial antigenic diversity is common to other hyperdiverse pathogens. It underlies a series of fundamental epidemiological characteristics, including large reservoirs of transmission from high prevalence of asymptomatics and long-lasting infections. Previous theory has shown that negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) mediated by the acquisition of specific immunity by hosts structures the diversity of var gene repertoires, or strains, in a pattern of limiting similarity that is both non-random and non-neutral. A combination of stochastic agent-based models and network analyses has enabled the development and testing of theory in these complex adaptive systems, where assembly of local parasite diversity occurs under frequency-dependent selection and large pools of variation. We show here the application of these approaches to theory comparing the response of the malaria transmission system to intervention when strain diversity is assembled under (competition-based) selection vs. a form of neutrality, where immunity depends only on the number but not the genetic identity of previous infections. The transmission system is considerably more persistent under NFDS, exhibiting a lower extinction probability despite comparable prevalence during intervention. We explain this pattern on the basis of the structure of strain diversity, in particular the more pronounced fraction of highly dissimilar parasites. For simulations that survive intervention, prevalence under specific immunity is lower than under neutrality, because the recovery of diversity is considerably slower than that of prevalence and decreased var gene diversity reduces parasite transmission. A Principal Component Analysis of network features describing parasite similarity reveals that despite lower overall diversity, NFDS is quickly restored after intervention constraining strain structure and maintaining patterns of limiting similarity important to parasite persistence. Given the described enhanced persistence under perturbation, intervention efforts will likely require longer times than the usual practice to eliminate P. falciparum populations. We discuss implications of our findings and potential analogies for ecological communities with non-neutral assembly processes involving frequency-dependence.

AB  - Over the years, Indian farmers have leveraged their ancestral know-how and experimented to cultivate different crops in difficult environmental conditions. Of late, however, traditional knowledge and practices have suffered massive erosion, mainly due to the impact of globalization and modernization. In this regard, the objective of the present paper was to document and validate the Indigenous Technical Knowledge (ITKs) in the tribal farming system in Himachal Pradesh. Kinnaur and Lahaul-Spiti districts of Himachal Pradesh were purposively selected for the study owing to their special status of Scheduled Tribal Area. Further, three villages from each district were selected randomly covering a sample of 120 farmers. In addition, 5 key informants experienced in particular ITKs were selected from each village for its validation through Quantification of Indigenous Knowledge (QuIK) methodology. The major documented ITKs were classified into appropriate categories such as soil and water management, cropping system, farm implements, post-harvest technology, storage, horticultural crops, food product development, agro-animal based yarns and leaves, medicinal, veterinary science, animal husbandry, and some myths. Further, Kothar, Graat, Suttar, tying of branches of trees, and chicha were revealed as the most useful ITKs in the tribal areas of Kinnaur. In Lahaul-Spiti, Khudh, Sumbhu, Sem, and shaving off of yak's hair in summer were the most popular ITKs.

AB  - Tropical plants are expected to have a higher variety of defensive traits, such as a more diverse array of secondary metabolic compounds in response to greater pressures of antagonistic interactions, than their temperate counterparts. We test this hypothesis using advanced metabolomics linked to a novel stoichiometric compound classification to analyze the complete foliar metabolomes of four tropical and four temperate tree species, which were selected so that each subset contained the same amount of phylogenetic diversity and evenness. We then built Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models to test for tropical-temperate differences in metabolite diversity for the entire metabolome and for four major families of secondary compounds. We found strong evidence supporting that the leaves of tropical tree species have a higher phenolic diversity. The functionally closer group of polyphenolics also showed moderate evidence of higher diversity in tropical species, but there were no differences either for the entire metabolome or for the other major families of compounds analyzed. This supports the interpretation that this tropical-temperate contrast must be related to the functional role of phenolics and polyphenolics.

AB  - Changes in the risk of exposure to infectious disease agents can be tracked through variations in antibody prevalence in vertebrate host populations. However, information on the temporal dynamics of the immune status of individuals is critical. If antibody levels persist a long time after exposure to an infectious agent, they could enable the efficient detection of the past circulation of the agent; if they persist only a short time, they could provide snap shots of recent exposure of sampled hosts. Here, we explored the temporal dynamics of seropositivity against Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) in individuals of a widespread medium-sized mammal species, the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), in France. Using a modified commercially available immunoassay we tested 1554 blood samples obtained in two wild deer populations monitored from 2010 to 2020. Using multi-event capture-mark-recapture models, we estimated yearly population-, age-, and sex-specific rates of seroconversion and seroreversion after accounting for imperfect detection. The yearly seroconversion rates indicated a higher level of exposure in early (2010-2013) than in late years (2014-2019) to infected tick bites in both populations, without any detectable influence of sex or age. The relatively high rates of seroreversion indicated a short-term persistence of antibody levels against Bbsl in roe deer. This was confirmed by the analysis of samples collected on a set of captive individuals that were resampled several times a few weeks apart. Our findings show the potential usefulness of deer as a sentinel for tracking the risk of exposure to Lyme disease Bbsl, although further investigation on the details of the antibody response to Bbsl in this incompetent host would be useful. Our study also highlights the value of combining long-term capture-mark-recapture sampling and short-time analyses of serological data for wildlife populations exposed to infectious agents of relevance to wildlife epidemiology and human health.

AB  - The Pyrenean capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus aquitanicus) is a forest obligate grouse that has experienced a marked population decline in recent decades owing to the lack of optimal habitats. However, the effect of forest structure on potential predators and habitat competitors has not been well-studied. We conducted a camera-trapping study at three conservation areas in Huesca province (northeastern Spain), which were classified as 'optimal', 'favorable', and 'unfavorable' based on habitat suitability for the capercaillie. This study was conducted for 3417 days at a total of 130 camera locations in autumn-winter and spring-summer, capturing 8757 valid photos. In total, 36 different species were recorded. The most frequently detected species were Southern chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica pyrenaica; 32.6%), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus; 18%), wild boar (Sus scrofa; 9.6%), red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris; 6.1%), mustelids (5.6%), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes; 4.8%). Capercaillies were photographed in the optimal and favorable habitat areas. Nest predators, such as mustelids and red fox, were more frequently detected in the favorable area during autumn-winter and in the optimal area in spring-summer, while corvids were more frequently detected in the unfavorable habitat area during both periods. No clear pattern was found for wild boar (nest predator and habitat competitor) or cervids (competitors). As capercaillie coexist with a wide range of predators and competitors, and habitat structure may not always explain species relative abundance, factors such as disturbance and food resources should be also taken into account when aiming to develop targeted management for the benefit of the capercaillie.

AB  - Outbreaks of eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; hereafter SBW) are a major natural disturbance in coniferous forests of eastern North America. These outbreaks provide a superabundant source of food for insectivorous birds. Three species, referred to as budworm-linked warblers, exhibit strong positive numerical responses to early increases of SBW density: Tennessee Warbler (Leiothlypis peregrina), Cape May Warbler (Setophaga tigrina), and Bay-breasted Warbler (S. castanea). Their abundance increases even before defoliation is visible from aerial surveys. Budworm-linked warblers may detect new epicenters of SBW outbreaks through natal dispersal, as this movement is typically much more extensive than subsequent (breeding dispersal) movements. Our main objectives were, thus, (1) to determine whether sudden increases in the abundance of budworm-linked warblers could be used to detect early stages of SBW outbreaks, and (2) to examine age-specific responses of budworm-linked warblers to local and landscape-level habitat characteristics, in order to investigate the potential role of natal dispersal in the detection of new epicenters. To do so, we estimated the abundance of each species of budworm-linked warbler in 75 study plots sampling a gradient of SBW density and related them to 7 stand variables and landscape metrics with generalized additive mixed models. We also compared the responses of yearling (second-year; SY) and older (after-second-year; ASY) individuals to the density of SBW larvae and habitat variables at different spatial scales. We captured 31 Tennessee Warblers, 27 Cape May Warblers, and 57 Bay-breasted Warblers. The abundance of all three species of budworm-linked warblers increased with SBW larval density, but the numerical response of Bay-breasted Warbler was initiated earlier and it varied with age. SY individuals tended to be associated with stands supporting lower larval densities than ASY individuals and, as suggested by other authors, Bay-breasted Warbler appeared to be more efficient at exploiting SBW larvae at low density. For that reason, this species represents an early indicator of stands undergoing SBW outbreaks and we propose to use its abundance as an indicator to orient labour-intensive ground surveys of SBW larvae.

AB  - Chondrichthyes, an ancient and diverse class of vertebrates, are crucial to the health of marine ecosystems. Excessive demand for chondrichthyan products has increased fishing pressure, threatening similar to 30% of species with extinction in recent decades. India is the second-largest shark landing nation globally and the province of Gujarat, is the largest contributor to its shark exports. Despite their significant contribution to global fish supplies, chondrichthyan fisheries in Gujarat remain understudied and many species, data deficient, posing challenges to the conservation of remaining populations in the region. Here, we report results from taxonomic assessment of elasmobranchs at four key landing sites in Gujarat. We identified thirty-one species of sharks and rays with a significant bias toward capture of females and juveniles by fisheries. Our data indicate the presence of nursery areas for species such as Sphyrna lewini and Rhynchobatus laevis in the neritic areas off Gujarat. Further, we discovered extensions of the current distribution range for three species -Torpedo sinuspersici, Carcharhinus sorrah, and Rhinobatos punctifer. Taxonomic identities for a subset of species were confirmed using genomic analyses conducted with portable DNA sequencing tools. We present assessments for six data deficient species in the region - Rhinobatos annandalei, Rhinoptera jayakari, Maculabatis bineeshi, Pateobatis bleekeri, T. sinuspersici, and Carcharhinus amboinensis. Our investigation underscores species with urgent conservation needs and reduces data deficiencies. These data will inform and pivot future scientific and conservation efforts to protect remaining populations of some of the most vulnerable Chondrichthyes in the Arabian Seas Region.

AB  - Objective: Lop sheep species exhibit remarkable adaptability to desert pastures and extreme arid climates, demonstrating tolerance to rough feeding and high resistance to stress. However, little is known about the population genetic diversity of Lop sheep and the genetic mechanisms underlying their adaptability to extreme environments. Methods: Blood samples were collected from a total of 110 individuals comprising 80 Ruoqiang Lop sheep and 30 Yuli Lop sheep. A total of 110 Lop sheep were subjected to whole genome resequencing to analyze genetic diversity, population structure, and signatures of selection in both regions. Results: The genetic diversity of the Lop sheep population is substantial, and the degree of inbreeding is low. In comparison to the Lop sheep in Yuli County, the genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium analysis results for the Lop sheep population in Ruoqiang County are slightly lower. Population structure analysis indicates that Ruoqiang and Yuli Lop sheep have differentiated into two independent groups. Using Yuli Lop sheep as the reference group, an analysis of the extreme environmental adaptability selection signal of Lop sheep was conducted. The FST and pi ratio under the 1% threshold identified 1686 and 863 candidate genes, respectively, with their intersection yielding a total of 122 candidate genes. Functional annotation revealed that these genes are associated with various traits, including immune response (SLC12A2, FOXP1, PANX1, DYNLRB2, RAP1B, and SEMA4D), heat and cold resistance (DNAJC13, PLCB1, HIKESHI, and PITPNC1), desert adaptation (F13A1, PANX1, ST6GAL1, STXBP3, ACTN4, and ATP6V1A), and reproductive performance (RAP1B, RAB6A, PLCB1, and METTL15). Conclusions: These research findings provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the survival and reproductive characteristics of Lop sheep in extreme environments, and they hold practical value for the conservation and utilization of Lop sheep genetic resources, as well as for genetic improvement efforts.

AB  - Simple Summary Large mammals' behavioral responses to humans as predators may be impacted by hunting intensity. Using a playback experiment, we found that two wild ungulates exhibited reactive (flee) rather than proactive responses (decrease habitat use) to human vocalizations at a hunting-prohibited site in North China. The wild ungulates had equal or even higher flight probabilities upon hearing vocalizations of humans than the native extant large carnivore (leopard). We also found habituation-type responses featured as progressively decreased responses to the vocalizations in both ungulates. Large mammals can perceive humans as predators and therefore adjust their behavior to achieve coexistence with humans. However, lack of research at sites with low hunting intensity limits our understanding of how behavioral responses of animals adapt to different predation risks by humans. At Heshun County in North China, where hunting has been banned for over three decades and only low-intensity poaching exists, we exposed two large ungulates (Siberian roe deer Capreolus pygarus and wild boar Sus scrofa) to the sounds of humans, an extant predator (leopard Panthera pardus) and a control (wind), and examined their flight responses and detection probabilities when hearing different type of sounds. Both species showed higher flight probabilities when hearing human vocalization than wind, and wild boar were even more likely to flee upon hearing human vocalization than leopard roar, suggesting the behavioral response to humans can equal or exceed that of large carnivores in these two ungulates even in an area without hunting practices. Recorded sounds had no effect on detection probability of both ungulates. Additionally, with repeated exposure to sounds, regardless of treatment, roe deer were less likely to flee and wild boars were more likely to be detected, indicating a habituation-type response to sound stimuli. We speculate that the immediate flight behavior rather than shifts in habitat use of the two species reflect the low hunting/poaching pressure at our study site and suggest further examination of physiological status and demographic dynamics of the study species to understand human influence on their long-term persistence.

AB  - Papers arguing for Malagasy central highlands (MCH) as natural grassland rely disproportionally on a single reference (Bond et al. 2008, The antiquity of Madagascar's grasslands and the rise of C4 grassy biomes. Journal of Biogeography, 35, 1743-1758). The paper argues that (1) evolution of endemic grassland specialist fauna, (2) paleoecological findings and (3) existence of subfossil C-4-grazers provide evidence that when humans entered the MCH around 2000 years before present (BP), it was a natural, ancient grassland. Respectfully, we find discrepancies between that study and its sources: (1) proportions of endemic grassland-limited species are 17-fold greater than original data (which show 87% of species are forest-limited and 2% [not 32%] are grassland-limited); (2) paleodata relevant to human-influenced timeframes are omitted; and (3) the hippo specimen used to invoke existence of ancient C-4-grazers was the common hippo from mainland Africa, circa 1950. We conclude that the paper's findings are unsupported, and MCH grasslands are likely anthropogenic.

AB  - Understanding how environmental stressors impact fisheries is imperative for the sustainable management of our marine resources. Synchrony in inter-annual growth patterns among individuals and populations has been identified across large spatial scales, both within and among species. This synchrony indicates a detectable sensitivity to changes in climatic or environmental conditions. We explored within-region effects of environmental and climatic variability using inter-annual otolith growth rates (increments) in a tropical coral reef fish, Naso unicornis. Dendrochronology techniques were applied to remove age-specific growth effects and extract a high-frequency variability signal indicative of short-term environmental change. Using linear mixed-effects models, we identified best predictors of the variation in growth at two adjacent latitude subsets in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. We found different latitude subset growth responses for the years 2000-2013 and 2005-2017, indicating independent fluctuations in growth across latitude however, synchrony was present among individuals within a latitude range. Local environmental processes were more important than regional climatic processes for explaining N. unicornis growth in the north, but in the central islands, neither process had a clear effect. Otolith growth in fish inhabiting the north had a positive response to increased annual average sea surface temperature (SST). In adjacent central islands, otolith growth responded negatively to warmer winter SST. Baseline information for most fisheries on the direct impact of external forcings on fish, especially in tropical coral reef fisheries, remains sparse. We provide information on how climate and environment have impacted past growth with implications for future fisheries productivity monitoring.

AB  - Trophic structures, i.e., the diets, food chain positions, and feeding relationships of species in an ecological community, are a fundamental yet understudied avenue of investigation into Australian megafauna extinction. Calcium (Ca) isotope analysis has been developed as a tool to reconstruct trophic levels in vertebrate palaeobiology and palaeoecology. A baseline of modern marsupial Ca isotope signatures in a single trophic level and dietary niche is required to successfully apply this tool in order to reconstruct Australian faunal food webs.
   We present Ca isotope data from dental enamel of modern Tasmanian bare-nosed wombats (Vombatus ursinus tasmaniensis) to constrain the Ca isotope composition of this species, an opportunistic grazer, and assess whether sex and environmental variables influence such composition. We compare these data to complementary strontium isotope data from the same samples as a proxy for geographical location. Elodont (ever-growing) wombat teeth allow for a sequential sampling strategy and thus provide high resolution intra-individual variability on a seasonal scale, creating the largest intra-individual and intra-species set of Ca isotope data in a single species so far. We show that the Ca isotope composition of Tasmanian bare-nosed wombats falls within the range for herbivores and is independent of geological substrate. Comparison with carbon and oxygen isotope data from sequential samples within the same individuals highlights that sub-monthly intra-individual variations in Ca isotope compositions may result from change in the proportions in the wombat's diet of C3 and C4 plants, or monocots and dicots. The Ca isotope compositions of male and female wombats suggest that Ca isotopes in marsupials could be used to trace nursing and weaning behaviour. The characterisation of Ca isotope values in marsupial herbivore enamel presented contributes to a modern reference set for reconstructing diet from fossil remains of extinct Australian megafauna herbivores.

AB  - Theory and empirical work suggest that coral reefs may exhibit alternative stable states of coral versus macroalgal dominance. However, it is unclear how dispersal of coral and macroalgae among reefs might impact this bistability and the resilience of the coral-dominated state. We develop a mathematical model to investigate how reef cover dynamics are affected by (1) coral and macroalgal dispersal between two reefs and (2) heterogeneous grazer abundances. We find that at low coral and macroalgal dispersal levels, a new type of stable state emerges with both coral and macroalgae present. Furthermore, we show that a reef abundant with coral and grazers can support a coral-dominated stable state in a second reef depauperate of grazers by dispersal of coral larvae. These results help explain previous empirical findings on reefs once thought to be incongruent with traditional coral-macroalgal alternative stable states theory-such as intermediate coral and macroalgal cover stable states and high coral-low grazing scenarios. Our findings indicate that changing dispersal levels (e.g., due to climate change, reef degradation) between reefs changes the possible stable states and the grazing rate at which the coral-dominated state is predicted to be stable. This work demonstrates the relevance of accounting for the level of dispersal among coral reefs or other bistable ecosystems when designing conservation management plans.

AB  - Biodiversity of large wild mammals is declining at alarming rates worldwide. It is therefore imperative to develop effective population conservation and recovery strategies. Population dynamics models can provide insights into processes driving declines of particular populations of a species and their relative importance. But there are insufficient tools, namely population dynamics models for wild herbivores, for characterizing their decline and for guiding conservation and management actions. Therefore, we have developed a model which can serve as a tool to fill that void. Specifically, we develop an integrated Bayesian state-space population dynamics model for wildlife populations and illustrate it using a topi population inhabiting the Greater Mara-Serengeti Ecosystem in Kenya and Tanzania. The model integrates ground demographic survey with aerial survey monitoring data. It incorporates population age and sex structure and life history traits and strategies and relates birth rates, age-specific survival rates and sex ratios with meteorological covariates, prior population density, environmental seasonality and predation risk. It runs on a monthly time step, enabling accurate characterization of reproductive seasonality, phenology, synchrony and prolificacy of births, juvenile and adult recruitments. Model performance is evaluated using balanced bootstrap sampling and by comparing model predictions with empirical aerial population size estimates. The hierarchical Bayesian model is implemented using MCMC methods for parameter estimation, prediction and inference and reproduces several well-known features of the Mara topi population, including striking and persistent population decline, seasonality of births, juvenile and adult recruitments. It is general and can be readily adapted for other wildlife species and extended to incorporate several additional useful features. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

AB  - Due to the increased frequency of human-tick encounters and expanding ranges of ticks in the United States, there is a critical need to identify environmental conditions associated with tick populations and their likelihood to contact human hosts. In a passive tick surveillance partnership with the US Department of Agriculture Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, we identified environmental variables associated with tick encounters by forestry personnel. Ticks were identified by species and life stage, and site-specific variables were associated with each tick using FIA forest inventory datasets and generalized linear models with negative binomial distributions. Of the 55 FIA variables available, we identified biotic and abiotic environmental variables associated with Amblyomma americanum L. (carbon in litter material and standing dead tree aboveground dry biomass), Dermacentor variabilis Say (seedling species unevenness and elevation), and Ixodes scapularis L. (carbon in dead woody material and seedling species unevenness). We propose conducting future treatment-control studies using these forestry-related environmental variables to test their ability to alter tick abundance at sites. Land management decisions not only affect common flora and fauna, but changes to these habitats can also alter the way ticks parasitize hosts and use vegetation to find those hosts. These results can be used with land management decisions to prevent future human-tick encounters and highlight risk areas.

AB  - Alteration of benthic reef habitat after coral bleaching and mortality induces changes in fish assemblages, with implications for fisheries. Our understanding of climate impacts to coral reef fisheries is largely based on fish abundance and biomass. The rates at which biomass is produced and replenished (productivity and turnover) are also important to sustaining fisheries, yet the responses of these metrics following bleaching are largely unknown. Here, we examine changes in fish productivity and turnover after mass coral bleaching events in Seychelles, on reefs that were recovering to coral-dominated habitats and those that shifted to macroalgae-dominated regimes. Productivity of fish assemblages increased on all recovering reefs, particularly on fished reefs resulting in levels similar to protected reefs 19 years after bleaching. Herbivore-detritivores, such as scraping and excavating parrotfish, appeared to drive biomass production through increased abundance on recovering reefs. Productivity on regime-shifted reefs remained stable at 1994 levels in fished areas, with increases observed on protected reefs. Large increases in browser productivity (particularly on protected reefs), combined with increases for invertivores, maintained post-bleaching productivity on macroalgal reefs. For all diet groups, net turnover was generally higher on fished regime-shifted reefs than on recovering reefs, suggesting fish biomass is more readily replenished on macroalgal reefs. Reef structural complexity was a positive predictor of productivity for all diet groups. These findings indicate that post-bleaching reef fish productivity is strongly influenced by benthic recovery trajectories, and demonstrates the importance of herbivore and invertivore species in sustaining small-scale inshore fisheries following climatic disturbances.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to determine the influence of plant community type, forest stand age, and season on the forage quality of plant growth forms in a forest-grassland mosaic. We determined the forage quality of plant growth forms (graminoids, forbs, and shrubs) at 64 sites in the Blue Mountains of Oregon, over four dates between May and September over two years. Samples were analyzed for crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). Sites were classified according to climax vegetation and grouped as either forested (ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa; Douglas-fir, Pseudotsuga menziesii; grand fir, Abies grandis) or non-forested (meadow or grassland). Forested sites were also categorized as "young" or "old" based on mean diameter at breast height of less than or greater than 37.5 cm, respectively. Graminoid and forb CP in early May were 3.5 and 2.5 points greater in the grand fir community type than the other forested types (P <= 0.01) and were 2.7 and 4.9 points greater in the meadow type than the grassland type (P <= 0.04). In mid-September, graminoid CP was similar between all community types (P >= 0.78). In early May, forb ADF and NDF were similar between all community types (P >= 0.18). In mid-September, forb ADF was 10.7 points lower in the ponderosa pine and Douglas-fir types than in all other community types (P <= 0.02). Forb ADF and NDF were greater in young stands than in old stands (P < 0.01). Furthermore, forb ADF was 11.4 points greater in the young grand fir community type than all other forested types (P < 0.01). Our study characterizes forage quality across the growing season in diverse vegetation types and, in turn, can be applied to wildlife and livestock management to predict and manage animal landscape distribution.

AB  - Host and pathogen dynamics are driven by seasonal variation, leading to complex epidemic patterns which are not well understood. Here, we linked demography and epidemiology in a single framework to reach a mechanistic understanding of disease dynamics in natural populations characterized by seasonality. We applied this approach to depict the interplay between a host, the wild boar, and a viral disease, African swine fever. This virus spreads in wild boar by direct-contact among living individuals or though contacts with infected carcasses. In this system, both host and pathogen show seasonal patterns: survival and reproduction probabilities vary across the year in the wild boar, and virus persistence in the environment is affected by temperature which influences the speed of carcasses degradation. Using a stochastic individual-based model, we showed that virus invasion success strongly varies according to the time of introduction due to the seasonal specific interaction between the virus and host. Furthermore, the shape of the following epidemic varies across seasons, with variation in speed and magnitude of the outbreak. Consequently, the host population response was also season-specific, both regarding the speed of the decline and the change in population structure. Overall, our study highlights the inextricable connections between host, pathogen and the environmental dynamics, and the importance to consider each component to understand disease dynamics.

AB  - Simple Summary Begait is a goat population reared for meat and milk production in northern Ethiopia, Tigray region. However, molecular-based genetic evaluation of these goat breeds has not yet been performed. Hence, the estimation of their genetic parameters and selection responses is crucial for the conservation and genetic improvement of goats. In this study, we estimated genetic parameters using a whole-genome sequencing data set to analyze genetic diversity, population structure and selection signatures by comparing the Begait goat genome with the remaining four Ethiopian goat populations. Generally, our results indicated the basis for the projecting characteristics, which can be used for future genetic improvement and animal genetic resources of goat breeds.Abstract Goats belong to a group of animals called small ruminants and are critical sources of livelihood for rural people. Genomic sequencing can provide information ranging from basic knowledge about goat diversity and evolutionary processes that shape genomes to functional information about genes/genomic regions. In this study, we exploited a whole-genome sequencing data set to analyze the genetic diversity, population structure and selection signatures of 44 individuals belonging to 5 Ethiopian goat populations: 12 Aberegalle (AB), 5 Afar (AF), 11 Begait (BG), 12 Central highlands (CH) and 5 Meafure (MR) goats. Our results revealed the highest genetic diversity in the BG goat population compared to the other goat populations. The pairwise genetic differentiation (FST) among the populations varied and ranged from 0.011 to 0.182, with the closest pairwise value (0.003) observed between the AB and CH goats and a distant correlation (FST = 0.182) between the BG and AB goats, indicating low to moderate genetic differentiation. Phylogenetic tree, ADMIXTURE and principal component analyses revealed a classification of the five Ethiopian goat breeds in accordance with their geographic distribution. We also found three top genomic regions that were detected under selection on chromosomes 2, 5 and 13. Moreover, this study identified different candidate genes related to milk characteristics (GLYCAM1 and SRC), carcass (ZNF385B, BMP-7, PDE1B, PPP1R1A, FTO and MYOT) and adaptive and immune response genes (MAPK13, MAPK14, SCN7A, IL12A, EST1 DEFB116 and DEFB119). In conclusion, this information could be helpful for understanding the genetic diversity and population structure and selection scanning of these important indigenous goats for future genetic improvement and/or as an intervention mechanism.

AB  - Floral field margins are known to benefit invertebrate species diversity and abundance within agricultural landscapes, but variation in success limits widespread uptake. Understanding how variation within floral field margins can affect certain entomological groupings is lacking but would allow for a more individualised design of margins to enhance biological control. This meta-analysis aims to answer the question; do floral field margins benefit biological pest control over grassy field margins? We found that floral margins significantly benefit the natural enemy community and biological control services, relative to non-floral grass margins. We confirm that field margin type is linked to higher abundance and diversity of natural enemies, lower numbers of herbivorous invertebrate pests, and reduced crop damage. We consider whether specific characterisations of natural enemies and pest communities vary between these margin types, finding key differences in the abundances of aerial and epigeal enemies, the diversity of parasitoid and predatory enemies and pest abundances found in naturally regenerating and sown floral field margins. The finding here cements the implementation of floral field margins as a legitimate control method for crop pests in the face of losses due to pesticides and highlights design and management considerations for the success of floral margins.

AB  - When wild-caught Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) from the Slovak Carpathian Mountains were reintroduced to Central Switzerland in the early 1970s and spread through the north-western Swiss Alps (NWA), they faced a largely unfamiliar landscape with strongly fragmented forests, high elevations, and intense human land use. For more than 30 years, radio-collared lynx have been monitored during three different project periods (in the 1980s, 1990s, and 2010s). Our study explored, how lynx over generations have learned to adjust to the alpine environment. We predicted that (1) lynx nowadays select more strongly for open habitats, higher elevations, and steep slopes compared to the early stages of recolonization and that (2) consequently, there were significant changes in the Eurasian lynx' prey spectrum. To test our predictions, we analyzed telemetry data (VHF, GPS) of 13 adult resident lynx in the NWA over 35 years, using Resource Selection Functions. Furthermore, we compared kills recorded from different individuals inhabiting the same region during three project periods. In general, lynx preferred forested areas, but over the years, they avoided open habitat less. Compared to the early stage of the recolonization, lynx in the most recent project period selected for higher elevations and the proportion of chamois in their prey spectrum surmounted that of roe deer. Potential driving factors for the observed changes could be increasing tolerance to human presence, intraspecific competition, or fitness benefits through exploitation of new resources. Long-term studies like ours provide important insight into how animals can respond to sudden environmental changes, e.g., in the course of translocations into new areas or anthropogenic alterations of their habitats.

AB  - Scatter-hoarding rodents play important roles in seed dispersal and predation in many forest ecosystems. Existing studies have shown that the seed foraging preference of rodents is directly affected by seed traits and indirectly affected by the traits of other co-existing seeds nearby (i.e., neighbor effect). Plant seeds exhibit a combination of diverse seed traits, including seed size, chemical defense, and nutrient content. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the influence of each single seed trait on such neighbor effects. Here, by using artificial seeds, we investigated the impacts of contrasts in seed size, tannin content, and nutrient content on neighbor effects. We tracked 9000 tagged artificial seeds from 30 seed-seed paired treatments in a subtropical forest in southwest China. The contrast in seed size between paired seeds created obvious neighbor effects measured through three seed dispersal related indicators: the proportion of seeds being removed, the proportion of seeds cached, and the distance transported by rodents. However, the magnitudes and the signs of the neighbor effects differed among pairs, including both apparent mutualism and apparent competition, depending on the contrast in seed size between paired seeds. The contrasts of tannin and nutrient content between paired seeds showed relatively few neighbor effects. Our results suggest that the contrast in seed traits between the target seed and its neighboring seeds should be considered when studying rodent-seed interactions. Furthermore, we expect that similar complex neighbor effects may also exist in other plant-animal interactions, such as pollination and herbivory.

AB  - Ecological processes driving female-skewed adult sex ratios (ASRs; males:females) in populations with polygynous mating systems have been addressed theoretically, but empirical support is scarce. The theoretical framework of the female substitution hypothesis (FSH) asserts that a female-skewed ASR at carrying capacity reflects an overall fitness benefit for females and for males competitive in acquiring access to reproductive females. The FSH predicts that as population abundance increases females should acquire forage more efficiently than males, thereby leading to passive displacement of males. The result is declining ASR associated with differential habitat use by both sexes as food resources are depleted by female scramble competition. We characterized the temporal variation in ASR in a Roosevelt elk population inhabiting the Redwood National and State Parks, California, across 24 years, and determined which of two possible ecological mechanisms was the driver of a declining ASR. The first mechanism explored was that increasing female abundance associated with declining forage in the study area led to the passive displacement of males into the study periphery over time. The second mechanism explored was that a declining ASR was precipitated by a lack of males within the study area and the study periphery. Systematic population surveys from a vehicle were done to estimate abundance and ASR as well as assess male abundance in the study periphery. Forage biomass was estimated in quarter-m(2) plots randomly placed in meadows inhabited by female elk. Our multiple regression analysis revealed an inverse relationship between abundance and ASR indicating density dependence. We found numerous males in the study periphery when females were abundant. Our least squares models indicated declining food resources across years when female abundance increased. Our results showed that the first, and not the second, ecological mechanism examined was responsible for a female-skewed ASR. Our findings provide empirical support for the theoretical framework of the FSH in a nonmigratory population protected from hunting.

AB  - In recent years, the northward migration of elephant herds in China's Yunnan Province has attracted unprecedented public attention to the conservation of Asian elephants, with habitat fragmentation and human disturbance thought to be key factors. In this study, we used Jiangcheng, a new distribution site for Asian elephants in southwest China, as an example, combined the available remote sensing and monitoring data with the MaxEnt3.4.1 model, to analyze the factors affecting the activities of Asian elephants under the conditions of human disturbance and habitat degradation. The Least Cumulative Resistance model was utilized to construct the potential ecological dispersal corridors, and the key corridors were identified through the gravity model to explore the ecological security pattern of the habitat of Asian elephants in Jiangcheng County. The results show that the habitat of Asian elephants in Jiangcheng County is fragmented, showing a north-south strip distribution, never moving to the northeast. The existing suitable habitat is located in the low-elevation area (<1500 m), which is close to water sources and roads, and there is no nature reserve in this area. The land is mainly occupied by scrub or grassland near mountainous forests, but part of it is also under cultivation, which leads to conflicts between humans and elephants occur frequently. There are 14 ecological source areas, which are mainly distributed in the two regions of Zhengdong and Kangping, and there are 92 ecological corridors, of which 3 are important corridors and 89 are general corridors. This study comprehensively analyzes the current status and connectivity of Asian elephant habitat in Jiangcheng County at the regional scale, which helps to optimize the pattern of suitable habitat, promotes the dispersal of Asian elephants and habitat connectivity, and provides realistic guidance and basic information for the conservation planning of isolated populations of this species and their habitats.

AB  - Barley is an important feed crop in Iran and is threatened by an increased frequency of drought. Increasing diversity in the form of evolutionary populations (EPs) and mixtures is one strategy to increase the resilience of crops. Four barley EPs, which have evolved in different locations over 7 to 10 years from the same original population, were evaluated for agronomic trait and stability together with two landraces, and one improved variety for three cropping seasons in four locations. Modest but significant differences were found only for plant height with a range of less than 4 cm. Stability, measured with cultivar superiority, as well as environmental variance and reliability measures generally indicated a superior stability of EPs-with two of them ranking first and second for grain yield reliability-but also differences between the EPs. The effect of recurrent droughts on the diversity within EPs is discussed as a possible explanation for the lack of divergent evolution. The seed management of Eps, including seed exchange between farmers, is suggested as a possible strategy to avoid the reduction in diversity within populations. Future research will address the nutritional value of the EPs, which is often quoted by sheep owners as superior to commonly grown varieties.

AB  - Condensed tannins (CTs) are abundant, ecologically-relevant secondary metabolites in many plants, which respond to variables associated with anthropogenic environmental change. While many studies have reported how genetic and environmental factors affect CT concentrations, few have explored how they influence CT molecular structure. Here, using trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) as a model organism, we report how foliar CT concentrations, polymer sizes, representation of procyanidins and prodelphinidins, and stereochemistry vary in response to changes in air temperature (warming and freeze damage), air composition (elevated CO2 and O-3), soil quality (nutrients and microbiome), and herbivory (mammal and lepidopteran). Use of multiple aspen genotypes enabled assessment of genetic influences on aspen CTs. CT concentration and composition were analyzed by thiolysis-ultra high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry in archived leaf samples from prior experiments. All environmental variables explored except for soil microbiome influenced both CT quantity and quality, with climate factors appearing to have larger effect magnitudes than herbivory. Climate, soil, and herbivory effects varied among genotypes, while air composition effects were consistent across genotypes. Considering that CT properties (concentrations and molecular structures) mediate functions at the organismal through ecosystem scales, intraspecific variation in responses of CT properties to environmental factors could provide a pathway through which environmental change exerts selective pressure on Populus populations. Future studies are needed to identify the molecular-level mechanisms by which environmental factors influence CT concentrations and structures, and to establish their ecological and evolutionary significance.

AB  - The reintroduction of the Mexican wolf in the wilds of northwestern Mexico has allowed us to address its trophic ecology and elucidate conflicts with livestock producers: their main mortality factor. Our objective was to determine the feeding habits of wolves in Mexico, as well as the quantity and frequency of livestock predation in relation to seasonal and individual variables, through the analysis of genetically identified scats. During 2012-2022 we collected 1171 Mexican wolf scats. We extracted and sequenced DNAm and identified individuals and their sex using microsatellite analysis. We washed the scat and separated the undigested components for taxonomic identification. We estimated the frequency of prey items, the biomass it contributed to the diet, and compared prey consumption between sexes and between the birth and dispersal seasons. We constructed generalized linear models to identify the relationship between livestock presence in the diet and dietary prey richness with respect to environmental and individual variables. We identified 68 wolves that had consumed 30 species of vertebrates. Of these, white-tailed deer (36.12%), diversionary feeding (22.79%), and cattle (25.56%) had the highest contribution to biomass. The ingestion of items was independent of the sex of the wolves but was dependent on the season. The presence of deer and diversionary feeding decreased the likelihood of cattle being ingested but also decreased the richness of items of wild species in the wolf diet. Wolves in northwestern Mexico fed mainly on large prey available in the reintroduction area, including livestock. As wolves consume livestock, it increases the risk of retaliatory actions from ranchers. Our results serve as a basis for the implementation of strategies to reduce human-wolf conflicts and set a baseline for coexistence in northwestern Mexico.

AB  - Despite numerous domestic legislations, international treaties, agreements, conventions, and protocols to curb wildlife crimes, Bangladesh's illegal wildlife trade (IWT) crime rate has increased significantly in recent years. The provision of the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012 sets the highest seven and lowest two years punishment for killing tigers and elephants, a maximum of two years, and a minimum of six months imprisonment for killing birds. Nevertheless, the country has only 17% forest land; in this small area, wildlife crime increased 28 times in 2020, and nearly 4,000 live wild animals have been rescued, while more than 300 cases have been registered in the last ten years. We suggest that ineffective legal enforcement is the main reason for the illegal transaction of wild species through insecure border areas. Hence, successfully controlling the IWT problem in Bangladesh requires reducing the demand for wild animals, stopping the route of supplies, and combating global transnational wildlife crime.

AB  - The behavior and success of commercial bushmeat gun hunters in the forest landscape between the Tshuapa and Lualaba rivers, Democratic Republic of the Congo, were studied to understand hunter practices and wildlife governance challenges through the lens of optimal foraging theory. Over a period of 4 months in 2016 to 2017 and 7 months in 2022, 242 hunter follows covering 3235 km were conducted. Hunting success increased with distance from the villages and was associated with wildlife encounter rates, the quality of guns and night hunting. Prey size and the type of encounter influence prey selectivity. The results indicate the limited applicability of optimal foraging theory to commercial bushmeat gun hunter behavior in the Lomami context, high hunting pressure on ungulates and primates, and the importance of the Lomami National Park to both protect biodiversity and as a source of wildlife for adjacent forests.

AB  - In present study, the toxic elements, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), were determined in whey milk samples obtained from various cattle (cow, goat, buffalo, sheep, camel) and human subjects of different areas of Sindh, Pakistan, based on consuming drinking water (exposed area) and surface water (control/non-exposed area). The whey milk was separated from casein by lowering the pH, and heating in an ultrasonic bath at 60 degrees C for 5 min and centrifuged. The whey milk samples were treated with deep eutectic solvent, prepared from choline chloride-oxalic acid (ChCl-Ox) at different mole ratio. Effects of different parameters on digestion efficiency of whey milk samples, including time and temperature of electric hot plate, mole ratio, and volumes of deep eutectic solvent were examined. The total levels of all selected toxic elements were also detected in whole milk samples of all exposed and nonexposed cattle and human, after acid digestion method. The validity of the proposed method was established by a conventional acid digestion method of selected whey milk samples and spiked certified standards in replicate real whey milk samples. The resulted elements obtained after proposed and conventional heating system were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The % of all three toxic elements found in whey milk samples were 24 to 50% of their total content in milk samples of different cattle and human. The As, Cd, and Pb contents in cattle and human milk consumed contaminated groundwater was significantly higher (2- to 3-fold) than those values observed for milk samples of cattle, who receive drinking water from fresh canal water (p < 0.01). Estimating the daily intake, hazard quotient and carcinogenic risk for <6 month to 5 years old children, based on the concentrations of toxic elements in milk samples of different cattle and human.

AB  - Background Karuk and Yurok tribes in northwestern California, USA, are revitalizing the practice of cultural burning, which is the use of prescribed burns to enhance culturally important species. These cultural burns are critical to the livelihoods of indigenous peoples, and were widespread prior to the establishment of fire exclusion policies. One of the major objectives of cultural burning is to enhance California hazelnut (Corylus cornuta Marsh var. californica) basketry stem production for Karuk and Yurok basketweavers. To evaluate cultural burning as a form of human ecosystem engineering, we monitored hazelnut basketry stem production, qualities, and shrub density in 48 plots (400 m(2)) within two prescribed and 19 cultural burn sites. Socio-ecological variables that were analyzed included burn frequency, burn season, overstory tree (>= 10 cm diameter at breast height) basal area, ungulate browse, and aspect. We also observed basketry stem gathering to compare travel distances, gathering rates, and basketweaver preferences across sites with different fire histories and land tenure. Results Hazelnut shrubs, one growing season post burn, produced a 13-fold increase in basketry stems compared with shrubs growing at least three seasons post burn (P < 0.0001). Basketry stem production and stem length displayed negative relationships with overstory tree basal area (P < 0.01) and ungulate browse (P < 0.0001). Plots burned at high frequency (at least three burn events from 1989 to 2019) had 1.86-fold greater hazelnut shrubs than plots experiencing less than three burn events (P < 0.0001), and were all located on the Yurok Reservation where land tenure of indigenous people is comparatively stronger. Basketweavers travelled 3.8-fold greater distance to reach gathering sites burned by wildfires compared with those that were culturally burned (P < 0.01). At cultural burn sites, wildfire sites, and fire-excluded sites, mean gathering rates were 4.9, 1.6, and 0.5 stems per minute per individual, respectively. Conclusions Karuk and Yurok cultural fire regimes with high burn frequencies (e.g., three to five years) promote high densities of hazelnut shrubs and increase hazelnut basketry stem production. This improves gathering efficiency and lowers travel costs to support the revitalization of a vital cultural practice. Our findings provide evidence of positive human ecosystem engineering, and show that increasing tribal sovereignty over fire management improves socio-economic well-being while at the same time supports measures of ecosystem structure and function.

AB  - Qualitative studies have suggested that forest changes following a wildfire can challenge a hunter's ability to harvest big game, such as moose (Alces alces). Quantitative effects have not been estimated. Given the increasing prevalence of wildfires, the strong linkages between wildfire and moose habitat, and the importance of moose to the people of the boreal region of North America, our goal was to assess if and how moose harvest patterns changed immediately following a wildfire. To address that goal, we used 36 years (1984-2019) of spatially explicit wildfire and moose harvest data in Alaska to compare moose harvest variables the year before and year after a wildfire occurred. With a few exceptions, the number of hunters, kills, and success rates were similar (p > 0.05, effect size < 0.3) between pre- and post-wildfire years. We estimated a weak to moderate effect on change in moose hunter numbers, kills, and success rate in only a small percentage (1.5%) of wildfires that burned a very large proportion (>38%) of a moose harvest reporting unit. Our findings suggest that wildfire has not caused a clear and functional quantitative effect on hunters' ability to harvest moose in Alaska.

AB  - Disease is a key driver of community and ecosystem structure, especially when it strikes foundation species. In the widespread marine foundation species eelgrass (Zostera marina), outbreaks of wasting disease have caused large-scale meadow collapse in the past, and the causative pathogen, Labyrinthula zosterae, is commonly found in meadows globally. Research to date has mainly focused on abiotic environmental drivers of seagrass wasting disease, but there is strong evidence from other systems that biotic interactions such as herbivory can facilitate plant diseases. How biotic interactions influence seagrass wasting disease in the field is unknown but is potentially important for understanding dynamics of this globally valuable and declining habitat. Here, we investigated links between epifaunal grazers and seagrass wasting disease using a latitudinal field study across 32 eelgrass meadows distributed from southeastern Alaska to southern California. From 2019 to 2021, we conducted annual surveys to assess eelgrass shoot density, morphology, epifauna community, and the prevalence and lesion area of wasting disease infections. We integrated field data with satellite measurements of sea surface temperature and used structural equation modeling to test the magnitude and direction of possible drivers of wasting disease. Our results show that grazing by small invertebrates was associated with a 29% increase in prevalence of wasting disease infections and that both the prevalence and lesion area of disease increased with total epifauna abundances. Furthermore, these relationships differed among taxa; disease levels increased with snail (Lacuna spp.) and idoteid isopod abundances but were not related to abundance of ampithoid amphipods. This field study across 23 degrees of latitude suggests a prominent role for invertebrate consumers in facilitating disease outbreaks with potentially large impacts on coastal seagrass ecosystems.

AB  - The current spread and proliferation of the invasive macroalga Rugulopteryx okamurae in South European coastal waters is a major ecological problem with a high socioeconomic impact. First identified as invasive in the Strait of Gibraltar (S Iberian Peninsula) in 2014, R. okamurae continues its expansion along the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Despite its extended presence, the biotic control mechanisms and long-term impacts of R. okamurae consumption by native herbivores remain unexamined. This 24-week experiment investigates the physiological responses of the common sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus from three different locations following an invasion gradient by the time when R. okamurae was first detected. Sea urchin individuals were fed two diets: a strict diet of 100 % R. okamurae or a mixed diet with 50 % R. okamurae and 50 % Ulva sp. We evaluated the response of P. lividus individuals based on ingestion rates, relative weight (g), mortality, Ivlev's electivity index, and gonadosomatic index (GSI). Individuals from locations with more time since invasion fed on 100 % R. okamurae showed higher weight loss, higher mortality, and lower GSI than individuals from short-term invaded locations. Those negative effects were reduced for individuals fed a mixed diet. Within the mixed diet, Ivlev's electivity values of individuals from "10 years of invasion" reduced from random selection to partial avoidance over R. okamurae across the experiment. Our results reveal long-term underlying effects of R. okamurae ingestion, suggesting implications for the conservation of P. lividus populations in invaded locations, with potential ecosystem-level consequences as it is a key controlling species in coastal systems.

AB  - River recreation often contributes to ecological degradation - a primary concern for river management professionals. Using social science data to inform ecological management helps mitigate recreational impacts, particularly at sites that experience high recreation use. This paper demonstrates the utility of an approach to collect, display, and use social data based on an indicators and thresholds approach at Buffalo National River in Arkansas (BUFF). Specifically, we presented a series of digitally manipulated photographs to river recreationists at BUFF that depicted varying levels of use, or density of use, to identify social thresholds - the levels of use deemed unacceptable by river users. We coupled the photos with quantitative questionnaires and found that paddlers, anglers, and campers thought that moderate to high-density levels were unacceptable. Pairing such data with empirical evidence of ecological degradation born from recreation use (e.g., erosion, water quality issues) provides a robust and defensible justification for a range of management actions, including altering use levels and river access. The research methods presented in this paper are transferable to a range of high-use rivers and waterways, and thus provide a blueprint for river professionals who by design or default interface with recreation and ecological resources. In the end, combining social and ecological data can fortify management decisions and decrease associated conflicts among important groups of river recreationists.

AB  - Plant secondary metabolites that are released into the rhizosphere alter biotic and abiotic soil properties, which in turn affect the performance of other plants. How this type of plant-soil feedback affects agricultural productivity and food quality in the field in the context of crop rotations is unknown. Here, we assessed the performance, yield and food quality of three winter wheat varieties growing in field plots whose soils had been conditioned by either wild type or benzoxazinoid-deficient bx1 maize mutant plants. Following maize cultivation, we detected benzoxazinoid-dependent chemical and microbial fingerprints in the soil. The benzoxazinoid fingerprint was still visible during wheat growth, but the microbial fingerprint was no longer detected. Wheat emergence, tillering, growth, and biomass increased in wild type conditioned soils compared to bx1 mutant conditioned soils. Weed cover was similar between soil conditioning treatments, but insect herbivore abundance decreased in benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. Wheat yield was increased by over 4% without a reduction in grain quality in benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. This improvement was directly associated with increased germination and tillering. Taken together, our experiments provide evidence that soil conditioning by plant secondary metabolite producing plants can increase yield via plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions. If this phenomenon holds true across different soils and environments, optimizing root exudation chemistry could be a powerful, genetically tractable strategy to enhance crop yields without additional inputs.

AB  - Plants and insects are the two dominant groups in terrestrial ecosystems, and insect damage on fossil plants is the only direct evidence documenting the past ecological history between these two, hyperdiverse groups. We describe, analyze, and interpret plant-insect interactions of a lower Cenomanian paleoforest from western France - the Puy-Puy Quarry of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine Region. We examined 1605 fossil leaves, axes, and reproductive material of bennettitalean, pinalean, and ginkgoalean gymnosperms; lauralean and magnolialean angiosperms; and pteridophyte fronds. We identified functional feeding groups (FFGs) and insect damage types (DTs) preserved on this foliage and data were rarified to indicate sample completeness. By employing R, various statistical parameters were calculated. We established 71 DTs for the nine FFGs of hole feeding, margin feeding, skeletonization, surface feeding, oviposition, piercing and sucking, galling, mining, and pathogens, and 1292 feeding event occurrences. Of the specimens examined 22.2% exhibited one or more DT, with angiosperms the most affected plant group. The most diverse interactions were mining and galling, indicating a mosaic of humid and xeric habitats, respectively, for the Puy-Puy paleoforest, a conclusion consistent with previous paleontological and sedimentological interpretations. Elevated DT richness suggests long-standing ecological relationships between the plants and insects, representative of a mature forest.

AB  - Concentrated cream (CC) is a dairy product containing more than 60% milk fat. CC has a very short shelf life because it is made from unripe cream. The present study aims to determine how packaging with reducing gas (H-2) and nitrogen (N-2) affects the quality properties and shelf life of CC. For this purpose, lipolysis, oxidation, color, microbiological, and free fatty acid development and the fatty acid composition of modified atmosphere packaged (MAP) CC samples were studied for 28 days. For MAP1, 96% N-2 + 4% H-2 was used, and for MAP2, 100% N-2 and air was used for the control group. During storage, MAP1 samples remained at lower lipolysis (ADV and FFA) and oxidation levels than MAP2 and the control group. The MAP1 and MAP2 methods preserved the color of the samples and reduced the microbial growth rate. A lower formation of free fatty acids was observed in the samples packed with MAP1 and MAP2 than in the control group. The results showed that hydrogen gas positively affected the quality and storage time of samples.

AB  - The first detection of Fascioloides (F.) magna in northeastern Bavaria in 2011 was presumably correlated to natural migration movements of free ranging wild ruminants originating from the neighboring Czech Republic, where high infection rates have been reported frequently. To gain more data on the continuing spreading and current occurrence of the giant liver fluke in surrounding regions, 700 livers of cloven-hoofed game originating from eleven different northeastern Bavarian counties were investigated for the presence of F. magna and accompanying liver parasites in the hunting season 2019-2020. Macroscopically altered liver tissue was further investigated by pathohistological and parasitological examination. F. magna was detected in 5.9% (38/640) of livers from red deer (0.7% < 1 year, 9.8% > 1 year; p < 0.05) whereas none of the investigated livers of wild boar, roe, and fallow deer was infected (n=60). Mild pathological alterations of the liver tissue were documented in 15, moderate in 14, and major in 9 of all F. magna-positive cases. Histologically, the fluke-specific pigment haematin, large trematode eggs, and periportal fibrosis were detected in the liver tissue of infected animals. In 9% of all investigated livers, parasitic stages of other parasites, i.e., Dicrocoelium dendriticum (6.0%), Fasciola hepatica (0.3%), Taenia spp. (1.7%), and Echinococcus multilocularis (1.0%), were found. According to the results of this study, F. magna is not restricted to formerly known affected regions of Upper Franconia, but is also present in the military training ground Grafenwohr, Upper Palatinate, and the Bavarian Forest National Park, Lower Bavaria, with estimated prevalences of 3.6 and 16.4%, respectively, and thus seems to spread in suitable habitats in northeastern Bavaria.

AB  - Simple Summary After several years of inappropriate management, the pasture inside the enclosure for captive red deer in Paneveggio Pale di San Martino regional Park (TN, Italy) lost its nutritional value, due to the expansion of unpalatable tall grasses. Therefore, several measures to restore a suitable pasture composition were needed. The mowing activity represents a disturbance for the captive deer, which negatively affects the animals' well-being. To establish the more appropriate times/days to perform activities inside the enclosure, we observed the alarm reactions and relative intensity of animals exposed to different visual stimuli presented inside and outside the enclosure. Some differences were highlighted between the males and the nursery (females and fawns) groups. Considering the deer biology and the studied location, the best months in which it would be possible to plan activities inside the enclosure are March, April (if the snow is not present) and August. Data elaboration suggests that the best day to perform activities inside the enclosure is Wednesday because the animals showed less sensitivity to disturbances; Tuesday and Thursday may also be considered additional suitable days. The study analyzes red deer responses to disturbances during the day and different exposures to tourists, to establish the more appropriate times to carry out activities inside the Paneveggio deer enclosure. The alarm reactions of red deer were observed after presenting different types of visual stimuli inside and outside the fence, in order to answer some questions: Which stimuli produce the strongest reactions from the animals? Do animals differently react to stimuli presented outside and inside the fence? On which days and times are the animals more sensitive to disturbances? Are there different reactions between the males and females? The results suggest that the red deer adversely react to the disturbance at different degrees of intensity in relation to day, sex, tourist and where the stimuli are presented. It was observed that during the days with the highest tourist presence, the animals were particularly alarmed; discomfort accumulation produced the highest number of alarm reactions on Monday. For these reasons, it would be opportune to manage the pasture on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, scheduled at specific times of day, preferably far from the estimated presence of tourists.

AB  - Whole-genome sequencing has advanced the study of species evolution, including the detection of genealogical discordant events such as ancient hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). The evolutionary history of bighorn (Ovis canadensis) and thinhorn (Ovis dalli) sheep present an ideal system to investigate evolutionary discordance due to their recent and rapid radiation and putative secondary contact between bighorn and thinhorn sheep subspecies, specifically the dark pelage Stone sheep (O. dalli stonei) and predominately white Dall sheep (O. dalli dalli), during the last ice age. Here, we used multiple genomes of bighorn and thinhorn sheep, together with snow (O. nivicola) and the domestic sheep (O. aries) as outgroups, to assess their phylogenomic history, potential introgression patterns and their adaptive consequences. Among the Pachyceriforms (snow, bighorn and thinhorn sheep) a consistent monophyletic species tree was retrieved; however, many genealogical discordance patterns were observed. Alternative phylogenies frequently placed Stone and bighorn as sister clades. This relationship occurred more often and was less divergent than that between Dall and bighorn. We also observed many blocks containing introgression signal between Stone and bighorn genomes in which coat colour genes were present. Introgression signals observed between Dall and bighorn were more random and less frequent, and therefore probably due to ILS or intermediary secondary contact. These results strongly suggest that Stone sheep originated from a complex series of events, characterized by multiple, ancient periods of secondary contact with bighorn sheep.

AB  - Temporal trends of mercury in Arctic wildlife are inconsistent within and between species and are often insignificant, which limits data interpretation. Recent multivariate analyses have shown that weather and climate factors (e.g. temperatures, sea ice conditions) are related to total Hg (THg) concentrations in wildlife tissues, though relatively few studies have explored these relationships. The present study compared time series of THg concentrations in liver of polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 2007/08-2015/16), eggs of thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia, 1993-2015) and kidney of caribou (Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus, 2006-2015) from the Hudson Bay region of Canada and statistically modelled THg over time with available climate and weather data. Significant temporal trends of THg concentrations were not detected in any species. However, in multivariate models that included time-lagged sea ice freeze up dates, THg concentrations increased 4.4% yr(-1) in Qamanirjuaq caribou. Sea ice conditions were also related to THg levels in polar bear liver but not those in eggs of murres, though year was not a signifcant factor. Greater precipitation levels one to two years prior to sampling were associated with greater THg concentrations in polar bears and caribou, likely due to greater deposition, flooding and discharge from nearby wetlands and rivers. Time-lagged Arctic and/or North Atlantic Oscillation (AO/NAO) indices also generated significant, inverse models for all three species, agreeing with relationships in other time series of similar length. The magnitude and direction of many relationships were affected by season, duration of time-lags, and the length of the time series. Our findings support recent observations suggesting that temporal studies monitoring Hg in Arctic wildlife should consider including key climatic or weather factors to help identify consistent variables of influence and to improve temporal analyses of THg time series.

AB  - It is important to quantify the emissions from livestock to adapt mitigation practices for the rural communities where the livestock populations lie. This study reviewed the existing empirical models and selected a simple model that requires only one input, i.e., the dry matter intake (DMI), to estimate methane emissions from livestock. This input can be easily recorded by the rural communities to quantify the emissions from their livestock. The data required to estimate the methane emissions is collected from selected rural communities in the northern part of India. It is observed from the pilot study that based on the quantity of feed, the emissions are highest for buffaloes (133.65-275.63 g/d/livestock) followed by cows (109.2-217.42 g/d/livestock) and sheep (41.81-58.93 g/d/livestock). The study also recommends the necessity to focus on quality feeds, feed additives such as coconut oil and seaweed, using improved forage varieties, technological innovations for breeding, manure management, and sustainable integrated livestock farming systems. Policies and schemes are also required to mainstream research on livestock and issues leading to emissions, such as scaling up the production of low-emission species like poultry, sheep, and pigs. Policies promoting mixed farming and advanced breeding research, improved feed quality and accessibility, and policies to support incentives that can drive behavioral changes among producers and consumers should also be analyzed and updated. Livestock are mainly in rural communities, and hence it is an important task for researchers and academicians to train the rural communities to quantify the emissions, and the adaptation and mitigation practices to overcome them. The outcome of the study can be used as resource material to empower rural communities.

AB  - It is generally recognized that the quality differences in plant germplasm resources are genetically determined, and that only a good "pedigree" can have good quality. Ecological memory of plants and rhizosphere soil fungi provides a new perspective to understand this phenomenon. Here, we selected 45 tea tree germplasm resources and analyzed the rhizosphere soil fungi, nutrient content and tea quality. We found that the ecological memory of tea trees for soil fungi led to the recruitment and aggregation of dominant fungal populations that were similar across tea tree varieties, differing only in the number of fungi. We performed continuous simulation and validation to identify four characteristic fungal genera that determined the quality differences. Further analysis showed that the greater the recruitment and aggregation of Saitozyma and Archaeorhizomyces by tea trees, the greater the rejection of Chaetomium and Trechispora, the higher the available nutrient content in the soil and the better the tea quality. In summary, our study presents a new perspective, showing that ecological memory between tea trees and rhizosphere soil fungi leads to differences in plants' ability to recruit and aggregate characteristic fungi, which is one of the most important determinants of tea quality. The artificial inoculation of rhizosphere fungi may reconstruct the ecological memory of tea trees and substantially improve their quality.

AB  - The Eurasian wild boar (Sus scrofa), having faced a population size reduction during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, is now experiencing a remarkable population recovery, not only confined to natural habitats alone, but also thriving in human-dominated environments. Previously, studies on wild boars predominantly relied on the analysis of supposedly neutral molecular markers (e.g., microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms). In this study, a next-generation sequencing approach was used to examine the adaptive variation at the second exon of the SLA-DRB1 locus in 116 wild boars from the western Balkans. A total of 17 functional SLA-DRB1 alleles were detected which translated into 14 different amino-acid sequences. In 12 individuals, we observed alleles at duplicated SLA-DRB1 loci. Spatial analysis revealed the presence of three genetic clusters, albeit with relatively low overall differentiation (an average FST value of 0.012). Positive selection was detected on only one codon, as indicated by multiple tests, while the presence of shared alleles among related species suggested signals of trans-species polymorphism. Our results indicate the high MHC diversity at the SLA-DRB1 locus in wild boars from the Balkan Peninsula, shaped by a complex interplay of several non-exclusive mechanisms, including balancing selection, recombination, and gene duplications.

AB  - Habitat loss and fragmentation due to accelerated agriculture expansion is a major threat to existing wildlife populations across Asia. The human-wildlife interface mosaic across Asia is varied in terms of juxtaposition and structure, which can strongly influence biodiversity value and impacts on wildlife species. Here we analyzed habitat selection behavior of Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus ) across three study sites with different agriculture use patterns in Myanmar, a country recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot, including but not limited to, commercial palm oil and sugarcane plantations, and subsistence agriculture. These different agriculture use landscape capture landscape mosaic structure found across Asia. Given elephants exhibit heterogeneous spatial behavior, we fitted individual step selection and resource selection models to gain insight into the diversity of strategies employed at the local (step) and home range (thirdorder) scale. We used variance partitioning analysis to quantify the explanatory contribution of individual and study sites across both scales. We found that the variation in the resource selection behavior was mainly due to individual differences, and the configuration of agriculture present in an individual 's range was the most influential to its selection behavior. Enhancing understanding of how the level of fragmentation on the landscape relates to agricultural use can serve to help focus conservation efforts. Continued accelerated agriculture expansion is increasing the rate of contact between elephants and humans and, thereby escalating negative human-elephant interactions, often resulting in human and elephant deaths. Gaining a deeper understanding of habitat selection behavior by elephants across the changing landscapes of Asia can help inform management decisions and conservation actions.

AB  - The application of organisms as part of soil remediation can accelerate the decomposition of organic matter and the carbon cycle. To explore the synergistic effects of earthworms and phosphate-solubilizing bacteria on C accumulation in artificially improved soils of manure and in slurry-amended soil, a dry slope of land was established on the hillside of a large pig farm. Experiments involving six treatments were performed, including control (CK), pig manure (Pm), and pig manure + slurry (Pm + S) treatments, as well as manure + slurry + earthworms (Te), manure + slurry + phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (Tb), and manure + slurry + earthworms + bacteria (T(e + b)). Compared with the CK, both the Pm + S and T(e + b) treatments significantly increased the SOC content. In particular, the T(e + b) treatment increased the SOC by 196%. The synergistic effect of T(e + b) on the increase in organic carbon was consistent with the results of soil-carbon sequestration. After comprehensive fertilization, soil-carbon sequestration reached 2.87 Mg C hm(-2), while stable organic carbon increased to 1.88 Mg C hm(-2). It was also consistent with the result of PCA analysis in which applying earthworms promoted an increase in insoluble organic carbon. Therefore, in the future, earthworms and organic fertilizers can be applied to promote organic carbon sequestration on dry sloping land.

AB  - Once deposited, radiocesium remains in the environment for a long time, and constantly enters the food chain. Over time, game species tend to accumulate Cs-137 by two orders of magnitude more than farm animals. This occurs especially in places heavily contaminated, thus meat products made out of local game should be treated with caution. One of such areas, known as the Opole Anomaly, is located in South-Western Poland and represents one of most Cs-137 contaminated regions across Europe after the Chernobyl accident. The aim of the study was to find out the Cs-137 activity in soil and local game, the value of the soil-to-game aggregated transfer factor and to assess the effective dose of the ionising radiation (Eeff) received by consumers of local game meat in years 2012-2019. We examined meat of three common game species: red deer, roe deer and wild boar for Cs-137 activity. Cs-137 activity in meat samples ranged from 0.14 to 592 Bq kg(-1). The aggregated transfer factor (Tag) in game ranged from 0.006 to 0.01 m(2) kg(-1) f.w. for wild boar, 0.005-0.008 m(2) kg(-1) f.w. for roe deer, and 0.003-0.004 m(2) kg(-1) f.w. for red deer. The effective dose received by people who regularly consume local game meat ranged from less than 14.2 mu Sv y(-1) to 134 mu Sv y(-1), depending on the amount of differently contaminated game meat consumed annually. Even those for whom game is the only source of meat, consumption of wild boar along with local mushrooms and bilberries will, since 2012, not exceed the regulation limit of Cs-137 at the level of 1 mSv y(-1). By the best of our knowledge this is the first study regarding Cs-137 activity in game and risk assessment from the most contaminated "post-Chernobyl" area in Poland.

AB  - Understanding resource use of invasive species provides insights for predicting and mitigating their impacts on biodiversity. We explored the predictability of diet of the invasive common warthog by describing and comparing the diet of warthog populations from two semi-arid, invaded sites, Addo Elephant National Park (AMC), and Great Fish River Nature Reserve (GFRNR), Eastern Cape, South Africa. These sites are both dominated by the Subtropical Thicket biome, but differ in vegetation type. We used forage availability to estimate diet preferences at AMC. We predicted that warthog would consume grass in invaded landscapes. Additionally, we predicted that the diet at one invaded site would predict this at another invaded site. As predicted, warthog mainly consumed grass at both sites (AMC - 87.4%, GFRNR - 88.5%), eating few woody plants, succulents, and forbs. Cynodon dactylon was the most consumed species in AMC, in GFRNR this was Eragrostis curvula and Cymbopogon pospichilii. Our ability to predict the diet between sites was constrained by variation in the plant species consumed. We found strong relationships between the consumption of preferred plant species at AMC and their consumption at GFRNR. We show that warthogs are specialised grazers outside their native range and thus can be expected to impact grass communities in invaded areas, especially preferred grass species. Thus, conservation managers need to monitor grasses in areas invaded by warthog to better detect and manage their impacts.

AB  - Hetian sheep have a long history and a wide distribution. They are renowned for their carpet-grade wool, which makes them a valuable genetic resource in China. The survey revealed that Hetian sheep primarily inhabit three distinct ecological environments: mountains (MTS), mountain-grasslands (MGTS), and grasslands (GTS). To understand the evolutionary relationships and germplasm characteristics of Hetian sheep in these diverse environments, we randomly selected 84 healthy adult ewes from each of these ecological regions. We obtained the Illumina Ovine SNP50K BeadChip by extracting DNA from Hetian sheep ear tissue using the phenol-chloroform method. Afterward, we conducted a population genetic structure and genetic diversity analysis of Hetian sheep using the Illumina Ovine SNP50K Beadchip. Principal component analysis (PCA) and neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analysis indicated that Hetian sheep in three different ecological environments exhibit distinct genetic distances. Admixture analysis indicated that MGTS and GTS share a common ancestral origins. Additionally, the linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis indicated that M had the highest decay rate, while MG had the lowest decay rate. Furthermore, we identified the overlapping homozygous genomic regions of Hetian sheep in the three ecological environments through runs of homozygosity (ROH) analysis. We subsequently performed gene annotation and enrichment analysis on these overlapping genomic regions. In the MTS environment, we identified 31 candidate genes associated with high-altitude environmental adaptation. These genes are involved in bone cell generation, differentiation, and the maintenance of bone homeostasis (WNT6, WNT10A, and CHSY1); tooth and tongue development (LEF1, TP63, and PRDM16); and hearing and visual functions (RBP4, ATF6, and JAG1). In the GTS environment, we identified 22 candidate genes related to economic traits, including those associated with reproduction (PLA2G4F, ACVR1, and ADCY2) and growth (CAPN3, YAP1, and FGF9). Research indicates that Hetian sheep can be divided at the genomic level into three subtypes: MTS, MGTS, and GTS. This enhances the genetic diversity of Hetian sheep germplasm resources and provides guidance for the conservation of Hetian sheep breeds. Additionally, we have identified genes related to multiparous traits in MGTS and GTS, offering insights for the selection and breeding of multiparous Hetian sheep.

AB  - Pubenza is a remarkable palaeontological site of Colombia, and a place that could hold some of the potentially oldest evidence of humans in northern South America. Previous palaeontological research at this site has mainly focused on the megafauna. Here we describe and establish the systematic palaeontology for the small fauna that inhabited this ancient lacustrine ecosystem, including the first report of birds, tortoises and vipers for the Late Pleistocene in Colombia. Furthermore, exceptionally well preserved fossilised wasp nests are morphologically and elementally characterised, which is the first report of an ichnofossil of this kind in northern South America. In addition, new material of kinosternid turtles, armadillos and rodents is also described. Our results reveal that the Bogota River Basin, where Pubenza is located, was a rich ecosystem during the Late Pleistocene and a region of great interest for future articulated palaeontological and archaeological studies.

AB  - Vertebrate surveillance for eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) activity usually focuses on three types of vertebrates: horses, passerine birds, and sentinel chicken flocks. However, there is a variety of wild vertebrates that are exposed to EEEV infections and can be used to track EEEV activity. In 2009, we initiated a pilot study in northern New England, United States, to evaluate the effectiveness of using wild cervids (free-ranging whitetailed deer and moose) as spatial sentinels for EEEV activity. In Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont during 2009-2017, we collected blood samples from hunter-harvested cervids at tagging stations and obtained harvest location information from hunters. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention processed the samples for EEEV antibodies using plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNTs). We detected EEEV antibodies in 6 to 17% of cervid samples in the different states and mapped cervid EEEV seropositivity in northern New England. EEEV antibody-positive cervids were the first detections of EEEV activity in the state of Vermont, in northern Maine, and northern New Hampshire. Our key result was the detection of the antibodies in areas far outside the extent of documented wild bird, mosquito, human case, or veterinary case reports of EEEV activity in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont.These findings showed that cervid (deer and moose) serosurveys can be used to characterize the geographic extent of EEEV activity, especially in areas with low EEEV activity or with little or no EEEV surveillance. Cervid EEEV serosurveys can be a useful tool for mapping EEEV activity in areas of North America in addition to northern New England.

AB  - Very little is known about factors determining the assemblage structure of megadiverse polyphagous-herbivore scarab chafers in the tropics (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae). Here, we examined the composition of Sri Lankan chafer assemblages and investigated whether it is influenced more by the general ecoclimatic situation, macrohabitat, or indetermined stochastic biotic and abiotic factors of each locality. We also explored the influence of the latter on separate lineages and general body size. Based on dedicated field surveys conducted during the dry and wet seasons, we examined 4847 chafer individuals of 105 species sampled using multiple UV-light traps in 11 localities covering different forest types and altitudinal zones. Assemblages were assessed for compositional similarity, species diversity, and abundance within four major eco-spatial partitions: forest types, elevational zones, localities, and macrohabitats. Our results revealed that assemblages were shaped mainly by locality stochastics (i.e., multi-factor ensemble of all biotic and abiotic environmental conditions at local scale), and to a minor extent by ecoclimatic conditions. Macrohabitat had little effect on the assemblage composition. This was true for the entire chafer assemblage as well as for all single lineages or different body size classes. However, in medium and large species the contrasts between localities were less pronounced, which was not the case for individual lineages of the assemblage. Contrasts of assemblage similarity between localities were much more evident than those for forest types and elevation zones. Significant correlation between species composition and geographic distance was found only for the assemblage of small-bodied specimens. Seasonal change (dry-wet) in species composition was minor and only measurable in a few localities. The strong turnover between examined localities corroborates with the high degree of endemism in many phytophagous chafers, particularly in Sericini. Connected with their hypothetic poor habitat specificity and polyphagy, this might also explain why so many chafer crop pests in the Asian tropics are endemics.

AB  - Wildlife feeding activities are growing as a trend in recent years, with wild ruminants (e.g. deer in urban parks) receiving an increasingly unnatural diet as a result of public attention. The effects of diet on the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants have been established in the context of animal agriculture, with highly modified diets driving morphological changes in the rumen papillae. However, these dietary effects have not been widely explored in wild ruminants that are exposed to recreational feeding. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of human-wildlife feeding interactions on the rumen papillae of a wild population of fallow deer in Phoenix Park, Dublin. The length, width, and density of the ventral rumen papillae were compared across a variety of feeding behaviours, ranging from deer that consistently accept food from humans to deer that rarely, if ever, accept food from humans. The surface enlargement factor (SEF) was also calculated as a measure of overall absorptive surface in the rumen and was similarly compared. Statistical analysis revealed that consistent acceptors of food had significantly higher papillae density than those that do not accept food. Increased papillae density in deer receiving high amounts of human food suggests a shift in the internal rumen environment. A lack of significant change in the SEF suggests that a cellular change may be occurring. This artificial rumen state requires further attention to elucidate the full extent of these feeding impacts on the gastrointestinal integrity of these wild deer. Moreover, this is a call for research into other human-wildlife feeding interactions that occur in human-dominated landscapes, beyond the deer of Phoenix Park.

AB  - The recognition of a proboscidean subspecies, Mammuthus armeniacus taiwanicus, from the Pleistocene represents one of the milestones for paleontological research in Taiwan in the 1970s. However, the whereabouts of the holotype and referred specimens remain unknown due to curation issues. Here, we report the rediscovery of the holotype and five referred specimens in the Tainan City Zuojhen Fossil Park collection and National Taiwan University, out of 16 original specimens in the private and museum collections, after our intense search for historical fossil materials. Given the size difference between the holotype (smaller) from Taiwan and other Eurasian mammoths, this Taiwan mammoth may represent an island dwarf rather than only a subspecies of steppe mammoths as originally identified in 1975. Our rediscovery of original materials of mammoths from the Pleistocene of Taiwan promises to further test this taxonomic and evolutionary hypothesis in the eastern margin of Eurasia, and to elucidate the Pleistocene extinctions and faunal turnover leading to the modern biodiversity.

AB  - Background Sharing of space by humans and wildlife at a time may ignite apparent conflict. Populations of many species are declining due to the degradation of wildlife habitats caused by agricultural activities. Additionally, livestock may compete with wild herbivores for grazing and reduce the abundance of wild prey for carnivores. A reduction in populations of prey species of large predators might cause carnivores to be attracted towards livestock, ultimately provoking and aggravating the human-carnivores conflict. This study investigated the current status of the human-predators conflict in and around the Bale Mountains National Park. Results Most (72.75%) respondents agreed on the presence of livestock predation. Major reported predators were spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), olive baboon (Papio anubis), African wolf (Canis lupaster), aardvark (Orycteropus afer), genet (Genetta genetta), Ethiopian wolf (Canis simensis), lion (Panthera leo), and leopard (Panthera pardus). Cattle (54.19%), sheep (70.96%), goat (32.0%), donkey (37.72%) and horse (27.54%) were mentioned as major target of predators. Within the past ten years 1623 sheep, 741 cattle, 639 goats, 193 donkeys, and 124 horses were predated. This study found an increasing trend of livestock predation. The trend was reported to be high within the Park (68%). During the past ten years, households reported killings of 3320 livestock that cost 347,460.53 USD. Loss of 8.66 USD per month constituted 27.45% of their monthly income which is expected to have a great sustenance impact. Human settlement (41%), agricultural practices (38.6%), overgrazing (25.3%), deforestation for charcoal production (25.1%), deliberate fire to free lands for agriculture (17.3%) were noticed as major causes of livestock depredation. Conclusions The results of the present study show that there is strong human-livestock predator conflict in the study area. Therefore, the author suggested that conflict mitigation efforts focus on securing the livestock enclosure to protected areas and regular compensation fees for farmers that face great damage from wildlife. The foremost action should be awareness creation about the environmental, social, and economic importance of protected areas. The management staff of the Park is also expected to promote community involvement in the plan of mitigation strategies and practices.

AB  - Body size is one of the most characteristic traits of every animal species and strongly influences its ecological niche. Identifying life-history traits that are associated with body size and investigating possible causalities behind such contingencies is thus a central topic in evolutionary ecology. In this study, we examined whether adult body size in Lepidoptera relates with resource type used at larval stage, larval dietary specialisation, voltinism, or adult diel activity. Based on previous findings, we hypothesised that species associated with woody plants are overall larger than those feeding on herbaceous plants or alternative food sources (e.g., lichens, detritus etc.). We further hypothesised that larger body sizes are associated with a lower degree of dietary specialisation, a univoltine life style, and nocturnal activity in adults. To test our hypotheses, we focussed on more than 220 species of European Erebidae moths, one of the taxonomically and ecologically most diverse Lepidoptera families worldwide. Increasing availability of molecular data for this group, coupled with advances in phylogenetic comparative methods, allowed us to study these trait relationships by accounting for shared evolutionary history among species, and- in addition to that- investigate potential causalities driving the detected patterns. We found adult body size to be positively linked with woody plant feeding and a univoltine life cycle, supporting the respective hypothesis. Our results further indicated that resource type affects the evolution of body size, while the latter strongly determines voltinism. Contrary to expectation, body size was neither related with larval dietary specialisation nor with adult diel activity. In conclusion, our study suggests that smaller body sizes, frequently associated with feeding on herbaceous plants or alternative food sources, are of evolutionary advantage as they facilitate the realisation of multiple generations per year and thus allow for faster adaptations to changing environmental conditions.

AB  - Since nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient for many herbivores, variations in dietary N content will affect their fitness. In the Seto Inland Sea, Japan, the N content of green algae, Ulva spp., has in recent years shown a tendency to decrease due to the progress of oligotrophication. We investigated the effect of the reduction in N content of Ulva australis on the survival, growth, and reproduction of the herbivorous amphipod Ampithoe tarasovi under laboratory conditions. When amphipods were fed U. australis with a low N content, survivorship was not affected. However, the growth of both males and females was impaired due to the reduced molt increment and extended intermolt period. Furthermore, the low N content delayed female maturation and reduced the percentage of ovulation alongside the brood size and number of broods. These results suggest that the total number of eggs produced in the lifetime of a female in A. tarasovi is markedly reduced under low N food conditions. Therefore, in coastal waters where dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) is deficient, because the tissue N content of algae reflects the DIN concentration in the ambient water, the population density of A. tarasovi may decrease due to the reduction in the number of viable offspring.

AB  - Introduction and objective. Reports on tick-borne infections in free-living juvenile animals and their impact on survival of cervids in nature are lacking. The aim of the study was to detect and identify the Babesia and Anaplasma phagocytophilum species/ecotypes that may have contributed to the death of juvenile animals from a wildlife rescue centre in spring 2020.
   Material and methods. PCR amplification and sequencing of two genetic markers (18S rDNA and cox1 for Babesia, 16S rDNA and groEL for A. phagocytophilum) were used for screening eleven samples derived from juvenile animals which died in a rescue centre (seven roe deer Capreolus capreolus, one elk Alces alces, one red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris, one European beaver Castor fiber, one red fox Vulpes vulpes). Phylogenetic analysis of full-length 18S rDNA sequence was performed to enable differentiation between two closely-related species infecting wild ungulates, Babesia capreoli and Babesia divergens (zoonotic).
   Results. The occurrence of the typical SNPs of B. capreoli at two discriminating positions in the 18S rRNA gene allowed identification of B. capreoli infection in a roe deer calf. In two calves, Anaplasma phagocytophilum ecotype 2 was identified, including the same calf co-infection. No Babesia DNA was amplified in an elk calf treated for babesiosis. Splenomegaly was recorded in roe deer calves with A. phagocytophilum and A. phagocytophilum + B. capreoli infection.
   Conclusions. The study revealed that tick-borne infections are common among juvenile, free-living cervids and may contribute to their mortality.

AB  - The production and reproduction of small ruminants, such as sheep and goats, living under extensive range-grazing conditions may be influenced by the availability of nutrients and the mineral content of forage. This study evaluated the biodistribution of calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na) and zinc (Zn) in whole blood, serum, blood clots, plasma, plasma sediments and hair in sheep and goats. Forty clinically healthy, nonpregnant female sheep and goats were enrolled in the study. Hair and blood samples were performed in duplicate to assess mineral concentration in biological substrates using a Thermo Scientific iCAP- Q ICP-MS spectrometer (Omaha, Ne, USA). Higher levels of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, and Na were observed in blood and blood clots than in serum, plasma, plasma sediments and hair in sheep and goats. A significant effect of species was observed for all the bioactive element concentrations in the investigated substrates (p < 0.05). The results revealed positive correlations between serum and plasma for all investigated elements in sheep (p < 0.0001) and for Mn and Na in goats (p < 0.001), as well as between serum and blood for Ca, Fe, Mg and Mn in sheep (p < 0.0001) and for Ca and Mn in goats (p < 0.001). Plasma and blood showed a positive correlation for Ca, Fe, and Mn (p < 0.001) in sheep, and for Fe, Mn, Na, and Zn (p < 0.0001) in goats. These findings elucidate differences in biodistribution between sheep and goats, offering valuable insights for livestock production.

AB  - Medicinal leech aquaculture is gaining importance due to increased clinical demand and conservation concerns resulting from overharvesting. Hirudo verbana, a CITES-listed and commercially valuable species, requires nutritionally adequate, species-specific feeding strategies for sustainable production. Although leeches feed on various vertebrate hosts in nature, the effects of different blood sources and forms on their growth, health, and water quality remain poorly understood in leech aquaculture. This study evaluated the impacts of natural and heparinized blood from cattle, sheep, goat, and live frog on leech growth, digestive response, and water quality. A total of 315 leeches were fed monthly for 3 months using selected blood sources. Parameters including specific growth rate (SGR), regurgitation, mortality, deformities, and water quality were monitored. The highest SGRs were observed in heparinized cattle (3.83%) and natural goat blood (3.61%), while sheep blood resulted in the lowest (1.87%). Regurgitation was associated with high ash and moisture content and low basophil levels. A strong negative correlation (r = - 0.853, P < 0.05) between basophils and regurgitation may indicate a potential biomarker for feed tolerance in medicinal leeches. Bloods with higher total protein and lower cholesterol and ash supported better growth. Groups fed with goat and sheep blood exhibited markedly higher conductivity and nitrogenous waste levels, especially ammonium. These findings emphasize the importance of blood composition in feed formulation for medicinal leeches and support the use of natural goat and heparinized cattle blood to enhance growth performance, health, and environmental outcomes in H. verbana aquaculture.

AB  - Willows serve as a keystone host-plant genus for insect herbivores. The diversity of insect herbivore assemblages harboured by willows is typically affected by the diversity of specialised metabolites that willows produce. Here, we studied three small, shrubby willow species (Salix myrtilloides, S. repens and S. rosmarinifolia) that primarily occur at sites of high conservation value in the Czech Republic. We explored if associated insect communities reflect the specialised chemistry in these uncommon host plants. We measured the three willow species for overall metabolomic profiles and salicinoids using non-targeted metabolomics and sampled them for caterpillars, leaf-chewing beetles (adults and larvae), sawfly larvae, and sap-sucking Hemiptera. We detected 2,067 metabolites across the three willow species. Most of them were shared by S. repens and S. rosmarinifolia, while S. myrtilloides showed a distinct chemical profile. Salix repens and S. rosmarinifolia also had significantly higher concentration and richness of salicinoids than S. myrtilloides. Th e abundance of all insect species and generalists that also feed on host-plants outside Salicaceae was higher on S. myrtilloides than on S. rosmarinifolia or S. repens. The abundance of Salicaceae specialists did not differ among the three willow spe-cies. Insect community composition, in contrast, did not show pronounced differences among the three willows. Our results suggest that salicinoids may be responsible for the low abundance of generalist herbivores. Furthermore, our study indicates that herbivore community composition does not reflect the specialised chemistry in the three willows we studied. Therefore, we hypothesise that the presence of some of the insect species is primarily determined by other factors, such as the habitat type where the respective willow species occur. Although the studied willows possess some characteristic specialised chemistry, we conclude that their importance as hosts of specific and sometimes threatened insect fauna may be mediated by willow habitat preference.

AB  - Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a significant zoonotic parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus cestode parasites, affecting a variety of animals, including humans and wildlife, with serious implications for public health. In Pakistan, CE continues to pose a considerable public health challenge, impacting the livestock sector and wildlife conservation due to its economic and socio-cultural ramifications. This study aimed to examine the frequency of lesions indicative of Echinococcus cysts in livestock across several slaughterhouses in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), with the data collection occurring from May 2022 to February 2024. A total of 1120 animals, including 455 buffaloes, 295 cows, 200 sheep, and 170 goats, were assessed. The overall CE prevalence was found to be 5.7% (95% CI: 4.3-7.0%; 63 out of 1120), with the highest frequency in buffaloes (6.6%; 95% CI: 4.3-8.9%) and the lowest in goats (2.9%; 95% CI: 0.4-5.5%). Female animals demonstrated a higher infection rate (6.3%; 95% CI: 4.4-8.1%) compared to males (4.7%; 95% CI: 2.8-6.7%), with the liver being the most frequently affected organ (55.0%; 95% CI: 41.7-66.3%). Additionally, a survey of 200 respondents revealed that 74.5% of farmers were unaware of CE, and only 14.5% were taking preventive measures against parasites. These findings suggest a potential decline in the prevalence of this parasitic disease, likely due to advancements in veterinary services and modern farming practices.

AB  - Biochar and organic fertilizer are widely supported to maintain crop production and sustainable development of agroecosystems. However, it is unclear how biochar and organic fertilizer alone or in combination regulate soil functional microbiomes and their relationships to ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). Herein, a long-term (started in 2013) field experiment, containing five fertilization treatments, was employed to explore the effects of biochar and organic fertilizer applications on the EMF (based on 18 functional indicators of crop productivity, soil nutrient supply, element cycling, and microbial biomass) and the functional microbiomes of bulk soil and rhizosphere soil [normalizing the abundances of 64 genes related to carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulphur (S) cycles]. Compared with single-chemical fertilization, biochar and organic fertilizer inputs significantly enhanced most ecosystem-single functions and, in particular, the EMF significantly increased by 18.7-30.1%; biochar and organic fertilizer applications significantly increased the abundances of soil microbial functional taxa related to C-N-P-S cycles to varying degree. The combined application of biochar and organic fertilizer showed a better improvement in these indicators compared to using them individually. Most functional microbial populations in the soil, especially the taxa involved in C degradation, nitrification, nitrate-reduction, organic P mineralization, and S cycling showed significantly positive associations with the EMF at different threshold levels, which ultimately was regulated by soil pH and nutrient availability. These results highlight the strong links between soil microbiomes and agroecosystem functions, as well as providing scientific support for inclusion of biochar in agricultural production and services with organic amendments.
   8-year field evidence revealed impacts of biochar and pig manure on soil functional microbiome and ecosystem functions.Biochar and pig manure inputs notably enhanced most ecosystem-single functions and the EMF increased by 18.7-30.1%.Biochar and pig manure inputs notably enriched soil functional microbes related to C-N-P-S cycles to varying degree.Increase in EMF was related to microbe-driven soil processes such as C degradation, nitrification, and Po mineralization.Inclusion of biochar in crop production with organic amendments could enhance agro-ecosystem functions and services.

AB  - Estuaries support diverse fish and invertebrate communities, including resident species that rely on estuarine habitats year-round and transient migratory species. The unique movement patterns of these animals connect habitats within and far beyond the estuary and are integrally linked to fisheries management objectives. With a focus on Chesapeake Bay, this study leveraged data from collaborative acoustic telemetry networks in the northwest Atlantic to assess habitat use and phenology of movements for seven species of fish (cownose rays, dusky sharks, smooth dogfish, alewife, striped bass, common carp, and blue catfish) and one invertebrate (horseshoe crabs). A total of 288 acoustically tagged individuals were detected >3.2 million times (6,743 to 2,095,717 detections per species) on receivers across similar to 20.5 degrees of latitude spanning the North American Atlantic seaboard from Florida, USA, to New Brunswick, Canada. Common metrics of movement and phenology grouped these species as resident (common carp, blue catfish, horseshoe crabs), primarily resident in estuaries (juvenile striped bass), and coastal migrant (cownose rays, dusky sharks, smooth dogfish, alewife); maximum distance traveled varied by three orders of magnitude among these species. Further analysis of phenology for coastal migrants elucidated the timing and duration of these species' use of Chesapeake Bay. Collectively, movements linked habitats within Chesapeake Bay and connected the estuary to coastal ecosystems both to the north (e.g., alewife) and south (e.g., cownose rays), creating networks of fisheries management jurisdictions that varied in complexity and identified opportunities for enhancement to current management or co-management of some species. Our results elucidate the importance of estuaries to species with diverse movement behaviors, identify scales and pathways of habitat connectivity via animal movements, and highlight the utility of collaborative acoustic telemetry networks for quantifying movements relevant to both ecological research and fisheries management.

AB  - Many populations of consumers consist of relatively specialized individuals that eat only a subset of the foods consumed by the population at large. Although the ecological significance of individual-level diet variation is recognized, such variation is difficult to document, and its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Optimal foraging theory provides a useful framework for predicting how individuals might select different diets, positing that animals balance the "opportunity cost " of stopping to eat an available food item against the cost of searching for something more nutritious; diet composition should be contingent on the distribution of food, and individual foragers should be more selective when they have greater energy reserves to invest in searching for high-quality foods. We tested these predicted mechanisms of individual niche differentiation by quantifying environmental (resource heterogeneity) and organismal (nutritional condition) determinants of diet in a widespread browsing antelope (bushbuck, Tragelaphus sylvaticus) in an African floodplain-savanna ecosystem. We quantified individuals' realized dietary niches (taxonomic richness and composition) using DNA metabarcoding of fecal samples collected repeatedly from 15 GPS-collared animals (range 6-14 samples per individual, median 12). Bushbuck diets were structured by spatial heterogeneity and constrained by individual condition. We observed significant individual-level partitioning of food plants by bushbuck both within and between two adjacent habitat types (floodplain and woodland). Individuals with home ranges that were closer together and/or had similar vegetation structure (measured using LiDAR) ate more similar diets, supporting the prediction that heterogeneous resource distribution promotes individual differentiation. Individuals in good nutritional condition had significantly narrower diets (fewer plant taxa), searched their home ranges more intensively (intensity-of-use index), and had higher-quality diets (percent digestible protein) than those in poor condition, supporting the prediction that animals with greater endogenous reserves have narrower realized niches because they can invest more time in searching for nutritious foods. Our results support predictions from optimal foraging theory about the energetic basis of individual-level dietary variation and provide a potentially generalizable framework for understanding how individuals' realized niche width is governed by animal behavior and physiology in heterogeneous landscapes.

AB  - Aim of study: To demonstrate the virulence of a Mycobacterium bovis local pig isolate in order to contribute to a better understanding of the pathological and immunological consequences of M. bovis infection in previous sensitized animals. Area of study: Buenos Aires, Argentina Material and methods: One group of ten pigs received two oral doses of killed M. bovis suspension and a comparative intradermal tuberculin test (CIT) (multiple sensitized) and then was infected with the M. bovis strain. Another group only received the CIT (single sensitized) and the infective dose. Humoral immune response was followed monthly, and gross pathology, histopathological and bacteriological analysis were performed at necropsy 100 days after infection. Main results: M. bovis oral infection induced lesions and allowed bacterial growth in most of the animals. Previous sensitization with killed M. bovis suspension slightly raised the intensity of the response, as the multiple sensitized group showed higher lesion scores and humoral response. Research highlights: Although the differences in lesion scores were not statistically significant, oral route infection after sensitization can modify the course of infections towards a fast development of lesions with a higher fibrotic component suggestive of increased resistance to infection in the right conditions.

AB  - Understanding farmer behaviour and drivers for behaviour change will be the key to bringing about practice change, such as increasing management and enhancement of native biodiversity on-farm. Farmer participation in biodiversity protection and management is a critical challenge for both national conservation outcomes and achieving more sustainable farm systems. Enhancing native biodiversity provides a mechanism for increasing the sustainability of food and fibre production, mitigation of environmental emissions, and enhancing the resilience of farm systems to weather events and the impacts of climate change. We surveyed 500 sheep and beef farmers throughout New Zealand using a survey explicitly based on the dominant psychological model of volitional behaviour, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Farmers' attitudes, perception of social norms, control beliefs, moral obligation, and perceived private-public benefit, regarding the protection and management of native biodiversity on-farm, were investigated. We used a combination of descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and TPB regression modelling of the survey data to understand past pro-biodiversity behaviour and future intentions to implement pro-biodiversity behaviours on-farm. We found that sheep and beef farmers saw (1) greater public than private benefit resulting from the protection and management of native biodiversity on-farm; (2) belief in the efficacy of specific biodiversity behaviours has a stronger relationship with actual behaviour than intentional behaviour; and (3) planning for pro-biodiversity behaviours, such as in a farm planning process, increases farmer pro-biodiversity behaviour. We conclude there is a need to increase farmer understanding of pro-biodiversity practices and outcomes for both farmer private and public benefit and the removal and dissolution of perceived barriers and constraints preventing more pro-biodiversity behaviour on-farm. Based on this research, we recommend that policy initiatives should be targeted at (1) illustrating and communicating the multiple values of native biodiversity to farm systems and farming enterprises (private benefit), and to ecosystem function and New Zealand's conservation objectives as a whole (public benefit); (2) the specific areas operating as behavioural controls on pro-biodiversity behaviour, and (3) integrating native biodiversity considerations into farm planning processes.

AB  - DNA barcoding and DNA-based species delimitation are major tools in DNA taxonomy. Sampling has been a central debate in this context, because the geographical composition of samples affects the accuracy and performance of DNA barcoding. Performance of complex DNA-based species delimitation is to be tested under simpler conditions in absence of geographic sampling bias. Here, we present an empirical dataset sampled from a single locality in a Southeast-Asian biodiversity hotspot (Laos: Phou Pan mountain). We investigate the performance of various species delimitation approaches on a megadiverse assemblage of herbivorous chafer beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) to infer whether species delimitation suffers in the same way from exaggerate infraspecific variation despite the lack of geographic genetic variation that led to inconsistencies between entities from DNA-based and morphology-based species inference in previous studies. For this purpose, a 658 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) was analyzed for a total of 186 individuals of 56 morphospecies. Tree-based and distance-based species delimitation methods were used. All approaches showed a rather limited match ratio (max. 77%) with morphospecies. Poisson tree process (PTP) and statistical parsimony network analysis (TCS) prevailingly over-splitted morphospecies, while 3% clustering and Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD) also lumped several species into one entity. ABGD revealed the highest congruence between molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and morphospecies. Disagreements between morphospecies and MOTUs have to be explained by historically acquired geographic genetic differentiation, incomplete lineage sorting, and hybridization. The study once again highlights how important morphology still is in order to correctly interpret the results of molecular species delimitation.

AB  - Simple Summary Since PCV2 is currently the primary viral agent in intensive pigs, the cost of immune suppression and preventative measures has resulted in severe economic losses. It has been claimed that PCVs infect wild pigs in a number of nations, including South Korea, Germany, and Italy. Jiangxi province in China is a heavily populated area with an extremely intensive pig production industry, but data on the transmission of PCVs in wild boar are poor. In order to ascertain the incidence of PCV1/2/3 and the genetic characteristics of PCV2 circulating in wild boar in Jiangxi province, an epidemiological investigation was conducted. We discovered a medium prevalence of PCVs, notably PCV2, which indicated that wild boar in Jiangxi province were exposed to PCVs. Our findings highlight the need for the pig sector to actively prevent the contact between livestock and wild boar, which have a high risk of PCVs infection. A number of disorders that harm pig production are linked to porcine circoviruses, including PCV2. PCV2 infection is a substantial contributor to porcine-circovirus-associated illnesses (PCAS) and the post-weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), which have a significant negative economic impact on pig production. Additionally, PCV infection has been labeled as a global concern to cattle and wildlife. This study's objectives were to examine the prevalence of PCV1/2/3 in Jiangxi Province, China, and to clarify the epidemiological significance of wild boar in PCV epidemiology. The 2020 hunting seasons resulted in the collection of 138 wild boar samples for PCV1/2/3 detection, which was followed by the genetic clarification of PCV2 strains. According to our data, 21.7% (30/138) of the population had PCV1 positivity, 22.5% (31/138) had PCV2 positivity, and 5.8% (8/138) had PCV3 positivity. Additionally, 10 out of 138 wild boar samples had PCV1 and PCV2 co-infections, while 5 out of 138 wild boar samples had PCV2 and PC3 co-infections. Nineteen full-length PCV2 genomes measuring 1767 nt were recovered from various animal tissues using conventional PCR. Eighteen out of nineteen PCV2 strains were identified as PCV2b by phylogenetic tree analysis, which was completed by the reference strain HLJ2015 obtained from domestic pigs in 2015. Additionally, one genotype of PCV2d JX11-2020 (MW889021) shared a sub-branch with the referenced strain TJ (AY181946), which was isolated in domestic pigs in 2002. This finding raises the possibility that domestic pigs could contract PCV2 strains from wild boar, posing a serious threat to the Jiangxi province of China's pig production industry.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) and water are crucial in crop production but increasingly scarce environmental resources. Reducing their inputs can affect the whole plant-arthropod community including biocontrol agents. In a multitrophic sys-tem, we studied the interaction of the bottom-up effects of moderately reduced N concentration and/or water supply as well as the top-down effects of pests of different feeding guilds on plant nutritional quality (N and car-bon concentration), direct defense (alkaloids and phenolics), and indirect defense (plant volatile organic com-pounds); on herbivore performance and host quality (N and carbon) to parasitoids and the latter's performance. Studied organisms were tomato plants, the sap feeders Macrosiphum euphorbiae and Bemisia tabaci, the leaf chewers Tuta absoluta and Spodoptera littoralis, and the parasitic wasps Aphelinus abdominalis and Necremnus tutae. Resource limitation affected plant quality, triggering bottom-up effects on herbivore and para-sitoid performance, except for T. absoluta and N. tutae. Feeding guild had a major influence: bottom-up effects were stronger on sap feeders; N effects were stronger on sap feeders while water effects were stronger with leaf chewers (S. littoralis). Top-down effects of leaf chewer herbivory partly attenuated bottom-up effects and partly suppressed plant defenses. Bottom-up effects weakened when cascading up trophic levels. In summary, the interaction between plants, pests, and beneficial insects was modulated by abiotic factors, affecting insect performance. Simultaneous abiotic and biotic impact shaped plant biochemistry depending on the feeding guild: the biotic top-down effect of leaf chewer herbivory attenuated the bottom-up effects of plant nutrition and hence dominated the plant biochemical profile whereas in sap feeder infested leaves, it corresponded to the abiotic impact. This study highlights the plant's finely tuned regulatory system facilitating response prioritization. It offers perspectives on how smart manipulation of plant nutrient solutions might save resources while maintaining efficient biocontrol in crop production. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Floral nectar is frequently colonized by microbes among which bacteria and yeasts are the most abundant. These microbes have the ability to alter nectar characteristics with consequences for the whole community of flower-visiting insects. Recent research carried out on natural enemies of insect herbivores has shown that microbe-mediated changes in nectar traits can influence the foraging behavior and life history traits of parasitoids. The production of microbial volatile organic compounds can affect the attraction of parasitoids to nectar, while changes in sugar and amino acid composition can impact their longevity. Future research should focus on understanding the effects of nectar microbial colonization on parasitoid reproduction, with a specific emphasis on the interactions among different microbial taxa known to co-occur in floral nectar. Overall, this review highlights the importance of considering the role of nectar-inhabiting microbes in shaping the interactions between parasitoids and their food resources.

AB  - Iberian pig production has its own quality regulation, which defines different handling and feeding systems for this breed. These differences influence production costs, market price and environmental impact. The most extensive system of fattening Iberian pigs is based on foraging acorns in a silvopastoral system named dehesa, and consumers usually associate the Iberian pork with this system, although nowadays more intensive systems are dominant due to their productivity and management simplicity. The aim of this study is to assess the Carbon Footprint (CF) of the different Iberian pig production systems using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology.This study is based on data collected from 19 Iberian pig farms producing nursery growers (& LE;25 kg, 2 farms), pre-finished pigs (100-110 kg, 3 farms) and 3 types of finished pigs (150-175 kg), including free-range fattened pigs (17 farms), outdoor intensively fattened pigs (2 farms) and indoor intensively fattened pigs (2 farms). The CF was calculated with a "cradle to farm gate" approach using the kg of live weight (kgLW) as functional unit, and including C sequestration in soils and biomass, which was calculated by field monitoring in a selection of measuring points. The average CFs of the final products were 9.2 & PLUSMN; 2.5 kg CO2eq kgLW- 1 for nursery growers, 5.6 & PLUSMN; 2.42 kg CO2eq kgLW- 1 for pre-finished pigs,-5.6 & PLUSMN; 6.5 kg CO2eq kgLW- 1 for free-range fattened pigs, 3.1 & PLUSMN; 1.5 kg CO2eq kgLW-1 for outdoor intensively fattened pigs and 7.7 & PLUSMN; 0.3 kg CO2eq kgLW- 1 for intensively fattened pigs. The main C sinks of the dehesa system (trees and soil) sequestered an average of 3.18 t CO2eq ha-1 year- 1. This C sequestration, averaging-10.2 & PLUSMN; 6.7 kg CO2eq kgLW-1 in free-range pig production, offsets 223% of the GHG emissions in those systems, which resulted in a negative CF (net CO2 sequestration). There was a direct rela-tionship between CF and pig stocking rate, leading to strongly negative CF values on those farms with the lowest pig stocking rates.

AB  - Herbivorous insects are predicted to have higher densities in larger patches, while their natural enemies will be more affected by the edge of these patches. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the relationship between brassica horticultural plot shape and the adjacent land use on the abundance of P. xylostella and its chances to be parasitised. Samples were collected from brassica plots during spring. Landscape metrics of the study area were estimated using Landsat images. We found a negative relationship between the pest abundance and the perimeter-to-area ratio of the brassica plot, and a positive relationship with land cover estimated from Landsat images. The proportion of parasitised immatures showed opposite relationship with the same variables. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that there exists significant variability in amino acid (AA) delta N-15 values of terrestrial plants, discriminating among plant types (i.e., legume seeds, grasses, tree leaves) as well as tissues of the same plant. For the first time, we investigate the potential of the spacing between the delta N-15 values of different AAs to differentiate between plant types and thus elucidate their relative importance in herbivore diet. Using principal component analysis, we show that it is possible to distinguish among five plant categories-cereal grains, rachis, legume seeds, herbaceous plants, and woody plants-whose consumption has different implications for understanding herbivore ecology and management practices. Furthermore, we were able to correctly classify the herbaceous plant diet of modern cattle using AA delta N-15 values of their tooth dentine adjusted for trophic enrichment. The AA delta N-15 patterns of wild and domestic herbivores from archaeological sites seem to be consistent with diets comprised predominantly of herbaceous plants, but there is variation in AA delta N-15 values among individuals that may reflect differing inputs of other plant types. The variation in AA delta N-15 values does not necessarily reflect the variation in herbivore bulk collagen delta C-13 and delta N-15 values, indicating that AA delta N-15 values have the potential to provide additional insights into plant dietary sources compared to bulk tissue isotope values alone. Future work should focus on defining trophic enrichment factors for a wider range of terrestrial herbivores and expanding libraries of primary producer AA delta N-15 values.

AB  - Plants have to cope with different biotic and abiotic stresses, such as the attacks of pathogens and herbivores, high irradiance, droughts, salt stress or nutrient deficiencies throughout their lifetime. These environmental perturbations lead to the regulation of the "primary" and "secondary" carotenoid network. The formers are produced and stored in plastids and they are necessary for photosynthesis and related functions. Otherwise, secondary carotenoids are derivatives of primary carotenoids. They perform other important functions not related to the photosynthetic process but essential for plant survival as regulators of growth and development or as signal molecules at all levels of plant organization. This review provides a complete revision of the status of all these carotenoids, highlighting their newly discovered functions involved in plant-environment interaction. Concurrently, this review covers recent information on how carotenoids perform critical functions for the sur-vival of animals (including humans) and the way they are suitable diagnostic tools for assessing the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems.

AB  - Biologging has proven to be a powerful approach to investigate diverse questions related to movement ecology across a range of spatiotemporal scales and increasingly relies on multidisciplinary expertise. However, the variety of animal-borne equipment, coupled with little consensus regarding analytical approaches to interpret large, complex data sets presents challenges and makes comparison between studies and study species difficult. Here, we present a combined hardware and analytical approach for standardizing the collection, analysis, and interpretation of multisensor biologging data. Here, we present (i) a custom-designed integrated multisensor collar (IMSC), which was field tested on 71 free-ranging wild boar (Sus scrofa) over 2 years; (ii) a machine learning behavioral classifier capable of identifying six behaviors in free-roaming boar, validated across individuals equipped with differing collar designs; and (iii) laboratory and field-based calibration and accuracy assessments of animal magnetic heading measurements derived from raw magnetometer data. The IMSC capacity and durability exceeded expectations, with a 94% collar recovery rate and a 75% cumulative data recording success rate, with a maximum logging duration of 421 days. The behavioral classifier had an overall accuracy of 85% in identifying the six behavioral classes when tested on multiple collar designs and improved to 90% when tested on data exclusively from the IMSC. Both laboratory and field tests of magnetic compass headings were in precise agreement with expectations, with overall median magnetic headings deviating from ground truth observations by 1.7 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. Although multisensor equipment and sophisticated analyses are now commonplace in biologging studies, the IMSC hardware and analytical framework presented here provide a valuable tool for biologging researchers and will facilitate standardization of biologging data across studies. In addition, we highlight the potential of additional analyses available using this framework that can be adapted for use in future studies on terrestrial mammals.
   Here we present the development and extensive field testing of a multisensor biologging collar in wild boar (Sus scrofa), coupled with classification techniques for identifying boar behavior from raw accelerometer data and, for the first time, provide a detailed characterization of magnetic heading data derived from raw magnetometer data in free-roaming individuals. By integrating our behavioral classifier and magnetic orientation data, we also explore dead-reckoning path reconstruction techniques that can provide a wealth of additional information for studies of animal movement and behavior.image

AB  - Studies in ecology, evolution, and conservation often rely on noninvasive samples, making it challenging to generate large amounts of high-quality genetic data for many elusive and at-risk species. We developed and optimized a Genotyping-in-Thousands by sequencing (GT-seq) panel using noninvasive samples to inform the management of invasive Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) in Haida Gwaii (Canada). We validated our panel using paired high-quality tissue and noninvasive fecal and hair samples to simultaneously distinguish individuals, identify sex, and reconstruct kinship among deer sampled across the archipelago, then provided a proof-of-concept application using field-collected feces on SGang Gwaay, an island of high ecological and cultural value. Genotyping success across 244 loci was high (90.3%) and comparable to that of high-quality tissue samples genotyped using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (92.4%), while genotyping discordance between paired high-quality tissue and noninvasive samples was low (0.50%). The panel will be used to inform future invasive species operations in Haida Gwaii by providing individual and population information to inform management. More broadly, our GT-seq workflow that includes quality control analyses for targeted SNP selection and a modified protocol may be of wider utility for other studies and systems where noninvasive genetic sampling is employed.

AB  - Moose management throughout much of Alaska and Canada relies on aerial count data, which are commonly collected using the geospatial population estimator (GSPE) protocol. The GSPE uses a model-based analytical approach and finite-population block kriging to estimate abundance from a collection of sampled survey units. Widespread implementation and well-documented analytical software have resulted in reliable estimates of moose abundance, density, and composition across a large proportion of their range. Analysis is conducted almost exclusively using the GSPE software, which fits a fixed model structure to data collected within a single year. The downside of this approach to analysis is that the fixed model structure is inefficient for estimation, leading to more field effort than would otherwise be necessary to achieve a desired level of estimator precision. We developed a more easily modified and flexible Bayesian spatial general additive model approach (BSG) that accommodates spatial and temporal covariates (e.g., habitat characteristics, trend), multiple survey events, prior information, and incomplete detection. Using a series of 6 GSPE surveys conducted in Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, Alaska, USA, from 2003-2019, we established the equivalence of the 2 approaches under similar model structures. We then extended the BSG to demonstrate how a more comprehensive approach to analysis can affect estimator precision and be used to assess ecological relationships. The precision of annual abundance estimators from the BSG were improved by an average of 43% over those based on the standard GSPE analysis, highlighting the very real costs of assuming a fixed (i.e., suboptimal) model structure. The population increased at a rate of 2.3%/year (95% CrI = 0.8-3.8%), and the increase was largely explained by a parallel increase in wildfire extent (i.e., high quality moose habitat). These results suggest that our approach could be used to increase estimator efficiency or decrease future survey costs without any modifications to the basic protocol. While modification of the GSPE software is possible, practitioners may find the BSG approach more convenient for quickly developing model structures for a particular application, thereby allowing them to extract more information from existing and future datasets.

AB  - Impediments that constrain animal movements across spatiotemporally heterogeneous landscapes can result in reduced or complete loss of access to critical resources. Across their range in North America, pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) are exposed to fences that can affect their ability to permeate the landscape, access critical resources, and respond to climatic variations. Understanding pronghorn movement responses to fences is essential for improving landscape permeability; however, prior studies provide only limited insight due to lack of information on fence characteristics and small sample sizes. Our study used hourly collar locations from adult female pronghorn in six herds in Montana, USA, and identified encounters with mapped fences to evaluate three movement responses (i.e., probability of an unaltered initial response, probability of crossing following an altered initial response, and passage time following an altered initial response) as a function of fence and landscape attributes. Based on 5581 encounters identified from movement pathways of 265 collared pronghorn and 979 km of mapped fences, we found that variability in pronghorn fence response was correlated with fence type. Woven wire fences substantially reduced unaltered initial and crossing responses and increased passage times as compared with low (i.e., average lowest wire height < 41 cm) or high (i.e., average lowest wire height & GE;41 cm) strand fences. Both low and high strand fences elicited similar responses of being relatively permeable at the initial encounter with reduced permeability thereafter. Fence crossing probabilities following altered initial responses increased through time modestly for strand fences but only negligibly for woven wire fences, with passage times averaging approximately 14 h. Pronghorn knowledge of and fidelity to specific permeable locations along fences, which may be due to inconsistent fence and landscape characteristics along the fence stretch, likely allow some woven wire fences and most strand fences, regardless of the average lowest wire height, to be permeable. Improving landscape permeability for pronghorn should focus on removing woven wire fences, replacing woven wire fences with strand fences, and incorporating variation in the lowest wire heights into new fence designs or modifications of existing fences.

AB  - Culicoides is a small dipteran genus of Ceratopogonidae Family with worldwide distribution. Due to their hematophagous habits, species within this genus are a biting nuisance to humans and domestic animals . They also transmit protozoa, filarial worms, and several arboviruses. The Northeastern region of Brazil is characterized by a semi-arid climate and few bodies of water, which does not favor breeding sites for ceratopogonids. In addition to the climatic factor, studies on Biting Midges Culicoides are scarce in this geographic region. The municipality of Pacoti, located in Serra de Baturit & eacute;, in Cear & aacute;, is an important area for agricultural production and ecotourism; also, Pacoti is located in an environmental protection area. Due to the medical and veterinary importance of these biting midges, a survey was conducted in Pacoti. For capture, CDC-type light traps were used near forested areas, where collections were carried out during two periods: March 2015, and August 2022. Of the 17 species found, 12 are new records for the municipality of Pacoti, nine are new records for the state of Cear & aacute;, and four are recorded for the first time for the Northeast region. Of the registered incriminated vectors, we found C. paraensis, C. insignis, and C. pusillus. The knowledge of biodiversity and geographic distribution update of Culicoides may contribute to prevention and control measures for vector-borne diseases in Cear & aacute;.

AB  - Occupancy models have been underused in multispecies plant studies. We evaluated the effectiveness of occupancy models to document impacts of management on grassland plant species populations in a pilot study. The study was designed to answer three questions: (1) From a list of 44 plant species, how many will have sufficient frequency to be analyzed? (2) Within a single site, which factor (sampling year or unit) influences occupancy and detection of each plant species? (3) How does the number of plots and visits affect the number of species with sufficient frequency for analysis? In 2012 and 2013, occupancy and detection probabilities of 44 plant species were assessed using permanently marked plots on two different grassland sites. Within each site, a fire and grazing managed unit and a burn-only control unit were used to test the efficacy of occupancy modeling for multiple plant species and study design. Four of the 44 species had sufficiently high known presence (pi) on both sites and years to be analyzed. There was little evidence to support that occupancy was different between years, despite very different weather patterns. There was support that occupancy was different in the burned and grazed unit compared with the control for Rhus copallinum L. Detection was highest (>= 0.8) for R. copallinum, while the other species analyzed varied. In 2012, eight species had sufficient pi for analysis. In 2013, 12 species had sufficient pi for analysis. Occupancy models can be useful for investigating multiple plant species; however, a priori investigation of species' distribution is necessary to ensure species can be analyzed. Detection of plants was never 1, and therefore, detection should continue to be incorporated in plant population models, regardless of modeling technique.

AB  - DNA metabarcoding is a contemporary technique in diet composition studies and stands to fill key knowledge gaps left by traditional diet analysis methods. For endangered species such as the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus), the fulfilment of these knowledge gaps presents an opportunity for improved management practices and vulnerability assessments. There are an estimated similar to 600 African wild dogs remaining in South Africa. These dogs are generally understood to prey upon impala (Aepyceros melampus) and other medium-sized ungulates. Here, we present the first assessment of DNA metabarcoding as a valuable method for diet composition analysis of this highly social carnivore. DNA from faecal samples collected across seven landscape types in the Kruger National Park (KNP) was extracted and used to determine the presence of seven unique prey taxa, including novel species such as the Cape hare (Lepus capensis). Impala was identified as a prey item in all landscape types, complementing the diet preference prediction made with stable isotope analysis using the same samples and existing understanding of wild dog diet. Given recommended improvements, the application of DNA metabarcoding in wild dog diet analysis shows promising prospects for identifying novel prey species and validating previous records of this endangered canids diet.

AB  - For the first time, the possibility of using infrared thermography to capture the temperature of the vulval skin surface around the calving process in order to forecast when the buffaloes' calving process will begin has been investigated. FLUKE infrared thermal camera was used to record the vulval skin surface temperature (VSST) and ocular temperature. Twenty-eight multiparous pregnant buffaloes had their thermograms taken at 6-h intervals between the 96th hour before the anticipated calving and the 24th hour after the calving. The eye and vulval skin surface showed a Delta T of 0.56 degrees C and 0.45 degrees C, respectively, indicating a considerable drop in temperature from 48 h before to calving. On the other hand, starting 6 h before calving, the vulval skin temperature showed an upward trend. There was minimal effect of circadian influence on the vulval skin surface temperature, as evidenced by the identical and significant declining pattern of the residual temperature of both the eye and VSST from 48 to 0 h of calving. Nonetheless, the reduction is ascribed to progesterone, which lowers vulval skin vascular perfusion and cutaneous circulation. Our study's findings suggested that, using related thermal signatures, vulval skin surface temperature variation in relation to calving as observed by digital infrared thermal imaging could be explored as a potential tool for predicting the onset of impending calving in buffaloes within -48 h.

AB  - Orexin is a ligand for orexin receptors OX1R and OX2R; it is a neuropeptide with pleiotropic functions, including regulation of reproduction. The current study was carried out to investigate the mRNA expression of the prepro-orexin gene (PPO) and orexin receptors (OX1R and OX2R) in ovarian follicles during different stages of their development in the ovary of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and to determine the role of orexin on oestradiol production. Ovarian follicles were classified into four groups based on size and oestradiol (E-2) level in the follicular fluid (FF) as follows: (i) small or F1, (ii) medium or F2, (iii) large or F3, and (iv) dominant/pre-ovulatory follicle or F4. In follicles, the mRNA expression of PPO and OX1R was greater in F3 and F4 follicles in granulosa cells (GC) and theca interna (TI) cells. OX2R expression did not vary among the different follicular stages in GC. Orexin-A and orexin receptors were localized in the cytoplasm of GC and TI, and intensity was higher in F3 and F4 follicles. In addition, we cultured GC and treated them at 0.1, 1.0, and 10 ng/mL orexin-A alone or in the presence of FSH (30 ng/mL) or IGF-I (10 ng/mL) for 48 h. There was a significant (p < .05) increase in oestradiol (E-2) secretion and cytochrome P0450 family 19 subfamily A member 1 (CYP19A1) expression from GC at 1.0 and 10.0 ng/mL orexin-A in the presence of 30 ng/mL follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) or 10 ng/mL insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In conclusion, the present study provided evidence that the orexin system is expressed in buffalo ovarian follicles, and orexin-A in the presence of FSH and IGF-I has a stimulatory effect on oestradiol secretion from the GC of water buffalo.

AB  - Livestock depredation by large carnivores is a global conservation challenge, and mitigation measures to reduce livestock losses are crucial for the coexistence of large carnivores and people. Various measures are employed to reduce livestock depredation but their effectiveness has rarely been tested. In this study, we tested the effectiveness of tall fences to reduce livestock losses to snow leopards Panthera uncia and wolves Canis lupus at night-time corrals at the winter camps of livestock herders in the Tost Mountains in southern Mongolia. Self-reported livestock losses at the fenced corrals were reduced from a mean loss of 3.9 goats and sheep per family and winter prior to the study to zero losses in the two winters of the study. In contrast, self-reported livestock losses in winter pastures, and during the rest of the year, when herders used different camps, remained high, which indicates that livestock losses were reduced because of the fences, not because of temporal variation in predation pressure. Herder attitudes towards snow leopards were positive and remained positive during the study, whereas attitudes towards wolves, which attacked livestock also in summer when herders moved out on the steppes, were negative and worsened during the study. This study showed that tall fences can be very effective at reducing night-time losses at corrals and we conclude that fences can be an important tool for snow leopard conservation and for facilitating the coexistence of snow leopards and people.

AB  - With extinction rates far exceeding the natural background rate, reliable monitoring of wildlife populations has become crucial for adaptive management and conservation. Robust monitoring is often labor intensive with high economic costs, particularly in the case of those species that are subject to illegal poaching, such as elephants, which require frequent and accurate population estimates over large spatial scales. Dung counting methods are commonly employed to estimate the density of elephants; however, in the absence of a full survey calibration, these can be unreliable in heterogeneous habitats where dung decay rates may be highly variable. We explored whether motion-sensitive cameras offer a simple, lower cost, and reliable alternative for monitoring in challenging forest environments. We estimated the density of African savanna elephants (Loxodanta africana) in a montane forest using the random encounter model and assessed the importance of surveying parameters for future survey design. We deployed motion-sensitive cameras in 65 locations in the Aberdare Conservation Area in Kenya during June to August in 2015 to 2017, for a survey effort of 967 days, and a mean encounter rate of 0.09 +/- 0.29 (SD) images/day. Elephants were captured in 16 locations. Density estimates varied between vegetation types, with estimates ranging from 6.27/km(2) in shrub, 1.1/km(2) in forest, 0.53/km(2) in bamboo (Yushania alpine), and 0.44/km(2) in the moorlands. The average speed of animal movement and the camera detection zone had the strongest linear associations with density estimates (R = -0.97). The random encounter model has the potential to offer an alternative, or complementary method within the active management framework for monitoring elephant populations in forests at a relatively low cost.

AB  - Although forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) are known to use logged forests, the impact of selective logging on this critically endangered species has never been well established. Considering the potential of some logged areas to serve as other effective area-based conservation measures, aligning with the Convention on Biological Diversity's 30/30 initiative, we aimed to assess the short-term impacts of logging on three population parameters: the presence, abundance, and activity of forest elephants. Combining camera traps and dung surveys before and after logging operations, we assessed the response of forest elephants in a certified timber concession in Gabon. Encouragingly, we found no negative effects of logging on the three population parameters studied. There was no discernible change in the presence of elephants after logging, and their abundance actually increased (relative abundance index from 1.56 to 2.59; p-value 0.0139) at one of the study sites. Activity patterns were also unaffected, showing sustained activity during daylight hours. We also identified the logging-associated factors that have significantly influenced forest elephant's abundance. Notably, logging intensity, as measured by the average number of trees harvested per hectare, and road density were positively correlated with the number of forest elephant observations (logging intensity effect: 0.2992, p-value 0.035; road density effect: 0.3628, p-value 0.060). As global conservation goals evolve, this research provides important insights into the coexistence of well-managed industrial activities and the conservation of endangered species, highlighting the need to include responsibly managed timber concessions in future conservation strategies. It also underscores the importance of wider adoption of sustainable practices such as low-impact logging, promoted by certification schemes such as FSC or PEFC, to secure the future of central African forests and their unique wildlife.

AB  - Altitude is the main external environmental pressure affecting the production performance of Tibetan sheep, and the adaptive evolution of many years has formed a certain response mechanism. However, there are few reports on the response of ruminal microbiota and host genomes of Tibetan sheep to high-altitude environments. Here, we conducted an integrated analysis of volatile fatty acids (VFAs), microbial diversity (16S rRNA), epithelial morphology, and epithelial transcriptome in the rumen of Tibetan sheep at different altitudes to understand the changes in ruminal microbiota-host interaction in response to high altitude. The differences in the nutritional quality of forage at different altitudes, especially the differences in fiber content (ADF/NDF), led to changes in rumen VFAs of Tibetan sheep, in which the A/P value (acetic acid/propionic acid) was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). In addition, the concentrations of IgA and IgG in Middle-altitude (MA) and High-altitude Tibetan sheep (HA) were significantly increased (p < 0.05), while the concentrations of IgM were significantly increased in MA (p < 0.05). Morphological results showed that the width of the rumen papilla and the thickness of the basal layer increased significantly in HA Tibetan sheep (p < 0.05). The 16S rRNA analysis found that the rumen microbial diversity of Tibetan sheep gradually decreased with increasing altitude, and there were some differences in phylum- and genus-level microbes at the three altitudes. RDA analysis found that the abundance of the Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group and the Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group increased with altitudes. Furthermore, a functional analysis of the KEGG microbial database found the "lipid metabolism" function of HA Tibetan sheep to be significantly enriched. WGCNA revealed that five gene modules were enriched in "energy production and conversion", "lipid transport and metabolism", and "defense mechanisms", and cooperated with microbiota to regulate rumen fermentation and epithelial immune barrier function, so as to improve the metabolism and immune level of Tibetan sheep at high altitude.

AB  - The natural environment of the Eemian Interglacial (MIS 5e) and Early Vistulian (MIS 5 d -a) in many areas in Central Europe is still insufficiently and fragmentarily known. Therefore, after the discovery of an almost complete skeleton of the Eemian Stephanorhinus kirchbergensis (Ja <spacing diaeresis>ger, 1839) in outcrop of palaeolake sediments near Gorz <acute accent>ow Wielkopolski (GW site, GS3 profile), a multi -proxy analysis was conducted for a precise recognition of the environmental and climate changes taking place before, during and after the life of this individual. Comprehensive palaeobotanical investigations of sediments of two palaeolakes lying above each other were performed palynological analysis including NPPs and algal analysis, plant macroremains studies (including wood fragments), as well as palaeozoological analyses of the Cladocera, Chironomidae and Coleoptera. The picture of changes in the environment and climate obtained thanks to the performed analyzes presented in a short way looks as follows. The end of the Wartanian Glaciation (MIS 6) was characterised by the dominance of herbaceous vegetation. Along with the gradually changing climatic conditions, the landscape of the Eemian Interglacial was dominated in sequence by birch, pine, oak (the so-called First Thermal Optimum), hazel forests with linden, hornbeam (Second Thermal Optimum) with a rarely recorded dry oscillation, then spruce with fir and again pine forests. The "older Eemian lake" during this time changed from deep, cold, oligotrophic and carbonate to shallower, cold waters with higher trophy, then deeper with lower trophy, again shallower with peats and dystrophic conditions and finally became terrestrial. The age of the post-Eemian part of the GS3 profile was reinterpreted, recognizing OSL dating as more reliable than radiocarbon dating, determining the age as Early Vistulian. Subsequent stages of this part of profile were characterised by significant cooling and intense development of heaths and peatbogs (MIS 5d), double return of pine and birch forests separated by intrainterstadial cooling (MIS 5c), recooling with dominant herbaceous plants (MIS 5b) and last warming with birch forests (MIS 5a). The "younger Early Vistulian lake " was formed with the rising of the water level. It was shallow, cold, low-trophic, with the water heating up in the summer, which caused trophic increases. Water levels fluctuated. With the progressing terrestrialization, oligotrophy appeared. Each of used proxies reconstructs a fragment of palaeoenvironmental changes on land and/or in the reservoir, registering climatic events on both regional and local scales. However, only the combination of all results allows for a full picture of natural changes.

AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales have been classified as critical priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (WHO). ESBL are universally distributed and, in 2006, were firstly reported on a wild animal. Understanding the relative contributions of wild animals to ESBL circulation in the environment is urgently needed. In this work, we have conducted a nationwide study in Portugal to investigate the occurrence of bacteria carrying clinically significant antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG), using widely distributed wild ungulates as model species. A total of 151 antimicrobial resistant-Enterobacterales isolates were detected from 181 wild ungulates: 50% (44/88) of isolates from wild boar (Sus scrofa), 40.3% (25/62) from red deer (Cervus elaphus), 41.4% (12/29) from fallow deer (Dama dama) and 100% (2/2) from mouflon (Ovis aries subsp. musimon). Selected isolates showed a diversified resistance profile, with particularly high values corresponding to ampicillin (71.5%) and tetracycline (63.6%). Enterobacterales strains carried blaTEM, tetA, tetB, sul2, sul1 or dfrA1 ARG genes. They also carried blaCTX-M-type genes, which are prevalent in human infections, namely CTX-M-14, CTX-M-15 and CTX-M-98. Strikingly, this is the first report of CTX-M-98 in wildlife. Almost 40% (n = 59) of Enterobacterales were multi-drug resistant. The diversity of plasmids carried by ESBL isolates was remarkable, including IncF, K and P. This study highlights the potential role of wild ungulates as environmental reservoirs of CTX-M ESBL-producing E. coli and in the spill-over of AMR bacteria and their determinants. Our findings suggest that wild ungulates are useful as strategic sentinel species of AMR in terrestrial environments, especially in response to potential sources of anthropogenic pollution, providing early warning of potential risks to human, animal and environmental health.

AB  - Remote retrieval of near-surface chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentration in small inland waters is challenging due to substantial optical interferences of various water constituents and uncertainties in the atmospheric correction (AC) process. Although various algorithms have been developed to estimate Chla from moderate-resolution terrestrial missions (similar to 10-60 m), the production of both accurate distribution maps and time series of Chla has proven challenging, limiting the use of remote analyses for lake monitoring. Here, we develop a support vector regression (SVR) model, which uses satellite-derived remote-sensing reflectance spectra (R-rs(d)) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images as input for Chla retrieval in a representative eutrophic prairie lake, Buffalo Pound Lake (BPL), Saskatchewan, Canada. Validated against in situ Chla from seven ice-free seasons (N 200; 2014-2020), the SVR model outperformed both locally tuned, Rdrs-fed empirical models (Normalized Difference Chlorophyll Index, 2 and 3-band, and OC3) and Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) by 15-65%, while exhibiting comparable performance to a locally trained MDN, with an error of similar to 35%. Comparison of Chla retrieval models, AC processors (iCOR, ACOLITE), and radiometric products (Rayleigh corrected, surface, and top-of-atmosphere reflectance) showed that the best Chla maps and optimal time series (up to 100 mg m(-3)) were produced using a coupled SVR-iCOR system.

AB  - An in-depth understanding of the relationship between anthropogenic activity and climate change under extreme climate conditions could provide a scientific basis and historical reference for coping with future climate change properly. This understanding is also crucial for ensuring the sustainable development of ecology, environment, economy, and society. Here, fecal stanols in the Xiada Co sediment core on the western Tibetan Plateau (TP) were used to reconstruct local human and ruminant populations over the past 4700 years. Climate data based on brGDGTs and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) data in the same sediment core, along with relevant documentary and archaeological evidence from the TP, were also compiled to investigate the relationship between human activity and climate change in the western TP during the late Holocene. Our analysis suggests that the change in human and ruminant populations in the Xiada Co basin was likely influenced by regional climate change, fluctuations in the lake level, and social factors. From 4700 to 2900 cal yr BP, the populations were relatively high due to the warm and humid climate compared to the period of 2300-0 cal yr BP. During 3400-2900 cal yr BP, the basin experienced the highest population density. This could be attributed to the combination of a relatively warm and humid climate, the introduction of cold and dry-tolerant crops like barley, and the introduction of livestock such as sheep/goat and cattle into the western TP. Between 2900 and 2450 cal yr BP, the increased lake levels and frequent level changes likely caused significant population declines. From similar to 1000 to 300 cal yr BP, temperature appeared to have a stronger influence on human and ruminant population change compared to lake level and precipitation. Notably, around 300 cal yr BP, the basin experienced the smallest human and ruminant pop-ulations due to the extremely cold and dry climate, as well as frequent conflicts between Guge and Ladakh. From 0 cal yr BP onward, there was a notable increase in both human and ruminant populations in the Xiada Co basin, which aligns with the data on populations in Rutog county, Nagri prefecture. Furthermore, the significant rise in the levels of ruminant fecal stanols suggests a shift in the primary domesticated ruminant species after similar to 1250 cal yr BP, with sheep/goat becoming the dominant livestock. This is supported by absolute concentration of fecal stanols in local contemporary animal feces and relevant archaeological evidence from the western TP. This study confirms the use of fecal stanols as a valuable tool for reconstructing ancient human activities on the western TP.

AB  - The widespread diffusion of the wild boar on the Italian territory and its consistent use for hunting have created the possibility to conduct multiple studies on the pathologies afflicting this ungulate. Nevertheless, in the last two decades, only some pathologies such as classical and African Swine Fever, Tuberculosis, Brucellosis from Brucella suis have benefited from substantial public funding and the consequent great interest from the scientific world, while less attention was addressed to parasitic diseases including sarcoptic mange. Therefore, to fill this gap, the purpose of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of sarcoptic mange in the wild boar population in Aosta Valley in the Northwest of Italy, including sympatric species as foxes. Due to past field surveys, it has been possible to find a possible role of snow metrics in the spread of this pathogen. Even if there are only empirical evidence and the mechanism remain unknown remote sensing analysis considering snow metrics were performed to provide to veterinarians, foresters, biologists, and ecologists new tools to better understand wield board dynamics and join to ordinary tool an instrument to enhance management and planning strategies. The snow metrics (SM) were derived from USGS NASA Landsat 8 L2A retrieved from Theia CNES platform and processed in Orfeo Toolbox LIS extension package. The relationship between SM and the disease spread was tested per each Aosta Valley municipality obtaining LISA maps for each hunting season. The results have showed that this parasite is present in an endemic form even if with rather low prevalence values, equal to 1.2% in the season hunting season 2013/2014, and equal to 7.5% in the hunting season 2014/2015. Moreover, within simultaneous given values of SM, sarcoptic mange seem to find good conditions for spreading.

AB  - Succession of submerged vegetation was monitored from the early stages for a period of 10 years by Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) divers in Milada Lake. Milada Lake is the result of a flooded surface coal mine, the first large-scale hydrological recultivation in the Czech Republic. The main focus was on apparent changes in the percentage cover of primary producers (macrophytes and macroalgae) during early successional stages. In total, data on 33 environmental factors (chemical, physical, and biological) were collected and the importance of their impact was statistically analyzed. Besides macrophytes, we also monitored macroalgae that mainly occupied deep areas (down to 12 m) and have been neglected in literature in contrast to macrophytes. Uniquely, the trophic state of the study site decreased in contrast to most water bodies worldwide. Changes in the plant species composition during succession, including replacement of the dominant group of Characeae with Vaucheria sp. (both macroalgae), correlated with a decrease in nitrate concentration, N-NO3. Furthermore, the herbivorous fish biomass and availability of uncovered lake bottom played important roles in the succession of macrophytes and macroalgae. Although some changes in submerged vegetation during succession of a newly created lake are to be expected, the main shifts observed apparently correlated with the studied factors. The conclusions may be useful for the prediction of succession in similarly created lakes in the future.

AB  - The woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) is an iconic species of the Eurasian Pleistocene megafauna, which was abundant in Eurasia in the Pleistocene until its demise beginning approximately 10 000 years ago. Despite the early recovery of several specimens from well-known European archaeological sites, including its type specimen (Blumenbach 1799), no genomes of European populations were available so far, and all available genomic data originated exclusively from Siberian populations. Using coprolites of cave hyenas (Crocuta crocuta spelea) recovered from Middle Palaeolithic layers of two caves in Germany (Bockstein-Loch and Hohlenstein-Stadel), we isolated and enriched predator and prey DNA to assemble the first European woolly rhinoceros mitogenomes, in addition to cave hyena mitogenomes. Both coprolite samples produced copious sequences assigned to C. crocuta (27% and 59% mitogenome coverage, respectively) and woolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis; 27% and 81% coverage, respectively). The sequences suggested considerable DNA degradation, which may limit the conclusions to be drawn; however, the mitogenomes of European woolly rhinoceros are genetically distinct from the Siberian woolly rhinoceros, and analyses of the more complete mitogenome suggest a split of the populations potentially coinciding with the earliest fossil records of woolly rhinoceros in Europe.

AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal distribution and habitat preferences of marine megafauna is critical for effective conservation. Many large pelagic elasmobranchs are threatened by overfishing, yet fine-scale data on their occurrence and distribution remains limited. The reef manta ray Mobula alfredi aggregates at several locations throughout the coastal waters of the Inhambane Province of Mozambique, including Praia do Tofo, where sightings have declined by up to 99% over the past two decades. However, trends at another aggregation location, Praia de Z & aacute;vora, remain unknown. Here, we analyze reef manta ray sightings in Z & aacute;vora over a 15-year period from 2009 to 2023. Our findings reveal an 82.4% decline in sightings, coupled with a shift from year-round sightings to a seasonal aggregation and a change in site preference from two cleaning stations to a single one. Generalized additive models (GAMs) identified year, day of year, and moon illumination as significant predictors of reef manta ray occurrence at their primary aggregation site, suggesting that temporal factors may play a larger role in their visitations in this area than other environmental variables, including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a, and the Indian Ocean Dipole. While the steep declines in sightings along the Mozambican coastline are of serious concern, the large seasonal aggregations in Z & aacute;vora, likely for reproduction, provide hope for this population. Ensuring the survival of manta rays in Mozambique will require fostering collaboration among researchers, local communities, and policymakers, while strengthening enforcement of protective measures and integrating comprehensive monitoring data to mitigate threats to the population.

AB  - China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and there are significant differences in the development of pig breeding in different regions. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) produced in the process of pig breeding will affect China's environmental quality. In view of this, based on the Minimum Distance to Weak efficient frontier model, this paper constructs Metafrontier-Malmquist-Luenberger (MML) index considering negative output under the common frontier to comprehensively evaluate the green total factor productivity of Chinese pig breeding (GTCP). This has guiding significance for improving China's pork production and reducing pollution emissions. The results manifest that (1) no matter under the common frontier or the group frontier, GTCP presents large temporal and spatial differentiation characteristics. Compared with the central region and the western region, the eastern region has obvious advantages in GTCP. (2) GTCP has shown an upward trend as a whole, which is mainly due to the technical progress. (3) Compared with small-scale and medium-sized GTCP, large-scale GTCP has apparent superiorities. Based on the above outcomes, this paper finally raises policy recommendations for improving GTCP: (1) give full play to the advantages of pig breeding in different regions, (2) increase the research and introduction of pig breeding clean technology and improve the application efficiency, and (3) give full play to the scale effect and vigorously develop large-scale pig breeding.

AB  - Camellia oleifera C. Abel. is a significant economically cultivar in southern China, with numerous improved varieties developed. However, the long-term sustainable development of these varieties under near-natural conditions has been overlooked. We investigated the rhizosphere and non - rhizosphere soils of wild and improved C. oleifera forests in similar habitats. The microbial community structure was analyzed using high-pass sequencing, and stability was assessed through average variations in community composition. Network analysis helped identify key bacteria, and their interactions with soil physicochemical properties were further examined using the Mantel test and PLS-PM structural equation modeling. The physical and chemical properties of soil and fungal community structures varied among different C. oleifera varieties. In the improved C. oleifera forest, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, the key fungal groups, made up over 80% of the total relative abundance, compared to only about 30% in the wild C. oleifera forest. The improved stand demonstrated better stability (AVD value of 0.604) than the wild stand (AVD value of 0.648). PLS-PM analysis indicated that pH changes positively influenced the stability of the bacterial community but negatively affected soil properties, while the opposite was true for fungi. The soil in improved C. oleifera forests demonstrated a greater capacity for nutrient enrichment through soil microorganisms, making it more prone to acidification than the wild C. oleifera forest. Additionally, it exhibited higher bacterial diversity and lower fungal diversity. pH values and total potassium content are key factors influencing microbial structure and stability.

AB  - Simple Summary The Siberian musk deer is a vulnerable species, and understanding its health is crucial for conservation. This study investigated the gut microbiome of wild Siberian musk deer in three different locations in Republic of Korea. By analyzing fecal samples through 16S rRNA sequencing, we observed significant differences in the alpha diversity among Siberian musk deer from various habitats, while the beta diversity showed no significant differences. Despite the lack of variation in the beta diversity, we identified unique bacterial compositions specific to both the species and the different locations. These insights are valuable because the gut microbiome plays a vital role in animal health, and the differences in microbial communities can be influenced by factors such as diet and habitat. This study is the first to provide important information about the gut microbiota of wild Siberian musk deer, which could aid in developing future conservation strategies.Abstract The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the health and well-being of wildlife. However, its composition and diversity remain unexplored, particularly in threatened species such as the Siberian musk deer (SMD). This study aimed to elucidate the gut microbiota composition within different wild SMD communities for assessing their health status. We conducted the first comprehensive fecal microbiome analysis of wild SMD inhabiting three distinct locations in Gangwon Province, Republic of Korea (Korea). Fecal samples were collected non-invasively and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed for gut microbiota characterization. Consistent with previous research, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in the gut microbiota of wild SMD. Planctomycetota was a prevalent phylum in wild SMD gut microbiota, warranting further investigation of its ecological significance. While significant differences were observed in the gut microbiota richness among the three groups, no significant disparities were detected in the beta diversity. Additionally, certain genera exhibited distinct relative abundances among the groups, suggesting potential associations with geographic factors, gut disorders, and dietary habits. Our findings provide valuable insights into the gut microbiome of wild SMD and offer a foundation for future microbiome-based conservation efforts for this vulnerable species.

AB  - Climate change-induced salinity intrusion into agricultural soils is known to negatively impact crop production and food security. However, the effects of salinity increase on plant-herbivore-natural enemy systems and repercussions for pest suppression services are largely unknown. Here, we examine the effects of increased salinity on communities of rice (Oryza sativa), brown planthopper (BPH), Nilaparvata lugens, and green mirid bug (GMB), Cyrtorhinus lividipennis, under greenhouse conditions. We found that elevated salinity significantly suppressed the growth of two rice cultivars. Meanwhile, BPH population size also generally decreased due to poor host plant quality induced by elevated salinity. The highest BPH density occurred at 2.0 dS/m salinity and declined thereafter with increasing salinity, irrespective of rice cultivar. The highest population density of GMB also occurred under control conditions and decreased significantly with increasing salinity. Higher salinity directly affected the rice crop by reducing plant quality measured with reference to biomass production and plant height, whereas inducing population developmental asynchrony between BPH and GMB observed at 2 dS/m salinity and potentially uncoupling prey-predator dynamics. Our results suggest that increased salinity has harmful effects on plants, herbivores, natural enemies, as well as plant-pest-predator interactions. The effects measured here suggest that the bottom-up effects of predatory insects on rice pests will likely decline in rice produced in coastal areas where salinity intrusion is common. Our findings indicate that elevated salinity influences tritrophic interactions in rice production landscapes, and further research should address resilient rice insect pest management combining multipests and predators in a changing environment.

AB  - Palaeognathae consists of five groups of extant species: flighted tinamous (1) and four flightless groups: kiwi (2), cassowaries and emu (3), rheas (4), and ostriches (5). Molecular studies supported the groupings of extinct moas with tinamous and elephant birds with kiwi as well as ostriches as the group that diverged first among the five groups. However, phylogenetic relationships among the five groups are still controversial. Previous studies showed extensive heterogeneity in estimated gene tree topologies from conserved nonexonic elements, introns, and ultraconserved elements. Using the noncoding loci together with protein-coding loci, this study investigated the factors that affected gene tree estimation error and the relationships among the five groups. Using closely related ostrich rather than distantly related chicken as the outgroup, concatenated and gene tree-based approaches supported rheas as the group that diverged first among groups (1)-(4). Whereas gene tree estimation error increased using loci with low sequence divergence and short length, topological bias in estimated trees occurred using loci with high sequence divergence and/or nucleotide composition bias and heterogeneity, which more occurred in trees estimated from coding loci than noncoding loci. Regarding the relationships of (1)-(4), the site patterns by parsimony criterion appeared less susceptible to the bias than tree construction assuming stationary time-homogeneous model and suggested the clustering of kiwi and cassowaries and emu the most likely with similar to 40% support rather than the clustering of kiwi and rheas and that of kiwi and tinamous with 30% support each.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflict is a widespread issue, particularly around protected areas such as national parks. This study aimed to evaluate human-carnivore conflict in and around Gibe Sheleko National Park using semi-structured questionnaires. The survey was conducted between December 2018 and August 2020, involving interviews with 281 randomly selected household heads from eight Kebeles and 15 Park management staff. A total of 965 livestock losses were documented over three years, around two animals lost per household per year, with goats being the most affected (48.08%), followed by chickens (33.98%) and cows (13.37%), and sheep were the least affected (1.14%). Of the total livestock losses, the majority (27.15%) were attributed to spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), followed by serval cats (Leptailurus serval) (23.21%), and olive baboons (Papio anubis) (21.66%). Spotted hyenas (wet: 57.25%, dry: 42.75%), leopards (Panthera pardus) (wet: 65.47%, dry: 34.53%), and African wolves (Canis lupaster) (wet: 62.24%, dry: 37.76) caused more losses during the wet season. However, the olive baboon (wet: 38.28, dry: 61.72%) and the serval cat (wet: 45.09, dry: 54.91%) caused more losses during the dry season. From the total, about 951 livestock losses (excluding dogs) were reported, resulting in an estimated economic loss of $69,273.65. Goats contributed the largest share ($33,537.92), followed by cattle ($32,634.42) and chickens ($1,423.52). Approximately 62% of respondents reported an increasing trend in livestock predation, particularly by spotted hyenas, olive baboons, and serval cats. Guarding was used by most farmers (80.2%) as a preventative measure against livestock predation; however, it did not work. In the study area, few respondents also applied trapping as a retaliatory killing strategy, which may have a significant impact on existing carnivores. Therefore, collaboration between stakeholders is essential to develop effective mitigation strategies for the ongoing livestock predation by wild carnivores in the area.

AB  - Mangroves are common coastal ecosystems in tropical regions around the world. Ecological interactions are recurrent in these forest environments, including herbivory. In this sense, the present study aimed to evaluate leaf herbivory in three mangrove species, Laguncularia racemosa, Avicennia schaueriana and Rhizophora mangle, in a mangrove forest at Arpoeiras Beach, in Acaraii, Ceara and to compare it between the dry and rainy seasons in the region. Initially, ten trees of each mangrove species were selected and marked with a minimum distance of five meters apart. Next, ten leaves were randomly collected from each tree, 100 per species, i.e., 300 per collection, and a total of 1800. Three collections were made in the dry period (August, September and October) and three more in the rainy period (January, February and March). In the laboratory, the leaves were measured for width and length and weighed. They were classified according to herbivory damage and had their leaf area and herbivorous restored area were determined. The damages that were more frequent were scraping, hole I, hole II, spot I, spot II, gall and mine. Other damage was present but with low representativeness. Hole I and mine were more frequently in the leaves of Laguncularia racemosa. In Avicennia schaueriana, scraping, spot I and gall were more frequent. In Rhizophora mangle, hole II frequently occurred, with great loss of leaf surface and undefined damage. It is concluded that herbivores show preference among plant species and some injuries are more frequent. The salinity of the environment was a determining factor for herbivory, since it was in the rainy season that there were the highest values of leaf herbivory in mangrove species.

AB  - Biased birth sex ratios have been documented in many mammalian populations, but it is often difficult to know whether they result from biases in the sex ratio at conception and/or sex differences in prenatal mortality. It is generally admitted that there is an excess of males at conception and a higher level of mortality during gestation for males because of a positive relationship between size and vulnerability. Here, we challenge this classical prediction in a wild boar (Sus scrofa) population facing highly variable food resources (mast seeding) and in which male fetuses are heavier than females. Using long-term hunting and mast seeding data, we show that sex ratio at conception is balanced and that females suffer from higher embryonic mortality particularly in large litters, whatever the level and the type of food resources. One possible explanation is that a female embryo is ready for implantation later than an identically aged male because of slower development and is more likely to miss the implantation window. To what extent a lower survival of female embryos is a common feature in mammals remains to be carefully explored.

AB  - Acoustic deterrents are currently being considered for deployment at strategic bottlenecks, such as lock and dams of major rivers, to deter upstream movement of invasive carp. Previous studies have demonstrated that bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and H. molitrix, respectively) display negative phonotaxis to playbacks of broadband sound recordings produced from a 100 hp outboard boat motor. However, there is concern that acoustic deterrents may impact the movement of non-target native fishes in the Upper Mississippi River. We evaluated the potential impacts of a broadband underwater acoustic deterrent on native ostariophysans [bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)], invasive ostariophysans [bighead carp, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and silver carp], and native non-ostariophysans [(American eel (Anguilla rostrata), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and paddlefish (Polyodon spathula)]. Fish were exposed to playback of the broadband sound (60-10000 Hz), and their behavior was evaluated. Bighead carp showed a strong negative phonotaxis response to the stimulus [12.3 +/- 7.5 (SD) mean consecutive reactions], silver carp and grass carp showed moderate responses (4.5 +/- 5.2 and 3.8 +/- 3.5 reactions), and common carp displayed low responses (1.3 +/- 1.9 reactions). Of the native fish, bigmouth buffalo (2.1 +/- 2.9 reactions) and hybrid striped bass (0.3 +/- 0.5 reactions) were the only species to demonstrate observable response to the acoustic stimulus. Based on this small-scale behavioral screening, acoustic deterrents should have minimal impact on native species; however, larger pond and field trials are necessary to confirm this finding.

AB  - Coyotes (Canis latrans) are a highly adaptable canid species whose behavioral plasticity has allowed them to persist in a wide array of habitats throughout North America. As generalists, coyotes can alter movement patterns and change territorial strategies between residency (high site fidelity) and transiency (low site fidelity) to maximize fitness. Uncertainty remains about resident and transient coyote movement patterns and habitat use because research has reached conflicting conclusions regarding patterns of habitat use by both groups. We quantified effects of habitat on resident and transient coyote movement behavior using first passage time (FPT) analysis, which assesses recursive movement along an individual's movement path to delineate where they exhibit area-restricted search (ARS) behaviors relative to habitat attributes. We quantified monthly movement rates for 171 coyotes (76 residents and 53 transients) and then used estimated FPT values in generalized linear mixed models to quantify monthly habitat use for resident and transient coyotes. Transients had greater movement rates than residents across all months except January. Resident FPT values were positively correlated with agricultural land cover during fall and winter, but negatively correlated with agriculture during spring. Resident FPT values were also negatively correlated with developed habitats during May-August, deciduous land cover during June-August, and wetlands during September-January except November. FPT values of transient coyotes were positively correlated with developed areas throughout much of the year and near wetlands during July-September. Transient FPT values were negatively correlated with agriculture during all months except June and July. High FPT values (ARS behavior) of residents and transients were generally correlated with greater densities of edge habitat. Although we observed high individual variation in space use, our study found substantive differences in habitat use between residents and transients, providing further evidence that complexity and plasticity of coyote habitat use is influenced by territorial strategy.

AB  - Variability in climate and weather conditions and socio-economic shifts are dramatically altering the landscapes and livelihoods of peoples of the northern high-latitudes. Such escalating trends have distinctive consequences at the local and regional scale and the ability to adapt to such rapid changes will challenge cultural, social, and economic systems across Arctic regions. Using a cultural landscape approach, this study provides an in-depth qualitative analysis of sheep farming communities in subarctic South Greenland. Our study centers local voices and helps document shifting weather-related and other socio-economic challenges. We interview four farming households, one historian, and one local economic development expert to understand the broader context, the challenges and vulnerabilities, and the persistence of agriculture in this high north region. Our analysis reveals four overarching themes influencing the sustainability of sheep farming: (1) multi-generational farming heritage, (2) reciprocity and community support, (3) shifting weather and climate influences and farming livelihoods, and (4) farm operations and new opportunities. Findings from this study fill a gap in the literature on local and regional impacts of weather and socio-economic shifts in remote regions. Through the inclusion of local Inuit and other voices, we document how geographically dispersed subarctic communities are adapting to broader shifts.

AB  - EU consumers are increasingly concerned about the practice of surgical castration of male piglets. An alternative approach that is more welfare-friendly is to raise intact pigs, but it is important to limit boar taint in the meat and fat of these animals, which produces an off-odor and flavor rejected by consumers when perceived. One way to accomplish this is by diet manipulation, as reported in previous studies with commercial non-castrated hybrid pigs selected for lean meat deposition. In this trial, we tested the effect of sex on the blood, growth, carcass, and meat quality as well as on the boar taint compounds of Alentejano pigs. The pigs were raised outdoors and fed commercial and fiber-rich diets, the latter known for their potential to reduce boar taint. The results show that outdoor raised intact Alentejano pigs grew faster and produced leaner and less saturated meat than castrated ones. Although the experimental diet had no significant effect on boar taint compounds, the levels detected on most Alentejano pigs were, however, below the threshold values for consumer detection.
   This trial evaluated the effect of sex on the blood, growth, carcass, meat quality, and boar taint compounds in male Alentejano (AL) pigs (n = 30). From similar to 40 to 130 kg LW, castrated (C) and intact pigs (I and IExp groups) were fed commercial diets ad libitum. Between similar to 130 and 160 kg (slaughter), C and I pigs continued on commercial diets, while IExp were fed an experimental diet containing locally produced pulses and by-products aimed at reducing boar taint. At similar to 160 kg, blood urea levels were higher in IExp than C pigs, triacylglycerols were lower in both intact groups, and cortisol was lower in IExp. IExp pigs exhibited faster growth, improved feed conversion ratio, carcass higher commercial yield and leaner meat than C pigs. The loin intramuscular fat in intact pigs was lower, less saturated and more polyunsaturated, while total collagen was higher. Fat androstenone content was higher in intact pigs and skatole content was similar across treatments, although they were below threshold values for consumer detection. Finally, although boar taint compounds were low in intact AL pigs raised outdoors, adding pulses and by-products to the experimental diet did not result in a reduction in fat skatole content compared to pigs fed the commercial diet.

AB  - The Chihuahuan Desert has been overgrazed by livestock ranching since the 16th century. This has changed the structure and dynamics of the ecosystem, and native species have developed physiological adaptations to survive these vegetation changes. We evaluated the changes in packed cell volume (PCV) and plasma protein of Dipodomys merriami, Merriam's kangaroo rats, inhabiting shrubland and grassland areas at Mapimi Biosphere Reserve, Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico. We captured 57 individuals from two vegetation types in March-April for two years. We found higher kangaroo rat packed cell volume in grassland than shrubland. However, the plasma protein/packed cell volume ratios were not significantly different between rats from both vegetation types, suggesting that an increase in PCV is a consequence of dehydration. Monitoring the packed cell volume can be a useful and rapid screening tool to assess responses to changes in habitat degradation in arid areas.

AB  - Bison (Bison spp) are being reintroduced into semi-wild, spatially constrained herds across North America and Europe. Herd managers are concerned about gastrointestinal (GI) nematode parasites as they care for the health of their bison. We examine how demographics, grazing location, herd management, and anthelmintic treatments affect the fecal egg counts (FECs) of GI nematodes within a reintroduced Plains bison (Bison bison bison) herd in the Great Plains. Our results suggest that younger bison (<2 years of age) experience higher GI parasite eggs/oocysts per gram (epg/opg) and that some taxa are more prevalent throughout different periods of a bison's early years. Demographic findings suggest that calf and yearling (0-2 yrs age) bison have the highest FECs and that these decline until reaching a low in peak adulthood and thereafter (x > 6 yrs of age). FECs of both Trichuris spp. and particularly Nematodirus spp. were much more abundant, relatively, during the first year of a bison's life. This pattern was also true of Moniezia spp. and Eimeria spp., however, strongyle-type spp. FECs appeared to peak in relative abundance during the second year of life. Our data also indicate that FECs are influenced by differences in land-use histories of pastures previously grazed by cattle or by the proportion of frequent flooding in different pastures. Treatment results suggest that fenbendazole may more effective than moxidectin at lowering FECs of bison over the long-term, and lasting effects of at least one administered anthelmintic treatment. Multiplex PCR assays revealed that American bison share GI nematodes with cattle including: Ostertagia spp., Haemonchus placei, Cooperia onchophora, and Oesophagostomum spp, but did not detect the presence Trichostrongylus columbriformis. Our results may have wider conservation implications for reintroduction efforts of American bison, as well as the endangered European bison (Bison bonasus).

AB  - Information regarding the food habits of tropical cervids is limited. We studied the food habits of rusa deer (Rusa timorensis), a tropical cervid in the Pangandaran Nature Reserve, West Java, Indonesia. The faecal composition of the rusa deer collected over a year was analysed using microscopy of plant fragments. The results showed marked seasonal changes: in the rainy season, the rusa deer mainly fed on Cynodon dactylon, a lawn-like grass, which accounted for approximately 50% of the faecal composition. During the dry season, C. dactylon in the faeces decreased to approximately 20%, while the composition of fruits increased, suggesting that food conditions for the deer were better in this season. This pattern differs from that of temperate cervids which can feed on abundant plant leaves during summer but are forced to consume low-quality foods such as bark and dead leaves during winter.

AB  - Humans and elephants inevitably encounter competition over resources in the elephant habitat. Due to different social development conditions, there may be differences in how humans and elephants coexist in different regions, mainly reflected in the attitude toward elephant conservation and the ability to cope with conflicts. By comparing human-elephant conflicts in different regions, it helps to explore the long-term coexistence path between humans and elephants. This paper selects the Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve in China, the habitat of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus), and the Nyerere-Selous-Mikumi region in Tanzania, the habitat of African steppe elephants (Loxodonta africana), as the study area, and assesses the current situation of human-elephant conflict in the study area through semi-structured interviews and questionnaires, to understand the residents' perception of the conflict and the willingness of residents to protect elephants, and empirically analyze the factors affecting the residents' willingness to protect. The results showed that the types of human-elephant conflicts in the Xishuangbanna (China) and the surrounding areas of the Nyerere-Selous-Mikumi ecosystem in Tanzania were similar, and the respondents in the Xishuangbanna region (China) suffered more losses but had a stronger willingness to protect elephants. Besides, residents that are less impacted by conflict, have higher household incomes and more diversified livelihood sources are likely to have a stronger willingness to protect the elephant. This study emphasizes the role of socioeconomic development and governance capacity enhancement in mitigating human-elephant conflict, providing a richer perspective on the governance of human-elephant conflict.

AB  - Simple Summary Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) are classified as extinct in the wild from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List. In 2021, there were more than 6000 individuals in Dafeng Reserve, China. With the increasing of population size for Pere David's deer in Dafeng Reserve, it is urgently needed to conduct disease research in order to protect this animal better. Diarrhea is one of the most common diseases affecting the health of Pere David's deer. However, little is known about how the intestinal ecology changes in these diarrheic animals. The aim of this study is to reveal the changes of intestinal microbiome and metabolic pathways in diarrheic Pere David's deer based on gut microbiome and metabolic pathways. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry, the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were analyzed in five diarrheic Pere David's deer. Results demonstrated the distinct changes in the diversity and composition of gut microbiota, as well as great changes in numerous fecal metabolic profiles in diarrheic Pere David's deer. The integrated pathway analysis revealed serious disturbances in several metabolic pathways, such as lipid, bile acid, cofactor and vitamin metabolism. These data provided important gut ecology information for diarrheic Pere David's deer, which may facilitate improved diagnostic and treatment strategies for sick animals in the future. Diarrhea is one of the most common diseases affecting the health of Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus). It is believed that an imbalanced intestinal ecology contributes to the etiology of the condition. However, little is known about how the intestinal ecology changes in these diarrheic animals. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) were used to investigate the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites in five Pere David's deer with diarrhea. The results showed that when compared with healthy individuals, considerable changes in the gut microbiome were observed in diarrheic animals, including a significant reduction in microbial diversity and gut microbiota composition alterations. Furthermore, the profiles of numerous fecal metabolites were altered in diarrheic individuals, showing large-scale metabolite dysregulation. Among metabolites, acylcarnitines, lysophosphatidylcholine, bile acids, and oxidized lipids were elevated significantly. Constantly, several metabolic pathways were significantly altered. Interestingly, predicted metabolic pathways based on 16S rRNA gene sequence and differential metabolite analysis showed that lipid metabolism, cofactor, and vitamin metabolism were altered in sick animals, indicating microbiota-host crosstalk in these deer. When combined, the results provide the first comprehensive description of an intestinal microbiome and metabolic imbalance in diarrheic Pere David's deer, which advances our understanding and potential future treatment of diarrheic animals.

AB  - The present study was planned to describe the allelopathic effect of Euphorbia hirta (Pig weed) on Cicer arietinum (black gram) The effect of weed extract and powder on different growth parameters were studied on seed germination, velocity of germination, seedling growth, plant height, fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll and protein contents of Cicer arietinum. In Petri plate experiments extract of different concentrations were used such as 3, 5 and 7% and distilled water used as a control with their five replicates. The 7% extract of E. hirta showed highest inhibitory effect on germination, velocity of germination, seedling growth and plumule length was more inhibited than the radicle length of test crop. In Pot experiments weed powder were taken in different amount such as 10, 15 and 20 g, mixed with uniform amount of soil (500 g) and control pots were filled only with soil, with their five replicates. Weed powder has non-significant effect on plant height of C. arietinum. Fresh and dry weight also indicates inhibitory effect was proportional to the amount of weed powder. Chlorophyll contents and carotene were gradually decreased in treated plants as compared to the control. The highest % inhibition was observed in 20g. The inhibition may be due to the allelochemicals present in E. hirta.

AB  - Wildlife management attempts to balance consumptive and non-consumptive values to manage hunting opportunities, considering population resilience. Mountain goats Oreamnos americanus are particularly sensitive to harvest. Using data from 33 792 mountain goats harvested in British Columbia (BC), Canada, between 1977 and 2019, we performed Bayesian regressions to examine the effect of regulations (limited entry hunting (LEH) or general open season (GOS)) on yearly harvest and harvest sex ratios. We also investigated temporal trends and the effect of licensed hunter residency (resident in British Columbia, or not) on harvest sex ratios. We then examined how horn length of harvested mountain goats was influenced by sex, year of harvest, age and mountain range. The more restrictive LEH regulations generally reduced harvest of mountain goats. The annual proportion of males harvested appeared independent of regulation and increased over time. Non-resident hunters harvested a greater proportion of males compared to resident hunters. The combined length of the first and second horn growth increments decreased slightly with age at harvest for males but increased for females, suggesting a possible very weak hunter selection for males with rapid early horn growth and possibly against lactating females. Our study supports LEH regulations and hunter education to distinguish sex and age as key tools for mountain goat harvest management. Similar tools could be considered to manage other ungulates that are sensitive to harvest.

AB  - El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a large-scale climatic phenomenon that has fundamental effects on the terrestrial environments and ecosystem functions. Based on observed crop production and pest damage of a 41-y time series from 1980-2020 in China, the present study examined ENSO's long-term effects on agroecosystems and found that changing crop yields per hectare and pest outbreaks can ultimately be connected to ENSO cycles by comparing the effect sizes of respective responses across different ENSO phases. The El Nino phases (the warming phases) and La Nina phases (the cooling phases) have had opposite effects on crop yields and damage of arthropod pests in most cases, and such effects were climatic-region-dependent. Our evidence demonstrates that the climatic origin of a crop could associate with its responses to ENSO phases: wheat benefited from La Nina phases when planted in subtropical climates and from El Nino phases when planted in the middle temperate climate; rice were resilient to El Nino phases in warmer areas, while La Nina phases significantly increased the rice yield in the subtropical climate. Corn yields were significantly lower during El Nino phases in all four climatic regions, while La Nina phases significantly increased corn yields only in the Tibetan Plateau. Additionally, we found higher pest damage occurring during El Nino phases and lower damage occurring during La Nina phases for many arthropod species. Our improved understanding of crops and arthropod herbivore responses to ENSO phases can contribute to predicting global impacts of climate changes on agriculture and food security.

AB  - The intensive and long-term use of atrazine in agriculture has resulted in serious environmental pollution and consequently endangered ecosystem and human health. Soil microorganisms play an important role in atrazine degradation. However, their degradation efficiencies are relatively low due to their slow growth and low abundance, and manure amendment as a practice to improve soil nutrients and microbial activities can solve these problems. This study investigated the roles of goat manure in atrazine degradation performance, metabolites and bacterial community structure. Our results showed that atrazine degradation efficiencies in unamended soils were 26.9-35.7% and increased to 60.9-84.3% in goat manure amended treatments. Hydroxyatrazine pathway was not significantly altered, whereas deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine pathways were remarkably enhanced in treatments amended with manure by encouraging the N-dealkylation of atrazine side chains. In addition, goat manure significantly increased soil pH and contents of organic matters and humus, explaining the change of atrazine metabolic pathway. Nocardioides, Sphingomonas and Massilia were positively correlated with atrazine degradation efficiency and three metabolites, suggesting their preference in atrazine contaminated soils and potential roles in atrazine degradation. Our findings suggested that goat manure acts as both bacterial inoculum and nutrients to improve soil microenvironment, and its amendment is a potential practice in accelerating atrazine degradation at contaminated sites, offering an efficient, cheap, and eco-friendly strategy for herbicide polluted soil remediation.

AB  - The Kerguelen Plateau is the largest topographic barrier to the eastward flowing Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in the Indian Sector of the Southern Ocean. The plateau is separated into a northern and southern plateau by the Fawn Trough. The northern plateau has a shallow bathymetry (<700 m) with two prominent island systems, the Kerguelen Islands on the northern end and Heard and McDonald Islands on the southern end. The interaction of the northern and southern branches of the Polar Front with the northern plateau results in a complex oceanographic environment, with potential for dynamic mixing of sub-Antarctic and Antarctic fauna. Furthermore, the High Nutrient Low Chlorophyll (HNLC) water that flows over the northern plateau is subject to natural iron fertilization from the shallow bathymetry (< 700 m), leading to extensive phytoplankton blooms each summer, particularly to the southeast of the Kerguelen Islands. The Heard Island region on the central plateau has been relatively underexplored. In January 2004, the Heard Island Predator-Prey Investigation and Ecosystem Study (HIPPIES) conducted macrozooplankton (RMT-8 trawl) and micronekton (IYGPT trawl) sampling in foraging areas used by top predators in the vicinity of the island. Macrozooplankton and micronekton were sampled day and night from three depth strata (0-100 m, 100-300 m and 300-600 m). In the area south and east of Heard Island, over bathymetry >= 1000 m depth, the water column had characteristics of the southern branch of the Polar Front (S-PF) and the macrozooplankton and micronekton were dominated by Antarctic Zone fauna (e.g., the euphausiids Euphausia triacantha and Euphausia frigida, and the myctophids Krefftichthys anderssoni, Electrona antarctica, Gymnoscopelus braueri and Gymnoscopelus nicholsi). Shallow slope and shelf stations were located north of the S-PF and the macrozooplankton assemblages were influenced by Polar Frontal Zone species (e.g., Euphausia vallentini), while the shelf micronekton were dominated by the bentho-pelagic channichthyids Champsocephalus gunnari and Channichthys rhinoceratus, together with G. nicholsi. Most macrozooplankton migrated from the deep epipelagic (100-300 m) into the surface epipelagic (<100 m) at night, although some macrozooplankton occurred at high densities in the surface epipelagic during the day (e.g., Rhincalanus gigas, Themisto gaudichaudii). Most micronekton species occurred in the mesopelagic layers (300-600 m) during the day, and migrated into the deep and surface epipelagic at night. Only the small but very abundant K. anderssoni utilized the top 300 m during the day. The vertical distributions of macrozooplankton and micronekton are discussed with respect to the foraging behavior and diets of top predators.

AB  - Species interactions are a unifying theme in ecology and evolution. Both fields are currently moving beyond their historical focus on isolated pairwise relationships to understand how ecological communities affect focal interactions. Additional species can modify both the number of interactions and the fitness consequences of each interaction (i.e., selection). Although only selection affects the evolution of the focal interaction, the two are often conflated, limiting our understanding of the evolution of multispecies interactions. We manipulated aboveground herbivory on the legume Medicago lupulina in the field and quantified its effect on number of symbionts and the per-symbiont impact on plant performance in two belowground symbioses: mutualistic rhizobia bacteria (Ensifer meliloti) and parasitic root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne hapla). We found that herbivores modified the number of rhizobia nodules, as well as the benefit per nodule. However, each effect was specific to a distinct herbivory regime: natural herbivory affected nodule number, whereas leafhoppers (Cicadellidae) weakened the per nodule benefit. We did not detect any effect of herbivory on nematode gall number or the cost of infection. Our data demonstrate that distinguishing between symbiont number from the fitness consequences of symbiosis is crucial to accurately infer how pairwise interactions will evolve in a community.

AB  - Deltas are hydrologically dynamic landscapes where river floodwaters create a mosaic of productive ecosystems that provide important services. The flood regime, however, is vulnerable to upstream anthropogenic activities, climate change and geomorphic processes. Deciphering the roles of multiple potential stressors on flood regime change is critical for developing appropriate adaptive and mitigative strategies but requires knowledge of hydrological variability at broader scales of space and time than is typically available from instrumental and observational records. At the globally recognized Peace -Athabasca Delta (Canada), the timing, magnitude and causes of reduced flooding and drawdown of perched basin water levels remain an intense focus of investigation. Here we employ novel 'paleofloodscapes', generated from geospatial interpolation of Bayesian mixing model fingerprinting of sediment elemental concentrations, to quantify variation in the delta's flood regime during the past similar to 140 years. Results reveal that flooding of the delta began to decline several decades before hydroelectric regulation of Peace River flow, not coincident with it, and the influence of floodwaters from the unregulated Athabasca River has declined more than the regulated Peace River. A key discovery is that widespread flooding of perched basins occurs when ice -jam events on the river(s) coincide with a relatively high water -plane in the delta's open -drainage network. Without knowledge of open-drainage water levels, inferred change to the flood regime of perched basins may be inaccurate when derived solely from analyses of Peace River hydrometric data and climatic records. The paleofloodscapes illustrate that rising sediment delivery caused by a natural river avulsion in 1982 may undermine the intended purpose of a proposed weir installation. The most recent paleofloodscape, developed from lake surface sediment sampling shortly after widespread flooding, demonstrates the value of the approach as a landscape hydrological monitoring tool, and is readily transferrable to other floodplains to track flood regime change.

AB  - Acoustic deterrents are currently being considered for deployment at strategic bottlenecks, such as lock and darns of major rivers, to deter upstream movement of invasive carp. Previous studies have demonstrated that bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and H. molitrix, respectively) display negative phonotaxis to playbacks of broadband sound recordings produced from a 100 hp outboard boat motor. However. there is concern that acoustic deterrents may impact the movement of non-target native fishes in the Upper Mississippi River. We evaluated the potential impacts of a broadband underwater acoustic deterrent on native ostariophysans [bigmouth buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)], invasive ostariophysans [bighead carp, common carp (Cyprinus carpio), grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) and silver carp], and native non-ostariophysans [(American eel (Anguilla rostrata), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), hybrid striped bass (M. saxatilis x M. chrysops), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) and paddlefish (Polyodon spathula)]. Fish were exposed to playback of the broadband sound (60-10000 Hz), and their behavior was evaluated. Bighead carp showed a strong negative phonotaxis response to the stimulus [12.3 +/- 7.5 (SD) mean consecutive reactions]. silver carp and grass carp showed moderate responses (4.5 +/- 5.2 and 3.8 +/- 3.5 reactions), and common carp displayed low responses (1.3 +/- 1.9 reactions). Of the native fish bigmouth buffalo (2.1 +/- 2.9 reactions) and hybrid striped bass (0.3 +/- 0.5 reactions) were the only species to demonstrate observable response to the acoustic stimulus. Based on this small-scale behavioral screening, acoustic deterrents should have minimal impact on native species, however, larger pond and field trials are necessary to confirm this finding.

AB  - Bacteria are key drivers in regulating ecosystem functions, and understanding the diversity and dynamic changes in bacteria in composting is very important for optimizing compost. This study investigated the structure, composition, and function of bacterial communities in alkaline pig manure compost using Miseq sequencing, PICRUSt2. The ACE and Chao1 indices of the bacterial communities in various phases were significantly different. Bacterial communities of alkaline pig compost were different from neutral and acidic swine manure compost, and there were 438 genera of common bacteria in various stages. The main bacterium was the phylum Firmicutes. There were six genera, including Romboutsia, Clostridium, Terrisporobacter, norank_f_Marinococcaceae, Saccharomonospora, and unclassified_f_Bacillaceae, that were significantly correlated (p < 0.05), or even extremely significantly correlated (p < 0.001), with the physicochemical properties. TOC, moisture, C/N, and Tem were the key factors that caused changes in bacterial communities in composting. PICRUSt2 analysis showed that there were seven functional groups: metabolism (45.02-48.07%), environmental information processing (15.25-16.00%), genetic information processing (16.97-20.02%), cellular processes (3.63-4.37%), human diseases (0.71-0.82%), organismal systems (0.66-0.77%), and unclassified (13.93-14.36%). This study will provide a reference for improving bacteria growth and reproduction conditions in pig manure composting, optimizing the process, and improving the efficiency of composting.

AB  - The effect of microplastics (MPs) on the biological treatment of organic waste has been extensively studied, but little is known about the influence of different MPs on composting humification and the fungal community. In this study, PE, PVC, and PHA MPs were individually mixed with cow dung and sawdust and then composted. The results showed that different MPs had various influences on humification, and the humic acid to fulvic acid ratio of all MP-added treatments (0.44-0.83) was lower than that of the control (0.91). During the composting process, Ascomycota (26.32-89.14%) and Basidiomycota (0.47-4.78%) are the dominant phyla in all treatments and all microplastics decreased the diversity and richness of the fungal community at the thermophilic stage of composting. Exposure to MPs had an obvious effect on the fungal community at the genus level, and the addition of PHA and PE MPs increased the relative abundance of phytopathogenic fungi. LEfSe and network analysis indicated that MPs reduced the number of biomarkers and led to a simpler and more unstable fungal community structure compared to the control. This study has important implications for assessing microplastic pollution and organic waste disposal. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite rapid advances in sensor development and technological miniaturization, it remains challenging to non-invasively record small-amplitude electrophysiological signals from an animal in its natural environment. Many advances in ecophysiology and biologging have arisen through sleep studies, which rely on detecting small signals over multiple days and minimal disruption of natural animal behavior. This paper describes the development of a surface-mounted system that has allowed novel electrophysiological recordings of sleep in wild marine mammals. We discuss our iterative design process by providing sensor-comparison data, detailed technical illustrations, and material recommendations. We describe the system's performance over multiple days in 12 freely moving northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) sleeping on land and in water in captivity and the wild. We leverage advances in signal processing by applying independent components analysis and inertial motion sensor calibrations to maximize signal quality across large (> 10 gigabyte), multi-day datasets. Our study adds to the suite of biologging tools available to scientists seeking to understand the physiology and behavior of wild animals in the context in which they evolved.

AB  - In tropical forests, drought and herbivory represent two potent stresses on seedlings. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of severe droughts in many tropical forests, which may influence seedling vulnerability to herbivores if drought stress affects seedling palatability. Furthermore, contrasting selective pressures in wetter vs drier forests could mean that species well-adapted to herbivores are less drought resistant and vice versa. In this study, we measured seedling performance and herbivory in a common garden experiment where seedlings of 15 tree species were subjected to irrigation or rainfall exclusion treatments across two dry seasons in Panama. Water manipulation had no effects on foliar herbivory during the experiment for all species combined and for 14 of the 15 focal species when analyzed separately. There was large variation among species in herbivore damage, but no relationship between the sensitivity of species to drought and the amount of herbivory they experienced. Altogether, our findings suggest that increasing drought stress is unlikely to directly alter tropical tree seedling susceptibility to herbivore attack in this forest. Additional studies are needed to determine whether drought alters tropical plant-herbivore interactions via other mechanisms, such as through changes in herbivorous insect communities and/or increases in fitness costs of herbivory. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - While leishmaniases have long been established in southern Europe, increasing cases have also been reported in Central Europe. A recent serological study in Poland suggested the presence of Leishmania spp. in European bison (Bison bonasus). To verify this, we screened both Culicoides biting midges and European bison tissues for Leishmania DNA. Biting midges were collected in the Bia & lstrok;owieska Forest, where we identified ten species, with Culicoides obsoletus and C. pictipennis being the most abundant. However, none of the 129 biting midges or 63 European bison tissue samples tested positive for Leishmania DNA. In contrast, Culicoides midges were found to carry Trypanosoma theileri and the monoxenous trypanosomatid Herpetomonas ztiplika. Moreover, T. theileri was detected in three European bison, marking the first molecular confirmation of this parasite in this host. Given the absence of Leishmania DNA in both European bison and biting midges, we propose that the previous serological findings may have resulted from cross-reactivity with T. theileri rather than a true Leishmania infection.

AB  - Spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula White; SLF) is a phloem-feeding planthopper invasive to the Eastern United States that can feed on a range of wild and cultivated plant species. Since its 2014 introduction in the United States, large infestations and subsequent economic damage have been reported in cultivated grapevines, but no studies have detailed grapevine physiological responses to SLF phloem feeding. This study investigated grapevine-SLF interactions, detailing how different infestation densities affect leaf gas exchange and end-season concentrations of nonstructural carbohydrates and nitrogen in vegetative and perennial tissues of two Vitis species. Effects on fruit ripeness parameters and dormant bud freeze tolerance were examined, in addition to other year-after effects. Phloem feeding by low densities (<= 4 SLF shoot(-1)) had minimal effects, whereas greater densities (5-15 SLF shoot(-1)) increasingly affected carbohydrate and nitrogen dynamics in both Vitis species. Phloem feeding substantially affected starch and, to a lesser extent, total nitrogen concentrations of woody roots. Prolonged exposure strongly reduced leaf gas exchange. We conclude that intensive late-season phloem feeding by large adult SLF population densities (>= 8 SLF shoot(-1)) can induce carbon limitation, with the potential for negative year-after effects in cases of severe belowground carbon depletion. This work presents novel insights into SLF-grapevine interactions, identifies avenues of future SLF-plant research, and assists the development of action thresholds for SLF management in vineyards.

AB  - Camellia oleifera (Abel) is an economic tree species and one of the four largest oil plants in the world. The leaf and twig responses and plasticity indices of C. oleifera were investigated under four light regimes in Pinus massoniana understory plantations, namely, 100% light intensity (CK), 75% of CK (HL), 50% of CK (ML), and 30% of CK (LL). The morphological characteristics, biomass allocation, and physiological characteristics of C. oleifera leaves and twigs under different light regimes, as well as their plasticity indexes, were comprehensively evaluated. The results showed that leaf area, and specific leaf area, leaf total carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll contents, and photosynthesis increased, which indicates that plants have the strongest adaptability under HL. No fruit appeared in twigs under LL and ML. The plastic morphological traits were greater than the biomass allocation and physiological traits. The plasticity of palisade/sponge tissue thickness and lower epidermis thickness were the lowest. In conclusion, C. oleifera have differences in sensitivity and regulation mechanism according to their differences in leaf morphological characteristics, biomass allocation physiological indicators, and response to light regimes. C. oleifera plants showed obvious phenotypic inhibition under CK, while they can adjust their strategies for using light energy to maintain their own growth and development under HL. The wide range of light adaptation and strong plasticity of C. oleifera may be two important reasons for its existence in heterogeneous habitats, but it needs at least 75% light regimes to complete its normal growth development and fruit setting. The study provides insights into the optimum light regimes for the improvement of the quality and efficiency of C. oleifera in P. massoniana understory plantations.

AB  - High densities of herbivorous purple marsh crabs (Sesarma reticulatum) have caused major vegetation loss in salt marshes across Cape Cod (Massachusetts, USA). As creekbanks are a preferred habitat for this species, much of the damage is concentrated along these edges, resulting in an elevated potential for creek widening through erosion and bank slumping. The presence and/or spatial distribution of S. reticulatum is variable across this region with impacts ranging from minor to severe, and this provides an opportunity to distinguish between background vs. S. reticulatum-enhanced widening. To accomplish this, GIS tools were used to delineate portions of tidal creek systems in 18 marshes, half of which have experienced substantial creekbank vegetation losses from crab-driven herbivory. Delineations were based on georeferenced aerial photography between 2005 and 2021. In addition, creek widths at discrete locations in the delineated systems were measured in each photo year using GIS tools to estimate rates of bank retreat. A smaller number of narrow <2.0 m mosquito ditches were analyzed in the same way to further stratify the data by initial width. Between 2010 and 2021, all tidal conduits ranging from the larger, natural creeks to mosquito ditches widened at a rate that was significantly higher in marshes with no Sesarma damage. While all marshes are under threat from SLR, creek-widening in those experiencing intense crab herbivory may have a greatly shortened lifespan.

AB  - Sustainable use of wildlife requires information about the demographic parameters of free-ranging populations. Although exploitation of capybara populations occurs throughout its distribution, in Colombia its legal use has been suspended for two decades. The flooded savannas of Colombia and Venezuela that are home to the largest population of capybara are under high risk due to anthropic transformations. Here, we estimated the density, size, age structure, and group size of a population of capybara. We present information from seven samplings between the years 2004 and 2017. We established a 3600 ha grid with 700 m spaced transects in Paz de Ariporo, Casanare (Colombia). Three types of comparisons were made: 1) Interannual, equal climatic periods in samples of contiguous years, 2) Seasonal, different climatic periods of contiguous years, and 3) by decade, equal climatic periods in intervals of one decade. For all sampling, we calculated the finite population growth rate (lambda), the maximum production index (Pmax), and only for the samplings that coincided with the harvesting period allowed in Colombia the sustained harvest index (h). In 2005, the population presented the largest size (N = 12 802, D = 3.75ind / ha), while in 2017 it tended to decrease (N = 6928, D = 2.03ind / ha). In the seasonal rain-dry comparisons,. shows a decrease near to 30 %, while, per decade, there are positive and negative fluctuations. For the samplings in 2005 and 2015, (h), indicates that sustainable harvesting is viable, however, it is necessary the monitoring of the populations and their habitat.

AB  - Plants may produce induced defenses such as longer thorns or secondary compounds to cope with higher levels of herbivory. However, it is unclear if physical and chemical plant defenses increase incrementally along a gradient of herbivore densities. We hypothesized that physical and chemical anti-herbivore defenses in selected shrubs increase with increasing herbivore density. We tested our hypothesis using four 0.81 km2 paddocks on each of two ranches in southern Texas, USA, that were fenced to exclude ingress and egress by white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus). Target densities of deer on each ranch were 0 (control), 25, 49, and 74 deer/km2. Pelleted feed was provided ad libitum in each paddock. In July 2014, we selected ten plants of blackbrush acacia ( Vachellia rigidula), twisted acacia ( Vachellia schaffneri), and spiny hackberry ( Celtis ehrenbergiana) in each of the four research paddocks on each ranch. We marked stems on each plant and recorded length of the main stem, lateral stems, and thorns during July 2014-2016. We collected leaf and stem samples from 20 plants of each of the three browse species during July and October 2014 and 2015 for analysis of crude protein and tannins. Branch density of blackbrush acacia was 38 % (25 deer/km2) to 123 % (49 deer/km2) greater in deer density treatments and thorn density of blackbrush acacia was 27 % greater in treatments with 74 deer/km2 than in control treatments. Spiny hackberry branch density was 2.5 times greater in treatments with 49 deer/km2 than in control treatments. Induction of plant antiherbivore defenses with increasing deer density occurred primarily in blackbrush acacia. A key finding is that induced physical and chemical defenses in shrubs can respond to increasing herbivore density in a non-linear fashion and the combination of defense strategies can vary depending on herbivore density.

AB  - Simple Summary The conversion of livestock manure into organic fertilizer through composting is an effective way to harmlessly and resourcefully utilize manure. The bacterial communities change rapidly during the composting process, and there is a synergistic effect of various bacteria, which realizes the dynamic fermentation of composting. However, the succession of bacterial communities and its relationship with the physicochemical properties of the material during sheep manure composting remain unclear. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools were used to analyze the succession and to explore the metabolic functions of bacterial communities during sheep manure composting. The results will help to further improve the sheep manure composting process, improve the quality of compost products, and promote fertilizer utilization of sheep manure. Bacterial community is a key factor affecting aerobic composting, and understanding bacterial community succession is important to revealing the mechanism of organic matter degradation. In this study, the succession and metabolic characteristics of bacterial communities were explored in 45 days composting of sheep manure and wheat straw by using high-throughput sequencing technology and bioinformatics tools, respectively. Results showed that the alpha diversity of bacterial community significantly decreased in the thermophilic (T2) phase and then recovered gradually in the bio-oxidative (T3) and the maturation (T4) phases. Bacterial communities varied at different stages, but there were 158 genera in common bacterial species. Unclassified_f_Bacillaceae, Oceanobacillus, Bacillus, Pseudogracilibacillus, and Nocardiopsis were identified as keystone bacterial genera. Eleven genera were significantly correlated (p < 0.05), or even extremely significantly correlated (p < 0.001), with the physicochemical factors. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that changes of bacterial community diversity correlated with physicochemical factors. The highest relative abundances were amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism among the metabolic groups in the compost. These results will provide theoretical support for further optimizing sheep manure composting conditions and improving the quality of organic fertilizers.

AB  - Several groups of marsupial mammals have been cited as examples of functional convergence with placental mammals (e.g. Thylacinus cynocephalus (thylacine) and Canis lupis (gray wolf)), though detailed quantitative analyses have often revealed subtle differences between such groups. A less-well known purported case of convergence is that between the extant Ailuropoda melanoleuca (giant panda) and the extinct diprotodontid marsupial, Hulitherium tomasettii from the montane rainforest of Papua New Guinea. Because of its body weight and bizarre panda-like post-cranial morphology, H. tomasettii has been depicted as a specialist bamboo feeder. Here, we test this dietary hypothesis by using a multi-proxy approach that includes Orientation Patch Count Rotated (OPCR) and dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA). Specifically, we compare the dental complexity and DMTA of H. tomasettii to other diprotodontids and extant herbivores with similar cranio-dental features and/or post-cranial features, including extant bamboo feeders. We show that H. tomasettii does not display the high dental complexity or DMTA attributes exhibited in extant bamboo feeding taxa. Instead, low dental complexity and DMTA data suggest that H. tomasettii was neither adapted for consuming mechanically challenging food nor did it consume particularly tough or hard foods like the culm of bamboo, and was more akin to other diprotodontids and/or bilophodont browsers (e.g. browsing tapirs). Our results suggest that H. tomasettii was likely a generalised browser and not a specialised bamboo feeder. Collectively, the post-cranial morphology and diet of H. tomasettii may indicate a browser that was able to take advantage of vegetation higher up in trees and/or softer bamboo leaves.

AB  - Comparative landscape genetics studies provide insights on the impact of landscape elements on gene flow patterns of different species inhabiting the same geographic area. We investigated the population genetic structure of two sympatric ungulates, roe deer Capreolus capreolus and Northern chamois Rupicapra rupicapra, in a mountain area of the central Italian Alps (Trentino, northern Italy). A total of 122 chamois and 72 roe deer samples were genotyped by two species-specific panels of 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci and analyzed by aspatial and spatially explicit analyses. While the roe deer population resulted unstructured, a clear population structure was detected in chamois, with two main groups, one inhabiting the eastern and the other spread in the western part of the study area. Landscape genetics analysis confirmed these scenarios and revealed a different effect of landscape on gene flow. An IBD (Isolation-By-Distance) model best explained genetic variation in roe deer, while IBR (Isolation-By-Resistance) was found as the process underlying genetic variation patterns in chamois, suggesting arable lands, coniferous forests, watercourses, and main roads as potential barriers. Species distribution and landscape use might explain these results: roe deer mostly occupy valley floors relatively connected to each other, and their spatial behavior may promote gene flow across areas. On the other hand, chamois prefer higher elevations and their movements may be hindered by valleys, rivers, and road networks. This study highlights the different impacts of natural and anthropic landscape elements on gene flow in two sympatric species, resulting from their different ecological requirements.

AB  - Aquatic megafauna are difficult to observe and count due to the inaccessibility and issues of detectability. Traditional transect and helicopter counts are useful for obtaining population estimates, but they often have logistical and cost limitations. The recent proliferation of drone technology offers an innovative way of surveying animal populations. However, data collected from drones are hindered by an analysis bottleneck that increases the time needed to process them. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are an emerging category of deep learning that can automate this data analysis process. Here, we compare traditional methods with drone surveys, by detecting and counting Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) and common hippopotami (Hippopotamus amphibious). We evaluate the utility of CNNs for object detection and quantification in complex environments. Drone counts were more accurate than traditional methods; identifying 21% more crocodiles. Where vegetation was open, hippo counts with a drone showed a similar pattern (identifying 43% more). When vegetation was dense the drone produced less-accurate population estimates than traditional methods. CNN accuracy was limited (85%) due to the reduced training dataset available for the CNN. However, with an expanded data set, object detection is likely to be more accurate, making it more applicable for expedited and automated data analysis.

AB  - Herd reduction or reducing the population density of deer in infested areas is a widely considered method to combat CWD. However, the viability of this method relies on interest and cooperation from local residents that may have different values, attitudes towards such methods. This paper summarizes key findings from a recent survey of local residents in CWD infested area in West Tennessee to explain the barriers and opportunities in securing local cooperation for this method of CWD management. State wildlife agencies and their conservation partners will benefit from these findings in designing appropriate communication, outreach and incentive mechanism towards a successful CWD management.

AB  - Members of the public play a primary role in successful implementation of wildlife management plans, making communication between scientists and the public a vital component of wildlife management. Although there is substantial public interest in the health of ungulate populations, stakeholder perspectives can vary widely, rendering a single approach to communication ineffective. To improve science communication, we characterized perspectives regarding issues negatively affecting mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in Wyoming, USA. We used Q methodology, a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach where participants ranked a series of statements followed by semi-structured interviews, to identify shared perspectives. We interviewed individuals (n = 37) representing prominent stakeholder groups (e.g., ranchers, hunters, conservation non-profits) in Wyoming. We identified 3 perspectives (52% of variance explained) that captured shared views regarding what factors are negatively affecting mule deer: bottom-up (n = 17 participants; 26% variance), human contributions (n = 9; 14% variance), and top-down (n = 8; 12% variance) perspectives. Most participants shared the idea that mule deer are being negatively affected, but participants diverged in views as to the primary issues. Perspectives ranged from being focused on bottom-up factors (e.g., habitat fragmentation, condition of winter ranges) to top-down factors (e.g., predation, disease) to factors focused on human contributions (e.g., human activity, public and political interests). Based on how participants diverged in perspectives and their interest in mule deer management, we discuss opportunities for scientists to improve communication by incorporating ecological complexity and nuance, moving towards a 2-way dialogue of communication, and sharing their own first-hand experiences in future communications with stakeholders.

AB  - Calcrete Bontveld is a mosaic vegetation that occurs on flat-topped calcareous ridges adjacent to solid Valley Thicket in the Albany Thicket biome of South Africa. It consists of thicket clumps (bushclumps) scattered in a grassy dwarf shrubland matrix. While the bushclumps of Calcrete Bontveld represent the thicket component in the mosaic the extent and nature of similarity between the bushclumps and adjacent solid Valley Thicket remains unresolved. This study considers the relationship between the thicket communities of these two spatially separate but proximal vegetation types. As expected, bushclumps share a substantive compositional similarity and structure with the nearby solid Valley Thicket but minimally so with the surrounding grassy dwarf shrubland matrix. The latter is made up of elements of other biomes with only a few thicket taxa. The Bushclump composition differs from the adjacent solid Valley Thicket in that it is less succulent and less diverse in the number of plant families. A total of 22 Thicket species were absent from the bushclumps notably a few iconic ones: trees Portulacaria afra, shrubs Cotyledon velutina, Euphorbia mammilaris and Kalanchoe rotundifolia, as well as the geophyte, Gasteria bicolor. By contrast, only 8 taxa were found only in the bushclumps, but not in the local form of solid Valley Thicket (e.g. Ptaeroxylon obliquum and Scolopia zeyheri). Several of these have a Cape Thicket affinity e.g. trees Colpoon compressum and Pterocelastrus tricuspidatus and the shrub Diospyros dichrophylla. The absence of many adjacent thicket species from the bush clumps provides evidence for exchange exclusion of propagules of some Valley Thicket taxa from the bushclumps of Calcrete Bontveld. However, the unique bushclumps are a suitable habitat for establishment of the more distant Cape-affinity taxa.

AB  - Livestock farming accounts for 14.5% of global total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. China has been a major contributor to global GHG emissions from livestock and is the biggest pork producer and consumer worldwide. However, those factors driving GHG emissions from pork production and consumption in China have not been thoroughly assessed. Here, we used the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model (GLEAM) and the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to identify and assess the major drivers contributing to the life-cycle carbon emissions embodied in China's pork production and consumption from 2005 to 2020. Our results show that CO2 emissions accounted for 99% of the total GHG emissions in the pig industry, primarily released from the processing and transporting of pig feed. These two sectors contributed more than 90% to the total CO2 emission. CH4 was mainly emitted from enteric fermentation and manure management of pigs, which accounted for a tiny portion of total carbon emissions in the pork industry. Among the primary factors driving pork-induced carbon emissions in China, the reduction of pork emission intensity (PPE) significantly slowed down growing carbon emissions, attributed to the improvements in pork production technology and the promotion of green farming. Our finding reveals that the growing population primarily contributed to elevated carbon emissions before 2015 due to increasing demands for pork meat. Since 2015, the rapid growth of the aged population in China has decreased pork consumption capacity and carbon emissions from pork consumption. The result indicates, for the first time, that the population aging in China, the largest pork consumer in the world, would play a vital role in reducing pork consumption-induced carbon emissions. Such an effect would become more significant in the future, along with the growing aged population in China, favoring the country's GHG emission mitigation increasingly.

AB  - Enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) levels via improved fertilization strategies can promote soil health and support sustainable crop production. While bacteria and fungi play a key role in SOC accumulation, the effects of soil micro-food webs that include organisms from higher trophic levels remain uncertain. We sought to narrow this knowledge gap by clarifying the associations between SOC accumulation and soil micro-food webs at the aggregate scale under long-term (18 years) fertilization treatments, which included a no-fertilizer control (Ctrl), synthetic fertilizers (NPK), and partial synthetic nitrogen replacement with pig slurry (OMNPK) or crop straw (RSDNPK). The concentration of SOC was significantly increased by fertilization following the order RSDNPK (13.1 g kg(-1)) > OMNPK (11.4 g kg(-1)) > NPK (9.1 g kg(-1)) > Ctrl (6.4 g kg(-1)). Nematodes and protists accounted for approximately 20% of all nodes in the multitrophic networks. Fertilization increased network complexity at the aggregate scale by 1-4 times across different sampling dates (P < 0.05). In all aggregate classes, the functionally important (FI) nematodes, protists, and bacterial taxa involved in soil carbon cycle had higher relative abundances under the fertilization treatments than under the Ctrl (P < 0.05). Structural equation modeling further indicated that besides soil microbes, network complexity, FI nematodes and protists were important to SOC accumulation. Compared with NPK, the key moments during which these soil biological attributes strongly regulated SOC under OMNPK and RSDNPK were delayed to late growth stages of maize. In conclusion, the increased network complexity and relative abundance of functionally important organisms from higher trophic levels of the soil micro-food webs at certain periods are vital contributors to effective SOC accumulation under fertilization regimes that include organic amendments.

AB  - The exposure to high altitude and cold stress poses challenges in maintaining normal physiological standards and body homeostasis in non-native animals. To enhance our understanding of the physiology of native and non-native goats in high-altitude environments, we conducted a comparative study to examine the impact of natural hypoxic and cold stress conditions on their feed intake (FIT) and associated changes in physiological responses, including plasma glucose concentration (PGC). The study took place at an altitude of 3505.2 m above mean sea level and involved twenty-two healthy females from two different breeds of goats. This study was conducted over a period of 56 days after the arrival of non-native Black Bengal goats (BBN) and compared with native Changthangi (CHAN) goats. Both groups were extensively reared in a natural high-altitude and cold-stress environment in Leh, India, and were subjected to defined housing and management practices. The parameters evaluated included FIT, PGC, respiration rate, heart rate, pulse rate, and rectal temperature. High altitudes had a significant (p < 0.05) impact on FIT, PGC, respiration rate, heart rate, pulse rate, and rectal temperature in BBN, whereas these parameters remained stable in CHAN throughout the study period. Additionally, the detrimental effects of high-altitude stress were more pronounced in non-native goats compared to native goats. These findings suggest that physiological responses in non-native goats tend to stabilize after an initial period of adverse effects in high-altitude environments. Based on the physiological responses and glucose concentration, it is recommended to pay special attention to the nutrition of non-native goats for up to the third week (21 days) after their arrival in high-altitude areas.

AB  - Global population growth and climate change challenge food security severely, and adopting appropriate fertilization strategies to guarantee food production under climate change is uncertain. This research studied the crop yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) in peas-wheat-potato rotation system under four fertilization regimes (viz. unfertilized control (CK), applied mineral nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer (NP), applied sheep manure (M), and applied NP+M (MNP)) through an 18-year field experiment combined with the DeNitrification-DeComposition biogeochemical modeling. We observed that MNP had the highest yield, the average total crop yield of pea, wheat and potato was 5784, 4735, 3240 and 1481 kg ha(-1) respectively in MNP, M, NP and CK. Manure application improved SOC significantly, it was 7.08, 7.51, 3.47 and 2.92 g kg(-1) respectively in MNP, M, NP and CK at the end of the field experiment. Under the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 climate projection (2022-2100), in all four climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), the yield order was MNP > M > NP > CK, and there was a significant difference in the average total yield of pea, wheat, and potato among treatments. Under future climate, the pea yields were higher than that in the historical period (2004-2021); the wheat yield in CK was similar to the historical period but it was higher in NP and M and lower in MNP than historical period. Moreover, the potato yield in MNP was slightly lower than that of the historical period but it was significantly higher in M and lower in NP and CK than historical period. Comparatively, MNP had higher yield stability and sustainability than NP, both under historical and future climate conditions. Fertilization reduced the yield response to growing-season precipitation under historical climate, while combined fertilization reduced the yield response to annual precipitation and average temperature in future climates. In addition, SOC increased in all treatments under the future climate scenarios and the effect of manure was significant, but the increase rate retarded as the climate scenario increase and time over. These results suggested that the combined application of manure and mineral fertilizer contributed to mitigating climate change's impact on crop yields.

AB  - While the renewal effect of extinction is considered to be invoked by attention to context during the extinction phase, there is also evidence that processing during initial learning (acquisition) may be important for later renewal. A noradrenergic agonist and a dopaminergic antagonist, administered before acquisition, did not affect renewal, however, the effects of NMDAergic neurotransmission in this regard are as yet unknown.
   In a previous study, administration of a single dose of the NMDA agonist D-cycloserine (DCS) before extinction learning facilitated extinction in the context of acquisition (AAA), but had no effect upon renewal. In the present fMRI study, DCS was administered prior to the initial acquisition of a predictive learning task, in order to investigate whether NMDA receptor (NMDAR) stimulation at this timepoint will modulate overall learning as well as the level of renewal, while increasing activation in the extinction- and renewal-relevant brain regions of inferior frontal gyrus (iFG) and hippocampus (HC).
   DCS facilitated acquisition, as well as extinction learning in the context of acquisition (AAA), and raised the level of ABA renewal. While BOLD activation during acquisition did not differ between treatment groups, activation in bilateral iFG showed a double dissociation during processing of AAA extinction trials, with DCS-mediated higher activation in right iFG and deactivation in left iFG. In contrast, placebo showed higher activation in left iFG and deactivation in right iFG. During the test (recall) phase, left iFG and right anterior hippocampus activation was increased in DCS participants who showed renewal, with activation in this region correlating with the ABA renewal level.
   The results demonstrate that NMDA receptor stimulation can facilitate both initial learning and extinction of associations, and in this way has an impact upon the resultant level of renewal. In particular NMDAergic processing in iFG appears relevant for the facilitation of AAA extinction and ABA recall in the test phase.

AB  - Elucidating factors that drive microhabitat selection in a species is important for informing the conservation management of the species. For species that use microhabitats as long-term refuge sites, selection pressures are likely to be strong because the microhabitat must fulfil their eco-physiological and life history requirements. Smaug giganteus (Sungazer) is a threatened (Vulnerable) cordylid lizard species in the highveld grasslands of South Africa - a key agricultural area in the country. Individuals dig burrows as refuges, which increases their sensitivity to habitat transformation. In addition, previous attempts to translocate populations have failed due to a lack of knowledge about their specific microhabitat requirements. We assessed microhabitat characteristics that may influence burrow site selection by measuring vegetation characteristics surrounding Sungazer burrows and comparing these to vegetation at randomly selected sites. We also recorded orientation, aspect, soil composition, and the presence of other animal dung. Sungazers selected sites with sparse vegetation cover, and where grass height was short, but had no preference for soil composition. There was no relationship between the presence of ungulate dung and the placement of Sungazer burrows. Most Sungazer burrows were orientated in a northerly direction on north-facing slopes, suggesting that burrow placement has thermoregulatory advantages. We recommend that to identify suitable sites for Sungazer translocations, landscapes are thoroughly surveyed with cognisance to the findings in this study, and that a soft-release translocation protocol follows to maximise translocation success.

AB  - In captive environments, mammals are frequently exposed to various parasitic protozoa and other vector-borne pathogens that can impact both animal health and public health. Monitoring these pathogens is essential for animal welfare and zoonotic disease control. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of parasitic protozoa and other vector-borne pathogens in captive mammals through molecular detection methods at the Belo Horizonte Zoo, Brazil. Between November 2021 and March 2023, whole blood samples were collected from 40 mammals. Molecular analyses identified piroplasms, Leishmania spp., granulocytic/platelet Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp., monocytic Ehrlichia spp., Bartonella spp. and hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. with a 72.5% positivity rate. Piroplasms were found in 22.5% (two Pantanal cats, two gorillas, one white rhinoceros, one spider monkey, one jaguar, one tufted capuchin and one hippo) and Leishmania spp. in 12.9% (four maned wolves). Granulocytic/platelet Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp. were found in 12.5% of the samples (one gorilla and four maned wolves), Ehrlichia canis in 2.5% of the animals (one maned wolf), Bartonella spp. in 42.5% (six howler monkeys, two maned wolves, one gorilla, one white rhino, one southern tamandua, one common woolly monkey, one tufted capuchin, one brown brocket deer, one agouti, one cougar and one hippo), hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. in 17.5% (one gorilla, one maned wolf, one white rhino, one howler monkey, two common woolly monkeys and one European fallow deer). Five Artiodactyla members tested negative for A. marginale. Coinfections occurred in 34.5% of the positive samples. Sequencing revealed that Theileria spp. and Cytauxzoon spp. are closely related to Theileria bicornis and Cytauxzoon felis; Ehrlichia canis and Bartonella spp. are closely related to B. clarridgeiae and B. henselae; and hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. are closely related to Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum. Our results showed a high occurrence of vector-borne pathogens in captive animals, including zoonotic species, which may pose a risk to animal and human public health.

AB  - The activities of predators and prey have been reported to influence each other. However, few studies have clarified when African leopards Panthera pardus are likely to encounter their prey. One reason for this is that the activity patterns of African forest mammals are poorly understood. Therefore, I aimed to clarify the activity patterns of leopards and their prey species by deploying camera traps on the ground and in trees in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. In total, 4468 camera days of camera traps set on the ground and 286 camera days of camera traps set in trees were analyzed. The overlap in activity patterns between leopards and their main prey species was calculated using coefficient Delta. At least seven leopards were identified in the study area. Leopards were active throughout the day, with crepuscular peaks at dawn and dusk. Blue duikers Philantomba monticola, the most consumed species in Mahale, were predominantly diurnal. The activity patterns of leopards moderately overlapped with those of blue duikers (Delta = 0.65). The activity patterns of leopards showed a moderate (Delta = 0.61) or low (Delta = 0.42) overlap with those of red-tailed monkeys Cercopithecus ascanius when detections were captured by arboreal or terrestrial cameras, respectively. Mahale leopards may hunt blue duikers and arboreal primates in the midday on the ground, and may also attack primates in roost trees at night. Future studies on the leopard diet in various study areas, as well as comparisons of activity patterns between leopards and other animals, will elucidate leopard ecology.

AB  - Protected areas are crucial to safeguard Sub-Saharan Africa's extraordinary and abundant megafauna. In many of these areas, instability has derailed conservation efforts and impeded adequate wildlife monitoring. Discovered in 2004, Eastern chimpanzees are found in the Central Uele Basin in northern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) within the Bili-Ue acute accent re acute accent Protected Areas Complex (BUPAC), the largest contiguous protected area in the country. BUPAC is threatened by habitat destruction, mining, wild meat trade, and insecurity. BUPAC chim-panzees are part of the largest remaining continuous population of the species in Africa; they are also being behaviourally unique. Forest elephants were frequent in the 1960 ' s in the BUPAC but have declined significantly up to 2004-2007. We used line transects to estimate Eastern chimpanzee and forest elephant density in the BUPAC core area in 2016 and 2019 and compared these with the 2004-2007 surveys. A total of 37 and 137 two km long line transects were systematically placed in 5,841 km2 and 6,176 km2 survey areas in 2016 and 2019, respectively. We found that chimpanzee density did not change during the two survey periods but indicators for forest elephant density decreased eight-fold. Human activities were detected mainly along the core area pe-riphery in both survey years, where they overlapped with centres of animal activity. The stable high density of chimpanzees is a positive outcome for the core BUPAC. However, despite being a conservation priority area that has received relatively intensified protection, declining forest elephant numbers are likely to reflect the high number of human conflict hotspots in vicinity as well as the increasing human population density around the core area. We propose by elevating the core area to National Park whilst strengthening on the ground enforcement and management structures as well as legal measures against poaching might ensure the long-term survival of such an important area in Africa.

AB  - Giant clams (subfamily: Tridacninae) are an important food and economic resource for the Republic of Palau and the greater Indo-Pacific region. However, giant clam diversity and distribution data for Palau are out of date. This study reports the species diversity and distribution of giant clams across the Palauan archipelago (total survey area of 3,300(2) m) from data collected between 2015-2017. This is the first documented finding of Tridacna noae in Palau, however, it was rare. Only four individuals were found at only two locations. Results show that Palau is home to a diverse and abundant population of giant clams. Tridacna crocea (an important food and economic resource) exhibited the highest abundance, with an average of 20.0 +/- 2.9 individuals per 50 m(2). Tridacna maxima and Tridacna squamosa were ranked next in abundance. In contrast, T. noae, Tridacna derasa, Tridacna gigas, and Hippopus hippopus were found in low numbers or only found in few locations. The density of all recruits, juveniles, and adult T. crocea and T. maxima did not differ significantly between conservation areas and open fishing sites, which suggests the possibility that ecological factors such as habitat loss, acute weather events, or changes in sea surface temperatures could be impacting replenishment or recruitment. However, one protected area was found to have a higher abundance of T. crocea recruits and adults, which suggests that protection from fishing may have increased recruitment rates and lowered mortality rates at this site. Taken as a whole, clam populations in Palau remain reasonably abundant and healthy. As demand for giant clams continues to rise in Palau and the region, local regulations should focus on sustainable fishing practices by establishing size limits, species bans, and long-term monitoring plans to maintain the diverse populations of giant clams found there.

AB  - Camelina (Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz; Brassicaceae) is known as an important and low-input oilseed crop, which is widely used in the production of biopolymers, biofuels, cosmetics, food, and feed. One of the main problems of camelina cultivation is related to seed size which can directly influence its germination, seedling growth, and development. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate the effect of temperature (T) and water potential (psi) on camelina germination behavior using population-based threshold models as the first study in this case. For this purpose, camelina seeds were incubated at eight Ts (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 degrees C) and at each of the following five levels of psi s (0, -0.25, -0.50, -0.75 and -1 MPa). The results illustrated that T, psi and T x psi significantly affected germination characteristics of camelina. The psi(b)(50) value remained constant at Ts <= 20 degrees C ( 1.29 MPa), afterward increased linearly to 0.81 and 0.41 MPa at 25 and 30 degrees C, respectively. The thermal time model also showed that the psi levels did not affect the value of T-b at sub-optimal Ts (T-b = 1.5 degrees C), while T-c(50) decreased linearly with decreasing psi, with the rate of 11.3 degrees C per MPa at supra-optimal Ts, conforming with the results obtained by the hydrothermal time model. This decrease in germination capacity at Ts above T-o was due to the shifts in the psi(b)(50) (become more positive), reflecting a decrease in GR(50) as a result of thermoinhibition which could be considered as an adaptive strategy under stress conditions. The cardinal Ts for camelina germination at 0 MPa were estimated 1.5 degrees C for T-b, 20.0 degrees C for T-o, and 34.4 degrees C for T-c. Consequently, camelina could be marked as a cold-tolerant plant and suitable for cultivation in arid regions due to the high resistance to low water potential (psi(b)(50) = 1.29 MPa).

AB  - Simple Summary Infrared camera technology was used to study the space occupancy, activity rhythm, and sexual segregation of white-lipped deer (Cervus albirostris) in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin of Tibet for two years. The results showed that, in Jiacha Gorge, the occupancy of white-lipped deer is high, belonging to crepuscular activity pattern mammals. White-lipped deer have two activity peaks in the forest (May, October), and most of their activities are in the form of mixed groups of male and female during breeding and wintering. This study provides important information for the habitat utilization of white-lipped deer, and offers a scientific basis and theoretical support for the protection of white-lipped deer in Jiacha Gorge in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin. The white-lipped deer (Cervus albirostris) is a rare and endangered species found in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. To understand the space occupancy, activity rhythm, and sexual segregation of the white-lipped deer, 24,096 effective photos and 827 effective videos were captured using infrared cameras from February 2020 to January 2022. The ecology and behavior of the white-lipped deer in Jiacha Gorge were studied in more detail using site occupancy models, relative abundance index, and other technologies and methods. The results show that The occupancy predicted by the model exceeds or approaches 0.5. The occupancy increases with greater altitude and with larger EVI values, while the detection rate increases with altitude only during spring and decreases with EVI values only in summer. The daily activity peaks for white-lipped deer were observed from 7:00 to 11:00 and 17:00 to 22:00, with annual activity peaks occurring from April to June and from September to November. From July to the following January, white-lipped deer mostly move in mixed-sex groups, while during the remainder of the year, they predominantly associate with individuals of the same sex. Climate, vegetation coverage, food resources, and human disturbance collectively influenced the behavior and habitat utilization of white-lipped deer. The foundational research conducted on white-lipped deer over the past two years is expected to enhance the basic understanding of white-lipped deer in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and contribute to future protection and management decisions.

AB  - Our understanding of the biology of the extinct pig-footed bandicoots (Chaeropus) has been substantially revised over the past two decades by both molecular and morphological research. Resolving the systematic and temporal contexts of Chaeropus evolution has relied heavily on sequencing DNA from century-old specimens. We have used sliding window BLASTs and phylogeny reconstruction, as well as cumulative likelihood and apomorphy distributions, to identify contamination in sequences from both species of pig-footed bandicoot. The sources of non-target DNA that were identified range from other bandicoot species to a bird-emphasizing the importance of sequence authentication for historical museum specimens, as has become standard for ancient DNA studies. Upon excluding the putatively contaminated fragments, Chaeropus was resolved as the sister to all other bandicoots (Peramelidae), to the exclusion of bilbies (Macrotis). The estimated divergence time between the two Chaeropus species also decreases in better agreement with the fossil record. This study provides evolutionary context for testing hypotheses on the ecological transition of pig-footed bandicoots from semi-fossorial omnivores towards cursorial grazers, which in turn may represent the only breach of deeply conserved ecospace partitioning between modern Australo-Papuan marsupial orders.

AB  - Introduced Phragmites (Phragmites australis ssp. australis) forms part of an invasion assemblage in North America that includes non-native insect herbivores and parasitoids, some of which are now found on both the introduced and native subspecies of Phragmites (P. australis ssp. americanus). This insect assemblage is key to understanding the impact of P. australis invasion and interpreting the efficacy of biological control used against introduced P. australis. Our study provides the first dedicated comparison of insect assemblages associated with native and introduced P. australis in Canada. From a 2016 to 2017 survey of 28 geographically paired sites across Ontario, Canada, fourteen insect taxa were recorded from both subspecies. Genotype had no effect on alpha-diversity but stem attack rates from at least one herbivore were higher on native populations than on paired introduced populations (+ 18.6%). We report the first record of Chaetococcus phragmitis (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae) and Rhizedra lutosa (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Canada and of R. lutosa and Lasioptera hungarica (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) on native P. australis in North America.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The occurrence of traumatic injuries was assessed in cattle, sheep, goats and pigs reared and slaughtered in the Czech Republic. For the purposes of the study, the results of veterinary postmortem examinations at slaughterhouses in the period from 2010 to 2019 were analyzed. In the studied animal species, findings of traumatic lesions were detected at low frequency. The low frequency of traumatic lesions is favorable from the perspective of the welfare of slaughtered animals. In terms of further improvements to animal welfare, it would be desirable to focus on the prevention of trauma in cattle in particular, in which findings of trauma were more frequent than in the other species studied. The category most affected by trauma both to the limbs and body was cows.
   The welfare of cattle, pigs, sheep and goats was assessed by measuring trauma detected during veterinary postmortem inspection at slaughterhouses. The subject of this evaluation were all bovine, porcine, ovine and caprine animals slaughtered at Czech slaughterhouses in the monitored period, i.e., a total of 1,136,754 cows, 257,912 heifers, 1,015,541 bulls, 104,459 calves, 586,245 sows, 25,027,303 finisher pigs, 123,191 piglets, 22,815 ewes, 114,264 lambs, 1348 does and 5778 kids. The data on the numbers of traumatic findings were obtained retrospectively from a national veterinary database collecting data from slaughterhouse postmortem examinations. The results showed that findings of trauma were observed at a low frequency in the studied species. Injuries were detected most frequently in cows (1.71%). In contrast, no findings associated with the presence of trauma were recorded in does and kids. From the viewpoint of trauma localization, findings on the limbs were more frequent than findings on the body (p < 0.01). The only exceptions to this were lambs, does and kids, for which there was no statistically significant difference between findings on the limbs and the body (p = 1.00). The results show that housing system (bedding, the presence of slats, floor hardness), transport of animals to the slaughterhouse (moving animals to the vehicle, loading ramps, floors in transport vehicles and the transport of animals itself) and design of the slaughterhouse (unloading ramps, passageways and slaughterhouse floors) have a greater impact on the limbs than the bodies of animals in the majority of species. A difference was also demonstrated in the occurrence of findings of trauma in the limbs and body (p < 0.01) between culled adult animals and fattened animals, namely in cattle and pigs. A difference (p < 0.01) between ewes and lambs was found only in the occurrence of traumatic injury to the limbs. The results showed that fattened animals are affected by the risk of trauma to a lesser extent than both culled adult animals and young animals. Statistically significant differences (p < 0.01) were also found between the studied species and categories of animals. The category most affected from the viewpoint of injury both to the limbs and body was cows. In contrast to cows that are typically reared indoors, the low frequency of traumatic findings was found in small ruminants and in bulls, i.e., animals typically reared outdoors. Assumedly, access to pasture may be beneficial considering the risk of traumatic injury.

AB  - Despite showing high resilience and adaptation to various types of habitats including human-dominated landscape, barking deer have experienced considerable threats due to habitat loss, poaching, and competition for resources with other deer species. In the present study, we examined the population genetic parameters of barking deer from the Indian Himalayan Region, (IHR) using mitochondrial and nuclear markers and performed comparative analysis with the barking deer sequences retrieved from China, Thailand, Vietnam, and India (Central and Northeast region). We observed relatively high genetic diversity (Hd = 0.904 +/- 0.038 and pi = 0.0165 +/- 0.005) at mitochondrial Cyt b gene and a moderate genetic variability at 11 nuclear microsatellites (Ho = 0.587 +/- 0.072, He = 0.731 +/- 0.046). The Bayesian-based population structure analysis revealed the presence of two different populations corresponding to the western and central-eastern Himalayas. The present study has generated a baseline population genetic account of barking deer that may be used in population monitoring of barking deer across IHR using non-invasive genetic sampling.

AB  - The quality of green tea is influenced by soil microbes in addition to soil conditions and the Camellia sinensis cultivar. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can significantly improve soil quality and crop productivity; however, the specific AM fungal groups that affect the catechin quality index (CQI) of green tea are not yet clear. In the present study, rhizosphere soil samples, root samples, and fresh tea leaves from six different Camellia sinensis cultivars in Hunan Province, China, were collected. The taxonomic diversity and community composition of AM fungi in the rhizosphere soil and roots were investigated using high-throughput Illumina amplicon sequencing technology, and the mycorrhizal colonization rate was assessed. The two main AM fungal genera in the Camellia sinensis roots and rhizosphere were Paraglomus and Glomus. A higher catechin quality index (HCQI) is correlated with greater accumulation of Paraglomus in the roots of Camellia sinensis. The tea cultivar and the available phosphorus content in the rhizosphere soil significantly affected the mycorrhizal colonization rate and the composition of the AM fungal community within the roots. The mycorrhizal colonization rate affected the catechin composition, consequently influencing the CQI of green tea. Furthermore, fluctuations in the proportional presence of Paraglomus and Glomus within the roots of Camellia sinensis notably affected the CQI. In summary, increased mycorrhizal colonization and increased prevalence of Paraglomus substantially increase the CQI of green tea. These findings have significant implications for the application of AM fungi in the production of high-quality green tea.

AB  - Intercropping is one of the most widely used agroforestry techniques, reducing the harmful impacts of external inputs such as fertilizers. It also controls soil erosion, increases soil nutrients availability, and reduces weed growth. In this study, the intercropping of peanut (Arachishypogaea L.) was done with tea plants (Camellia oleifera), and it was compared with the mono-cropping of tea and peanut. Soil health and fertility were examined by analyzing the variability in soil enzymatic activity and soil nutrients availability at different soil depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-40 cm). Results showed that the peanut-tea intercropping considerably impacted the soil organic carbon (SOC), soil nutrient availability, and soil enzymatic responses at different soil depths. The activity of protease, sucrase, and acid phosphatase was higher in intercropping, while the activity of urease and catalase was higher in peanut monoculture. In intercropping, total phosphorus (TP) was 14.2%, 34.2%, 77.7%, 61.9%; total potassium (TK) was 13.4%, 20%, 27.4%, 20%; available phosphorus (AP) was 52.9%, 26.56%, 61.1%; 146.15% and available potassium (AK) was 11.1%, 43.06%, 46.79% higher than the mono-cropping of tea in respective soil layers. Additionally, available nitrogen (AN) was 51.78%, 5.92%, and 15.32% lower in the 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-40 cm layers of the intercropping system than in the mono-cropping system of peanut. Moreover, the soil enzymatic activity was significantly correlated with SOC and total nitrogen (TN) content across all soil depths and cropping systems. The depth and path analysis effect revealed that SOC directly affected sucrase, protease, urease, and catalase enzymes in an intercropping system. It was concluded that an increase in the soil enzymatic activity in the intercropping pattern improved the reaction rate at which organic matter decomposed and released nutrients into the soil environment. Enzyme activity in the decomposition process plays a vital role in forest soil morphology and function. For efficient land use in the cropping system, it is necessary to develop coherent agroforestry practices. The results in this study revealed that intercropping certainly enhance soil nutrients status and positively impacts soil conservation.

AB  - Although roads are central to human society, they have many negative environmental impacts and create risk for traveling motorists. Our aim was to evaluate the spatiotemporal evolution of ungulate-vehicle collision (UVC) hotspots in response to major road construction. We examined two different locations and scales in the province of Alberta, Canada: (1) a highway bypass adjacent to a large city with 4.5 km of wildlife mitigation measures (wildlife fencing and two underpasses) and (2) 55 km of rural highway that was converted from a two-lane to a four-lane divided highway. Using government police collision and carcass data (2000-2021), beforeafter and control-impact analyses were used to assess changes in UVC rates. Our approach is novel in that we tested the paired use of a clustering method known as kernel density estimation plus and a spatiotemporal stepwise modification of this method to monitor UVC hotspots. By monitoring UVCs over space and time, we could identify stable vs. ephemeral UVC hotspots, a fence-end effect, and a barrier effect due to traffic volume, and we could explore hotspot stability before and after construction. The wildlife mitigation measures along the highway bypass resulted in 86% fewer UVCs compared to an unmitigated highway. At a larger scale, however, net benefits were affected by road density. The construction of a four-lane divided highway with no wildlife mitigation measures and an increase in the posted speed limit resulted in a slight increase in UVCs and the reemergence of the majority of historical UVC hotspots. Our analysis highlighted the need to incorporate wildlife considerations at a variety of scales throughout the transportation planning and mitigation evaluation process.

AB  - A critical function of animal coloration is avoiding attack, either by warning predators or reducing detectability. Evolution of these divergent strategies may depend on prey palatability and apparency to predators: conspicuous coloration may be favoured if species are distasteful, or habitats make hiding difficult; by contrast, camouflage may be effective if prey lack defences or environments are visually complex. For insect herbivores, host plants provide both chemical defence and the background against which they are detected or obscured; thus, plant traits may be key to coloration in these foundational terrestrial organisms. We use 1808 species of larval Lepidoptera to explore macroevolution of protective coloration strategy. We find that colour and pattern evolve jointly in caterpillars, similar to an array of species across the animal kingdom, while individual elements of coloration evolve closely with diet ecology. Consistent with key tenets of plant defence and plant-herbivore coevolutionary theory, conspicuous colours are associated with herbaceous host plants-thought to be defended by toxins-while camouflage colours and patterns are associated with woody plants and grasses. Contrary to theory, dietary specialization is not associated with conspicuous coloration. Our results add valuable insights into the evolutionary forces shaping colour and pattern in nature.

AB  - This work constitutes an approach to hunting management in Uruguay. We have focused on wild boar hunting, the most widespread form of recreational hunting in this country. We explored the connections and discrepancies between the different actors based on a qualitative study conducted with conservationists, animal rights groups, nature managers, and hunters. The informality of hunting and the lack of population studies on wildlife were the main concerns raised while hunting with dogs was the most controversial issue. These results allowed us to propose some potential management actions to improve hunting management: issuing a hunting license, regulating hunting with dogs, developing collaborative wildlife monitoring, promoting new technologies within the framework of ethical hunting, and developing a realistic and effective poaching control.

AB  - Kumar P, Thakur TS, Deepika, Sharma N. 2022. Diversity studies on insect pests of high altitudinal transitional zones of North-western Himalayas. Nusantara Bioscience 14: 203-210. Class Insecta constitute a major fauna and comprise many species of economic importance. Due to climate change and increase in temperature, many insect species are changing their habitat considerably and also shifting their hosts. This leads to changes in the diversity of insect pests at different altitudinal gradients. High altitude forest cover is not large and massive as plains forest cover but it supports some of the very important economical tree species like-Quercus sp., Himalayan Poplar, Betula sp., Abies pindrow (Royle ex D.Don) Royle, Juniper spp., Birdcherry, Maple, etc. The present study was undertaken to analyze any change in insect pest incidences and diversity of pest species due to the change in host preferences or due to the change in the climatic patterns. The study was conducted at four selected sites viz. Rohtang area (Kullu Forest Division), Chanshal area (Rohru Forest Division), Sach area (Churah Forest Division), and Indrahar area (Dharamshala Forest Division) of high altitudinal transitional zones of Himachal Pradesh, India, to study insect pest diversity. A total of 32 insect species were recorded during the study period comprised of the Insect orders viz., Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Orthoptera, Dermaptera, and Lepidoptera. The present investigation led to the finding that species of Coleoptera (beetles) were the most dominant insects attacking trees of the high altitudinal transitional zone, followed by Lepidoptera (Butterflies and moths) and Hemiptera (aphids).

AB  - The primary aim of the current study was to develop a model capable of predicting the spatial distribution patterns of soil organic carbon (SOC) in mangrove forests (Avicennia marina) affected by camel grazing along the southern coast of the Red Sea. Four protected locations within mangrove forests were selected along the southern coast of the Saudi Red Sea, while eight other locations were selected under the influence of camel grazing. Three equations-allometric, exponential, and sigmoid-were employed on soil carbon data obtained from 40 soil cores, which equated to 600 soil samples. The goal was to develop models that could forecast how the cumulative SOC stocks (SOCc) and volumetric SOC densities (SOCv) would be distributed throughout the respective soil profiles in protected and grazed locations of mangroves, in order to predict how soil carbon changes when mangroves are under grazing stress. The sigmoid and exponential equations proved to be most effective in predicting SOCv distribution, with average R-2 values of 0.956681 and 0.893894 for protected and grazed locations, respectively. For protected locations, all three equations effectively predicted the SOCc, with the sigmoid equation (R-2 = 0.999942) exhibiting the best performance. In grazed locations, all equations were applicable, with the allometric equation demonstrating superior accuracy (R-2 = 0.999910). The study found that grazing activities in mangrove forests resulted in a loss of SOC stock of 7.0 kg C/m(2), accounting for 54% of the initial stock. These findings will significantly enhance our comprehension of SOC distribution in mangrove ecosystems under the grazing effect, allowing us to quantify the impact of camel grazing on SOC dynamics in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - To manage predation risk, prey navigate a dynamic landscape of fear, or spatiotemporal variation in risk perception, reflecting predator distributions, traits, and activity cycles. Prey may seek to reduce risk across this landscape using habitat at times and in places when predators are less active. In multipredator landscapes, avoiding one predator could increase vulnerability to another, making the landscape of fear difficult to predict and navigate. Additionally, humans may shape interactions between predators and prey, and induce new sources of risk. Humans can function as a shield, providing a refuge for prey from human-averse carnivores, and as a predator, causing mortality through hunting and vehicle collisions and eliciting a fear response that can exceed that of carnivores. We used telemetry data collected between 2017 and 2021 from 63 Global Positioning System-collared elk (Cervus canadensis), 42 cougars (Puma concolor), and 16 wolves (Canis lupus) to examine how elk habitat selection changed in relation to carnivores and humans in northeastern Washington, USA. Using step selection functions, we evaluated elk habitat use in relation to cougars, wolves, and humans, diel period (daytime vs. nighttime), season (summer calving season vs. fall hunting season), and habitat structure (open vs. closed habitat). The diel cycle was critical to understanding elk movement, allowing elk to reduce encounters with predators where and when they would be the largest threat. Elk strongly avoided cougars at night but had a near-neutral response to cougars during the day, whereas elk avoided wolves at all times of day. Elk generally used more open habitats where cougars and wolves were most active, rather than altering the use of habitat structure depending on the predator species. Elk avoided humans during the day and similar to 80% of adult female mortality was human caused, suggesting that humans functioned as a "super predator" in this system. Simultaneously, elk leveraged the human shield against wolves but not cougars at night, and no elk were confirmed to have been killed by wolves. Our results add to the mounting evidence that humans profoundly affect predator-prey interactions, highlighting the importance of studying these dynamics in anthropogenic areas.

AB  - Cyromazine as insect growth inhibitor have been frequently detected in the environment, which show a potential threat to environment and soil health. Nitrogen is an essential component of all living organisms and the main nutrient limiting life on our planet In this study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and sequencing of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria were conducted to investigate the dynamic effects of cyromazine on nitrogen conversion during laboratory-based composting. Results showed that the presence of cyromazine significantly reduced the abundance of amoA gene during the thermophilic phase of composting (p < 0.01), resulting in lower oxidation of NH4+-N. The archaea amoA gene was more resistant to cyromazine. The nirK gene was more abundant than the nirS gene during composting and was significantly reduced only under high concentrations of cyromazine (p < 0.01). The high close of cyromazine (15 mg/kg) severely damaged the nitrogen fixation capacity of compost products. Cyromazine exhibited an inhibition effect on richness (ACE, Chao) of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms during the thermophilic period, while increased the diversity (shannon) at all stages of composting. Pseudomonas_formosensis was the core denitrifiers that harbored nosZ gene, Nitrosomonas_eutropha and Nitrosospira_sp_Nl5 were the dominant nitrifier that harbored amoA gene, and these species have a negative response to cyromazine. Network analysis indicated that the dominant bacteria harboring amoA and nosZ genes were hubs of nitrogen oxidation and reduction processes. Structural equation modeling revealed that NO2--N conversion played a crucial role in driving denitrification, and increase of NH4+ -N content was attributed to the inhibition of nitrification and denitrification during composting caused by cyromazine.

AB  - Subsistence poaching threatens the persistence of wildlife populations worldwide and the well-being of people who participate in poaching. We conducted interviews around Murchison Falls National Park, Uganda to assess the acceptability of poaching. Conflict with wildlife was the most important factor determining attitudes towards poaching and the tools of the trade. More than 80 % of the respondents living within 5 km of the park boundary had never been inside the park. Additionally, the provision of goats as incentives to people did not influence attitudes but increased human-wildlife conflict. This implies that acceptability of poaching among people living in close proximity to wildlife is influenced by the nature of the interaction between people and protected areas, but more importantly, limiting positive interaction can create negative consequences. Our results emphasize the importance of providing remedies compatible with local livelihoods and conditions and show that negative experience with wildlife builds intolerance.

AB  - The dry savannahs of the Sahelian vegetation zone house a remarkable community of large mammals that have been less studied than their counterparts in the eastern Africa. Here we examine some aspects of the ecology of a community of twenty different large mammal species in a savannah of Burkina Faso, for a relatively long-term period (seven years). We observed remarkable interannual differences in terms of (i) number of contacts and (ii) their groups size (range of groups). Nonetheless, the calculated Kilometric Index of Abundance, with all species pooled, showed a relatively stable value of 0.88-1 individual per Km, apart in 2012 when it decreased to 0.7. GLM models on the observed number of contacts and group sizes revealed that there were significant effects of the species, but neither of the year nor of the season. Remarkable species-specific density fluctuations throughout time were observed when applying the DISTANCE methodology to the dataset. The sex ratio showed great fluctuations between the years and by species, even if there was a general predominance of females.

AB  - In the proposed study, a nonlinear model is developed to explore the interactive dynamics between cattle and invertebrates when they coexist in a grassland system and compete with one another for the same resource - the grass biomass. The constructed model is theoretically investigated using the qualitative theory of differential equations to show the system's rich dynamical properties, which are crucial for maintaining the ecosystem's balance in grasslands. The qualitative findings show that, depending on the parameter combinations, the system not only displays stability of many equilibrium states but also experiences transcritical and Hopf bifurcations. The model results support the idea that inter-specific competition between cattle and invertebrates does not always produce regular dynamic patterns but may also produce periodic and destabilizing patterns. The model's outputs may assist in striking a balance between pasture and natural grass biomass in grassland with the invertebrates.

AB  - How organisms obtain energy to survive and reproduce is fundamental to ecology, yet researchers use theoretical concepts represented by simplified models to estimate diet and predict community interactions. Such simplistic models can sometimes limit our understanding of ecological principles. We used a polyphagous species with a wide distribution, the brown bear (Ursus arctos), to illustrate how disparate theoretical frameworks in ecology can affect conclusions regarding ecological communities. We used stable isotope measurements (delta C-13, delta N-15) from hairs of individually monitored bears in Sweden and Bayesian mixing models to estimate dietary proportions of ants, moose, and three berry species to compare with other brown bear populations. We also developed three hypotheses based on predominant foraging literature, and then compared predicted diets to field estimates. Our three models assumed (1) bears forage to optimize caloric efficiency (optimum foraging model), predicting bears predominately eat berries (similar to 70% of diet) and opportunistically feed on moose (Alces alces) and ants (Formica spp. and Camponotus spp; similar to 15% each); (2) bears maximize meat intake (maximizing fitness model), predicting a diet of 35%-50% moose, followed by ants (similar to 30%), and berries (similar to 15%); (3) bears forage to optimize macronutrient balance (macronutrient model), predicting a diet of similar to 22% (dry weight) or 17% metabolizable energy from proteins, with the rest made up of carbohydrates and lipids (similar to 49% and 29% dry matter or 53% and 30% metabolizable energy, respectively). Bears primarily consumed bilberries (Vaccinium myrtillus; 50%-55%), followed by lingonberries (V. vitis-idaea; 22%-30%), crowberries (Empetrum nigrum; 8%-15%), ants (5%-8%), and moose (3%-4%). Dry matter dietary protein was lower than predicted by the maximizing fitness model and the macronutrient balancing model, but protein made up a larger proportion of the metabolizable energy than predicted. While diets most closely resembled predictions from optimal foraging theory, none of the foraging hypotheses fully described the relationship between foraging and ecological niches in brown bears. Acknowledging and broadening models based on foraging theories is more likely to foster novel discoveries and insights into the role of polyphagous species in ecosystems and we encourage this approach.

AB  - Throughout California, oak savannas exhibit poor recruitment of saplings in natural populations. To prevent the decline of California oak (Quercus spp.) populations, management practices need to elucidate the drivers of recruitment limitations. Previous research suggests that nurse plants enhance the establishment of oaks by buffering them from stressors such as insolation and herbivory. However, their long-term effects on sapling performance remain poorly known. Here we explore the differential impacts of nurse plants on the growth and distribution of sympatric evergreen and deciduous oak species. We compared all naturally occurring saplings found underneath and around nurse plants in two environments with contrasting densities of herbivorous mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in 2015 and 2023. The nurse plants and oaks observed in 2015 were located and evaluated after eight years, along with all new oak saplings recruited between 2015 and 2023. We uncovered that beneficiary oaks protected by nurse plants had greater height growth compared to those exposed in the open. Additionally, increased herbivory stress is associated with a shift in the distribution of beneficiaries underneath the nurse plant, favoring recruitment closer to the nurse plant's center. We conclude that nurse plants are only beneficial to the long-term growth of oak saplings under high herbivory scenarios. As nurse plants are not as effective facilitators for deciduous species compared to evergreen ones, further research devoted to management solutions for deciduous oak species is warranted.

AB  - During the last glacial period, rapidly changing environments posed substantial challenges to Neanderthal populations in Europe. Southern continental regions, such as Iberia, have been proposed as important climatic "buffer" zones during glacial phases. Contextualising the climatic and ecological conditions Neanderthals faced is relevant to interpreting their resilience. However, records of the environments and ecosystems they exploited across Iberia exhibit temporal and spatial gaps in coverage. Here we provide new evidence for palaeotemperatures, vegetation structure, and prey herbivore ecology during the late Pleistocene (MIS 5-3) in northern Spain, by applying multiple stable isotope tracers (& delta;18O, & delta;13C, & delta;15N, & delta;34S) to herbivore skeletal remains associated with Neanderthal occupations at Axlor Cave, Bizkaia. The results show little change over time and indicate stable climatic conditions and ecosystems across different occupations. Large within-layer isotopic variability in nitrogen and sulphur suggests the presence of a mosaic environment and a variety of isotopic ecotones that were exploited by Neanderthals and their prey. We implement a combination of carbonate and phosphate & delta;18O measurements to estimate palaeotemperatures using a cost-effective workflow. We show that the targeted use of phosphate & delta;18O measurements to anchor summer peak and winter trough areas enables high-precision seasonal palaeoclimatic reconstructions.

AB  - Natural populations evolve in response to biotic and abiotic changes in their environment, which shape species interactions and ecosystem dynamics. Agricultural systems can introduce novel conditions via herbicide exposure to non-crop habitats in surrounding fields. While herbicide drift is known to produce a variety of toxic effects in plants, little is known about its impact on nontarget wildlife species interactions. In a two-year study, we investigated the impact of herbicide drift on plant-herbivore interactions with common weed velvetleaf (Abutlion theophrasti) as the focal species. The findings reveal a significant increase in the phloem-feeding silverleaf whitefly (Bermisia tabaci) abundance on plants exposed to herbicide at drift rates of 0.5% and 1% of the field dose. We also identified a significant phenotypic trade-off between whitefly resistance and herbicide resistance in addition to whitefly resistance and relative growth rate in the presence of dicamba drift after increasing the populations grown in Year 2. In a follow-up greenhouse study, we found evidence that dicamba drift at 0.5% of the field dose significantly increased the average chlorophyll content (in milligrams per square centimeter) along with a positive correlation between whitefly abundance and chlorophyll content. Overall, these findings suggest herbicide exposure to nontarget communities can significantly alter herbivore populations, potentially impacting biodiversity and community dynamics of weed populations found at the agro-ecological interface.

AB  - Leaf economic spectrum (LES) traits (e.g., leaf mass area and leaf nutrient concentrations) are effective indicators of an acquisitive or conservative resource use strategy for plants. The increased atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) alters soil nutrient availability, thereby affecting plant LES traits. However, how the LES traits and their trade-offs affect the resource-use strategies of understory plants under long-term N and P additions is still unclear. Based on a fertilization plot including four treatments (control (CK), N addition (+N, 100 kg N hm(-1) yr(-1)), P addition (+P, 50 kg P hm(-1) yr(-1)), and combined N and P additions (+NP, 100 kg N hm(-1) yr(-1) + 50 kg P hm(-1) yr(-1))) conducted over 12 years in a subtropical broad-leaved evergreen forest, this study addresses the differential response of four LES traits (leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf N concentration (Nmass), leaf P concentration (Pmass) and leaf net photosynthesis per unit mass (Amass)) to fertilization in five dominant understory plants (Camellia fraternal, Eurya muricata, Eurya rubiginosa, Rhododendron ovatum, and Symplocos sumuntia) to test whether trade-offs between plant traits closely related to light resources play an important role in influencing plant resource-use strategies. The results show that, compared to the CK treatment, the LMA was significantly increased by 12.5% to 12.8% under +N treatment, and the Nmass was significantly increased by 25.9% and 23.6% under +N and +NP treatments, while Pmass and Amass were significantly increased by about 23% and 15 similar to 50%, respectively, after P addition. There was a highly significant negative correlation between the response of LMA and Pmass, irrespective of the addition of N and P alone or together. The increase in LMA under +N treatment made the resource-use strategy of the understory plants more conservative. Meanwhile, the understory plants tended to rapidly acquire resources by decreasing LMA while increasing Pmass under +P and +NP treatments. Our results suggest that, under long-term N and P additions, understory plants with limited light availability change their resource-use strategies mainly through the trade-off between leaf LMA and Pmass, which should be considered to capture the long-term adaptive strategies of understory plants against a background of intense atmospheric N and P deposition.

AB  - Systematic field surveys were conducted in 2010-13 for the threatened, globally rare plant species, Helonias bullata L. (swamp pink: Liliaceae) in New Jersey, which contains 60% of known populations. A total of 90 sites were visited, including 56% of extant populations, focusing on the highest quality, largest, and most geographically representative populations in the state in order to comprehensively assess the species' status. A complete census and threat assessment was conducted for each population, using standardized methods adopted during previous surveys in 1997-2001, and population trends were determined by comparing results between data sets. The results found declines in 83% of Helonias populations in the past 10 yr, including severe declines (> 67%) in 53% of populations, and another 26% experiencing declines of 20% or more. Analyses of past and present data sets found the primary cause of declines appeared to be herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), which had not been previously regarded as a significant threat to the species, followed by hydrological changes caused by human development and/or water consumption. Browse damage to Helonias was directly observed in 84% of populations, with an average of 40% of Helonias clusters exhibiting recent damage at each site. Concern for observer bias was also explicitly addressed in the methods and analyses providing further confidence in the results. Implications for the conservation and recovery of Helonias are discussed, as well as the benefits and limitations of the standardized methods used for long-term studies of this and other rare plant species in the future.

AB  - Many coral reefs have shifted from coral- to macroalgae-dominated community states, heightening the need to understand resilience of coral communities. Fishing on herbivores often reduces resilience of the coral state, as lower herbivory fosters macroalgal establishment. Despite the acknowledged importance of fishing, relatively little attention has been paid to how fishers change their behavior as macroalgae overgrow reefs, or how the resulting dynamic feedbacks might affect resilience. We address these questions in Moorea, French Polynesia, where local fishers target herbivorous fishes and where shifts to algal dominance have occurred on some lagoon reefs. We quantified fisher preferences for reef habitats where they target various taxa. For the two most ecologically important taxa of herbivores targeted in the fishery, parrotfish (Scaridae) and unicornfish (Naso), fishers preferred to harvest from locations with less macroalgae. We incorporated these habitat preferences into a spatially explicit social-ecological model of reef dynamics to explore consequences of changes in fishing behavior for resilience of the coral state, particularly following disturbance. Fishing that targets low-macroalgae locations typically generates resilience by facilitating local recovery of herbivores and thus of coral in the less-targeted macroalgae-dominated patches. However, the resulting movement of fishers across the seascape can sometimes create fragility; if coral loss is widespread, avoidance of macroalgae concentrates fishing in patches having the highest coral cover, resulting in loss of coral via reduced herbivory. Our results emphasize that resilience and coral-macroalgae regime shifts cannot be understood without considering humans as a dynamic part of the system.

AB  - Orphans of several species suffer social and physiological consequences such as receiving more aggression from conspecifics and lower survival. One physiological consequence of orphaning, stunted growth, has been identified in both humans and chimpanzees, but has not been assessed in a non-primate species. Here, we tested whether wild African elephant orphans show evidence of stunted growth. We measured individually known female elephants in the Samburu and Buffalo Springs National Reserves of Kenya, with a rangefinder capable of calculating height, to estimate a von Bertalanffy growth curve for female elephants of the study population. We then compared measurements of known orphans and non-orphans of various ages, using a Bayesian analysis to assess variation around the derived growth curve. We found that orphans are shorter for their age than non-orphans. However, results suggest orphans may partially compensate for stunting through later growth, as orphans who had spent a longer time without their mother had heights more similar to non-orphans. More age mates in an individual's family were associated with taller height, suggesting social support from peers may contribute to increased growth. Conversely, more adult females in an individual's family were associated with shorter height, suggesting within-group competition for resources with older individuals may reduce juvenile growth. Finally, we found a counterintuitive result that less rainfall in the first 6 years of life was correlated with taller height, potentially reflecting the unavoidable bias of measuring individuals who were fit enough to survive conditions of low rainfall as young calves. Reduced growth of individuals has been shown to reduce survival and reproduction in other species. As such, stunting in wildlife orphans may negatively affect fitness and represents an indirect effect of ivory poaching on African elephants.

AB  - Adult sex ratio and fecundity (juveniles per female) are key population parameters in sustainable wildlife management, but inferring these requires abundance estimates of at least three age/sex classes of the population (male and female adults and juveniles). Prior to harvest, we used an array of 36 wildlife camera traps during 2 and 3 weeks in the early autumn of 2016 and 2017, respectively. We recorded white-tailed deer adult males, adult females, and fawns from the pictures. Simultaneously, we collected fecal DNA (fDNA) from 92 20 m x 20 m plots placed in 23 clusters of four plots between the camera traps. We identified individuals from fDNA samples with microsatellite markers and estimated the total sex ratio and population density using spatial capture-recapture (SCR). The fDNA-SCR analysis concluded equal sex ratio in the first year and female bias in the second year, and no difference in space use between sexes (fawns and adults combined). Camera information was analyzed in a spatial capture (SC) framework assuming an informative prior for animals' space use, either (a) as estimated by fDNA-SCR (same for all age/sex classes), (b) as assumed from the literature (space use of adult males larger than adult females and fawns), or (c) by inferring adult male space use from individually identified males from the camera pictures. These various SC approaches produced plausible inferences on fecundity, but also inferred total density to be lower than the estimate provided by fDNA-SCR in one of the study years. SC approaches where adult male and female were allowed to differ in their space use suggested the population had a female-biased adult sex ratio. In conclusion, SC approaches allowed estimating the preharvest population parameters of interest and provided conservative density estimates.

AB  - The killer whale (Orcinus orca) behavior termed "depredation" is a major issue negatively affecting fisheries worldwide. Information on killer whale depredation in the northwestern Pacific Ocean is limited. The goal of this work was to assess the extent of killer whale depredation on the groundfish fisheries in the western Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk. Observations of killer whale depredation were conducted on 8 of the 42 (19%) longline fishing vessels between October 2018 and September 2019. Killer whales depredated during 2.0% of vessel days in the western Bering Sea and 18.6% of vessel days in the Sea of Okhotsk, taking exclusively Greenland turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Seventy-one killer whales were identified depredating on longlines in the Sea of Okhotsk, with the best estimation for the total number of killer whales depredating about 139 individuals. Results suggest that killer whale depredation is an issue for Greenland turbot longline fisheries in the northwestern Pacific. There is a strong need for mitigation measures, as this has an economic impact on the fisheries and also affects the killer whale population and associated ecosystems.

AB  - Most phytophagous insects are specialists, so availability of suitable host plants often may be a critical factor limiting establishment of non-native insect species. Here we investigate the extent to which established nonnative tree-feeding insects utilize hosts that are native to the invaded range as well as hosts that are themselves non-native. We accomplish this by comparing host use among all native and non-native bark beetles and pinhole borers (Scolytinae and Platypodinae) established in Europe and North America reported in the literature. These groups of insects are well-known for the disparity among species in specialized behavior and development tied to host physiology. We find considerable variation in host breadth, as measured by species-level and genuslevel host richness and phylogenetic diversity of hosts, among different feeding guilds (ambrosia beetles, true bark beetles, twig beetles, and others). In each region, ambrosia and twig beetles exhibit the greatest diversity of hosts. Host breadth on native plants was generally greater for native beetle species than for non-native beetle species. In contrast, host breadth of non-native beetles is generally greater on non-native plants than on plants native to the focal region. These results indicate that successful invasion of these insect herbivores is dependent on the prior introduction of their non-native host plants, or the availability of native hosts that are closely related to their ancestral host plants.

AB  - Beehive deterrents are commonly used to mitigate human-elephant conflict and protect woody vegetation. To ensure hive activity, reduce abscondment risks, and maintain deterrent effectiveness, resident bee colonies require supplementary feeding during periods of low resource availability. However, our study found that ants frequently consume the supplementary feed in open feeders intended for bees. Anoplolepis custodiens was the most numerically dominant species that excluded bees from the feeders, followed by Camponotus and Crematogaster spp. With higher ant abundance, the predicted probability of zero bees being present at feeders increased up to 82%. This competition may undermine the efficacy of beehive deterrents as a conflict mitigation tool. We developed a simple and effective ant exclusion method that raised the overall predicted probability of bees' presence at supplementary feeding stations from 32% to 68%. Our findings suggest that innovative solutions to exclude ants from supplementary feed may improve the implementation and success of this conflict mitigation method across Africa.

AB  - Mushrooms are a little known source of food for large herbivores, but are of high quality because of their high protein content and digestibility. Approximately 50 epigeous and hypogeous mushroom and lichen species have been identified in the diet of cervids so far using macro remains. Our main objective was to determine which mushroom species are consumed by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) using a molecular approach. We collected 114 fecal samples from deer harvested in 2014 and 2015 on Anticosti Island (Quebec, Canada), extracted total DNA from feces, and amplified fungal DNA specifically via polymerase chain reaction. Amplified fungi DNA was then sequenced with the Illumina method to identify mushroom species consumed by deer. Our results revealed that deer harvested consumed up to 4979 fungal species, including 580 species that appeared to be consumed directly. Adults tended to consume a higher mushroom diversity than juveniles, and mushroom diversity consumed by deer was much higher in 2015 than 2014. Adult females consumed a higher mushroom diversity than males, especially lactating females. Our results contribute to the understanding of the role of mushrooms and their large diversity in white-tailed deer diet.

AB  - Species distributions, abundance, and interactions have always been influenced by human activity and are currently experiencing rapid change. Biodiversity benchmark surveys traditionally require intense human labor inputs to find, identify, and record organisms limiting the rate and impact of scientific enquiry and discovery. Recent emergence and advancement of monitoring technologies have improved biodiversity data collection to a scale and scope previously unimaginable. Community science web platforms, smartphone applications, and technology assisted identification have expedited the speed and enhanced the volume of observational data all while providing open access to these data worldwide. How to integrate and leverage the data into valuable information on how species are changing in space and time requires new best practices in computational and analytical approaches. Here we integrate data from three community science repositories to explore how a specialist herbivore distribution changes in relation to host plant distributions and other environmental factors. We generate a series of temporally explicit species distribution models to generate range predictions for a specialist insect herbivore (Papilio cresphontes) and three predominant host-plant species. We find that this insect species has experienced rapid northern range expansion, likely due to a combination of the range of its larval host plants and climate changes in winter. This case study shows rapid data collection through large scale community science endeavors can be leveraged through thoughtful data integration and transparent analytic pipelines to inform how environmental change impacts where species are and their interactions for a more cost effective method of biodiversity benchmarking.

AB  - Wildlife animals are recognized as reservoirs for zoonotic fungi and their faeces might play an important role in introducing pathogens into the environment. Thought wild boar (Sus scrofa) population has dramatically increased across Europe, information about their possible role in dissemination of zoonotic pathogenic yeasts in the environment is scant. Therefore, fecal samples (n = 124) from wild boars from Campania region (Southern Italy) were collected and yeasts identified biochemically and molecularly by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and their phylogenetical relationship assessed. The antifungal susceptibility profiles of yeasts were also investigated using AFST-EUCAST method. Yeasts were isolated from 50.1% of the samples with the highest occurrence in samples from the province of Salerno (61.1%). A total of 368 Candida strains belonging to nine species were identified, with Candida albicans (45.7%), followed by Candida krusei (15.2%), Kazachstania slooffiae (9.8%) and Candida parapsilosis (7.6%) as the most prevalent identified species. Among C. albicans four sequence types (i.e., ST1-ST4) were identified with an intraspecific nucleotide difference up to 0.21%. The ML tree grouped all representative sequence types as paraphyletic clades with those of the references yeast species, respectively and supported by high bootstrap values. Fluconazole was the less active drug whereas, posaconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole the most active one. No resistance phenomena were observed for C. albicans and high MICs values for 5FC, azoles and echinocandines were registered in non-albicans Candida spp. This study showed, for the first time, the important role of wild boars in dissemination of pathogenic fungi in the environment. The absence of resistance phenomena in the Candida spp. might reflect environmental free from residues of azoles antifungals pollution or chemicals and suggests the role of wild boar as bio indicators of environment quality.

AB  - Forest restoration is a great challenge when saplings are repeatedly pruned by leaf-cutting ants and pesticides are not permitted. Based on four hypotheses (distance-dependent foraging, plant repellence, structural complexity, and nutrient content), we predicted that sapling performance increases and ant pruning decreases: (1) away from leaf-cutting ant nests; (2) in unpalatable or (3) tall vegetation patches; and (4) in non-fertilized soils. We set up a full factorial field experiment to test the hypotheses; we also monitored sapling performance without and with plastic tree shelters used by practitioners to deter ant pruning. Our results showed predicted sapling survival from 40 to 80% per year for distances to nests ranging from 4 to 223 m, respectively. Ant pruning decreased with increasing distance, with null pruning at distances >121 m. Variation in sapling survival, but not in ant pruning, was also explained by the interaction between vegetation palatability and nutrient condition. Vegetation height did not explain sapling survival or pruning. Plastic tree shelters increased survival by 3.5 times and reduced pruning by half. Height of surviving saplings was not affected by any treatment. Our results show the potential for active forest restoration without the use of tree shelters away from leaf-cutting ant nests, while tree shelters are a viable option near leaf-cutting ant nests.

AB  - There is growing interest from research and conservation groups in the potential for using small unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs; <2 kg) to conduct wildlife surveys because they are affordable, easy to use, readily available and reliable. However, limitations such as short flight endurance, and in many situations, aviation regulations, have constrained the use of small UAVs in survey applications. Thus, there is a need to refine survey methods adapted to small UAVs that conform to standard operations within aviation law. We developed a novel survey approach based on a grid sampling design using two multirotor UAVs (Phantom 4 Pros) flying simultaneously, within visual line of sight, from our vessel base-station. We used this approach to assess the fine-scale distribution and abundance of dugongs (Dugong dugon) in the remote waters of the Pilbara, Western Australia during three field seasons across 2 years. We surveyed 64 non-overlapping survey cells in random order one or more times and obtained complete image coverage of each surveyed cell of our 31 km(2) survey area. Our sampling design maximizes sampling effort while limiting survey time by surveying four cells, two at a time, from one location. Overall, we conducted 240 flights with up to 17 flights per day (mean = 14 flights per day) and could obtain complete coverage of up to 11.36 km(2)per day. A total of 149 dugongs were sighted within the 50,482 images which we manually reviewed. Spatially-explicit models of dugong density distribution (corrected for availability and perception bias) were produced using general additive models to identify areas more or less used by dugongs (range of corrected dugong densities across all field season = 0.002-1.79 dugongs per 0.04 km(2)). Dugong abundance estimates ranged from 47 individuals in June 2019 (CV = 0.17) to 103 individuals in May 2018 (CV = 0.36). Our method, which proved convincing in a real-word application by its feasibility, ease of implementation, and achievable surface coverage has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications from community-based local-scale surveys, to long-term repeated/intensive surveys, and impact assessments and environmental monitoring studies.

AB  - Eutrophication resulting from anthropogenic activities has been recognized as a significant driver of changes in ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, it may exacerbate the top-down effect and thus exert an important impact on plant growth. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a 3-year manipulative field experiment to investigate the impacts of nitrogen addition and crab herbivory on the growth of Phragmites australis in the salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta. The results demonstrated that a 3-year nitrogen addition can significantly increase the total nitrogen and carbon content of P. australis leaves, thereby enhancing their nutritional value and palatability, as well as increasing the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs. Therefore, nitrogen addition together with crab herbivory had a significant negative effect on P. australis height, leaf length, and leaf breadth in the ambient crab and procedural crab cage treatment compared to the crab exclusion treatment. The structural equation modeling further substantiated these findings. The model revealed a direct and positive correlation between nitrogen addition and leaf nutrient content (path coefficient = 0.34). Additionally, it demonstrated a direct and positive relationship between leaf nutrient content and the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs (path coefficient = 0.22). Simultaneously, there was an observed negative correlation (path coefficient = - 0.37) between the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs and plant functional traits, represented by leaf length in the model, during 2018. Moreover, the crab exclusion treatment significantly reduced the proportion of leaves consumed by crabs and thus enhanced the P. australis individuals, leaf number, and biomass. Overall, crab herbivory had a significant detrimental top-down effect on the growth of P. australis, and nitrogen enrichment may exacerbate this top-down effect. The findings of our study highlight the combined adverse effects of nutrient enrichment and top-down on plant functional traits and plant growth. The findings of this study will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors influencing vegetation degradation in coastal wetland, thereby establishing a solid theoretical framework for the conservation and management of wetland ecosystems within the context of global environmental change.

AB  - Herbivores can reach extraordinary abundances in many ecosystems. When herbivore abundance is high, heavy grazing can severely defoliate primary producers and, in some cases, even drive ecosystem to undergo regime shifts from a high productivity state to a denuded, low productivity state. While the phenomenon of herbivore-driven regime shifts is well documented, we only partially understand the mechanisms underlying these events. Here, we combine herbivory experiments with 21 years of long-term monitoring data of kelp forest ecosystems to test the hypothesis that herbivores drive regime shifts when herbivory exceeds primary production. To test this hypothesis, we quantified how the foraging habits of an important group of marine herbivores-sea urchins-change with increases in sea urchin biomass and trigger regime shifts to a foundation species, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Using experiments, we quantified how the grazing capacity of urchins increases as urchin biomass increases, then we combined these estimates of urchin grazing capacity with estimates of kelp production to predict when and where urchin grazing capacity exceeded kelp production. When grazing capacity exceeded kelp production, sea urchins caused a 50-fold reduction in giant kelp biomass. Our findings support the hypothesis that the balance between herbivory and production underlies herbivore-driven regime shifts in Southern California kelp forests and provides insight into when and where urchins are likely to force regime shifts in kelp forest ecosystems.

AB  - The spatial and seasonal distributions of benthic marine organisms are generally linked to the physical and chemical features of the environment. The abundance of Libinia ferreirae Brito Capello, 1871 was analysed in relation to the environmental factors: water temperature (surface and bottom), water salinity (bottom), and substratum (texture and organic matter of the sediment). Samples were collected monthly, from January 1998 to December 1999, in the Ubatumirim (UBM), Ubatuba (UBA) and Mar Virado (MV) Bays, on the northern coast of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We caught a total of 213 spider crabs (Ubatumirim = 39; Ubatuba = 53 and Mar Virado = 121). The abundance of L. ferreirae was highest during the spring (October to December) in the three bays. We assume that this result is associated with the entrance of the South Atlantic Central Water during this season, whose features favoured primary productivity and, consequently, displayed a higher food availability for other trophic levels. The lowest number of specimens found during the autumn might be caused by the migration of the population to other sites. The high abundance of L. ferreirae in MV is probably associated with sediment composition, i. e., fine grains which benefit the species' habit of burrowing in the sediment. Hence, the combination of a favourable sediment homogeneity and the highest food availability seems to be effective modulators of the abundance and distribution of L. ferreira in the bays. This investigation elucidates the importance of analysing environmental factors together, to expand knowledge about the study species.

AB  - Climate change will affect the distribution of many tropical plant species. However, the understanding of how dioecious tropical species cope with different environmental conditions is still limited. To address this issue, we investigated how secondary trait attributes in populations of the dioecious tropical tree Myrsine coriacea change along an altitudinal gradient. Eighty individual plants (40 male and 40 female) were selected among seven natural populations. Leaf variation in morphological and stomatal traits, and carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions were analyzed. Female plants had greater isotopic leaf carbon composition (delta C-13) and nitrogen content than male plants, increasing their carboxylation capacity. Plants of both sexes had smaller stomata, greater water-use efficiency (greater delta C-13), and greater nitrogen isotopic composition (delta N-15) at higher altitudes. They also showed lower delta N-15 and had greater carbon: nitrogen ratios at lower altitudes. There was a lack of coordination between stomatal and vein traits, which was compensated for by variation in specific leaf areas. This mechanism was essential for increasing plant performance under the limiting conditions found by the species at higher altitudes.

AB  - Active zones consist of protein scaffolds that are tightly attached to the presynaptic plasma membrane. They dock and prime synaptic vesicles, couple them to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and direct neurotransmitter release toward postsynaptic receptor domains. Simultaneous RIM + ELKS ablation disrupts these scaffolds, abolishes vesicle docking, and removes active zone-targeted Munc13, but some vesicles remain releasable. To assess whether this enduring vesicular fusogenicity is mediated by non-active zone-anchored Munc13 or is Munc13-independent, we ablated Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 in addition to RIM + ELKS in mouse hippocampal neurons. The hextuple knockout synapses lacked docked vesicles, but other ultrastructural features were near-normal despite the strong genetic manipulation. Removing Munc13 in addition to RIM + ELKS impaired action potential-evoked vesicle fusion more strongly than RIM + ELKS knockout by further decreasing the releasable vesicle pool. Hence, Munc13 can support some fusogenicity without RIM and ELKS, and presynaptic recruitment of Munc13, even without active zone anchoring, suffices to generate some fusion-competent vesicles.

AB  - Knowledge of Afrotropical bat diversity is hindered by hidden diversity because of inefficient sampling techniques, limited survey effort, and taxonomic description. With 90 bat species recorded, Nigeria supports almost a third of the bat diversity known to occur in Africa, yet the country remains relatively under-sampled. Southeastern Nigeria and southwestern Cameroon are predicted to be the largest of six bat diversity hotspots in Africa, with the Cameroonian side receiving more sampling effort. This area is also recognized to support hyperdiverse mammalian assemblages and endemic species. Notwithstanding, two major protected areas on the Nigerian part of this bat diversity hotspot were hitherto not sampled, raising the likelihood of discovering new country records in these conservation priority forests. We conducted an intensive survey using harp traps and mist nets in forests of Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary and Cross River National Park (Okwangwo Division). We also recorded echolocation calls of captured individuals to create the first in-country call library. We captured 36 bat species of which 10 are new country records raising the number of bat species known from Nigeria to 100. Harp trap captures represented 99% of forest understory bats sampled with 15 out of 18 species caught exclusively in traps. Rarefaction curves of captures suggest near-complete sampling with harp traps but incomplete sampling with mist nets. Eight of the 10 new country records were captured exclusively in harp traps, demonstrating the value of contemporary techniques for frequently missed species - here referred to as methodological blind-spot diversity. We report the re-identification of two museum specimens that were previously identified as Rhinolophus hillorum (R. cf. hillorum) and Miniopterus inflatus (M. villiersi) thus, our captures of the true forms confirm the presence of both species in Nigeria for the first time. We also provide noteworthy taxonomic comments on other species. To improve the efficiency of future Afrotropical bat surveys we recommend the deployment of complementary trapping techniques in identified diversity hotspots, especially sites that have been under-sampled.

AB  - Home ranges are vitally important to an animal's behavior, survival, and reproduction. Variation in environmental conditions and landscape composition coupled with differences between sexes can influence home range structure, and understanding these differences is important for species management. Elk (Cervus canadensis Erxleben, 1777) are a widespread culturally important ungulate that has been well studied over portions of its range. Reintroduced populations in eastern North America, where conditions differ dramatically from those in the west, are comparatively understudied. Using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck movement models, we calculated season- and sex-specific home range and core areas for elk in Pennsylvania, USA. Results showed strong seasonal variation in sizes of core areas and home ranges, with summer ranges consistently smaller than other seasons. Home ranges were largely forested. However, forest cover of core areas was lower than home ranges. Proportion of open cover types was greater in core areas than home ranges. Use of timber harvests overall was low. However, among individuals with highly forested home ranges, timber harvests were strongly selected for in spring. This work highlights the regional specificity in the size, composition, and seasonality of elk home ranges, and stresses the need for additional context-specific research in understudied elk populations of forested eastern landscapes.

AB  - The present study aims to determine the seasonal change of fatty acid composition in pasture period, especially CLA (Conjugated linoleic acid), in the milk of Akkaraman ewe and Hair goat. During the pasture period, 10 Akkaraman ewe and 10 Hair goats were grazed only on pasture without additional feeding. Individual milk samples were obtained from each animal once a month from May to October. Plant samples were again obtained from the pasture once a month. The pasture period displayed effects on the CLA ratio in total milk fat acid in both species. CLA had the highest level of total milk fat acid in both species in May when pasture had the highest PUF A, especially linoleic acid (C18:2n6) and alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n3). SFA: UFA ratio reached the highest level in June for Akkaraman sheep and Hair goat. Although the atherogenic index was at the lowest level in September (P <= 0.01) in Akkaraman sheep milk, Hair goat milk had the lowest atherogenic index in May (p <= 0.001). All Delta(9) desaturase activities in Akkaraman sheep milk (14:1/14, 16:1/16 and 18:1/18) were affected by the pasture period. The findings of the present study indicated a relationship between CLA ratio in the total milk fatty acid and C18:3n3ratio in pasture.

AB  - Two leading factors that deteriorate environmental conditions and well-being are urban heat island (UHI) as a micro-climatic phenomenon and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration as the most critical greenhouse gasses. The aim of this study is to enhance outdoor thermal comfort (OTC), UHI, and CO2 concentration in a polluted and heated area with a high potential for promoting a sustainable culture. For this purpose, several sustainable solutions were evaluated, including cool roofs (CR), green roofs (GR), cool pavements (CP), vegetation greenness (VG), and total alternative (TA). Initially, the strategies were investigated individually, and later collectively in one part of the study area, and then expanded to the whole site for more assurance. The research results were extracted by ENVI-met (4.5.6) and then field measurements and another software's result, namely Element, Rhino and Grasshopper. According to the results, the VG scenario is the most effective strategy to improve OTC indices and CO2 concentration. Moreover, the CP scenario, with permeability, has the most crucial role in UHI mitigation, especially the nocturnal one; it is important to note that no study in the Middle East has been able to improve nocturnal and diurnal UHI simultaneously. Field measurements and another software's result validate our findings. Studied thermal comfort indices have the highest correlation with mean radiant temperature, followed by air temperature and CO2 concentration. Thus, this study provides a new perspective to appraise the effectiveness of CO2 concentration as an essential factor in this field and practicable solutions for designers.

AB  - AimsEnvironmental managers require reliable and cost-efficient monitoring methods for effective decision-making. Understanding forage availability is important for managing wild, vertebrate herbivore populations. We developed a process for exploring the accuracy and cost efficiency of various biomass estimation techniques for a case study where semi-arid woodland restoration is threatened by kangaroo grazing, with the aim of determining which method was most fit for purpose in a given decision context.LocationWyperfeld National Park, southeastern Australia.MethodsGrass biomass was estimated using a variety of methods, then compared to clipped biomass using linear models. Biomass estimation methods were either field-based (i.e., rising plate meter, multispectral radiometer) or satellite-based (i.e., Landsat satellite imagery, AussieGRASS forage production model). Sampling occurred across open and wooded semi-arid vegetation types. We compared methods based on accuracy, the ability of each method to accurately predict a 'forage-switch' threshold, cost, and the suitability for the management context.ResultsFor this case study, the multispectral radiometer was the most precise, yet most expensive, biomass estimation method over a single survey. However, satellite imagery proved to be the most cost-efficient and fit for purpose, as it was inexpensive and most accurately estimated biomass around a forage-switch threshold, second only to the multispectral radiometer. Accuracy of all methods was improved by including tree cover in the regression models.ConclusionsWe demonstrate a process for exploring which biomass estimation tool might be preferred for a given decision context, highlighting accuracy, consideration of tolerance to uncertainty and risk, the spatial and temporal scale of information required, and budget constraints.
   We compared the performance, cost, and suitability of multiple field and satellite-based grass biomass estimation methods. We demonstrated a process for method selection for a case study of kangaroo management for semi-arid woodland restoration in south-eastern Australia. The choice of method will ultimately depend on accuracy, cost, the scale of information required, and managers' tolerance to uncertainty and risk.image

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are widespread around the world and result in property damage, disease spillover, financial loss, and decreased tolerance of wildlife. Increasing elk (Cervus canadensis) populations and land-use changes in the western United States are challenging resource managers tasked with managing conflict. Lethal and non-lethal management actions are commonly used to remove elk from conflict zones where they are not desired. We used radio-collar location data collected from female elk in 2 study areas in Montana, USA, from 2017-2020 to evaluate population- and individual-level responses to management actions (i.e., hunting, hazing) and environmental factors (i.e., weather, season, time of day). First, we used a generalized linear model with a logit link to evaluate the effects of hunting, hazing, time period, seasonality, and weather on the proportion of collared elk that used a conflict zone. Second, we used an ordinary linear model to assess the influence of hunting, hazing, seasonality, and weather on the duration of time that individual elk remained away from conflict zones. The proportion of elk using conflict zones was reduced by hunting, modestly reduced by hazing and increasing snowpack for 1 study area, increased at night, and decreased by a seasonal trend across months. The time individual elk remained away from conflict zones increased with the number of hazing events that occurred during an event and showed a modest seasonal trend increasing across months. For 1 study area, time away increased with the number of hunting days during an event and increasing snowpack, but the increase was biologically trivial. Our results indicate mixed responses of elk to hunting and hazing actions and provide evidence that management actions can influence elk use of conflict areas. Agencies trying to reduce conflicts may want to consider a combination of hunting and hazing, while accounting for site-specific characteristics to keep elk away from conflict zones.

AB  - Weed seed biocontrol by omnivorous mice and insects can limit weed seedbanks, but this ecosystem service can be difficult to predict given the broad diet breadth of seed predators and their potential for intraguild predation. Seed foraging behavior is further modified by fluctuating cues of predation risk from higher trophic levels and the availability of refuge habitat. Uncertainty about whether co-occurring insects and mice additively contribute to weed biocontrol or interfere with each other via intraguild predation limits our ability to recommend habitat management strategies that reliably promote seed destruction. Using seed removal assays, fluorescent powder tracking, and stable isotope analyses, we assessed effects of a predation risk cue (moonlight) on mouse foraging patterns in a patchwork of vegetated and exposed plots in a cultivated field. Mouse foraging activity decreased on exposed ground during the full moon, compared to dark nights, yet foraging movements were unaffected by moon cycle within refuge patches. Weed seed consumption was more than three times higher in cover than exposed soil, and 78% of that difference was attributable to invertebrate granivores. Mice and invertebrate granivores both exhibited higher foraging activity in cover, indicating co-occurrence of intraguild predators and prey. However, stable isotope analyses of fecal samples revealed that mice captured in refuge habitats fed at slightly lower trophic levels than those in exposed habitats (suggesting minimal intraguild predation in refuge habitat), and mouse diet was unaffected by moonlight. Despite increased availability of invertebrate prey in cover patches, mice do not appear to preferentially exploit prey when avoiding their own predators or interfere with weed seed predation. Therefore, functional redundancy of mice and invertebrate seed predators in cover crops and other refuge habitats may strengthen and stabilize weed seed biocontrol.

AB  - Diverse specialised metabolites contributed to the success of vascular plants in colonising most terrestrial habitats. Understanding how distinct aspects of chemical diversity arise through heterogeneous environmental pressures can help us understand the effects of abiotic and biotic stress on plant evolution and community assembly. We examined highland and lowland willow species within a phylogenetic framework to test for trends in their chemical alpha-diversity (richness) and beta-diversity (variation among species sympatric in elevation). We show that differences in chemistry among willows growing at different elevations occur mainly through shifts in chemical beta-diversity and due to convergence or divergence among species sharing their elevation level. We also detect contrasting phylogenetic trends in concentration and alpha-diversity of metabolites in highland and lowland willow species. The resulting elevational patterns contribute to the chemical diversity of willows and suggest that variable selective pressure across ecological gradients may, more generally, underpin complex changes in plant chemistry.

AB  - Biodiversity is currently under strong pressure due to anthropogenic global change. Different drivers of global change may exert direct and indirect effects on biodiversity, and may furthermore interact with one another, but our respective knowledge is still very limited. We investigated indirect and interactive effects of two important drivers of global change, eutrophication and climate change, in replicated low- and high-altitude populations of an insect herbivore, the butterfly Lycaena tityrus, in a laboratory setting. We found local adaptation in developmental traits, with low-altitude populations being adapted to warmer temperatures and longer seasons. Lycaena tityrus responded negatively to agriculturally relevant levels of fertilization of its host plant, showing reduced body mass and prolonged development time. Negative effects were particularly pronounced at warmer temperatures and in high-altitude populations. Our study adds to the increasing knowledge that different drivers of global change may interact and thereby increase the overall level of threat to biodiversity. We suggest that populations inhabiting naturally nutrient-poor environments might be even more vulnerable to agricultural intensification than others, potentially applicable to many species. These findings may have important implications for protecting numerous vulnerable species in the face of rapid environmental change.

AB  - Echinoderms often play key roles in structuring marine ecosystems. The bat star Patiria miniata is an abundant echinoderm in the kelp forests of the northeastern Pacific coast whose trophic ecology has been understudied. Understanding the trophic role of P. miniata is important given the recent declines of many sea star populations due to wasting disease. Patiria miniata was largely unaffected by these outbreaks and could potentially fill the trophic niches left by other ecologically important sea star species. In this study, we used a combination of feeding experiments and stable isotope analysis to provide new insights into the trophic ecology of P. miniata. Given that P. miniata is considered an omnivorous generalist, we conducted a series of feeding experiments in which we quantified consumption rates for a wide range of reported prey items. Consumption rates were highest for different types of carrion, lower for sessile invertebrates, and negligible for all species of macrophytes. In a series of follow-up experiments, we found that food deprivation did not lead to demonstrable consumption of macrophytes by P. miniata, but that the presence of epiphytes significantly increased consumption rates (presumably of the epiphytes plus incidental consumption of macrophytes). Finally, we compared the isotopic niche of P. miniata with that of a carnivore (the giant sea star Pisaster giganteus), an herbivore (the purple sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), and a detritivore (the warty sea cucumber Parastichopus parvimensis) and found that P. miniata occupied the highest relative trophic level and was isotopically most similar to P. giganteus. Altogether, our results suggest that the diet of P. miniata is narrower and more carnivorous than previously expected.

AB  - 1. With increasing numbers of large grazing birds on agricultural grassland, conflict with farmers is rising. One management approach to alleviate conflict allows for- aging on dedicated agricultural land (accommodation areas) and nature reserves, combined with scaring on remaining agricultural land. Here, we examine the costeffectiveness of these measures by studying the influence on barnacle goose dis- tribution and associated economic damage.2. We present an individual/agent- based model of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) foraging on grasslands in Friesland, the Netherlands. The model is parameterized using field observations and GPS-tracks and allows simulation of management scenarios, differing in scaring probability and accommodation area size, with different potential management costs.3. Our model shows that, while yield loss decreases with higher scaring probabilities, costs of damage appraisal increase because geese graze on more fields. With small accommodation areas, achieving high scaring probabilities takes more ef- fort and could result in goose population decline. Total management costs are lowest without scaring activity.4. Synthesis and applications. Considering costs of active scaring and the need to maintain the barnacle goose population in a favourable conservation status, our model suggests that the most cost effective scenario is to prevent disturbance of geese. A high scaring probability could be beneficial if applied in small areas, for example around sensitive crops or airfields. Scaring in large areas could result in costs outweighing benefits and a declining barnacle goose population.

AB  - Knowledge on how adaptive evolution and human socio-cultural and economic interests shaped livestock genomes particularly in sub-Saharan Africa remains limited. Ethiopia is in a geographic region that has been critical in the history of African agriculture with ancient and diverse human ethnicity and bio-climatic conditions. Using 52K genome-wide data analysed in 646 individuals from 13 Ethiopian indigenous goat populations, we observed high levels of genetic variation. Although runs of homozygosity (ROH) were ubiquitous genome-wide, there were clear differences in patterns of ROH length and abundance and in effective population sizes illustrating differences in genome homozygosity, evolutionary history, and management. Phylogenetic analysis incorporating patterns of genetic differentiation and gene flow with ancestry modelling highlighted past and recent intermixing and possible two deep ancient genetic ancestries that could have been brought by humans with the first introduction of goats in Africa. We observed four strong selection signatures that were specific to Arsi-Bale and Nubian goats. These signatures overlapped genomic regions with genes associated with morphological, adaptation, reproduction and production traits due possibly to selection under environmental constraints and/or human preferences. The regions also overlapped uncharacterized genes, calling for a comprehensive annotation of the goat genome. Our results provide insights into mechanisms leading to genome variation and differentiation in sub-Saharan Africa indigenous goats.

AB  - Herbivorous fishes, and the productivity of algal turfs, are widely viewed as central to the functioning of coral reefs. This understanding is largely based on clear-water reefs. Our knowledge of herbivorous fishes and the nature of their nutritional resources on turbid reefs, by contrast, remains relatively limited. We therefore explored the nature of herbivorous fishes and the epilithic algal matrix (EAM) on turbid coral reefs across the Dampier Archipelago in northern Western Australia. We conducted comprehensive surveys of herbivorous fish abundances across natural turbidity gradients. Moreover, we quantified the trophodynamic functioning of herbivorous fishes relative to EAM structure and productivity. We revealed a clear relationship between turbidity gradients and herbivorous fish abundance, with herbivorous fishes being virtually absent from high turbidity reefs. Across the Dampier Archipelago, EAMs were typified by sediment-laden turfs with a limited propensity to deliver nutritional resources to fishes, while the productivity (i.e. the capacity for individuals to grow and produce new biomass) of herbivorous fishes was low and a fraction of that documented on clear-water reefs in the Indo-Pacific. Given the tight coupling between herbivorous fishes and their nutritional resources, these findings imply bottom-up nutrient resource limitation, which is likely due to reduced light levels and sediment-laden conditions inhibiting EAM productivity on turbid reefs. Our results suggest that EAM-based trophic pathways may be particularly unproductive on turbid reefs, with this energetic pathway playing a limited role in reef functioning compared to reefs in clear water.

AB  - Mounting evidence suggests that fishing can be a major driver of coral-to-macroalgae regime shifts on tropical reefs. In many small-scale coral reef fisheries, fishers target herbivorous fishes, which can weaken coral resilience via reduced herbivory on macroalgae that then outcompete corals. Previous models that explored the effects of harvesting herbivores revealed hysteresis in the herbivory-benthic state relationship that results in bistability of coral- and macroalgae-dominated states over some levels of fishing pressure, which has been supported by empirical evidence. However, past models have not accounted for the functional differences among herbivores or how fisher selectivity for different herbivore functional groups may alter the benthic dynamics and resilience. Here, we use a dynamic model that links differential fishing on two key herbivore functional groups to the outcome of competitive dynamics between coral and macroalgae. We show that reef state depends not only on the level of fishing but also on the types of herbivores targeted by fishers. Selectively fishing browsing herbivores that are capable of consuming mature macroalgae (e.g., unicornfish) increases precariousness of the coral state by moving the system close to the coral-to-macroalgae tipping point. By contrast, selectively harvesting grazing herbivores that are only capable of preventing macroalgae from becoming established (e.g., parrotfishes) can increase catch yields substantially more before the tipping point is reached. However, this lower precariousness with increasing fishing effort comes at the cost of increasing the range of fishing effort over which coral and macroalgae are bistable; increasing hysteresis makes a regime shift triggered by a disturbance more difficult or impractical to reverse. Our results suggest that management strategies for small-scale coral reef fisheries should consider how functional differences among harvested herbivores coupled with fisher selectivity influence benthic dynamics in light of the trade-off between tipping point precariousness and coral recovery dynamics following large disturbances.

   Maintaining minimum population sizes for local livestock breeds is a key goal in the conservation of animal genetic resources. As markets and livestock production systems have tended to favour a narrow base of high-output improved breeds, countries have had to use financial and other incentives to motivate breeders to keep local breeds. This paper explores the potential for more cost-effective alternatives to the most commonly used financial incentive, a fixed payment per animal or livestock unit. We compare the current fixed payment incentives for local breeds under the Slovenian Rural Development Programmme with those instead determined through a competitive tender approach. A stated preference survey was realised to determine the conditions under which breeders would be willing to participate in such an incentive system based on differentiated payments. Willingness to accept (WTA) payment for conservation was found to differ significantly from actual payment levels, being lower for the local sheep and goat breeds, and higher for the local pig breed. This suggests that implementation of differentiated payments would be more cost-effective; particularly when accompanied by measures to streamline administrative requirements, improve access to breeding stock and target support for local breed market valorisation (e.g., promotion of value chains based on designated quality schemes).
   Local livestock breeds in Slovenia have been eligible for financial incentives in the form of a fixed payment per livestock unit (LU) since 2002. The scheme has however not been successful in reversing the erosion of animal genetic resources (AnGR). This paper investigates an alternative, whereby incentive payments would better reflect breeders' actual opportunity costs. The paper contributes to the limited existing body of knowledge related to the use of tender mechanisms in the design of the payments for agrobiodiversity conservation schemes (PACS), particularly for AnGR. Empirical findings draw on the results of a stated preference survey involving 301 farmers in Slovenia, engaging, or being potentially able to engage, in the rearing of local pig, sheep and goat breeds. Interval and logistic regression model results suggest that willingness to accept (WTA) conservation support significantly differs from actual payment levels. The estimated WTA was found to be 27% lower for the local sheep and goat breeds and 5% higher for the local pig breed, suggesting that differentiated incentive payments would provide a more cost-effective alternative. Additional analysis of breeders' preferences and motives for engaging in local livestock breed production further informs understanding regarding AnGR conservation policy and the importance of accompanying actions to reverse negative population trends. These include reducing administrative barriers and enhancing the market valorisation of local breeds.

AB  - Scatter-hoarding small mammals act as both seed predators and seed dispersers in forest ecosystems. Their choices regarding consuming or caching seeds must balance the risk of predation with the energy rewards gained from immediate or delayed consumption of seeds. Several factors influence their interaction with seeds, including the individual's personality. Little is known about how personality affects foraging decisions in response to predation risk. This missing information is critical because if foraging decisions differ among individuals in response to perceived risk, then varying combinations of personality types in a population (and varying risks of predation across forest types) may have diverse effects on forest regeneration. Further, land-use change may influence the interplay of personality, risk perception and foraging decisions by altering the distribution of personality types in the landscape and the risk perceived by individuals. To contribute to filling these knowledge gaps, we designed a large-scale field experiment to evaluate how personality, perceived predation risk and land-use change affect the interaction of deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus and seeds. Using infrared cameras, we recorded the choices of individuals of known personality at paired experimental sites with high versus low perceived predation risk (n = 2389 observations from 74 individuals). We found that personality influenced multiple foraging decisions, and perceived risk affected how individuals with different personalities responded to those decisions. Specifically, exploration/activity influenced seed choice, boldness affected the number of seeds selected and docility influenced both foraging site selection and whether mice immediately consumed or removed seeds. Since personality only affected foraging microsite selection in unmanaged forests, our results show that land-use change decreased the importance of personality in affecting risk perception. We demonstrate the importance of considering personality on foraging decisions under varying levels of risk, and more generally, underscore the importance of considering individual variation in affecting ecological processes.

AB  - East Asian herbivorous waterfowl intensively use farmland in spring, next to their natural habitat. Accordingly, they might have expanded their migration strategy from merely tracking the green wave of newly emerging vegetation to also incorporating the availability of post-harvest agricultural seeds (here dubbed the seed wave). However, if and how waterfowl use multiple food resources to time their seasonal migration is still unknown. We test this migration strategy using 167 spring migration tracks of five East Asian herbivorous waterfowl species and mixed-effect resource selection function models. We found that all study species arrived at their core stopover sites in the Northeast China Plain after agricultural seeds became available, extended their stay after spring vegetation emerged and arrived at their breeding sites around the emergence of vegetation. At the core stopover sites, all study species used snowmelt as a cue to track seed availability, although smaller-bodied species tended to arrive later. At the breeding sites, swans tracked the onset of vegetation emergence and geese tracked the mid- or end phases of snowmelt. Our findings suggest that waterfowl track multiple resource waves to fine-tune their migration, highlighting new opportunities for conservation.

AB  - Plant species bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) may indirectly influence other plant species by sharing protective ants, potentially altering herbivory levels. However, the propagation of indirect effects in this type of mutualism has seldom been investigated. We investigated indirect effects via ant sharing among 21 EFN-bearing plant species of the tribe Bignonieae distributed on 28 plots in the central Brazilian Amazon. We used an ecological network index to quantify potential indirect effects among plant species through shared dominant and subordinate ant species. Plant species that were more attractive to ants (promoter species) had the highest potential to indirectly influence ant visitation to less attractive plant species (receptor species) in the community, primarily through changes in the attraction of dominant ant species. However, these potential indirect effects did not result in significant differences in herbivory patterns among the studied plants. Ant attendance and herbivory levels were similar among promoter species, neighbouring plants, and non-neighbouring plants. Unlike other mutualisms involving plants (e.g., pollination), the indirect effects among plant species that share protective ants had limited consequences. The low levels of herbivory and the small foraging areas of shared ant defenders could be responsible for the observed limited impact of indirect interactions among plant species in this system. Synthesis: This study demonstrates that plant species with EFNs can indirectly influence other plant species through ant sharing. The attractiveness of certain plants to ants enables them to affect the ant visitation patterns of less attractive plants in the community. However, these indirect effects did not significantly alter herbivory levels among plants. Overall, this study advances ecological understanding by showing that the sharing of protective ants among plant species can in some cases confer limited costs and benefits, leading indirect interactions to have minimal impact on herbivory patterns.

AB  - Some parasitic diseases of wild animals are transmissible to humans and cause health problems. A widespread ectoparasite of vertebrates is the deer ked, Lipoptena cervi ((L.); Diptera: Hippoboscidae). We studied the interaction of this parasite with habitat-related, host-related, and temporal factors in the Czech Republic. We analysed observations of its abundance in hunted wild animals in the context of their environment. Our results confirmed that cervids are a preferred host species. Most of the other relationships between ked abundance and the studied factors were probably due to the olfactory preferences of keds. Males and older individuals of the game host species were more attractive to the parasites for this reason. The higher abundance of keds at the beginning of the hunting season can be explained by their phenology. The deer ked can significantly affect the management of game species. We conclude that its preference for older male cervids is important for the future conditions of game animals. The population densities of deer keds in areas with high parasitization rates could thus be influenced by active game management.

AB  - Simple Summary: Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are on the rise in many European countries, triggering retaliatory killing and poisoning of wolves. Poisoning may have detrimental effects on endangered vulture species. In critical areas for vulture conservation such as the Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli Forest National Park, the conflict should be urgently evaluated. We assessed levels, trends, and defined related factors, by interviewing hunters and undertaking a diet analysis of wolf scats. Attacks affected mostly hare hunters, certain dog breeds and age classes, averaged one dog per hunter and decade, and happened under certain circumstances. Affected areas had specific landscape characteristics, fewer livestock, more hunting, and presence of wolf reproduction. Trends of wolf attacks on hunting dogs were positive and those on livestock negative. Wolves fed mainly on roe deer in summer and wild boar in winter, while the presence of dogs in scats was 5.1% in winter. Reduced dependence of wolves on livestock, as well as changes in wolf diet and hunting practices, may have predisposed wolves to kill more dogs recently. Wild boar also injured or killed hunting dogs, very often perplexing assessment of the conflict. The study concludes on practical measures for verifying and reducing hunting dog losses from wolf attacks.
   Hunting dog depredation by wolves triggers retaliatory killing, with negative impacts on wildlife conservation. In the wider area of the Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli Forest National Park, reports on such incidents have increased lately. To investigate this conflict, we interviewed 56 affected hunters, conducted wolf trophic analysis, analyzed trends for 2010-2020, applied MAXENT models for risk-map creation, and GLMs to explore factors related to depredation levels. Losses averaged approximately one dog per decade and hunter showing a positive trend, while livestock depredations showed a negative trend. Wolves preyed mainly on wild prey, with dogs consisting of 5.1% of the winter diet. Low altitude areas, with low to medium livestock availability favoring wolf prey and game species, were the riskiest. Dogs were more vulnerable during hare hunting and attacks more frequent during wolf post-weaning season or in wolf territories with reproduction. Hunter experience and group hunting reduced losses. Wolves avoided larger breeds or older dogs. Making noise or closely keeping dogs reduced attack severity. Protective dog vests, risk maps, and enhancing wolf natural prey availability are further measures to be considered, along with a proper verification system to confirm and effectively separate wolf attacks from wild boar attacks, which were also common.

AB  - Conservation and management of mobile marine species requires an understanding of how movement behaviour and space-use varies among individuals and populations, and how intra-specific differences influence exposure to anthropogenic threats. Because of their long-distance movements, broad distribution and long lifespan, whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) can encounter multiple, cumulative threats. However, we lack knowledge on how sharks at different aggregations use their habitats, and how geographic variation in anthropogenic threats influences their vulnerability to population decline. Using movement data from 111 deployments of satellite-linked tags, we examined how whale sharks at five aggregations in the Indian Ocean varied in their exposure to six anthropogenic impacts known to threaten this endangered species. Tagged sharks were detected in territorial waters of 24 countries, and international waters, with individuals travelling up to 11,401 km. Despite long-distance movements, tagged sharks from each aggregation occupied mutually exclusive areas of the Indian Ocean, where they encountered different levels of anthropogenic impacts. Sharks in the Arabian Gulf had the greatest proximity to oil and gas platforms, and encountered the warmest sea surface temperatures and highest levels of shipping, pollution and ocean acidification, while those from the Maldives and Mozambique aggregations had the highest exposure to fishing and human population impacts respectively. Our findings highlight the need for aggregation-specific conservation efforts to mitigate regional threats to whale sharks. Multinational coordination is essential for implementing these efforts beyond national jurisdictions and tackling issues of global conservation concern, including the consequences of climate change and an expanding human population.

AB  - Objectives: Dall's sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) are important herbivores in the mountainous ecosystems of northwestern North America, and recent declines in some populations have sparked concern. Our aim was to improve capabilities for fecal metabarcoding diet analysis of Dall's sheep and other herbivores by contributing new sequence data for arctic and alpine plants. This expanded reference library will provide critical reference sequence data that will facilitate metabarcoding diet analysis of Dall's sheep and thus improve understanding of plant-animal interactions in a region undergoing rapid climate change.
   Data description: We provide sequences for the chloroplast rbcL gene of 16 arctic-alpine vascular plant species that are known to comprise the diet of Dall's sheep. These sequences contribute to a growing reference library that can be used in diet studies of arctic herbivores.

AB  - Purpose Biochar and organic amendments can improve soil quality, but their combined effects on plant growth as well as soil microbial functions deserve further investigation. Materials and methods We established an 8-month field experiment to explore the effects of biochar (0, 10 t ha(-1)), organic amendments (10 t ha(-1) sheep manure and 2 t ha(-1) rapeseed cake), and their combinations on plant growth and soil quality in a Torreya grandis plantation. Results and discussion Organic amendments significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil available and total P contents as well as mineral nutrients in leaves. Biochar significantly increased soil available P and K and total K contents. Biochar combined with sheep manure rather than rapeseed cake displayed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in plant quality and soil nutrients in comparison with manure or rapeseed cake addition alone. Biochar combined with sheep manure significantly increased microbial activity (indicated by microbial substrate utilization rate) compared with manure alone treatment. In addition, organic amendments in combination with biochar generally had no significant effects on microbial diversity indices, but they had some interactive effects on some bacterial taxa, such as Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and predicted metabolism functions. Changes in soil nutrient contents were closely linked with soil bacterial community composition and improvements in plant quality.

AB  - The Eurasian beaver (Castor fiber) was an important member of Early and Mid-Holocene landscapes and animal communities in Northern Europe. Previous zooarchaeological research has established the alimentary roles of beavers for Mesolithic societies and their importance for fur procurement. In this paper, we develop an integrated biocultural approach to human-beaver interactions, examining the position of humans and beavers in Mesolithic and Early Neolithic multispecies systems. We contextualize beaver landscape agency in hydroactive environments with human behaviour, synthesizing currently available data on mammalian assemblages, ichtyofauna and beaver-related material culture across Northern Europe. This cross-cultural, diachronic analysis reveals previously overlooked facilitations of human behaviour by beaver practices and ecological legacies. We show that long-term trajectories of human-beaver cohabitation differed between northern European regions. While in Southern Scandinavia, human-beaver intersections witnessed major re-organizations during the Mid-Holocene, beavers retained a key role for human societies across Northeastern Europe throughout much of the Holocene and played an important part at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in the Dutch wetlands. Divergent pathways are also evidenced by Mesolithic beaver-related material culture, highlighting the cultural keystone status of Castor fiber in higher latitude European landscapes. We argue that this keystone status is grounded in the supply of human hunting, fishing, and gathering affordances by the animals, pointing to the generative commensality between Mesolithic foragers and their beaver neighbours. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the importance of the beaver in the making of Early and Mid-Holocene forager societies in Northern Europe and illustrate the fruitfulness of deploying an integrated multispecies approach.

AB  - Deer species can cause serious damages to trees through browsing and antler rubbing, and these impacts can generate significant economic losses. As a tool to minimize damages to trees by deer, repellents based on odor, visual and/or taste stimulus have been developed and tested. Repellents vary greatly in terms of costs, forms of use, duration, and/or the local context. Thus, selection of the most-effective repellent to each situation should consider the local environmental and socioeconomic contexts. Pyrazine analogs have been recognized to induce avoidance and fear-related behaviors in deer. These compounds are also found in ordinary and daily-use products, such as coffee, which can be easily obtained. The marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) is the largest native deer of South America. The southernmost population of this species is found in the lower Delta of the Parana River in Argentina, a large wetland highly modified due to commercial afforestation of Salicaceae. Local forestry producers usually report damage to plantations attributed to marsh deer, with a minor fraction of these producers perceiving high levels of damage and economic losses. We tested an easy-to-install repellent system based on coffee grounds by conducting trials focused on four captive marsh deer. The trials consisted in offering pellets of grain and fiber to deer, dividing the overall ration into two identical factions separated by 15 meters within the enclosure. In the "repellent site", a subset of the regular food was placed on the ground and treated with the repellent, whereas the other subset, also located in the ground but not treated, was used as the "control site". Whereas deer individuals presented alert behavior (50-100% of the times) after approaching the repellent site, this behavior was never observed at the control site. Significant differences were found among individuals probably due to a dominance interaction inside the group. The weight of food remains in the repellent site was significantly higher than in the control site at the end of the study. A repellency system based on coffee grounds could be an economic solution to be used by forestry producers of the Parana River delta or by anyone interested in diminish damages to particular resources. In addition, it is a biodegradable option with insignificant environmental impact and could be especially useful to be applied at small spatial scales, since it requires domestic materials and a relatively limited installation cost in terms of time spent to set up the system.

AB  - Sewage water in agriculture threatens human health and soil ecosystems through metal pollution.Nematodes show promise as bioindicators of soil health due to their abundance and position in soil food webs.Metal-polluted water decreased abundance of certain nematode groups and Sigma Maturity Index.Metal pollution positively affected nematode groups with r-selected life cycles.Sewage water has been inappropriately used in agriculture, posing possible threats to human health and the soil ecosystems by its constituent pollutants, especially heavy metals. Correct evaluation of its influences on soil biomes needs to consider the response of soil fauna. Among soil organisms, nematodes are seen as the best promising candidates for bioindicators of soil health. Here in, we collected soil samples from fresh water irrigated field from three sites (S1, S2 and S3) and sewage water irrigated distance gradient (5 m-40 m), to assess the influence of metal (Cu, Zn, Cd, Mn, Pb) polluted water on various characteristics of nematode communities. The results indicated that the heavy metals decreased the abundance of C-p3 nematodes, herbivores, and predatory nematodes as well as sigma maturity index, whereas, C-p1, C-p2, bacterivore and fungivore nematodes abundance and diversity positively responded to the metal pollution. Generally, nematode genera with r-selected life cycle were positively affected and those with K-selected life cycle were negatively affected by metal pollution. Overall nematode community has potential to be used as indicator of pollution stress in agricultural soils to check soil health and sustainability.

AB  - Seasonality shapes environments by driving vegetation patterns and faunal community composition, and identifying seasonality patterns in the past can provide unique insight into paleoenvironments and how they changed over time. Many environmental proxies operate on too large a time scale to glean data about intra-annual seasonality. However, serial enamel isotope samples from the teeth of high-crowned ungulates show promise for providing this temporal resolution of data. Interpreting these data remains a challenge due to the complexity of factors related to animal physiology and the isotopic values of environmental inputs. This study seeks to establish a method for interpreting intra-tooth isotopic change in modern equid teeth as a signal of seasonality by applying a linear mixed effect model to the isotope data to detect periodicity in serial enamel isotope values. Using a modern assemblage of zebra (Equus quagga) from Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, where long-term climate data has been collected, allows us to compare known climatic seasonality patterns to periodicity in the zebra tooth enamel isotopes. The results of the linear mixed effect modeling, in tandem with the climate data from Ol Pejeta, demonstrate the impact high precipitation variability can have on an environment. While our isotope results point towards measured precipitation seasonality patterns at Ol Pejeta, noise in our data and the variation identified by the models illustrate the challenges of working with serial enamel isotope data. Future refinement and application of this model will allow us to better characterize seasonality in both modern and fossil enamel datasets.

AB  - Treatment with exogenous additives during composting can help to alleviate the accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) caused by the direct application of pig manure to farmland. In addition, nano-cellulose has an excellent capacity for adsorbing pollutants. Thus, the effects of adding 300, 600, and 900 mg/kg nanocellulose to compost on the bacterial communities, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and ARGs were determined in this study. After composting, treatment with nano-cellulose significantly reduced the relative abundance of ARGs, which was lowest in the compost product with 600 mg/kg added nano-cellulose. Nano-cellulose inhibited the rebound in ARGs from the cooling period to the maturity period, and weakened the selective pressure of heavy metals on microorganisms by passivating bio-Cu. The results also showed that MGEs explained most of the changes in the abundances of ARGs, and MGEs had direct effects on ARGs. The addition of 600 mg/kg nano-cellulose reduced the abundances of bacterial genera associated with ermQ, tetG, and other genes, and the number of links (16) between ARGs and MGEs was lowest in the treatment with 600 mg/kg added nanocellulose. Therefore, adding 600 mg/kg nano-cellulose reduced the abundances of ARGs by affecting host bacteria and MGEs. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the positive effect of nano-cellulose on ARG pollution in poultry manure, where adding 600 mg/kg nano-cellulose was most effective at reducing the abundances of ARGs.

AB  - In this report, the fifth and last of our monographic series on mammalian diversity and ethnomammalogy in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluvial region of northeastern Peru, we document the local occurrence of 40 species of rodents, including 5 sciurids, 17 cricetids, 1 caviid, 1 cuniculid, 2 dasyproctids, 1 dinomyid, 2 erethizontids, and 11 echimyids. The following substantive taxonomic results, among others, are reported: (1) We discuss current issues of sciurid classification and treat all New World tree squirrels (Sciurini), except North American Tamiasciurus, as members of the genus Sciurus; the proposed subgeneric classification is monophyletic, and it conserves longstanding binomial usage for most species. (2) We describe a new species of squirrel, Sciurus ( Hadrosciurus ) pachecoi, which had previously been identified as a distinct lineage by molecular analyses. (3) We discuss the nominal taxa currently synonymized with S . (H.) pyrrhinus and comment on the application of names to phenotypes and mitochondrial haplogroups. (4) The currently accepted type locality of S . (H.) spadiceus (Cuiab & aacute;) cannot be correct; instead, documentary evidence suggests that the holotype must have been collected near Santar & eacute;m. (5) Sciurus flaviventer appears to be the only valid species of Microsciurus (sensu lato) that occurs in the Amazonian lowlands; Amazonian records of taxa previously reported in the literature as M. sabanillae and M . "species 2" appear to be based on erroneous geographic coordinates and unexplained genotype/ phenotype discordance, respectively. (6) We discuss and illustrate the diagnostic morphological characters of Nectomys apicalis and N. rattus, which have broadly overlapping distributions in northern Peru. (7) We analyze cytochrome b sequence data from 143 specimens of Oecomys from western Amazonia and summarize evidence for multiple unnamed lineages; of these, three from the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve are described as new species. (8) We question the recognition of O. tapajinus as a species distinct from O. roberti due to the lack of unambiguously diagnostic characters and the doubtful identity of the holotype of tapajinus. (9) We confirm sympatry between two species of Scolomys and provide revised diagnostic criteria for S. melanops and S. ucayalensis. (10) We report the only specimen of Dinomys branickii accompanied by definite locality data from Loreto department. (11) Proechimys quadruplicatus and P. steerei, closely related species previously thought to occur on opposite banks of the Peruvian Amazon, are both present in the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve; diagnostic characters are tabulated for the six species of Proechimys now known to occur in our region. Despite intensive and methodologically complementary faunal-sampling efforts, our rodent inventory is probably incomplete; at least four additional species could be expected to occur in our region based on geographic range data. If all four do occur there, then our inventory is about 90% complete. Documented sympatric species richness at intensively sampled sites in our region is substantially less than the regional total, but because of methodological omissions, no site is believed to have been completely inventoried for rodents. In the absence of known barriers to mammalian dispersal within the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve, however, local (sympatric) species richness is probably constrained only by habitat availability.
   Matses knowledge of rodents is richly detailed for primary game species ( Cuniculus paca and Dasyprocta fuliginosa) but is less detailed for less culturally important subsets of the fauna. As previously documented for other mammals (e.g., primates, xenarthrans, and ungulates), important game species are known by multiple names (including synonyms and hyponyms), whereas less culturally important but still salient species (e.g., squirrels) have single names, and many inconspicuous (e.g., small, nocturnal, and morphologically indistinguishable) species do not have unique identifiers. With the rodents treated in this report, the mammalian fauna of the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve is now known to include at least 201 species, but >20 additional species (mostly bats) could still be expected in the region based on geographic range data. Despite the probable incompleteness of our inventory, the Yavari-Ucayali interfluve is the only part of western Amazonia with an extensively documented mammal fauna. Therefore, the completion of this monographic series provides a unique taxonomic resource for urgently needed mammalogical research in this ecologically intact but increasingly vulnerable region.

AB  - In fish, it has been debatable whether branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) imbalance will show antagonistic effects on the growth and the concentrations of plasma or tissue BCAAs. The objective of this study were to investigate the effects of incremental levels of dietary leucine on the growth (trial 1) and potential antagonistic effects between BCAAs (trial 2) in tiger puffer. This study was composed of two separate trials. In trial 1, six experimental diets were prepared by the basal diet containing incremental levels of leucine (19.3, 24.9, 28.6, 32.6, 36.3 and 40.7 g kg(-1) of dry diet). In trial 2, five experimental diets were formulated to contain a proper amount of leucine (29.0 g kg(-1) of dry diet), a deficiency of leucine (12.6 g kg(-1) of dry diet), an excess of leucine (55.9 g kg(-1) of dry diet), an excess of isoleucine (43.2 g kg(-1) of dry diet) and an excess of valine (49.6 g kg(-1) of dry diet). All diets in two trials were fed to fish in triplicate net cages and polyethylene tanks, respectively. In trial 1, growth increase relative to initial body weight was 206.2-227.5%, while growth performance and body condition indices were not significantly affected by different levels of dietary leucine and did not show significantly linear or quadratic relationships with incremental levels of dietary leucine. In trial 2, growth performance also did not exhibit significant differences in fish fed imbalanced BCAAs diets. Compared with a proper amount of leucine group, the activities of branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase enzyme complex (BCKDH) and BCKDH kinase increased in the leucine or valine excessive diet. The expressions of amino acid transporters (BOAT1 and y(+)LAT2) and peptide transporter 1 (PepT1) were down-regulated by excessive dietary leucine, isoleucine or valine. Free valine concentration in plasma and muscle increased in the leucine deficient diet compared to a proper amount and an excess of leucine in diets. In conclusion, the growth of tiger puffer was not affected by the diets containing 12.6-55.9 g kg(-1) leucine. An excess of dietary leucine, isoleucine or valine possibly resulted in antagonism between BCAAs based on the activities of enzymes related to BCAA catabolism and the expressions of amino acid transporters, although the growth was not significantly depressed by one excessive BCAA when the other two BCAAs met the requirements for tiger puffer. In addition, plasma and muscle valine levels indicated that the antagonism of valine to leucine were observed in the leucine deficient diet, but not in the leucine excessive diet.

AB  - Supplementation with acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) during in vitro maturation significantly improves the rates of oocyte cleavage and morula and blastocyst formation in sheep and buffalo; however, the mode of action of ALC in improving oocyte competence is not completely understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ALC on proliferation, antioxidant properties, lipid droplet accu-mulation and steroid hormone secretion in yak (Bos grunniens) granulosa cells (GCs). Yak GCs were identified using FSHR immunofluorescence. The cells were treated with different concentrations of ALC, cell proliferation was detected by cell counting kit-8, and the optimal concentration and treatment time were determined for subsequent experiments. Then, reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by a DCFH-DA probe, and lipid droplet accumulation was observed by oil red O staining. Estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in the medium were detected by ELISA, and the expression of genes related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, the cell cycle, antioxidants and steroid synthesis was determined by RT-qPCR. The results showed that 1 mM ALC treatment for 48 h was the optimum treatment. It significantly increased cell viability (P < 0.05), significantly decreased the amount of ROS and lipid droplet content, and promoted P4 and E2 secretion (P < 0.05) of yak GCs. RT-qPCR results verified that GCs treated with 1 mM ALC for 48 h significantly increased the expression of genes related to anti-apoptosis and the cell cycle (BCL-2, PCNA, CCND1 and CCNB1), antioxidants (CAT, SOD2 and GPX1), and E2 and P4 secretion (StAR, CYP19A1 and HSD3B1) (P < 0.05), but it significantly decreased the expression of apoptosis genes (BAX and P53) (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALC increased the viability of yak GCs, reduced the amount of ROS and lipid droplets, increased P4 and E2 synthesis and affected the expression of related genes in yak GCs.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The runs of homozygosity (ROHs), the inbreeding coefficient, and the effective population size (Ne) in Pelibuey sheep were analyzed in 24 Pelibuey ewes from two lambs at parturition and 24 ewes that gave birth to a single lamb using the Ilumina OvineSNP50 BeadChip. The Ne decreased from 535 to 192 in the first ten generations. A total of 2194 ROHs were identified on the basis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), were identified in the prolific group and 2185 SNPs in ROH in the non-prolific group. The distribution of the lengths of the ROH, considering both groups, were found to be: 4065 less than 6 Mb, 213 between 6 and 12 Mb, 72 between 12 and 24 Mb, twenty between 24 and 48 Mb and 8 greater than 48 Mb. In prolific sheep, the ROH associated with prolificacy were identified near the LINGO2, FLRT2, ADGRB3 genes, related to "positive regulation of synapse assembly"; and the DGKG, DGKE, DGKB and DGKI genes, related to "protein kinase C-activating G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway". The present work present genes that can function as signal mediators or have activity in embryonic development, which is relevant to the economic activity of this species.

AB  - Purpose Fascioliasis is a zoonotic parasitic disease spread by genus Fasciola that causes considerable health and economic losses to both humans and livestock. Pakistan is an endemic region for fascioliasis and only a few molecular studies have been conducted to describe the etiology of disease in the country. Methods Current study involved the molecular characterization of adult fluke specimens (n = 31) through ITS-1 region of rDNA collected from four host species (sheep, goats, cattle and buffaloes) of district Sargodha. Moreover, coprology based epidemiology (n = 28620) and association of different risk factors with disease prevalence was also determined. Additionally, an overview of prevalence of fascioliasis in Pakistan, including molecular studies in the four provinces and livestock species, was also carried out. Results The phylogenetic analysis revealed that Fasciola gigantica was the main etiological agent infecting the livestock species of this region. The coprological survey revealed an overall prevalence of 30.18% among the livestock species (sheep = 32.31%, goats = 30.67%, cattle = 31.01%, buffaloes = 25.23%). It was inferred that females were slightly more susceptible to infection (32.59%) and that the older age group had higher infection rate (34.01%) in all the host species. Conclusion The current study suggests that fascioliasis is a disease of primary concern indicating its status as one of the prevalent diseases affecting livestock in this region. It was also concluded that both Fasciola gigantica and Fasciola hepatica existed among the infected animals in addition to presence of hybrid/intermediate form in Pakistan with F. gigantica as dominant species in Punjab province.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of molybdenosis on antioxidant capacity in endangered Przewalski's gazelles (Procapra przewalskii) in the animal rescue center in the Qinghai Lake National Nature Reserve in Northwestern China. Ten P. przewalskii in molybdenosis were selected and treated orally with copper sulfate (CuSO4) at a dose of 20 g/animal/5 days for 20 days. Ten healthy P. przewalskii were also selected and allocated to healthy pastures for 20 days. Samples of soil, forage, and animal tissue were collected. The values of mineral and hematological parameters were measured. Results showed levels of molybdenum (Mo) in soil and forage were significantly higher than those in healthy ranches (P < 0.01). The Mo content of blood and hair in gazelles from the rescue center was also significantly higher than those in the healthy ranches animals (P < 0.01). The copper (Cu) contents in blood and hair from the rescue center were significantly lower than those from the healthy pasture (P < 0.01). Hemoglobin (Hb) and red cell volume (PCV) in the gazelles from the animal rescue center were significantly lower than those from animals in healthy ranches (P < 0.01). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphocreatine kinase (CPK), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were significantly higher than those from gazelles in healthy ranches (P < 0.01). The antioxidant capacity in gazelles from the animal rescue center was significantly lower than that of gazelles in healthy ranches. Supplementing CuSO4 significantly decreased the Mo content of blood and cured molybdenosis in gazelles. In summary, the Mo content of soil and forage was very excessive for gazelles in the animal rescue center. The antioxidant capacity of P. przewalskii has been seriously affected by molybdenosis.

AB  - Transport is a stressor that can cause physiological and metabolic imbalances in livestock, resulting in stress-induced hyperthermia. In water buffaloes, studies regarding the thermal state of animals during mobilization are scarce. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the thermal response of 1516 water buffaloes using infrared thermography (IRT) during 15 short trips (783 animals, 60,291 records, average duration = 50.33 min +/- 5.48 min) and 14 long trips (733 animals, 56,441 records, average duration = 13.31 h +/- 47.32 min). The surface temperature was assessed in 11 regions (periocular, lacrimal caruncle, nasal, lower eyelid, auricular, frontal-parietal, pelvic limb, torso, abdominal, lumbar, and thoracic) during seven phases from pasture to post-transport. It was found that the surface temperature of the periocular, lacrimal caruncle, nasal, auricular, frontal-parietal, pelvic limb, torso, abdominal, lumbar, and thoracic regions was significantly higher during SJs (+3 degrees C) when compared to LJs (p < 0.0001). In particular, the frontal-parietal region had a significant increase of 10 degrees C during the post-transport phase (p < 0.0001) in both groups, recording the highest temperatures during this phase. Likewise, a strong positive significant correlation between the different regions was found (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001). It is worth mentioning that the herding, loading, pre-, and post-transport phases were the ones where the greatest thermal response was recorded, possibly due to the influence of human interaction. Finally, a strong positive correlation (r above 0.9, p > 0.001) between the periocular, lacrimal caruncle, pinna, and pelvic limb was found. According to the results, SJ could be considered a stressful event that hinders thermal generation, contrarily to LJ.

AB  - Sap flow, the transport of fluid in the water-conducting xylem tissues of plants, is commonly measured in studies of plant-water relationships by the heat pulse velocity method. Publications have been rare of long-term sap flow measurements for individual trees in a suburban environment. Plant-water relations in urban settings are essential for promoting urban greening where there is a perceived danger to infrastructure and buildings from planting trees in streets on clay sites. The function of residential houses built on reactive clays can be significantly impaired and walls of buildings cracked if considerable amounts of water are extracted from the soil by the root system of a tree or a group of trees in close proximity, leading to localised soil shrinkage settlement. This part of the wider study aimed to monitor sap flow of eight individual Australian native trees from two species using the heat ratio method (HRM) in the field over 12 months. The analysis of monthly sap flow volume showed a similar pattern for all monitored trees, although daily water demand varied substantially. Methods for estimating tree leaf surface area, crown shape and crown volume were investigated and the equation for calculating thermal diffusivity (k) and sap flow velocity on the basis of the HRM was reviewed. It has been proposed that k may vary substantially depending on how thermal conductivity (K) is estimated, which could lead to significant discrepancies for estimations of plant transpiration. Two K models (K-Hog and K-Van) were investigated and it was found that the impact on mean daily sap volume was negligible for the trees in this study.

AB  - Of the more than 3900 described species worldwide, stoneflies (order Plecoptera) are represented in Israel, a semi-arid country, by as few as five species. As a group of highly sensitive aquatic insects, they are restricted to the northernmost watershed of the Sea of Galilee, where the most pristine streams in Israel are found. The Israeli stoneflies are not often collected in the field, and they have not been recorded in the literature in the last 30 years. In order to provide an up-to-date picture, I gathered the available historical records of the local fauna, as well as all verified data from the last decade, and compared the two datasets. Despite the unprecedented efforts that have recently been invested in studying freshwater macroinvertebrates in Israel, a sharp decrease in stonefly occurrence is evident. Whilst the populations of three species have dramatically declined (Protonemura zernyi, Leuctra hippopus, and L. kopetdaghi), the remaining two have not been collected at all in over four decades and are considered locally extinct (Brachyptera galeata and Marthamea beraudi). These findings highlight the joint impact of multiple stressors on the stream system in the Sea of Galilee Watershed-namely, stream pollution and water diversion on the local level and climate change on the global level. If the current trends continue, there is a great concern that the entire local stonefly fauna will become extinct, and many stream-dwelling taxa may follow soon after.

AB  - In fragmented forests, edge effects can drive intraspecific variation in seedling performance that influences forest regeneration and plant composition. However, few studies have attempted to disentangle the relative biotic and abiotic drivers of intraspecific variation in seedling performance. In this study, we carried out a seedling transplant experiment with a factorial experimental design on three land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China, using four common native woody plant species. At different distances from the forest edge (2, 8, 32, 128 m), we transplanted four seedlings of each species into each of three cages: full-cage, for herbivore exclusion; half-cage, that allowed herbivore access but controlled for caging artifacts; and no-cage control. In the 576 cages, we recorded branch architecture, leaf traits, and seedling survival for each seedling before and after the experimental treatment. Overall, after one full growing season, edge-induced abiotic drivers and varied herbivory pressure led to intraspecific variation in seedling performance, including trade-offs in seedling architecture and resource-use strategies. However, responses varied across species with different life-history strategies and depended on the driver in question, such that the abiotic and biotic effects were additive across species, rather than interactive. Edge-induced abiotic variation modified seedling architecture of a shade-tolerant species, leading to more vertical rather than lateral growth at edges. Meanwhile, increased herbivory pressure resulted in a shift toward lower dry matter investment in leaves of a light-demanding species. Our results suggest that edge effects can drive rapid directional shifts in the performance and intraspecific traits of some woody plants from early ontogenetic stages, but most species in this study showed negligible phenotypic responses to edge effects. Moreover, species-specific responses suggest the importance of interspecific differences modulating the degree of trait plasticity, implying the need to incorporate individual-level responses when understanding the impact of forest fragmentation on plant communities.

AB  - Tea plantations are intensive monocultures and vulnerable to various pests due to a low diversity of natural enemies. In ancient tea plantations, the trees have grown for hundreds of years in mixed stands with many native trees, resulting in a landscape deemed as a "forest tea plantation." However, no empirical studies have explicitly examined the effects of forest tea plantations on arthropod communities. Here, we addressed the difference of arthropod assemblages and ecological networks between the forest tea plantations and monoculture tea plantations, specifically focusing on the natural enemies and insect herbivores. Our results showed that the diversity of all arthropods, insect herbivore, and their natural enemies was higher in forest tea plantations compared to the monoculture tea plantations. In contrast, monoculture tea plantations had a higher abundance of all arthropods and insect herbivores due to a sharp increase in the abundance of the pest leafhopper, Empoasca vitis. Furthermore, forest tea plantation had higher co-occurrences among natural enemies and insect herbivores than a randomized network, which suggests that natural enemies may co-occur with some specific herbivore species. These results allow us to predict that forest tea plantations enhance insect herbivore control by increasing diversity of natural enemies and network structure between natural enemies and herbivores. Our study suggests that the ecological network approach opens up new possibilities for improving our prediction and understanding of pest suppression in agroecosystems.

AB  - Studies investigating the effect of aboveground herbivory on plants often use clipping to simulate the effects of herbivores, for practical reasons. However, herbivore movements and transfer of oral secretions during herbivory may cause a different response in plant physiology and morphology compared to clipping. While studies have compared effects of real herbivory vs. clipping on biomass production, plant physiology, and shoot morphology, no study has compared such effects on root morphology. Therefore, we investigated the effect of herbivory by grasshoppers, herbivory simulated by clipping, and no herbivory on root morphological traits of ten grassland plant species. Root morphological traits were differently affected by the two herbivory treatments. Grasshopper herbivory significantly changed root morphology toward thinner roots with increased specific root length and root area, and decreased root tissue density compared to untreated control plants. Clipping had mostly similar, but weaker effects on root morphology than grasshopper herbivory. On the species level, grasshopper herbivory led to strongest changes in root morphology in almost all cases. In contrast, depending on the species, clipping resulted in varying root morphological trait values similar to grasshopper-damaged plants, or in some cases, more closely aligned with control plants. Though clipping was partly able to mimic the effects of herbivory by grasshoppers, results also indicate that, depending on the species, grasshopper herbivory had different but mostly stronger effects. We, therefore, recommend that future studies apply herbivory with real herbivores to better reflect natural responses in plants and related processes that root morphological traits mediate.

AB  - In Poland, red deer, roe deer and elk cause great damage to pine stands, and pine is the predominant forest-forming tree species in Polish forests. Pine seedlings planted adjacent to agricultural fields face heightened risk of damage from nocturnal foraging by game animals, which retreat to forested areas during the day. This damage creates openings for fungal entry, particularly by concerning plant pathogens, such as Fusarium species, which are prevalent in agricultural settings. This study aimed to analyze the mycobiome of pine seedlings damaged by forest animals, focusing on the presence of concerning pathogens in infested pine seedlings collected from ten forest plantations at various distances from rural areas. Samples of pine seedlings bitten by forest animals were taken from 10 forest plantations at different distances from rural areas. Selected diversity indices were determined to compare the fungal populations. Mycological analysis of the gnawed pine shoots using culture and qPCR methods revealed 746 fungal colonies. The most frequently isolated species were: Fusarium avenaceum, Alternaria alternata, Botrytis sp., Cladosporium cladosporioides, representatives of the genus Penicillium, Rhizopus nigricans and Fusarium oxysporum, which were found in samples from all study plots and are thus ubiquitous. Species that are typical pathogens of agricultural crops, such as Fusarium avenaceum, F. culmorum, F. poae, F. sporotrichioides and F. tricinctum, were also isolated from damaged seedling tissue in forest plantations neighbouring agricultural fields. Spearman's rank correlation analysis showed that the importance of secondary pathogens, represented by species of the genus Fusarium, decreased with increasing distance from agricultural fields, while the importance of primary pathogens increased. Younger pine seedlings exhibited lower species diversity and a higher prevalence of specific secondary pathogen species, coupled with heightened susceptibility to infection compared to older seedlings when subjected to tissue damage by forest animals. These findings underscore not only variations among plantations in proximity to agricultural fields but also suggest potential inter-land spread of fungi, emphasizing the need for integrated management strategies across agricultural and forestry domains.

AB  - Giant Panda (hereafter, panda) habitat in the Mountains of Southwest China is recognized as a global biodiversity hotspot, and protecting its habitat promotes the conservation of other endemic and threatened flora and fauna. Livestock grazing is an emerging threat to this critical habitat, and pandas have been found to retreat from areas of intensive livestock grazing. Yet the mechanism behind panda behavior is still unknown. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that livestock odor repels pandas by studying 15 captive pandas in Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan Province, China. We also examined panda behavioral responses and changes in spatial utilization to different odor sources, including feces from 2 livestock species (cattle and horse) and wild Sambar. Our results show that the odors of livestock feces suppress panda exploration of their surrounding environment, especially under cattle feces odor cues. This study sheds light on how pandas may react to livestock feces in the wild and the mechanism of reduction in habitat use by pandas, which provides foundational evidence to formulate improved management policies in panda-protected areas.
   The odors of livestock feces, particularly from cattle, significantly suppress giant pandas from exploration of their environment. This study is the first to empirically examine how livestock odor influences panda behavior through controlled experiments with captive pandas, providing key insights into the potential reasons behind the observed retreat of wild pandas from intensively grazed habitats. These findings offer critical evidence for improving livestock management in panda habitats to protect this endangered species.

AB  - The Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the tropical East Pacific is a region of interest for deep-sea mining due to its underwater deposits of polymetallic nodules containing economically important metals such as nickel, copper, and cobalt. It is also a region of extensive baseline studies aiming to describe the state of the environment, including the biodiversity of the benthic fauna. An abundant component of the abyssal plain ecosystem consists of sessile fauna which encrusts polymetallic nodules and are vulnerable to potential impacts arising from exploitation activities, particularly removal of substrate. Therefore, this fauna is often considered to have key species whose genetic connectivity should be studied to assess their ecological resilience. One such species is Abyssoprimnoa gemina Cairns, 2015, a deep-sea coral from the CCZ whose presence in the Interoceanmetal Joint Organization (IOM) claim area has been confirmed during samplings. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to obtain the 18S nuclear rRNA gene and the complete mitochondrial genome of A. gemina from IOM exploration area. The mitogenome is 18,825 bp long and encodes for 14 protein coding genes, 2 rRNAs, and a single tRNA. The two phylogeny reconstructions derived from these data confirm previous studies and display A. gemina within a highly supported cluster of seven species whose mitogenomes are all colinear and of comparable size. This study also demonstrates the suitability of NGS for DNA barcoding of the benthic megafauna of the CCZ, which could become part of the IOM protocol for the assessment of population diversity and genetic connectivity in its claim area.

AB  - The rarely encountered giant burrowing frog, Heleioporus australiacus, is distributed widely in a variety of sclerophyll forest habitats east of the Great Dividing Range in south-eastern Australia. Analyses of variation in nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial ND4 gene and thousands of nuclear gene SNPs revealed the presence of two deeply divergent lineages. Multivariate morphological comparisons show the two lineages differ in body proportions with > 91% of individuals being correctly classified in DFA. The two lineages differ in the number and size of spots on the lateral surfaces and the degree by which the cloaca is surrounded by colour patches. The mating calls are significantly different in number of pulses in the note. The presence of a F2 hybrid in the area where the distribution of the two taxa come into closest proximity leads us to assign subspecies status to the lineages, as we have not been able to assess the extent of potential genetic introgression. In our sampling, the F2 hybrid sample sits within an otherwise unsampled gap of similar to 90km between the distributions of the two lineages. The nominate northern sub-species is restricted to the Sydney Basin bioregion, while the newly recognised southern subspecies occurs from south of the Kangaroo Valley in the mid-southern coast of New South Wales to near Walhalla in central Gippsland in Victoria. The habitat of the two subspecies is remarkably similar. Adults spend large portions of their lives on the forest floor where they forage and burrow in a variety of vegetation communities. The southern subspecies occurs most commonly in dry sclerophyll forests with an open understory in the south and in open forest and heath communities with a dense understory in the north of its distribution. The northern subspecies is also found in dry open forests and heaths in association with eroded sandstone landscapes in the Sydney Basin bioregion. Males of both taxa call from both constructed burrows and open positions on small streams, differing from the five Western Australian species of Heleioporus where males call only from constructed burrows. Using the IUCN Red List process, we found that the extent of occupancy and area of occupancy along with evidence of decline for both subspecies are consistent with the criteria for Endangered (A2(c)B2(a)(b)).

AB  - Since the passage of the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971, federal agencies have been responsible for managing free-roaming equids in the United States. Over the last 20 years, management has been hampered by direct opposition from advocacy groups, budget limitations, and a decline in the public's willingness to adopt free-roaming horses (Equus caballus). As a result, free-roaming equid numbers have increased to >3 times the targeted goal of 26,785 (horses and burros [E. asinus] combined), the cumulative sum of the appropriate management levels (AML) for all 177 designated herd management areas (HMA) managed by the Bureau of Land Management. This increase is one of the causes of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) population declines, owing to habitat alteration from free-roaming equids exacerbated by ongoing drought. To evaluate potential demographic mechanisms influencing these declines, we compiled survival data from 4 studies in central Wyoming, USA, including 995 adult female (first-year breeders or older) sage-grouse during the breeding season, 1,075 nests, 372 broods, and 136 juveniles (i.e., overwinter survival for fledged young), from 2008-2022. During this period, we also obtained population information for free-roaming horses from 9 HMAs used by individual grouse in our sample. Population estimates of free-roaming horses for these HMAs ranged from 59% to 7 times of the maximum appropriate management level (AML(max)). Sage-grouse monitored outside of HMAs represented control populations and, because we assumed they were not exposed to populations of free-roaming horses, we set values of AML(max) to zero for all grouse located outside of HMAs. To evaluate whether free-roaming horses were negatively affecting sage-grouse, we modeled daily survival of breeding age females, nest, broods, and juveniles. There was strong or moderate evidence that overabundant free-roaming horses negatively affected nest, brood, and juvenile survival. When horse abundance increased from AML(max) to 3 times AML(max), survival was reduced 8.1%, 18.3%, 18.2%, and 18.2% for nests, early broods (<= 20 days after hatch), late broods (>20 days to 35 days after hatch), and juveniles, respectively. These results indicate increasing free-roaming horse numbers affected vital rates for important life stages of sage-grouse, and that maintaining free-roaming horse numbers below AMLmax would reduce negative effects to sage-grouse populations.

AB  - Plants interact with a large diversity of microbes and insects, both below and above ground. While studies have shown that belowground microbes affect the performance of plants and aboveground organisms, we lack insights into how belowground microbial communities may shape interactions between aboveground pathogens and insects. We investigated how soil microbiomes and aboveground organisms affect plant growth and development, and whether differences in soil microbiomes influence interactions between aboveground organisms. We conducted a growth-chamber experiment with oak seedlings Quercus robur growing in three soils with similar abiotic soil properties but with distinct natural soil microbiomes. Seedlings were subjected to single or dual attack by powdery mildew Erysiphe alphitoides and aphids Tuberculatus annulatus, either in the presence or absence of prior attack by a free-feeding caterpillar Phalera bucephala. Soil microbiomes were associated with differences in seedling height, and seedlings with multiple aboveground organisms had more but smaller leaves than healthy seedlings. The soil microbiome affected the severity of powdery mildew infection, and mediated the impact of co-occurring aboveground organisms on aphid population size. Our study highlights that plant performance is affected by natural soil microbiomes as well as aboveground organisms, and that natural soil microbiomes can affect interactions between pathogens and insects. These findings are important to understand species interactions in natural systems, as well as for practical applications, such as manipulation of soil microbiomes to manage agricultural pests and diseases.

AB  - Exploitation of bitumen-rich deposits in the Alberta Oil Sands Region (AOSR) by large-scale mining and processing activities has generated widespread concern about the potential for dispersal of harmful contaminants to aquatic ecosystems via fluvial and atmospheric pathways. The release of mercury has received attention because it is a potent neurotoxin for wildlife and humans. However, knowledge of baseline mercury concentration prior to disturbance is required to evaluate the extent to which oil sands development has contributed mercury to aquatic ecosystems. Here, we use stratigraphic analysis of total mercury concentration ([THg]) in radiometrically dated sediment cores from nine floodplain lakes in the AOSR and downstream Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) and two upland lakes in the PAD region to establish pre-1900 baseline [THg] and evaluate if [THg] has become enriched via fluvial and atmospheric pathways since oil sands mining and processing began in 1967. Concentrations of THg in sediment cores from the study lakes range from 0.022-0.096 mg/kg (dry wt.) and are below the Canadian interim sediment quality guidelines for freshwater (0.17 mg/kg). Results demonstrate no enrichment of [THg] above pre-1900 baseline via fluvial pathways at floodplain lakes in the AOSR or PAD. Enrichment of [THg] was detected via atmospheric pathways at upland lakes in the PAD region, but this occurred prior to oil sands development and aligns with long-range transport of emissions from coal combustion and other anthropogenic sources across the northern hemisphere recognized in many other lake sediment records. The inventory of anthropogenic [THg] in the upland lakes in the AOSR is less than at the Experimental Lakes Area of northwestern Ontario (Canada), widely regarded as a "pristine " area. The absence of enrichment of [THg] in lake sediment via fluvial pathways is a critical finding for stakeholders, and we recommend that monitoring at the floodplain lakes be used to inform stewardship as oil sands operators prepare to discharge treated oil sands process waters directly into the Athabasca River upstream of the PAD.

AB  - Many sexual weapons used in sexual combat and/or as visual displays of dominance (e.g., antlers, horns) show positive allometry with body size, but allometry in species with more than one sexual weapon is not well studied. We examined the static and evolutionary allometric relationships between body size and tusks (pure combat weapons) and/or antlers (both a visual signal and combat weapon) from thirty-three artiodactyl species including the muntjaks and tufted deer (Muntiacinae), which uniquely have both antlers and tusks. In Muntiacinae species, we found a positive static allometric relationship between antler length and skull length, whereas tusk size scaled isometrically, suggesting greater energy investment in antlers as signals over tusks as combative weapons when both are present. Evolutionarily, we found that in species with only one weapon (either solely tusked or solely antlered), their weapon scaled with positive allometry with body mass, and the relationship for antlers levels off at larger body sizes. When we included the dual-weaponed Muntiacinae species, the positive allometric trend for tusks was not conserved, resulting in an isometric relationship, suggesting the possession of antlers negatively affects the energy investment in tusks as weapons. Overall, our findings show that species that possess dual weapons invest less energy in each weapon relative to single-weaponed species.

AB  - Context Wildlife species depend on resources from agricultural ecosystems where pastoralists and farmers coexist with wildlife species. The negative interactions involving carnivores are more commonly associated with pastoralists, whereas those involving herbivores are primarily linked to farmers. Considering that most conservation efforts are currently focused on protected areas, regions where many wildlife species persist in human-dominated landscapes should also be given due consideration.Aims To decode the pattern of human-wildlife conflict and compensation in the human-dominated landscape of Marathwada, western India.Methods We examined one of the most comprehensive compensation databases of the human-dominated landscape, which contained 19,050 conflict incidents involving 15,678 individual households from 2659 different villages spread across 64,590 km2 in India. We used a negative binomial regression model to predict the conflict incidences and used these to highlight the conflict risk hotspots. Our research employed advanced regression modeling to create conflict risk prediction and compensation access maps. We observed seasonal patterns in conflict types, influenced by factors such as NDVI, distance to waterbodies, and elevation.Key results In 8 years, one human death per year was recorded, in addition to the 22.87 human injuries per year. Moreover, during that time, a total of 61.5 livestock deaths per year was confirmed. The four species with the highest estimated conflict probabilities are Panthera pardus fusca, Canis lupus pallipes, Boselaphus tragocamelus, and Sus scrofa. These species are also top-ranked for causing deaths, injuries, and crop raids. Additionally, vegetation cover emerged as a significant factor affecting human-wildlife interactions.Conclusions The increase in negative interactions is being driven by changes in vegetation cover following the seasonality of farmers' activities. Farmers must be the focus of any conflict resolution strategy because they represent the majority of the occurrences.Implications The results would help the wildlife managers to focus on the factors responsible for HWC such as farmers' seasonal activities, cropping patterns, seasons of cultivation and sowing, habits of livestock grazing, and year-round resource availability, in addition to the conflict hotspots and the conflict risk generated by the models.

AB  - Achieving state wildlife agency biological goals for deer (Odocoileus spp.) and turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) rely on high quality data collection via hunter harvest surveys. Concomitantly, better information is needed to optimize harvest survey methods. From 2017 to 2019, we surveyed North Dakota, USA, deer and fall turkey hunters using a self-administered mail survey as a control and 3 mixed-mode, internet/mail surveys to evaluate the efficacy of alternative survey designs for estimating harvest of game populations and informing future management. We measured response rates across segments of North Dakota deer and fall turkey hunters, and across mixed-mode treatments that could easily be implemented with existing wildlife agency resources. We also determined whether early survey respondents were more likely to harvest deer or turkey. Finally, we estimated the effects of demographic factors that may be associated with hunters returning survey treatment modes to further North Dakota Game and Fish Department's ability to tailor surveys to certain hunter groups. We found that internet-mail and mail-internet treatments resulted in significantly higher response rates than a traditional mail-only survey mode. We also found that hunters who successfully harvested an animal were more likely to return questionnaires shortly after the initial wave of surveying. Finally, we found that older, nonresident, and urban hunters were more likely to return questionnaires. Our research demonstrates potential use of tailored mixed-mode surveys to increase response rates.

AB  - Biological control of nutrient cycles is well documented in aquatic ecosystems, where consumer-driven recycling by herbivores can significantly impact ecosystem stoichiometry. In contrast, little is known in terrestrial ecosystems, where there is evidence that herbivores can also impact ecosystem stoichiometry. I studied a stoichiometric model of the soil-plant-herbivore system. The model shows that herbivores influence the ecosystem stoichiometry mainly through the direct and indirect controls of ecosystem inputs and losses, in a more complex way than predicted by the classic consumer-driven recycling theory. Overall, it shows that herbivores affect nutrient ratios in terrestrial ecosystems mostly independently of their own stoichiometric ratios, and that their impact may be different in forest versus grassland. The results highlight the sensitivity of terrestrial ecosystems to elusive actors, negligible in biomass but capable of modifying nutrient loss rates with major impacts on nutrient cycles and ecosystem stoichiometry.

AB  - Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) are influenced by infectious diseases. Although Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae has been the main focus of bighorn sheep managers since early 2010, other pathogens may also influence bighorn sheep populations. We sampled desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) captured for a study on the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge in southwestern Arizona, USA, 2001-2005, for a suite of pathogens: bluetongue (BT), epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), parainfluenza 3, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Clamydia, seven Leptospira serovars, bovine herpesvirus 1 (causative agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis), bovine viral diarrhea virus, and bovine respiratory syncytial virus. We recorded evidence of exposure to seven of these pathogens, with two Leptospira serovars (hardjo and bratislava), five strains of BT, and two strains of EHD detected. Seroprevalence rates of detected pathogens varied between 12-49%. We observed high levels of co-occurrence for EHD and BT. These results highlight that multiple pathogens may influence desert bighorn sheep populations. These data also provide historical context to pathogen exposure for a region where few such data are available.

AB  - Farmland habitats comprise an arrangement of cropped, uncropped and natural vegetation among the farms. Despite the differences in these habitats' features, generalist highly mobile predators are more likely to explore them in time and space.
   We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of the species of Dolichopodidae (Diptera) in organic vegetable farms because they are one of the most abundant generalist highly mobile predators in Brazilian agroecosystems.
   We simultaneously sampled the abundance of Condylostylus Bigot and Chrysotus Loew adults (both Dolichopodidae) in the crop, fallow areas, agroforests and forest fragments within five organic farms for 2 years.
   Predators preferred open-field habitats to agroforests and forest fragments. Probably, open-field habitats present more opportunities to prey foraging, resulting in higher population densities.
   To the extent that abiotic conditions become more restrictive during the dry season, agroforests and forests act as breeding sites and shelter, thereby maintaining the predators' populations in the overall farmland habitat.
   Both predatory genera occupy habitats with distinct features across time, forming a dynamic and contiguous population unit within the farm. Therefore, conservation biological control strategies in organic crops should consider the role of agroforests and forest fragments in species conservation beyond the plot level.

AB  - Rodent carcasses are a source of food and a biological hazard that can commonly be found in natural and anthropic ecosystems. Therefore, this article aims to determine which organisms consume those carcasses in an urban reserve. For this, 53 rodent carcasses were placed in front of camera traps to record their consumers. The final destiny of 41 carcasses is known: 76 % were consumed by opossums (Didelphis virginiana) and 24 % by ringtails (Bassariscus astutus). Flies and ants attempted to take advantage of the carcasses but in all cases ended up losing the competition to mammals. Opossums are the most efficient carrion consumers, as they exhibit learning as to where the carcasses are located and are able to consume old carcasses (up to 10 days old). This suggests that mid-size mammals, especially opossums, are providing an important ecological and health service for both natural ecosystems and human populations by removing rodent carcasses that otherwise could become sources of infection.

AB  - Brown bear (Ursus arctos) diet composition and seasonal food habits were examined in the Central Forest Nature Reserve (CFNR) in West-European Russia. This territory has 2 landscape types: (1) a mostly intact and strictly protected CFNR core area with southern taiga forests, and (2) a human-modified buffer zone around it. We collected 758 bear scats between March and November 2008-2021. Fleshy fruits were the most important food category in the bear diet and represented 30% of the annual estimated dietary energy content (EDEC). Among fruits, the most important food items were apples (Malus domestica; EDEC H 22%). Bears highly preferred bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) in the late summer and early fall seasons (EDEC H 9%). During the hyperphagia period, bears fed on apples, hazel nuts (Corylus avellana; EDEC H 17%), oat (Avena sativa; EDEC H 9%), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia; EDEC H 5%), and cranberry (V. microcarpum and V. oxycoccos; EDEC H 4%). Herbaceous plants were also important (EDEC H 6%) from late spring to early fall. Among insects, bears actively consumed ants (Formicidae; EDEC H 3%) and social wasps (Vespidae; EDEC H 3%). Ungulates, especially adult moose (Alces alces) and calves, comprised the most important food item for bears during spring, contributing 15% of the EDEC. The CFNR core area, which presents natural foods for bears, had a prevalence of bilberry in scat amount (Cliff's Delta = -0.20). The buffer zone had a prevalence of apples (Cliff's Delta H 0.19) and oat (Cliff's Delta = 0.14), whose distributions were associated with abandoned orchards and cultivated fields. Brown bear food habits in the CFNR are similar to those in southern and eastern Europe, with a great dietary contribution of plant materials (especially fleshy fruits and hard mast). However, at the same time, CFNR bears have a significant dietary impact associated with boreal ecosystems (high Vaccinium berry consumption and active moose hunting), which makes it similar to populations from northern Europe.

AB  - Interspecific interactions are fundamental drivers of animal space use. Yet while non-consumptive effects of predation risk on prey space use are well-known, the risk of aggressive interactions on space use of competitors is largely unknown. We apply the landscape of risk framework to competition-driven space use for the first time, with the hypothesis that less aggressive competitors may alter their behaviour to avoid areas of high competitor density. Specifically, we test how aggressive risk from territorial algal-farming damselfishes can shape the spatial distribution of herbivore fish competitors. We found that only the most aggressive damselfish had fewer competitors in their surrounding area, demonstrating that individual-level behavioural variation can shape spatial distributions. In contradiction to the landscape of risk framework, abundances of farming damselfish and other fishes were positively associated. Our results suggest that reef fishes do not simply avoid areas of high damselfish abundance, but that spatial variation in aggressive behaviour, rather than of individuals, created a competitive landscape of risk. We emphasize the importance of individual-level behaviour in identifying patterns of space use and propose expanding the landscape of risk framework to non-predatory interactions to explore cascading behavioural responses to aggressive risk.

AB  - Background The placenta of hystricomorph rodents, lagomorphs and some primates includes an unusual structure, termed a subplacenta, which essentially consists of trophoblastic cells located deep to the central implantation site within the area of decidualization. It has been suggested that the subplacenta is functionally important, although considerable controversy remains on the issue. In this context, our objective was to compare the architecture and structure of the subplacentas of different hystricomorph species, to investigate the possibility that it is active in hormone synthesis. Methods In total, the placentas of 3 capybaras (Hydrochaeris hydrochaeris), 2 pacas (Agouti paca), 5 agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina), 5 rock cavies (Kerodon rupestris) and 3 guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) at different stages of pregnancy (early, middle and near term) were used for gross and microscopic examination. This included the preparation of latex injection casts, immunohistochemistry for steroidogenic enzymes, scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Tissue steroid concentrations were also determined. Results The gross morphology and microvascular arrangement of the subplacentas were similar among the hystricomorphs studied including ultra-structural verification of cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast in all species. In guinea pigs, trophoblast cells exhibited characteristics consistent with intense metabolic and secretory activity in general. However, immuno-histochemical evidence also indicated that subplacental trophoblast expressed key steroidogenic enzymes, mainly in the chorionic villus region, consistent with tissue steroid concentrations. Conclusions The subplacentas within placentas of hystricomorph rodent species are structurally similar and, in guinea pigs, have potential for steroid hormone secretion from, at least the early stages of pregnancy.

AB  - Plastics are used in almost every aspect of modern life, ranging from construction and electronics to clothing and food packaging. Freshwater ecosystems are the ultimate destination for many pollutants, including plastic particles with diameter < 5 mm, commonly referred to as microplastics. When present in the aquatic environment, fishes actively or passively consume these microplastic particles. Studies on the natural diet of fishes can highlight and elucidate the impacts of this pollutant on aquatic ecosystems. In the study reported here, the stomachs, intestines and gills from 122 fishes (14 species) collected from the Curia & uacute; River Resort during the dry and rainy seasons were analyzed by chemical digestion with KOH to verify the presence of microplastics. The fishes were categorized by trophic guild (herbivore, carnivore, piscivore, omnivore) and collection period (dry vs. rainy). We found a total of 732 microplastics, all classified as fibers, in 96% of the fishes examined. The predominant colors of the fibers were blue (59%) and black (33%). The highest consumption of microplastics occurred during the rainy season. Among the six most abundant fish species sampled, microplastics were most common in the cichlid Geophagus (eartheaters). We also found differences between trophic guilds, with carnivores scoring highest in terms of the consumption of microplastics. We found no association between fish size and weight and the quantity of microplastic particles consumed. This study provides valuable baseline data on the ingestion of microplastics by fishes in the Curia & uacute; Resort, as well as new insights into the consumption of microplastic particles by freshwater fishes. We also compared our results to those from similar studies of fishes in aquatic environments around the world.

AB  - The endangered status of the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) calls for conservation urgency, which requires relevant ecological information targeting population patches. However, current information on wild dogs & PRIME;population estimates and ecological traits are still lacking in countries like Angola due to long periods of political unrest and vast areas which are poorly accessible to vehicles. To address this need, we assessed the overall distribution and population status of African wild dogs in Bicuar National Park, southwestern Angola. We also examined the availability of potential prey and sympatric competitors in this woodland habitat. This was achieved through Local Ecological Knowledge using semi-structured interviews to park rangers stationed at all vigilance posts, and complemented with camera trapping. Reported sightings show that wild dogs are distributed throughout Bicuar NP, with group sizes ranging from 2 to 38 individuals, including pups. Our findings confirm the presence of a resident breeding population of wild dogs, with available prey base consisting mostly of small to medium sized prey species such as duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia)/steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) and bush pig (Potamochoerus larvatus). The only large competing carnivores are the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) and leopard (Panthera pardus). Overall, results from this study add to the limited information for this species in Angola, revealing Bicuar NP as a stronghold for the conservation of this endangered canid and highlighting the need for several management actions. Furthermore, local knowledge from park rangers can provide a cost-effective approach to survey elusive species in remote regions, which could be implemented in other areas of Angola where baseline information on wild dogs or other threatened wildlife is urgently needed.

AB  - Beehives have previously been used to protect large trees from elephant impact in sub-arid savannas, thus improving the persistence of large trees as habitats for other species. This brief report aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the presence and absence of beehives as a management tool for reducing elephant-induced tree mortality. The study was conducted in three phases: Phase 1 (2015-2020) involved actively maintaining beehives on marula trees (Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra), Phase 2 (2020-2022) the systematic reduction in the number of active beehives, and Phase 3 (2022-2024) the removal of all beehives. The persistence rates of the trees with beehives were compared to those without beehives. We found that beehives significantly improved the persistence of the trees in the presence of elephants. During Phase 1, only 10% of the trees with beehives died compared to 34% of the trees with no beehives. In Phase 2, with a reduced number of active beehives, the mortality rates increased slightly for both trees with beehives and those without. However, in Phase 3, after the removal of all the beehives, the mortality rates significantly increased for all the trees monitored as part of the study. We also found that the mortality rate of the original trees with no beehives increased when beehives were removed from the study site, whilst the mortality rate of the original beehive trees without beehives in Phase 3 (8.7%) surpassed that of the 8.1% prior to the hanging of beehives. These findings highlight the effectiveness of beehives as a tree protection method against elephant impact and how beehives can improve the persistence of tree populations co-occurring with elephants.

AB  - Diverse assemblages of seed-dispersing megafauna once existed in Asian rainforests, but are now almost solely represented by elephants. Asia's rhinos persist in remnant, ecologically extinct populations and the most threatened of these is the Sumatran rhino, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis. To understand the seed dispersal role of Sumatran rhinos, we consolidated information on fruit consumption, seed dispersal, and fruit traits from a 2-month field study (Sumatra), local ecological knowledge (Peninsular Malaysia), and published and unpublished accounts. We evaluated differences between the taxa and traits of fruits dispersed by rhinos and elephants, and identified other dispersers of megafaunal-syndrome fruits that were rhino-dispersed. At least 79 plant species were dispersed by rhinos: overstorey plants (trees and climbers; 78% of species) had large, usually "mammal-colored," fruits and seeds, and were mainly drupes and berries; 61% of these were megafaunal-syndrome fruits (>4 cm wide). Understorey plants (herbs, shrubs, and small trees) had small, often capsular, fruits and seeds that are potentially dispersed following the "foliage-is-the-fruit" hypothesis. Rhinos were the only known disperser for 35% of the megafaunal-fruit genera. The highest dispersal overlap shown was with elephants: fruits dispersed by rhinos tended to be capsular and were smaller than fruits dispersed by both elephants and rhinos. Given these findings and the different foraging and ranging behavior of Sumatran rhinos and elephants, we suggest that these megafauna had important differences in their seed dispersal roles. Asian rainforests have, therefore, lost an important seed dispersal mutualist. Conservation efforts should aim to protect and restore the ecological function of these unique creatures.

AB  - Introduction: Insect herbivores and biotrophic pathogens are major stressors influencing natural regeneration in woodlands. Information on the effect of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) on plant-insect-pathogen interactions under natural conditions is lacking.Methods: We studied the effects of eCO(2) on leaf-out phenology, as well as on levels of insect herbivory and powdery mildew (PM), i.e., reduction of leaf photosynthetic material. We then assessed the combined impacts of these biotic stressors and eCO(2) on seedling photosynthesis and growth. A total of 92 naturally recruited and 114 potted seedlings of 5 temperate tree species (Quercus robur, Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, and Ilex aquifolium) within a mature oak woodland were studied.Results: We found that eCO(2) advanced leaf-out phenology and was a significant explanatory variable for growth and physiological performance in potted seedlings. Potted oak seedlings experienced 11-fold higher tissue loss from insect herbivory than natural seedlings. The earliest leaf-flushing species, hawthorn, and the evergreen holly were resistant to insect attack and were not affected by PM. Oak was defoliated most but showed the highest regeneration capacity. Hazel was more resistant to PM infection than oak and sycamore. Despite being highly infected by PM, sycamore was less affected than oak. The more vigorous sycamore and oak seedlings suffered more severe PM disease.Conclusion: No evidence emerged that eCO(2) enhances natural regeneration under biotic stress for any of the species studied.

AB  - The net benefit of indirect defence strategies to plant fitness in natural conditions is likely dependent on the ecological context. Little attention has been given to the relationship between plant-plant competition and the effect of herbivore natural enemies on plant fitness. We conducted a field experiment to compare the effects of unparasitized Pieris brassicae and caterpillars parasitized in the laboratory by the solitary parasitoid Hyposoter ebeninus on the seed production of wild Brassica nigra plants grown in different densities. We found that H. ebeninus, which reduces the feeding behaviour of its host, increased plant seed 0000-0003-4220-9075 production compared to unparasitized herbivory, but only in high plant density when competing plants are damaged by unparasitized herbivores. To further investigate this relationship, we used a three-dimensional plant model to simulate different levels of herbivory, parasitism and plant density. Synthesis. Our results suggest that plant-plant competition is a critical factor that interacts with the effectiveness of indirect defence and should be considered in future studies on the evolution of plant defence strategies.

AB  - Throughout the last century, climate change has altered the geographic distributions of many species. Insects, in particular, vary in their ability to track changing climates, and it is likely that phenology is an important determinant of how well insects can either expand or shift their geographic distributions in response to climate change. Grasshoppers are an ideal group to test the hypothesis that phenology correlates with range expansion, given that co-occurring confamilial, and even congeneric, species can differ in phenology. Here, I tested the hypothesis that early- and late-season species should possess different range expansion potentials, as estimated by habitat suitability from ecological niche models. I used nine different modeling techniques to estimate habitat suitability of six grasshopper species of varying phenology under two climate scenarios for the year 2050. My results suggest that, of the six species examined here, early-season species were more sensitive to climate change than late-season species. The three early-season species examined here might shift northward during the spring, while the modeled geographic distributions of the three late-season species were generally constant under climate change, likely because they were pre-adapted to hot and dry conditions. Phenology might therefore be a good predictor of how insect distributions might change in the future, but this hypothesis remains to be tested at a broader scale.

AB  - Human interactions with elephants are increasing throughout the African savannah elephant's range as habitat loss and modification and a growing human population continue to bring people and elephants into contact. These interactions can become negative when elephants are tempted into farmland, consume farmers' crops, or destroy water supplies, leading to human-elephant conflict. Each community coping with regular wildlife conflicts faces unique socio-ecological circumstances and constraints. Therefore, understanding the challenges within each system is a crucial step in designing customized management plans and mitigation interventions, adapted to the situation. We used a combination of survey results and participatory fuzzy-logic cognitive maps from six farming communities in south-east Kenya from previous studies, to understand the complex drivers and consequences of conflicts with elephants and how farmers conceptualize these interactions. These data informed the creation of five main strategies for mitigating the impacts of crop-raiding by elephants: deterrent methods, climate-smart agricultural techniques, alternative livelihoods, safety around elephants, and environmental stewardship. We consulted with local experts to design and deliver workshops in the six communities to present potential solutions within the strategies and to provide the content for a take-home manual. Although no single solution has emerged as the ideal way to mitigate these encounters, the workshops demonstrated a variety of approaches that can alleviate farmers' financial and safety concerns. Future work should include understanding barriers to wider acceptance of such methods and evaluating the efficacy of multifaceted approaches. Creating a customized curriculum for workshops informed by social science data can provide vital information for local people who want to co-exist alongside elephants and other wildlife.

AB  - Moose (Alces americanus) visit roadside mineral licks (RMLs; areas of roadside ditches where de-icing salts accumulate in spring) to obtain minerals that may be otherwise lacking in their diet. When moose use road corridors to access salts, they become hazards to motorists. Moose use of RMLs is dependent on season and time of day, but specific patterns of use and associated behaviours that may influence moose-vehicle collision risk are unknown. We used video-enabled camera traps, analysis of variance, and generalized additive mixed models to record, review, interpret, classify, and analyze the behaviours of adult moose between July 2012-July 2020 at five RMLs in north-central British Columbia. Monthly visitation rates to RMLs peaked in mid-summer which corresponds with the summer peak in moose-vehicle collisions in the study area. Bi-hourly visitation rates peaked at night. Vigilance and licking were the most common of many behaviours recorded. Cows with young spent the most time at RMLs, followed by bulls, then solitary cows. Proportion of time spent being vigilant peaked in May, licking peaked in June. Time spent licking was highest for bulls, followed by cows with young, then solitary cows. Research into complex and interacting factors such as traffic volume and flow, driver visibility and awareness of moose, and various methods for de-icing roads is further required to determine robust means of mitigating the risk of moose-vehicle collisions associated with RMLs.

In the past couple of decades, their recovery in the West has increased puma dispersal into the Midwest, with some individuals even traveling to the East Coast. We combined published expert opinion data and a habitat suitability index in an analysis that identified 17 areas in the Upper Midwest, Ozarks, Appalachia, and New England that could potentially host puma populations in the future. Thirteen of these were larger than 10,000 km(2) and so likely to ensure a puma population's long-term genetic health. Further, we quantified patch size, human density, livestock density, percent public land, and a sociocultural index reflecting wildlife values for comparing patches, as well as present a summary of current legislation relevant to puma management in the East. Our work may be useful in identifying suitable areas to restore pumas based not only on the quality of their biophysical habitat, but also on social values conducive to puma-human coexistence.

AB  - Southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina have a circumpolar distribution and migrate across broad geographic regions. Therefore, they can provide important insights into the responses of top predators to changes in the environment, especially those effected by climate change. For this, determining trophic interactions is key, and thus it is important to investigate the diet of all populations of M. leonina in the Southern Ocean. Limited literature exists on the diet of southern elephant seals at the Prince Edward Islands in the sub-Antarctic. During August and September 1976, the stomach contents of two juvenile male southern elephant seals were opportunistically collected at Marion Island (46(o)54'S, 37(o)51'E), and later analysed. Accumulated cephalopod beaks (n = 137) representing 18 taxa in nine decapod families were found. Onychoteuthidae was numerically the most abundant (28.7%), followed by Brachioteuthidae (21.8%), Neoteuthidae (12.6%), and Histioteuthidae (9.2%). Slosarczykovia circumantarctica (Brachioteuthidae) was the most abundant species (19.5%) followed by Batoteuthis skolops (Batoteuthidae) at 12.6%. Allometric equations using lower rostral lengths showed that the southern elephant seals ingested cephalopods with mantle length between 5.2 and 39.9 cm and weighing between 0.003 and 2.62 kg. There was only one very digested crustacean, and no recognizable fish remains in the stomach contents. The continuation of the investigation relies on examination of natural mortalities and dietary items obtained by stomach lavage of individuals, complemented by, for example, stable isotope compositions captured along the length of vibrissae and within dentinal growth layer groups of teeth as proxies for the elephant seals' trophic ecology.

AB  - This article analyzes how the "risky" mobilities of animals and viruses provoke government reactions that result in bordering processes: From 2020 onwards, German authorities erected hundreds of kilometers of fence along the Eastern border with Poland in response to the spreading of African swine fever (ASF), a highly contagious viral disease that affects both wild boars and domesticated pigs. The government's main intention behind fencing was to secure the German borderline against the unwanted border crossings of potentially infected wild boars from Poland. At this point in time, the animals were framed as a disease reservoir, while their wayward spatial movements were depicted as a biosecurity threat to the export-dependent German pig sector. Drawing on qualitative fieldwork in the state of Saxony, the article illustrates how government actors employed three techniques seeking to depoliticize the erection of veterinary fences, presenting them as an apolitical matter of concern, while withdrawing them from public scrutiny and contestation: first, re-scaling authority to the sub-national level; second, securitization; and third, disinformation. Yet, adopting a more-than-human approach to the study of borders, the article also points out how a number of human and nonhuman entities forged wayward relations that worked towards a repoliticization of the fences, while counteracting government intentions in the management and control of disease.

AB  - Wild boar Sus scrofa is increasing in numbers and extending its distribution across Europe and is difficult to control due to high reproductive potential. Dietary quality is a main determinant of wild boar population dynamics, and the extent to which they rely on human-provided food provide a key to limit their distribution. Yet, we lack data on wild boar diet from northern Europe. Here we use DNA-metabarcoding of faecal samples (n = 50) to determine wild boar diet during fall and winter in Norway. We mainly aimed to quantify the extent to which wild boar relies on natural or human-provided food sources. A secondary aim was to determine whether diet varies with individual characteristics (sex, age or weight), season (winter or fall), and between the two regions with wild boar in Norway. We found a high degree of diet variability between individuals. Individuals consuming high amounts of edible fungi consumed low amounts of plant material. The (heavier) male wild boars consumed 50% more human provided food than the (lighter) female wild boars. There was no clear effect of age, season (winter versus fall), or region on diet with the sample size available. The negative correlation between plants and fungi in each sample suggests that using multiple primers targeting different taxa can provide quantitative diet information, and points to an important role of fungi (truffles) during winter and fall. The large individual variation in diet may reflect opportunistic feeding tactics in Scandinavian boreal forests, driven by a lack of acorns and few crops. Our study has relevance for understanding limitations of wild boars at their northern distribution range in Europe, and thus also provides important information for management.

AB  - Background and aims: The restoration of forests in areas degraded by anthropic activities is an important practice in the management of mountain systems. Much research is yet needed on methods to reduce effects of herbivores and harsh environments on the establishment of planted tree saplings. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of a physical protection using polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cylinders in the plantation of two native tree species in the mountains of Central Argentina, in an area with the presence of leaf-cutting ants.
   M&M: The study species were escallonia (Escallonia cordobensis) and maiten (Maytenus boaria). The plantation site was at 1840 m asl. We used 230 seedlings per species, 100 with and 130 without a PVC protection. Outplanting was performed during the wet season in a reaswith low vegetation. We measured height, survival and herbivory every six months for two years.
   Results: For escallonia and maiten, respectively, physical protections increased biannual survival in 24 and 26%, increased height in 7.3 and 12.6 cm, and reduced herbivory by leaf-cutting ants in 30 and 51% as compared to non-protected saplings.
   Conclusions: The favorable effects of PVC protections on survival and growth could be due to the decrease in herbivory caused by leaf-cutting ants and also due to the protection against harsh abiotic conditions. We advocate for longer term studies which also aim at understanding the mechanisms underlying the improvement in seedling establishment.

AB  - Yaks adapt to extremely low temperatures, but they are more susceptible to heat stress (HS). The adaptive mechanisms with crucial plasma protein markers regulating the response to HS remain elusive. In this study, data-independent acquisition proteomics were used to evaluate the thermal adaptability under chronic HS and thermal-neutral conditions. As a result, yaks increased body temperatures and respiratory rates in response to HS. Eight differential proteins mainly related to vasodilatation were decreased by HS, but another four proteins associated with blood oxygen delivery were presented at higher levels. Complement and coagulation cascades pathway was activated by HS, and more proteins were upregulated to protect against inflammation and oxidative stress by higher levels of antioxidant proteins. It is likely that yaks react to HS with enhancement of immunomodulation, anti-oxidation, and blood oxygen delivery, which is conducive to taking appropriate environment and nutrition management strategies to get healthy and high-performing yaks in low-altitude regions during summer.

AB  - The effects of cyanobacteria biochar (CB) amendment on microbial community succession (MCS) during pig manure co-composting was evaluated. Conventional composting (T1) and different concentrations of CB co- composting were set up here (T2: 2.5% CB, T3: 5% CB, T4: 7.5% CB, T5: 10% CB, and T6: 20% CB). Core substrate indicators and microbial information were used to gain insight into microbial community succession structure (MCSS) by CB treatments. Low concentrations of CB show higher organic degradation rates (2.4% vs 2.2%; and Y = C *(1- e (- k * x) )), while high concentrations increased the content of TKN (T5: 54.40%). An innovative diversity quantization method (pan-gamma-diversity T5:42.275, T1: 40.642, and T2: 34.285) was proposed through linear simulation and integration. CB optimized Bacillus and Thermobacillus were key organic degradation genera during succession (collaborate with Caldicoprobacter) and increased the abundance of important nitrogen fixation genera Chelativorans (Day 42: minimun 4.8 times; and Day 72: minimum 1.3 times) and Longispora (Max 10.0%). The existence of bacteria Caldicoprobacter (2.0-9.3%) on mineralization process showed the synergy and co-assembly effects of CB on MCSS. Moreover, mantel test also shows the assembled and cooperation of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.

AB  - The temporal and spatial variation of a benthic brachyuran assemblage in Sao Paulo, Brazil, showing patterns possibly explainable by various environmental factors: water temperature and salinity, organic matter and sediment texture was investigated. Samples were collected near the areas with unconsolidated substrates close to Couves (CO) and Mar Virado (MV) Islands, Ubatuba coast, Sao Paulo State, over a period of two years (January 1998-December 1999). Monthly sample collections were performed using a shrimp fishing boat equipped with a double-rig trawl. Temperature and bottom water salinity were measured monthly, whereas organic matter and sediment texture was measured seasonally. Environmental variables were compared among islands, seasons, and years using Permutational Analysis of Variance (Permanova) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) analyses. Total Brachyura abundance was compared among islands, seasons, and years. For each island (CO and MV) the abundance was related to environmental variables, seasons, and years through Generalized Additive Models for Location, Scale and Shape (GAMLSS). In total, 2,109 samples were collected (1,021 in 1998 and 1,088 in 1999). The most abundant species were Hexapanopeus paulensis in CO and Callinectes ornatus in MV. The abundance of crabs was lower in CO than in MV. Such observations can be explained by the strong influence of oceanographic and continental events on CO. The reduced hydrodynamics at MV could promote fine sediment gathering and explain the homogeneous physicochemical characteristics of the area. Hence, different conditions can modulate species composition and abundance. This study provides information on the combination of modulating variables in benthic communities of brachyurans.

AB  - The rapid loss of arctic sea ice is forcing a larger proportion of the Southern Beaufort Sea polar bear (Ursus maritimus) population to spend more time on land, increasing chances of negative interactions between people and bears. In the United States, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) protects polar bears from incidental disturbance from human activities. For the remote and roadless areas of northern Alaska, USA, effective management of small aircraft activity is necessary to limit disturbance, but effects of overflights on polar bear behavior are largely unknown. During 2021 and 2022, we intentionally exposed polar bears (n = 115) to systematic aircraft activity (helicopter, fixed-wing) until we observed a disruption of behavior that qualified as a level B take response (e.g., abrupt change in activity or movement) under the MMPA. We used a Bayesian logistic regression to determine what factors influence and can be used to predict when a polar bear will exhibit a level B take response and estimate the probability of an aircraft eliciting a level B take response at different altitudes above the polar bear. Aircraft type, flight altitude, landscape (barrier islands vs. mainland), and bear behavior (active vs. inactive) upon initial aircraft encounter were all important predictors of take. Probability of take rapidly increased with a decrease in flight altitude starting at 450 m for helicopter and 300 m for fixed-wing aircraft. Active (e.g., standing, walking) polar bears on barrier-island landscapes were more likely to experience take than inactive (e.g., bedded) bears on mainland landscapes. Our findings can help with assessments and management plans by quantifying disturbance to polar bears from current and future human activity that involves aircraft use.

AB  - Seed dispersal is widely considered an important mechanism for the conservation of plant diversity. In tropical regions, over 80% of woody plant species are dispersed by vertebrates, often through the consumption of fruits. Our understanding of what drives interactions between vertebrates and fruits is limited. Through a systematic literature search, we compiled a database of fruit and seed traits and vertebrate-fruit interactions for tree and vertebrate species occurring in the Guianas, with the aim of facilitating research into seed dispersal and seed predation of tree species in the Guianas. The database was compiled by extracting data from 264 published sources. It consists of 21,082 records, of which 19,039 records contain information about 19 different fruit and seed traits belonging to 1622 different tree species. The other 2043 records contain information on vertebrate-fruit interactions between 161 vertebrate species and 464 tree species. Our analyses showed a taxonomic bias, particularly in the interaction data, toward large-bodied vertebrates, with most interactions recorded for the bearded saki (Chiropotes chiropotes), followed by the lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris). For plants we found an overrepresentation of the Sapotaceae and Moraceae families and an underrepresentation of the Rubiaceae, Myrtaceae, and Lauraceae families in the interactions.

AB  - The horse chestnut leaf miner Cameraria ohridella (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) is an invasive pest of horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum (Sapindales: Sapindaceae) and has spread through Europe since 1985. Horse chestnut leaf blotch is a fungal disease caused by Guignardia aesculi (Botryosphaeriales: Botryosphaeriaceae) that also seriously damages horse chestnut trees in Europe. The interaction between the leaf miner and the fungus has not yet been sufficiently described. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess leaf damage inflicted to horse chestnut by both C. ohridella and G. aesculi during the vegetation season and to model their interaction. The damage to leaf area was measured monthly from May to September 2013 in Ceske Budejovice, the Czech Republic using digital image analysis of sampled leaves. A simple phenomenological model describing the expected dynamics of the two species was developed. The study revealed that the damage caused by both the pests and the fungus varied significantly among sampling sites within the city. The overall leaf damage exceeded 50% in no-raking sites in August. The mathematical model indicates that infestation by C. ohridella is more affected by G. aesculi than vice versa. Guignardia aesculi is thus the superior competitor of the two species. Our findings highlight the delicate interplay between insect pests and fungal pathogens and the spatiotemporal dynamics influencing them, calling for more research in this understudied area.

AB  - Differing values between communities and government resource managers may lead to conflict, particularly when community members are not involved in decision making. Increasingly, co-management arrangements have become an important tool to increase local capacity for resource management, increase trust between diverse community groups, and foster effective stewardship. However, co-management depends upon collaboration between users and managers and the ability to understand relationships between a given resource and those who use it, even when these communities are often viewed as contravening conservation efforts. Invasive species, such as feral pigs (Sus scrofa), present particular management challenges because they damage island ecosystems but are also integral to community life ways and food systems. Based on interviews with local pig hunters in the Hawaiian Islands, we explored the social-cultural values and practices of local pig hunters, their reasons for hunting, and possibilities for greater collaboration in feral pig management. Results highlight the importance of hunting for both food and other forms of well-being and cultural perpetuation, along with opportunities for (1) expanding mechanisms of access to improve hunting opportunities for invasive species; (2) integrating rights and responsibilities to meet management objectives; and (3) improving communication to enhance collaborative arrangements. Considering the context of managing community use of an ecologically detrimental invasive species, this study offers insights to guide co-management partnerships with community groups that are sometimes perceived as opposed to invasive species control efforts.

AB  - The Gravettian site of Fuente del Salfn Cave is located in the northern Iberian Peninsula (Cantabrian Region, Spain). In 2016, excavations conducted at the site yielded numerous faunal remains, including mammals and fish. Researchers also recovered molluscs remains during the 1990, 1991, and 2000 campaigns. This study presents the results of the archaeozoological and taphonomical analyses of the large mammals and fish remains recovered during these excavations. At Fuente del Salfn Cave, a high level of bone fragmentation and the presence of burning damage characterizes the faunal assemblage. Taxonomy of large game shows diverse habitat exploitation, such as coastal valleys and plains (red deer, Cervus elaphus; horse, Equus ferus) as well as rocky landscapes (Iberian ibex, Capra pyrenaica; and chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra). Additionally, fish remains show the presence of salmonids (Salmo sp.), cyprinids, and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), indicating the exploita-tion of coastal, demersal, and riverine species. The taphonomic analysis of the mammals revealed burning damage concentrated on axial elements and epiphyses, characterized by temperatures typical of carbonization or calcification. The scarcity of carnivore gnawing marks and the presence of butchering marks prove that humans were the main accumulators at Fuente del Salfn Cave. Concerning fish, most remains correspond to spines, branchial spines, ribs, and vertebrae, indicating humans processed fish by removing these elements for con-sumption. Based on our results, Fuente del Salfn Cave provides an essential record of the subsistence strategies of the inhabitants of the Cantabrian Region during the Gravettian.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Pleurotus ostreatus spent mushroom substrate (P.SMS), which is characterized by high production but low utilization, on feed utilization and liver serum indices from the perspective of duodenal microorganisms. Forty-five 3-month-old Hu sheep were randomly assigned to five groups and fed diets in which whole-plant corn silage (WPCS) was substituted with P.SMS at levels of 0% (Con), 5% (PSMS5), 10% (PSMS10), 15% (PSMS15), or 20% (PSMS20). The results indicated that the addition of P.SMS complexly influenced the apparent digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, and crude protein, with PSMS10 showing the highest digestibility of these nutrients. P.SMS inclusion significantly affected serum alanine aminotransferase levels, with PSMS5 showing higher levels than both the Con and PSMS20 groups (p < 0.05). Importantly, the inclusion of P.SMS did not affect the richness and diversity of duodenal microorganisms. Significant differences in the phyla Verrucomicrobiota and Spirochaetota were observed between the Con and PSMS20 groups. The observed trend towards an increase in the genus Trichoderma (p = 0.057) suggests that P.SMS is susceptible to contamination by this genus, which in turn affects the structure of the intestinal flora. Furthermore, functional gene predictions indicated differences in amino acid metabolism among the groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, feeding with 10% P.SMS resulted in the highest digestibility without adversely affecting the structure of the duodenal community or liver function.

AB  - Due to their beauty and effectiveness in controlling aquarium pests, shrimps belonging to the genus Lysmata are among the most sought-after marine invertebrates by aquarists worldwide. Unfortunately, these shrimps are taken from their natural habitat to supply the ornamental market. Therefore, efforts to catalog the biodiversity of these species must be considered a priority measure for their conservation. Thus, the present study aims to survey the diversity of Lysmata along the coast of the state of Pernambuco and Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, northeastern Brazil. We collected shrimps using various techniques, which included dredging operations, the use of artificial refuge structures, and manual sampling. Also, we examined additional specimens deposited in crustacean collections. When possible, we identified the specimens through morphological, molecular, and color pattern data. Here, we synonymize L. lipkei to L. dispar and record for the first time L. bahia and L. dispar along the coast of Pernambuco, and L. moorei in Fernando de Noronha. Additionally, remarks are provided on L. intermedia and two specimens identified as Lysmata sp. collected at 80 and 102 m depth. We discuss details of why they were not assigned to a species and their similarity with congeners such as L. pederseni, L. rafa, and L. rathbunae. This study increases the number of peppermint shrimp species for the state of Pernambuco from five to eight and provides the first lysmatid record from Fernando de Noronha.

AB  - Ticks are distributed worldwide, and in South America, Brazil possesses the largest diversity of them. They are responsible for transmitting a wide range of pathogens to animals and accidentally to humans. The available data on tick species parasitizing wild animals in Parana State are limited to few reports. Accordingly, the aims of this study were to describe and map the distribution of ticks parasitizing wild animals in Parana State, southern Brazil, based on unpublished data from records of ticks deposited in two scientific collections, and tick records from previously published studies. Overall, we obtained 976 records of parasitism by ticks from 173 different species of free-ranging wild animals: 2/173 (1.2%) amphibians, 2/173 (1.2%) reptiles, 119/173 (68.8%) birds, 3/173 (1.7%) canids, 2/173 (1.2%) deer, 6/173 (3.5%) felids, 7/173 (4.0%) marsupials, 3/173 (1.7%) mustelid, 2/173 (1.2%) non-human primates, 2/173 (1.2%) procionid, 19/173 (11.0%) rodents, 2/173 (1.2%) Suine, 1/173 (0.6%) tapir, and 3/173 (1.7%) Xenarthra. A total of 6,794 ticks (1,163 males, 749 females, 428 adults of non-defined sex, 1,824 nymphs, 2,370 larvae, and 260 not identified stages) were recorded. The following tick species were recorded: Amblyomma aureolatum, Amblyomma brasiliense, Amblyomma calcaratum, Amblyomma coelebs, Amblyomma dissimile, Amblyomma dubitatum, Amblyomma fuscum, Amblyomma geayi, Amblyomma incisum, Amblyomma longirostre, Amblyomma nodosum, Amblyomma ovale, Amblyomma parkeri (some published as A. geayi), Amblyomma parvum, Amblyomma pseudoconcolor, Amblyomma rotundatum, Amblyomma sculptum (some published as Amblyomma cajennense senso lato), Amblyomma tigrinum, Amblyomma triste, Amblyomma sp., Haemaphysalis juxtakochi, Haemaphysalis sp., Ixodes auritulus, Ixodes fuscipes (some published as Ixodes aragaoi), Ixodes loricatus, Ixodes paranaensis, Ixodes schulzei, Ixodes sp., and Rhipicephalus microplus. Amblyomma aureolatum and A. longirostre were highly prevalent on wild hosts. Ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua) was the host species with the highest tick richness in Parana State, Brazil. Also, we provide the first record of the tick-host association A. fuscum on felid (Leopardus guttulus), and R. microplus on rodent (Sphiggurus villosus).

AB  - Plastic pollution and soil degradation pose substantial threats to the ecosystem. The need for a cleaner environment and a protector of degraded soil is urgently calling for a green alternative to petroleum-based plastic mulch. Here, we prepared a polysaccharide-based liquid mulch with soil amendment function by an emulsification method, which was used as a sprayable and green alternative to the petroleum-based plastic mulch and a soil remediation agent for degraded soil. Tamarind polysaccharides from tamarind industrial waste was applied as the film-forming agent and the soil particle aggregator. Additionally, Camellia saponins - the natural surfactant, and regenerated oil from waste cooking oil were added to the mulch to improve its homogeneity, mechanical property and hydrophobicity. By just adding 1% of regenerated oil to the system, the elongation at break and contact angle notably increased from 43.97% to 74.46% and 47.00 degrees-86.82 degrees, respectively; the watervapor permeability of the liquid mulch reduced from 5.63 g.mm.h(-1.)kPa(-1).m(-2) to 1.76 g.mm.h(-1).kPa(-1).m(-2). Application tests showed that the polysaccharide-based liquid mulch effectively achieved a high rate of soil resistance (90.36%) to wind erosion. Topsoil erosion caused by wind can be considerably reduced. Scanning electron microscopic characterization revealed the effect of xyloglucan on soil particle aggregation. The liquid mulch also increased the germination rate by 31.00%. Moreover, after liquid mulch degradation, the nitrogen and carbon contents of the soil increased significantly from 0.05% to 0.60% and 1.42%-13.54%, respectively, thereby substantially increasing the soil organic matter content. The developed low-cost, yield-improving liquid mulch shows promising prospects for mulches and soil amendment in agriculture.

AB  - Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii), the flagship species of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is renowned for its hardiness and resistance to low oxygen. Most of the previous studies focused on mitochondria and autosomes, with fewer studies related to the Y-chromosome. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the Y-chromosome genetic diversity, population structure, and historical dynamics of Tibetan antelope populations using 26 Y-SNP loci and 5 Y-SSR polymorphic loci. Our results revealed a nucleotide diversity of 0.00092 +/- 0.00002 and a haplotype diversity of 0.843 +/- 0.029 based on 26 Y-SNPs from 14 sequences, with a total DNA sequence length of 10,675 bp. Genotyping of 123 Tibetan antelope male samples with 5 Y-SSR loci indicated a mean observed number of alleles of 6.600, an effective number of alleles of 4.071, Shannon's Information index of 1.215, Nei's gene diversity of 0.556, and a PIC (Polymorphism Information Content) of 0.522. The population structure analysis classified all samples into three genetic populations, showing significant genetic differentiation that dates back approximately 170,000 years. However, no corresponding relationship was found between genetic populations and their geographical distribution, suggesting population convergence among Tibetan antelope populations. We inferred that population convergence facilitated genetic mixing, so that the population was able to maintain a relatively high genetic diversity after experiencing a severe hunting crisis. Given these findings, we highlight that the current model of protected areas, which are divided into administrative areas, while offering some protection, may not be optimal for the long-term conservation of Tibetan antelope populations. Therefore, we propose to establish a system of protected areas centered around protecting calving regions, ensuring that key breeding habitats are effectively safeguarded, while simultaneously fostering natural connections and gene flow among populations, thereby providing a safer, more suitable, and coherent living environment for the Tibetan antelope.

AB  - Simple Summary Wild boars and feral pigs are underinvestigated hosts for influenza A viruses (IAVs). This study confirmed and evaluated viral circulation in the Emilia-Romagna wild boar population between 2017 and 2022. Samples were collected at post mortems and screened for IAVs; 0.37% of the tested animals provided positive results. Positive samples were subtyped, isolated, and genotyped via full-genome sequencing. The results highlight the co-circulation of the same viral genotypes in overlapping years in both pigs and wild boars in the same geographical area. Considering the role of domestic and wild Sus scrofa species in the IAVs' ecology, surveillance against these viruses in the wild boar population needs to be implemented. A systematic surveillance against influenza A viruses (IAVs) in the Suidae population is essential, considering their role as IAV mixing vessels. However, the viral circulation in wild Sus scrofa species is poorly investigated in comparison to the knowledge of IAV infection dynamics in domestic pigs. This study investigated the circulation and the genetic diversity of wild boars' IAVs detected in the Emilia-Romagna region (2017-2022). A total of 4605 lung samples were screened via an M gene real-time RT-PCR for SwIAV; positive samples were subtyped by multiplex RT-PCR, and viral isolation was attempted. Isolated strains (3 out of the 17 positives) were fully sequenced to evaluate viral genotypic diversity. H1N1 was the most frequently detected subtype, with identification of H1pdm09N1 and H1avN1. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis revealed SwIAVs belonging to different genotypes, with different genetic combinations, and highlighted the simultaneous circulation of the same genotypes in both pigs and wild boars, supporting the hypothesis of SwIAV spillover events at the wildlife-livestock interface. This study represents an update on the wild boar SwIAV Italian situation, and the strains' complete genome analysis showed an evolving and interesting situation that deserves further investigation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Spatial distribution of wild boar damage risk is important and can be informative to wildlife habitat management. Hunchun is an important active area of Siberian tiger in China. The wild boar damage has brought barriers to the conservation and management of the Siberian tiger in this region. We predicted the spatial distribution of wild boar damage risk in Hunchun in terms of home range and feeding sites scales, and explored the spatial interaction between tiger habitats and the damage risk of wild boar. The results show the distance to the forest edge is an important factor affecting the wild boar damage, and 38.68% of the high-risk areas are overlapped with tiger habitats in Hunchun. Therefore, precise and differentiated management strategies should be adopted in the management of wild boar population.
   Hunchun, a typical area suffering wild boar (Sus scrofa) damage, is an important region for the Siberian Tiger (Panthera tigris) in China. By incorporating the maximum entropy model with 22 variables in the home range scale (12 variables) and in the feeding site scale (10 variables), we predicted wild boar damage risks in this area of China and analyzed how spatial factors influence damage risk. Damage risk was found to be high in areas close to the forest edge, areas with a higher forest cover and lower to medium deciduous forest proportion, low road density, and a medium river density and farmland proportion. The proportion of farmland which was identified as being in the high damage risk zone was 23.55%, of which 38.68% was within the habitat area of the Siberian Tiger. Finally, we propose wild boar damage prevention based on different management goals.

AB  - The accelerating use of plastics worldwide is of societal concern, especially as plastics fragment into smaller, micro- and nano-sized particles. Of particular importance is the effects on aquatic ecosystems since a major part of the nanoplastics eventually reach natural water systems. We identify, using replicated experimental wetlands, a tipping point where nanoplastics become detrimental to the key planktonic grazer, Daphnia. Moreover, the phytoplankton diatoms were also strongly affected by nanoplastics, whereas we detected no effects on the less efficient herbivore copepods, cyanobacteria, benthic bacterial decomposition or any bottom dwelling organisms. That some organisms and ecosystem functions, but not others, are strongly affected by nanoplastic particles predicts considerable alterations in aquatic food webs and a rewiring of feeding links. In a broader context, our study provides crucial data on the effects of nanoplastics in freshwater ecosystems, constituting urgently needed understanding for risk assessment, legislation, and management of plastic material.
   Some, but not all, freshwater organisms are detrimentally affected by the presence of nanoplastics, which is expected to lead to a rewiring of feeding links, suggest experiments in replicated wetland ecosystems.

AB  - Climate change is a primary driver of tropical mangroves colonizing temperate salt marshes in the Gulf of Mexico. Studies indicate that threshold temperatures of adult and sapling Avicennia germinans survival range from -7 to -10 degrees C and survival can depend on life history stage during a freeze event. We performed a growth chamber study to explore responses to varying freezing temperature regimes when produced at two different latitudes with varying salinity and nutrient conditions. Propagules were collected from Corpus Christi and South Padre Island, Texas. In Corpus Christi Bay, propagules were harvested from fertilized maternal shrubs (nitrogen, phosphorus, and controls) in an ongoing fertilization experiment (2017 to present). A 2-h hard freeze treatment (-8 degrees C), resulted in 20% survival across latitude and nutrient treatments. The lower latitude propagules, which were harvested from the hypersaline South Padre Island A. germinans, had higher survival rates after -2 degrees C exposure, grew significantly taller as seedlings over 20 weeks, and produced more leaves after -8 degrees C exposure. Propagules from nitrogen-treated shrubs grew taller following -2 degrees C exposure. In all treatments, propagule weight was a significant covariate predictor of seedling height and leaf production. Avicennia germinans populations may not be decimated by a single -8 degrees C freeze, and populations could possibly experience rapid recruitment from surviving propagules after a freeze, leading to local adaptation. Growth benefits from fertilized parent plants indicate that propagules from high nutrient areas may be "hotspots" of future A. germinans expansion.

AB  - Wildfire is the most impactful disturbance regime in the North American boreal region, driving the structure and composition of forests across the region. Recent climate models predict that increasing fire intensity and frequency will result in a shift from a largely coniferous forest to one with a greater dominance by deciduous species. We investigated how an iconic predator of the boreal system, the Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), moves through a range of burn scars (4-73 years old). Using GPS collars at 4-h fix rates, we fitted integrated step selection models to lynx movements across an 80-year post-fire chronosequence to assess habitat selection in both deciduous and coniferous forests. We predicted that lynx would primarily select intermediately aged spruce and young deciduous stands, mirroring previous research on the habitat selection of their main prey, snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). We found, however, that lynx habitat selection peaked at intermediately aged stands in both forest types, with selection for younger deciduous stands in the winter months. There was no seasonal change in coniferous stands as they experience little change in cover across seasons. We hypothesize that lynx select for habitats that maximize capture probability as opposed to simply habitats with the highest hare density. Together, these results show that lynx can be resilient to short-term shifts toward intermediate-aged stands. However, these benefits will likely diminish in the longer term as the decrease in fire return interval may reduce the prevalence of intermediate-aged stands.

AB  - Free-ranging domestic dogs Canis familiaris threaten wildlife species through predation, hybridization, competition for resources, and by contributing to the transmission of pathogens. The impacts of predation may be problematic, but in many regions the interactions of free-ranging dogs and wildlife are poorly studied. To determine the extent of the impacts of attacks by free-ranging dogs on Iranian mammals, we reviewed nearly 2 decades of social and traditional media reports and the scientific literature to gather data from across the country. We identified 160 free-ranging dog attacks (79 from academic articles, 14 from social media, and 67 from a variety of news websites) from 22 of the country's 31 provinces. Attacks by dogs were reported on 17 species, including nine Carnivora, six Artiodactyla, one Rodentia, and one Lagomorpha species. Most of the reported attacks on carnivores were on felids, including the Asiatic cheetah Acinonyx jubatus (n = 19), Eurasian lynx Lynx lynx (n = 18), caracal Caracal caracal (n = 10) and Pallas's cat Otocolobus manul (n = 8). Attacks on Artiodactyla were primarily reported for goitered gazelle Gazella subgutturosa (n = 47). Most of these attacks occurred within or adjacent to protected areas (n = 116, 73%), suggesting that free-ranging dogs are one of the most important human-associated threats to wildlife species even in protected landscapes. The impact of free-ranging dogs may be hampering conservation, and therefore we suggest some practical policy guidance for managing the impacts of free-ranging dogs on threatened species.

AB  - The experiment was to compare the effects of switching all-concentrate to all-roughage diets on rumen microflora and functional metabolism of yak, cattle-yak, Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle living in different altitudes. A total of 24 yaks, cattle-yaks, Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle with a similar weight and good body condition aged 3.5 years were selected and divided into four groups according to species. They were fed a concentrate diet with 40% soybean meal and 60% corn meal for the first month (C group) and a roughage diet with dry corn stalks (100%) for the second month (R group); the formal experimental period was 60 d. These results showed that the conversion had a significant effect on the rumen microflora structure of the four herds, and the biggest difference between concentrate and roughage diets was yak and cattle-yak, followed by Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes still predominate in all groups. Compared with the C groups, the relative abundance of Lentisphaerae and Kiritimatiellaeota increased in all R groups, and Lentisphaerae was significantly increased in yak and cattle-yak (p < 0.05). At the genus and species levels, Prevotella had the highest abundance, and the relative abundances of Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Sarcina and Ruminobacter in R groups were lower, while the abundances of other differential genera, including Methanobrevibacter, Fibrobacter, Treponema, Eubacterium, Butyrivibrio, Succinivibrio and Succinimonas, were all higher. Roughage diets increased the number of unique genes and functional genes encoding different CAZymes in rumen microorganisms in all four herds. In the functional contribution analysis, with the exception of ABC transporters and methane metabolism, Prevotella was the main contributor to almost all of these functions. In methane metabolism, Methanobrevibacter had the highest relative abundance, followed by Prevotella, Clostridia and Bacteroidales in all groups. Compared with Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle, yaks and cattle-yaks have better adaptability to roughage, and its utilization rate can be fully improved to reduce methane emission. The study indicates that when four herds are converted to high roughage at the later stage of feeding, the growth and reproduction of rumen microorganisms are affected, and the abundance and diversity of rumen microorganisms are increased to varying degrees. The transformation of concentrate to roughage diet can change the metabolic pathways of rumen microorganisms in yaks and finally affect the fermentation mode of rumen. The above results provide a theoretical basis for the research and development of fattening feeds for yaks, cattle-yaks, Tibetan yellow cattle and yellow cattle and the intensive feeding of livestock on the plateau.

AB  - Pastoral social-ecological systems worldwide are threatened by environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic changes. The magnitude of these threats and their impacts is higher in mountain social-ecological systems. This study analyzes how mountain pastoralists in Lotkuh Valley (Chitral, Pakistan) use their rangelands in changing social, environmental, and climatic contexts. Data were collected from a survey, focus groups, and observations through multistage stratified sampling and extensive fieldwork (2016-2019). The findings reveal that the strategy adopted by mountain pastoralists combines 7 different grazing mechanisms and stall feeding to use spatially segregated and seasonally productive rangeland resources in a sustainable manner. These seasonal mechanisms involve different types of livestock mobility, diverse fodder consumption, and grazing patterns. In winter, livestock are kept in stalls near the village. During spring, sheep and goats are taken to nearby low-lying pastures and meadows on a rotation basis. In summer, livestock and people move away from the village to settlements along a 3000 m elevational range to graze on the available pastures. Finally, in autumn, as the livestock descend, they browse intensively on stubble fields before the winter crops are planted. Furthermore, this strategy is based on the coordination of households' available labor force and pasture readiness. This study provides nuanced information on mountain pastoralists and rangeland management systems. The findings are useful for policymakers and practitioners in designing effective programs and policies to decrease the vulnerability and enhance the resilience of mountain social-ecological systems.

AB  - The gut microbiome can be one pathway by which a host rapidly acclimates and adapts to its ecological environment. Exploring how the microbiome has evolved to differ between hosts with different diets provides insights into the profound interactions between hosts and microbes within these systems. In this study, we used DNA metabarcoding techniques and macrogenomic prediction techniques to study the gut microbes of four desert rodent species with different feeding strategies in the same habitat. One species is herbivorous (Spermophilus alashanicu)s, one is granivorous (Phodopus roborovskii), another is omnivorous (Dipus sagitta), and the last (Orientallactaga sibirica) has a diet with a relatively high proportion of insects. Diets rich in plants and insects can be challenging to digest due to the abundance of indigestible fiber and stable chitin, respectively. Out of the species studied, the herbivorous Spermophilus alashanicus has the highest density of UCG-005 genes and the highest predicted abundance of genes related to digestive complexity. The composition of Phodopus roborovskii's microbiome has the highest variation between individuals, yet Phodopus roborovskii has the highest predicted abundance of genes associated with simple sugars-reflecting this species' potential adaptability to the starch within plant seeds and its constraints brought about by its smaller body size. The most insectivorous species, Orientallactaga sibirica, exhibits the highest predicted abundance of genes related to chitin degradation. This study has enhanced our understanding of the gut microbiota in the intestines of rodents as they adapt to various dietary strategies.

AB  - Coevolution between plants and their animal predators has led to diverse defensive adaptations. Multiple theories of defense propose that there are resource allocation costs associated with producing chemical defenses. One leading hypothesis, optimal defense theory (ODT), suggests that natural selection will result in the allocation of resources to defenses that optimize the cost-to-benefit ratio between defense and other functional processes. The population decline of the rare subalpine wetland species, Arizona willow (Salix arizonica), has been attributed to various biotic and abiotic factors, with browsing from wild and domestic ungulates as a significant concern for at least three decades. In a field experiment using natural populations, we compare the relationship between phytochemical defense and height in Arizona willows with and without long-term protection from browsing via browse exclosures. Consistent with the predictions of ODT, individuals with physical protection from ungulate browsing for multiple years had significantly lower phenolic glycoside (PG) concentrations and increased plant height compared to unprotected individuals. A similar pattern was found across all individuals, whereby total PG concentration and height were negatively correlated. In a short-term experiment in natural populations, changes in levels of defense were not observed when plants received protection for only one growing season. The contrasting pattern of defense plasticity in response to long-term versus short-term physical protection suggests a differential plastic response in this long-lived species. Delayed reduction in PG concentration may serve as a benefit to avoid mismatches between environmental cues and responses. Our research sheds light on the intricate dynamics between plant-defense strategies, environmental pressures, and evolutionary adaptations in shaping plant-browser interactions.

AB  - Ecological theory on predator-prey interactions and an understanding of how environmental factors affect predator dispersal and host finding is foundational to biological control of herbivorous pests in agricultural systems. However, our knowledge about the potential interaction between (A) the individual experience or conditioning of the arthropod predator based on its rearing environment and (B) the environmental conditions at the ultimate release site to control a particular pest is quite limited. We hypothesized that simplified rearing conditions present in commercial insectaries may produce predators that are less adept to navigate complex and challenging crop systems compared to those reared on target crops. We chose Phytoseiulus persimilis (Phytoseiidae) as a case study because it is an important commercialized predator of the twospotted spider mite on diverse crops worldwide. We established colonies of P. persimilis on bean (commercial rearing host plant) and strawberry (target crop plant) for over five generations and compared patterns of ambulatory dispersal when released on bean or strawberry and feeding efficiency on strawberry.<br /> Dispersal of P. persimilis was largely predicted by the presence of prey (higher dispersal when prey was absent), followed by the host on which predators were released (higher dispersal on bean compared to strawberry), and lastly by source colony (few examples of a significant difference). We found little evidence of an interaction between the two latter main effects. Rather, they were likely independent and additive. Prey consumption by P. persimilis on strawberry was higher for P. persimilis reared on strawberry compared to bean, but this did not translate into higher rates of oviposition.<br /> Synthesis and applications. This study provides insight into sources of variation in dispersal and host finding behaviour of biocontrol agents that may help to predict biocontrol success. To compensate for prey availability and host plant effects on predator dispersal and biocontrol efficacy, we suggest that release rates and strategies should be tailored to host plants given their physical characteristics and prey quality.

AB  - Wildlife capture, and the data collection associated with it, has led to major advancements in ecology that are integral to decision making pertaining to wildlife conservation. Capturing wildlife, however, can cause lethal and non-lethal risks to animals. Understanding the factors that contribute to the level of risk involved in wildlife capture is therefore important for the development and implementation of the safest and most effective methodologies. We used data from 736 animal captures of 389 individuals for 2 subspecies of female bighorn sheep (Rocky Mountain bighorn [Ovis canadensis canadensis], Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep [O. c. sierrae]) in Wyoming and California, USA, in 2002-2020 to evaluate the degree and extent of time that capture via helicopter net-gunning affects survival. We compared pre- and post-capture survival during a 10-week window centered on a capture event, and post-capture survival between captured animals and animals that were monitored but not captured during the 10-week window. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of handling techniques (number of times captured, season of capture event, handling time, chase time, and body temp) and biological factors (age and nutritional condition) on probability of capture mortality. Mean daily survival was 0.9992 during a 5-week pre-capture window, dropped to 0.9864 on the day of capture, and rebounded within 3 days of capture to pre-capture levels and that of sheep that were not captured. Overall, direct mortality resulting from capture was 1.36%, with 0.54% mortality occurring within the 3 days following a capture event for an overall 1.90% capture-related mortality. The only handling and biological metrics that influenced the probability of capture mortality were rectal temperature and nutritional condition; high initial rectal temperatures and poor body condition were associated with increased risk of mortality in the days following capture. Overall, helicopter net-gunning imposed low and short-term risk to survival of female bighorn sheep. To reduce bias in survival estimates, we recommend using a 3-day censorship window for post-capture mortalities as opposed to the common practice of a 2-5-week censor window. Helicopter net-gunning, including annual or seasonal recaptures, remains an effective and comparatively safe technique for capture and associated data collection of bighorn sheep.

AB  - The decline in insects forces the establishment of insect-friendly cultivation systems in agricultural landscapes in order to support pollinating insects and preserve ecosystem services. The study aims to clarify whether the additional cultivation of camelina in pea crops increases the diversity of wild bees and hoverflies. Abundance and diversity were considered and evaluated in camelina-pea mixed crop cultures, pea cultures and camelina cultures in three consecutive years by using standardized methods such as pan traps and visual catches. Aphid infestation, aphid predators as well as butterflies were also recorded. The comparison of pollinators shows an increase in species numbers in all three years of collection as well as in the number of individuals in 2020 and 2021 in mixed crops compared to pea crops. Calculated diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener-Index H-s and Evenness E) averaged H-s = 2.86 with E = 0.72 for mixed crops and thus higher than for pea crops, with H-s = 2.39 and E = 0.65. In camelina crops, also butterflies benefit visibly from the additional offer of flowers. The study demonstrates that additional cultivation of camelina provide necessary flowering resources, that have been shown to be used by a more diverse pollinator community, thereby supporting biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - Understanding the diel vertical migration (DVM) patterns of zooplankton has important implications for biological pumping and pelagic food webs. The functional traits of zooplankton generally determine their distribution in the environment. However, knowledge about the DVM patterns of zooplankton with different functional traits is limited. Here, we used a trait-based approach to study the vertical distributions of zooplankton in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG). Four functional traits, namely, body length, feeding type, trophic group, and reproductive mode, were selected in this study. A high biodiversity of zooplankton (165 taxa) was recorded in the NPSG. Zooplankton was mainly concentrated above 100 m and exhibited normal DVM. Zooplankton with small and medium body sizes (<2 mm, 69% +/- 16%), current feeding (43% +/- 14%), and omnivore-herbivores (54% +/- 14%) were dominant in the NPSG. The proportion of sac spawners in total abundance (52% +/- 14%) was higher than that of broadcast spawners (48% +/- 14%), which differed from that in the coastal regions. Sixteen functional groups of zooplankton were identified. Different functional groups exhibited distinct DVM patterns due to the influence of different factors. The DVM patterns of current-feeding omnivore-herbivores were significantly correlated with chlorophyll a, whereas giant ambush-feeding carnivores exhibited normal DVM patterns and were substantially correlated with the vertical distribution of their food organisms. However, the small omnivore-carnivores showed reverse DVM patterns. Overall, this study provided a new perspective for studies on zooplankton DVM from the aspect of functional traits.

AB  - Apex predators are widely threatened globally and generally considered a priority on the conservation biology agenda. The harpy eagle, Harpia harpyja, is an apex predator threatened by habitat loss and persecution and a flagship species for Neotropical conservation. We investigated the roles of social, economic and environmental factors related to livestock depredation by harpy eagles, causes of reported harpy eagle persecution by local landholders and the intent of future harpy eagle killings. We explored these issues using structured interviews with 184 local livestock owners, who had admitted killing a combined total of 181 harpy eagles. We found that livestock abundance and livestock husbandry were the best positive predictors of levels of self-reported livestock predation by harpy eagles. Domestic livestock reported to be killed by harpy eagles (192) were mainly chickens (47.9%), followed by goats (22.4%), pigs (18.2%) and sheep (8.3%), with pets representing only similar to 3% of kills. Few harpy eagle killings were related to livestock predation, which accounted for less than 20% of all eagles killed. Instead, the main reason for killing harpy eagles was simple curiosity, and many interviewees reported later regretting their acts. Regarding intent to kill harpy eagles in the future, interviewees' perceptions of the threat posed to livestock and humans by eagles, and the subjective norm, were unrelated to intent to kill harpy eagles further. The single most important factor in predicting intent to kill harpy eagles was whether the interviewee had suffered livestock predation by eagles in the past. Additionally, the intention to kill eagles was negatively associated with landholding size. Most of our interviewees were relatively large landowners, but they are typically outnumbered by smallholders who are more likely to persecute harpy eagles. Consequently, education, compensation and tourism activities should be directed to smallholders to mitigate unnecessary persecution and mortality of harpy eagles.

AB  - The control of medically important container-inhabiting mosquitoes is an ongoing challenge for mosquito control operations. Truck-mounted application equipment is a common option for rapid areawide larvicide deployment utilized by mosquito control operations. We tested the effectiveness of two truck-mounted sprayers (A1 Super Duty + Buffalo Turbine CSM3), for the deployment of water-dispersible biopesticides (VectoBac WDG:VectoLex WDG 50:50). Sixty residences within four residential neighborhoods in New Jersey were treated in 2019 and 2020. Three empty bioassay cups were placed in specific locations on each property (front yard/ back yard/ side of house), with an additional cup placed in an adjacent catch basin. This approach was replicated in two untreated control neighborhoods. Following larvicide application, cups were subjected to bioassays wherein larval mortality was tracked through adult eclosion. Overall, average larval mortality rates were 56% higher in treated cups compared against untreated controls. Mortality rates were affected by cup location, with 39% mortality in bioassay cups from back yards, 54% in those from the sides of houses, 73% in front yards, and 76% from cups in catch basins. Mortality did not differ significantly between the four treated neighborhoods, nor by the type of sprayer used. Our research shows that truck-mounted sprayers can be an effective method for larvicide deployment in residential neighborhoods, but effectiveness may depend upon the location of the target treatment area in relation to residences and other geographic obstacles.

AB  - Identifying, protecting, and restoring habitats for declining wildlife populations is foundational to conservation and recovery planning for any species at risk of decline. Resource selection analysis is a key tool to assess habitat and prescribe management actions. Yet, it can be challenging to map suitable resource conditions across a wide range of ecological contexts and use the resulting models to identify effective and universal habitat improvement actions. We developed a management-centric modeling approach that sought to balance the need to evaluate the consistency of key habitat conditions and improvement actions across multiple, distinct populations, while allowing context-specific environmental variables and spatial scales to nuance selection responses that form the basis of location-specific management prescriptions. To demonstrate this approach, we developed a set of habitat selection models for Gunnison sage-grouse (Centrocercus minimus), a threatened species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Conservation, species recovery, and habitat management efforts are needed in six isolated satellite populations (San Miguel, Crawford, Pinon Mesa, Dove Creek, Cerro Summit-Cimarron-Sims, and Poncha Pass) where environmental conditions differ, and the already small number of birds are declining. We used multi-scale and seasonal resource selection analyses to quantify relationships between environmental conditions and sites used by animals. All models included key habitat variables often altered through management actions to assess their differential influences across models. We found important similarities and differences among satellites, indicating that, although some rules of thumb are generally well-grounded, the consideration of population-specific environmental differences could increase the efficiency of local habitat improvement actions. Sagegrouse also had diverse responses to resource conditions at different scales, indicating that regional spatial (e.g., landscape) and local patch scale can differentially influence expected habitat improvements associated with where such management actions are implemented. Although context variables such as topography cannot be manipulated, sage-grouse associations revealed information that could guide the siting of improvement actions. This approach to balancing management objectives associated with habitat assessment may benefit spatially-structured populations with different environmental contexts and species with complex habitat needs and associations.

AB  - Several insects, including the wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Norton, Hymenoptera: Cephidae), interfere with biomass and grain production of triticale (xTriticosecale). We conducted a 2-year study in southern Alberta to compare the cultivars Pronghorn and AC Ultima at 200 and 400 seeds/m(2) in terms of wheat stem sawfly damage and incidence of a parasitoid wasp (Bracon cephi Gahan, Hymenoptera: Braconidae). Plants of AC Ultima seeded at the high rate were on average less damaged than those of Pronghorn, and had more parasitoids. AC Ultima was characterized by more solid pith development in the lumen, compared with Pronghorn, and it can be considered adequate germplasm for the development of more resistant solid triticale cultivars.

AB  - Wild pigs are an invasive species that can cause considerable damage, estimated at 1.5 billion USD. We examined the relationships among agricultural producers' positive/negative beliefs about wild pigs, their perceived risks associated with wild pigs, and their acceptability of lethal management actions. Data were obtained from a mail survey of Illinois agricultural producers (n = 3,035, response rate = 58%). Variables included six belief statements, 10 perceived risk statements, and four statements regarding the acceptability of lethal management actions for controlling the impacts of wild pigs. Findings supported the notion that perceived risks associated with wild pigs are related to negative (Hypothesis 1) and positive (Hypothesis 2) beliefs about pigs, as well as acceptability of lethal management actions (Hypothesis 3) to control the impacts of wild pigs. In addition, negative beliefs (Hypothesis 4) and positive beliefs (Hypothesis 5) were related to support for lethal control.

AB  - The bat fauna of Australia comprises some 25% of all terrestrial species, yet we know very little of the demography, dispersal, and movement dynamics of most bat species. The Pilbara leaf-nosed bat (Rhinonicteris aurantia Pilbara form) is a threatened microbat that roosts exclusively in caves that occur in mineral rich deposits in the Pilbara region. Due to their specific roost microclimate requirements these bats cannot survive for long without a suitable roost and are sensitive to roost disturbance. Understanding the connectivity of roosts throughout the Pilbara is crucial for informed decisions to mitigate potential impacts to persistence of this species in areas under economic development. Along with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers, we used reduced representation genomic sequencing of over 150 individuals from eight roost sites throughout the Pilbara and tested for landscape-scale population differentiation associated with the two major subregions - the Hamersley and Chichester, as well as finer-scale among roost variation. We found evidence of high rates of dispersal and low population structure within the Pilbara, indicating one panmictic population, with mtDNA results suggesting evidence of some female philopatry. Our results highlight the ongoing need for detailed genetic studies to provide critical insight to species dispersal, particularly in multi-use landscapes. We discuss the importance of identifying and retaining connectivity of key habitat to maintain genetic diversity and gene flow throughout panmictic populations.

AB  - Simple Summary The yak is the primary income source for millions of people in remote areas of western China and other parts of Asia, providing a basic subsistence commodity for herdsmen. Yaks depend on natural grazing, but the grass trace elements may be insufficient for the yaks' requirements. Our prior research demonstrated that the levels and sources of copper, manganese, and iodine could influence in vitro rumen fermentation for yaks. The aim of this study was to optimize yak feeding standards by examining the impact of diets containing different levels of copper, manganese, and iodine on yak growth. Results showed that diets containing 15.00 mg/kg of copper, 50.00 mg/kg of manganese, and 0.50 mg/kg of iodine had the most positive effect on the growth of growing yaks. Our study will facilitate yak diet formulation design and promote yaks' industry development.Abstract Copper, manganese, and iodine are part of a yak's required trace elements. However, knowledge about their dietary requirements is scarce. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to evaluate rumen fermentation, blood parameters, and growth performance and screen out the optimum levels of trace elements in yaks' diet. Here, 18 three-year-old castrated yaks were randomly divided into four groups, which fed with diets containing basal (CON: 4.40, 33.82, and 0 mg/kg) and low-level (LL: 10.00, 40.00, and 0.30 mg/kg), middle-level (ML: 15.00, 50.00, and 0.50 mg/kg), and high-level (HL: 20.00, 60.00, and 0.70 mg/kg) copper, manganese, and iodine for 30 days. With the increase in trace elements, yaks' daily weight gain (DWG), rumen pH, ammonia nitrogen, microbial protein (MCP), and volatile fatty acids levels and serum triglycerides and urea nitrogen levels showed firstly increasing and then decreasing trends and reached the highest values in ML, and serum ceruloplasmin and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activities showed continuously increasing trends. Yaks' DWG, rumen MCP, butyrate, and valerate levels and serum triglycerides, urea nitrogen, ceruloplasmin, and T-SOD levels in ML were significantly higher than CON. Therefore, the recommended levels of copper, manganese, and iodine in growing yaks' diet are 15.00, 50.00, and 0.50 mg/kg (ML), respectively.

AB  - Indigenous knowledge is central to understanding environment and health sciences in the Arctic, yet limited research in these fields has explored the human-animal-environment interface from the unique perspectives of Inuit women. Using a community-led, Inuit-centred research approach, we characterized the use and meaning of country food in the context of community well-being for Inuit women in Nunavut, Canada. In-depth conversational interviews and focus groups (n = 16) were held with Inuit women (n = 10) who are knowledge holders in the Qikiqtani region that hold decades of country food knowledge. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis and constant comparative methods. Inuit women described country food in the context of (1) well-being, connection, and identity, (2) hunger, craving, and healing, (3) food security and nourishment, and (4) change and adaptation. Inuit women described a wide range of country food as central to physical and mental health, food security, identity, culture, healing and medicine. Adaptive strategies were discussed, such as eating more fish when caribou were scarce. This research highlights the critical role of country food for health and well-being for Inuit women and shares knowledgeand perspective that is relevant to wildlfe and environment researchers, public health practitioners, policy makers, and others interested in advancing health, well-being, and food sovereignty in Inuit communities.

AB  - Bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus eurycerus) are rare, mostly nocturnal forest antelopes in tropical Africa that are prized by trophy hunters for their large size, curved horns, and colorful pelage. Estimating bongo population size is difficult because of their low densities and forested habitat, and therefore management decisions have not previously been based on realistic models of population dynamics. In this study, we estimate bongo density and population size in a safari hunting concession in northern Republic of Congo using spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) models based on camera trap data. The SECR bongo population estimates were used to model population dynamics under different scenarios of regulated and unregulated harvest and catastrophic natural events. Bongo density in the safari hunting concession was 8.77 bongo 100 km-2 (4.78-15.58). Vortex modelling showed that trophy hunting quotas granted previously would, if achieved, have led to rapid local extinction of bongo. As a result of this study, quotas were reduced to three bongo per year, which is only sustainable if current optimal conditions are maintained.

AB  - Invasive species are widely implicated in the decline of songbird populations, potentially via indirect effects such as the restructuring of ecological communities by non-native plants. We used stable isotope analysis to investigate whether ground foraging, generalist insectivore ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla (Linnaeus, 1766)) shifted diets following invasion by a non-native shrub, Japanese barberry (Berberis thunbergii DC.), in a temperate woodland system in New York, USA where barberry was previously linked to trophic downgrading in the leaf litter arthropod community. Assimilated ovenbird diets were primarily composed of predatory invertebrates followed by sucking herbivores, chewing herbivores, and detritivores. The only notable changes in assimilated ovenbird diets were a modest 14.7% decrease in chewing herbivore contributions and a minor 7.0% increase in sucking herbivore contributions in forest patches with high barberry densities. Our results indicate that the effects of non-native plants on connections between higher trophic levels are context-dependent, and comparisons with other studies suggest that community complexity and time since introduction are key contextual differences that affect the outcome of an invasion. Our results may reflect compensatory shifts in individual foraging effort by ovenbirds, but, in combination with our previous research, provide little evidence that barberry affects ovenbird condition and therefore downstream outcomes.

AB  - This paper aims to present possible areas to plant different vegetation types near traffic jams to reduce air pollution in the capital of Croatia, the city of Zagreb. Based on main traffic road and random forest machine learning using WorldView-2 European cities data, potential areas are established. It is seen that, based on a 10 m buffer, there is a possible planting area of more than 220,000 square meters, and based on 15 m buffer, there is a possible planting area of more than 410,000 square meters. The proposed plants are Viburnum lucidum, Photinia x fraseri, Euonymus japonicus, Tilia cordata, Aesculus hippocastanum, Pinus sp., Taxus baccata, Populus alba, Quercus robur, Betula pendula, which are characteristic for urban areas in Croatia. The planting of proposed trees may result in an increase of 3-5% in the total trees in the city of Zagreb. Although similar research has been published, this paper presents novelty findings from combined machine learning methods for defining green urban areas. Additionally, this paper presents original results for this region.

AB  - Chlorophyll and nitrogen contents were used as leaf physiological parameters. Based on multispectral images from multiple detection angles and the stoichiometric data of tea (Camellia sinensis) leaves in different positions on plants, the spatial differences in tea physiological parameters were explored, and the full channel difference vegetation index was established to effectively remove soil and shadow noise. Support vector machine, random forest (RF), partial least square, and back-propagation algorithms from the multispectral images of leaf and canopy scales were then used to train the tea physiological parameter detection model. Finally, the detection effects of the multispectral images obtained from different angles on the physiological parameters of the top, middle, and bottom tea leaves were analysed and compared. The results revealed distinct spatial differences in the physiological parameters of tea leaves in individual plants. Chlorophyll content was lowest at the top and relatively high at the middle and bottom; nitrogen content was the highest at the top and relatively low at the middle and bottom. The horizontal distribution of physiological parameters was similar, i.e., the values in the east and south were high, whereas those in the west and north were low. The multispectral detection accuracy of the physiological parameters at the leaf scale was better than that at the canopy scale; the model trained by the RF algorithm had the highest comprehensive accuracy. The coefficient of determination between the predicted and measured values of the spad-502 plus instrument was (R-2) = 0.79, and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.11. The predicted result for the nitrogen content and the measured value was R-2 = 0.36 and RMSE = 0.03. The detection accuracy of the multispectral image taken at 60 degrees for the physiological parameters of tea was generally superior to those taken at other shooting angles. These results can guide the high-precision remote sensing detection of tea physiological parameters.

AB  - Background In prey, patterns of individual habitat selection and movement can be a consequence of an individuals' anti-predator behavior. Adjustments of anti-predator behavior are important for prey to increase their survival. Hunters may alter the anti-predator behavior of prey. In long-lived animals, experience may cause behavioral changes during individuals' lifetime, which may result in altered habitat selection and movement. Our knowledge of which specific events related to hunting activity induce behavioral changes in solitary living species is still limited. Methods We used offspring loss in a solitary and long-lived ungulate species, moose (Alces alces), as our model system. We investigated whether offspring loss to hunters induces behavioral changes in a species subjected to heavy human harvest but free from natural predation. To test for behavioral change in relation to two proxies for experience (calf fate and age), we combined movement data from 51 adult female moose with data on their offspring survival and female age. We tested for adjustments in females' habitat selection and movement following calf harvest using Hidden Markov Models and integrated Step Selection Analysis to obtain behavioral state specific habitat selection coefficients. Results We found that females with a harvested calf modified habitat selection and movement during the following hunting season. Female moose selected for shorter distance to roads during the night, selected for shorter distance to forests and greater distance to human settlements following calf harvest than females who had not lost a calf. The survival of twins in a given hunting season was related to female age. Older females we more likely to have twins survive the hunting season. Conclusions Our findings suggest that losing offspring to human harvest imposes behavioral changes in a long-lived ungulate species, leading to adjustments in females' habitat selection and movement behavior, which may lower the risk of encountering hunters. In our study, female moose that experienced calf loss selected for lower distance to forest and selected for greater distance to human settlements during periods of high hunting pressure compared to females without the experience of calf loss during the previous hunting season. We interpret this as potential learning effects.

AB  - The temperature of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has rapidly increased under global change, accelerating the process of lacustrine eutrophication. Chlorophyll-a (Chla) has always been a key indicator of lacustrine phytoplankton biomass and eutrophication. Satellite images have incomparable advantages in estimating the long-term and large-scale variation of Chla under extremely harsh climate conditions. In order to effectively manage lakes and work toward Sustainable Development Goals, this research made use of Landsat surface reflectance data from 1986 to 2023, which were collected and processed on the Google Earth Engine platform, to remotely estimate Chla in lakes on the QTP. Among the 1,069 lakes studied in the QTP, 281 and 166 lakes showed significant increases and decreases in Chla (P < 0.05), respectively. Correlations between Chla and multiple environmental factors were analyzed (analyzed in particular nitrogen deposition, large livestock, and sheep factors, besides conventional factors), aiming to bring new inspiration to water environment management. Utilizing variance decomposition and multiple general linear model regression, we quantitatively analyzed the contribution of various environmental factors. This study creatively set up the 3 change scenarios of large livestock, sheep, and fertilizer into general-linear-model-based equations to forecast yearly variations in Chla in 10 typical lakes from 2024 to 2100. The concentration of Chla in most lakes exhibited a marked rise due to the yearly increase in large livestock, sheep, and fertilizer. We suggest reducing human activities in lakes facing high environmental pressures and redirecting some environmental pollution pressure to lake basins with more space for self-ecological system regulation in the future.

AB  - In Germany, wolves live in a human-dominated landscape. The return of the wolf to Germany more than 20 years ago is a prime example of successful nature conservation; however, it has also led to conflict due to the high degree of landscape fragmentation and the feeding habits of the wolf. Here, the wolf diet composition was studied based on an analysis of 11,225 scats. Wolves in Germany mainly feed on wild ungulates, which comprise more than 94% of their diet. The predominant species are roe deer and wild boar, whereby in most territories roe deer dominate the diet composition. Depending on availability, red deer and fallow deer may also make up a high proportion of the diet. Seasonal and territorial variation in diet composition has been noted even in directly neighboring territories. Wolves preferentially hunt juveniles of the main prey species. With the exception of the mouflon, which has all but disappeared locally, no other ungulate species has vanished from the wolf's diet. This study provides an overview of the varied diet of wolves in Germany since recolonization more than 20 years ago.

AB  - Spatial processes, particularly scale-dependent feedbacks, may play important and underappreciated roles in the dynamics of bistable ecosystems. For example, self-organised spatial patterns can allow for stable coexistence of alternative states outside regions of bistability, a phenomenon known as a Busse balloon. We used partial differential equations to explore the potential for such dynamics in coral reefs, focusing on how herbivore behaviour and mobility affect the stability of coral- and macroalgal-dominated states. Herbivore attraction to coral resulted in a Busse balloon that enhanced macroalgal resilience, with patterns persisting in regions of parameter space where nonspatial models predict uniform coral dominance. Thus, our work suggests herbivore association with coral (e.g., for shelter) can prevent reefs from reaching a fully coral-dominated state. More broadly, this study illustrates how consumer space use can prevent ecosystems from undergoing wholesale state transitions, highlighting the importance of explicitly accounting for space when studying bistable systems.

AB  - When making decisions about how to restore habitat for at-risk species, land managers must balance multiple competing objectives in the face of uncertainty about the impacts of management actions on at-risk populations. The Oregon silverspot (Speyeria = Argynnis zerene hippolyta) is a federally threatened butterfly, and uncertainty exists about the effects of proposed management. We used structured decision making (SDM) to guide restoration for Oregon silverspots. Managers identified persistence as their primary objective and further identified effects of herbicides as a key uncertainty. We developed a model of population dynamics incorporating management actions and parameterized the model based on experiments with a surrogate subspecies, the Zerene silverspot (S. z. zerene). Herbicide application may directly harm Oregon silverspots by increasing larval mortality, while indirectly benefiting silverspots by reducing the competition faced by their host plant. In this system, potential herbicide treatments include grass-specific fluazifop-P-butyl or forb-specific clopyralid applied with Agri-Dex(R) or Nu-Film(R)-IR adjuvants. We found that Oregon silverspot population growth rate is greatest with clopyralid and fluazifop-P-butyl when combined with Nu-Film(R)-IR than other alternatives (including no treatment) considering only direct effects or in combination with indirect effects. An adaptive management program would benefit Oregon silverspots by promoting exploration of management alternatives while allowing managers to act quickly to arrest steep declines. Uncertainty remains regarding how well our results will generalize in field conditions. Implications for insect conservation SDM, in combination with experiments to parameterize models, provides a powerful tool for evaluating risks from management actions relative to conservation benefits.

AB  - Wildlife crossing structures and road calming measures are frequently implemented to improve habitat connectivity and mitigate the risks of wildlife-vehicle collisions on roads. Although Southeast Asia is a known biodiversity hotspot, majority of studies assessing effectiveness of such structures were conducted outside the region. Existing studies also tended to be non-comparative and focused on crossing structures in silo. We addressed this gap by simultaneously surveying and comparing the usage frequency of mammals across three crossing types-culverts, roads and rope bridges-along a road surrounded by forests in Singapore. This allowed us to evaluate the preferences of mammals, assess usage patterns and investigate factors influencing the use of different crossing types. Using camera traps and closed-circuit televisions, we documented 1133 independent crossing events across a 9-month study period from March to November 2021. Fourteen mammal species were detected across all crossing types, with wild boar (Sus scrofa) being the most prevalent species (68.2%). Locally critically endangered species such as the Malayan porcupine (Hystrix brachyura), Sunda pangolin (Manis javanica), and Raffles' banded langur (Presbytis femoralis femoralis) were also recorded to use culverts, roads, and rope bridges for crossings, respectively. Although many species used multiple crossing types, most species had a preferred crossing method. Between culverts and roads, factors that influenced crossing preferences included group size for wild boars and time of day and presence of fences for other mammals. Even though such culverts were intended for drainage, they were still widely used by mammals. Overall, all three crossing methods were crucial in facilitating the movement of animals between habitats. Thus, a variety of infrastructure and measures to accommodate the diversity of wildlife moving across forest patches in a fragmented landscape is recommended.

AB  - PurposeIn Nepal, goat farming plays a vital role in the agricultural economy and food security, and this number is increasing. The purpose of this study was to understand the sustainability impacts of this highly important food item and to test a life cycle assessment method for an agricultural product in Nepal for the first time.MethodsLife cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) was applied to assess the carbon footprint, social impacts, and life cycle costs of goat meat produced in Western Nepal in Sudurpashchim and Karnali Provinces. Primary data were collected from goat farms, field cultivation, middlemen, and butcheries to assess climate impact and costs. Goat farmer group discussions were held to cover social impacts.Results and discussionThe carbon footprint of the carcass weight of the goat meat was 17 kg CO2eq/kg CW. Further studies should focus on methane emissions from enteric fermentation and manure and the overall efficiency of the production chain. The results indicate that, in general, the goat business is a good business, but profitability is mostly toward the downstream side of the value chain, especially for butchers selling directly to customers. Meeting basic needs, access to services and inputs, and women's empowerment were identified as social hotspots in several regions.ConclusionsLCSA is an applicable method in the food and agricultural sector in Nepal and provides several possibilities for the future. By integrating environmental, social, and economic perspectives, future interventions can better support small-scale farmers, enhance their livelihoods, and promote sustainable agricultural practices.

AB  - Buffalo plays a compelling role in reducing malnutrition and ensuring food to the people of Asian countries by its major contribution to milk and meat pool of the livestock agriculture farming system in the region. As Asia is the home for more than 90% of world buffalo population, they are also one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses. Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.) leaves are rich sources of naturally occurring essential oils and phenolic compounds, which could modulate rumen fermentation through mitigation of methanogenesis and nitrogen excretion along with stimulation of immune system and production performances of animals. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of dietary inclusion of eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) leaf meal (ELM) on voluntary feed intake, rumen functions, methane emission, nutrient utilization, milk yield and fatty acids profile, and immune response in lactating buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). An in vitro experiment conducted with graded dose (10-40 g/kg) inclusion of ELM into the total mixed ration to select ideal level for feeding to lactating buffaloes, an improvement (P < 0.05) in feed degradability (IVDMD), microbial biomass and ruminal volatile fatty acids concentration with reduced (P < 0.05) methane and ammonia-N production were evidenced when ELM was added at 10-20 g/kg DM, beyond which negative effects on rumen fermentation were pronounced. An in vivo experimentation was conducted with sixteen Murrah (Bubalus bubalis) buffaloes of mean live weight, 544.23 +/- 10.02 kg; parity, 2-4 at initial stage (similar to 60 days) of lactation with average milk yield of 11.43 +/- 1.32 kg and were divided into two groups (CON, ELM) of eight each in a completely randomized design. All the animals were kept individually on wheat straw-based diet with required quantity of concentrate mixture and green fodder. The control group buffaloes were fed a total mixed ration; however, the treatment group (ELM) was supplemented with 10 g/kg DM diet of dry grounded eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) leaves by mixing with the concentrate mixture. The feeding experiment was conducted for 120 days, including 15 days for adaptation to the experimental diets and 105 days for data recording. The nutrient digestibility (DM, OM, CP, and EE) was improved (P < 0.05) without affecting feed intake (P > 0.05) and fiber digestibility (NDF and ADF) in ELM supplemented buffaloes. Increased (P < 0.05) milk production and rumenic acid concentration (cis 9 trans 11 C18:2 CLA) were demonstrated with comparable (P > 0.05) milk composition and major fatty acids profile of milk in the supplemented buffaloes. Dietary inclusion of ELM reduced (P < 0.05) enteric methane production and fecal excretion of nitrogen. The health status of buffaloes fed ELM improved throughout the experimental period was improved by enhancing cell mediated (P = 0.09) and humoral (P < 0.01) immune responses without affecting (P > 0.05) major blood metabolites. The study described feeding ELM at 10 g/kg diet to lactating Murrah buffaloes as a natural source of phenols and essential oils to increase milk production and CLA content, reduce methane and nitrogen emissions, and improve health status. Thus, feeding of ELM could be beneficial for climate smart buffalo production system for enhancing milk production with lesser impact on environment.

AB  - Zinc plays a crucial role in the growth and reproductive functions of animals. Despite the positive effects of zinc that have been reported in oocytes of cows, pigs, yaks, and other animals, the influence of zinc on sheep is little known. To investigate the effect of zinc on the in vitro maturation of sheep oocytes and subsequent parthenogenesis-activated embryonic development, we added different concentrations of zinc sulfate to the in vitro maturation (IVM) culture medium. The IVM culture medium with zinc improved the maturation of sheep oocytes and the subsequent blastocyst rate after parthenogenesis activation. Notably, it also enhanced the level of glutathione and mitochondrial activity while reducing levels of reactive oxygen species. Thus, zinc addition to the IVM medium improved the quality of oocytes with a positive effect on the subsequent development of oocytes and embryos.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged warm water events that are increasing in frequency and magnitude due to rising global temperatures. The Northeast Pacific Blob was an unusually widespread MHW that affected ecosystems across the Northeast Pacific, from producers to top predators. Temperature and salinity data collected by northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) from 2014 to 2017 show significant (>2 sd) warm anomalies throughout the top 1,000 m of the water column, with peak warming in late 2015. Using temperature and salinity as a tracer of layers of constant density, we looked at how lateral advection may have contributed to the development of the Blob. Temperature and salinity anomalies and the expansion of the water column at the base of the pycnocline both indicate that northward advection of warm, salty water played an important role in the observed accumulation of warm water, in addition to surface warming. These findings contribute to our understanding of the physical dynamics of the Blob, especially the thermal content and structure of the water column, and offer mechanisms for its formation and maintenance, which are crucial to assessing the ecological effects of MHWs now and in the future.

AB  - Land use changes in the Alps over the last few decades have been characterised by a significant increase in forest coverage as a result of the abandonment of marginal agricultural sites. Natural afforestation and species protection laws affected the ecosystem, and therefore the services provided by the mountain environment, including landscape structure and aesthetics, changed. This work assess the changes in the ecosystem services offered by forests since 1954 in a region of the Italian Alps. Some ES were estimated in this work with GIS, and others were taken from the literature or the authors' previous works. Since the 1950s, forest ecosystem services such as growing stock, protection from hydro-geological hazards and carbon storage have increased. Deer and other forest species have risen in number. On the other hand, there has been a depletion of open space for priority habitats and species such as black grouse and capercaillie. Old postcards were used to understand land use change and people's aesthetic preferences. To determine people's preferences for the landscape, we used records of over 300,000 postcards, sold during nearly two decades. The most often chosen postcard portrayed a landscape of the 1970s with a mix of forest and open space, different from the scenario that the buyers could observe. The sales records for over 20 years of postcard business and the dates of the postcards that we obtained in this research allowed us to perform a quantitative analysis of landscape preferences. The main subject of the photo was a good predictor of the number of postcards sold, according to generalised linear models (GLM); and postcards of overly exploited landscapes, dense forest coverage or buildings were significantly less likely to be chosen. Artificially reinstating open areas will boost biodiversity and could recreate a landscape that resembles the historical agro-ecosystem without interfering with the forest's other functions. These findings will help managers and policy makers evaluate cultural ecosystem resources in the face of changing mountain landscapes.

AB  - Background Diet is a key component of a species ecological niche and plays critical roles in guiding the trajectories of evolutionary change. Previous studies suggest that dietary evolution can influence the rates and patterns of species diversification, with omnivorous (animal and plant, 'generalist') diets slowing down diversification compared to more restricted ('specialist') herbivorous and carnivorous diets. This hypothesis, here termed the "dietary macroevolutionary sink" hypothesis (DMS), predicts that transitions to omnivorous diets occur at higher rates than into any specialist diet, and omnivores are expected to have the lowest diversification rates, causing an evolutionary sink into a single type of diet. However, evidence for the DMS hypothesis remains conflicting. Here, we present the first test of the DMS hypothesis in a lineage of ectothermic tetrapods-the prolific Liolaemidae lizard radiation from South America. Results Ancestral reconstructions suggest that the stem ancestor was probably insectivorous. The best supported trait model is a diet-dependent speciation rate, with independent extinction rates. Herbivory has the highest net diversification rate, omnivory ranks second, and insectivory has the lowest. The extinction rate is the same for all three diet types and is much lower than the speciation rates. The highest transition rate was from omnivory to insectivory, and the lowest transition rates were between insectivory and herbivory. Conclusions Our findings challenge the core prediction of the DMS hypothesis that generalist diets represent an 'evolutionary sink'. Interestingly, liolaemid lizards have rapidly and successfully proliferated across some of the world's coldest climates (at high elevations and latitudes), where species have evolved mixed arthropod-plant (omnivore) or predominantly herbivore diets. This longstanding observation is consistent with the higher net diversification rates found in both herbivory and omnivory. Collectively, just like the evolution of viviparity has been regarded as a 'key adaptation' during the liolaemid radiation across cold climates, our findings suggest that transitions from insectivory to herbivory (bridged by omnivory) are likely to have played a role as an additional key adaptation underlying the exceptional diversification of these reptiles across extreme climates.

AB  - The temperate forests of Australia support a high diversity of hypogeous fungi and a wide variety of mycophagous mammals, yet many mammal-fungal relationships are still poorly understood. We studied the seasonal fungal diets of eight sympatric mammals (seven marsupials and one rodent) in a remnant montane eucalypt forest. Fifty-five different fungal taxa were identified from 305 scat samples. Swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor), yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes) and brown antechinus (A. stuartii) were the primary mycophagists in this community, but all mammals consumed fungi, including three species not previously recorded as mycophagous (eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus;common wallaroo, Osphranter robustus; and common dunnart, Sminthopsis murina). Winter was the peak season for fungal consumption and dietary diversity of fungi, however, the diversity of taxa ingested varied between species and season. Our work supports the idea that a diverse mycophagous mammal community is important for maintaining natural variation in fungal community composition.

AB  - The domestic pig breeds are in danger of extinction whereas the erosion of their gene pool is a serious concern because they significantly contribute to the rich biodiversity. Overall aim of this study was to determine the protocol for preserving the semen of the Windsnyer boars for conservation. A total of 18 ejaculates (6 replications/boar) were collected from three Windsnyer boars of proven fertility with the use of hand-gloved approach method, twice per week. Boars semen were pooled and extended with Beltsville Thawing Solution [(BTS) IMV Technologies, France], held at 18 degrees C for 3 hours and centrifuged. The sperm pellet was re-suspended with Fraction A (20% egg yolk + BTS) and cooled at 5 degrees C for 1 hour. Following cooling, semen was divided and diluted into different cryoprotectants (ethylene glycol, glycerol, propanediol, ethylene glycol + glycerol + propanediol) at equal contribution to make the total concentrations [4, 8, 12 and 16% and the 0% (control; without cryoprotectant)] and loaded into 0.25 mL straws. Two cryopreservation methods (liquid nitrogen vapour and controlled rated) were used to cryopreserve the semen straws. Semen straws were thawed at different temperatures (5, 18, 37 and 40 degrees C) and evaluated for sperm motility, viability, and morphology traits. Post-thawed sperm total motility (36.0 +/- 5.3) and live normal sperm (49.5 +/- 8.3) percentages were recorded to be higher in the treatment supplemented with 16% glycerol (P<0.05). The highest sperm total motility percentage was recorded at 40 degrees C (26.8 +/- 3.2) thawing temperature for liquid nitrogen vapour treatment (P<0.05). In conclusion, 16% glycerol was found to be the suitable cryoprotectant concentration for semen cryopreserved with liquid nitrogen vapour method and thawed at 40 degrees C.

AB  - Collecting arthropod samples is usually very invasive because these organisms die during sampling, and it is hard to obtain a statistically robust sample. The availability of arthropods is critical for the survival of the youngest White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) nestlings and impacting the productivity of this species populations; thus, the species is a strong predator of a variety of epigeic insects. At the time of progressive drying of climatic conditions due to climate change or/and in dry habitats replacing wetlands, the role of termophilic taxa as certain Coleoptera in nestling diet is often underestimated. Here, we evaluated the Coleopteran component of the diet of the White Stork nestlings using the nest lining material consisting of fragmented remains of regurgitated pellets and soil-like material, and related the community indices of Coleopteran fauna to the landscape structure within a radius of 2.5 km around nests. In eight nests collected in SE Poland, we found a massive accumulation of beetle remains representing 32,277 individual Coleopteran prey items, from which 17,252 were identified to the family level. Our analysis showed a significant relationship between the landscape structure and beetle communities, as well as the abundance of dominant prey taxa and the share of three major functional guilds (herbivores, scavengers, and predators). The significant contribution of scavengers was associated with a high proportion of forests around the nest and decreased with increasing proportion of arable lands and mixed crops, while the high proportion of herbivorous and predatory beetles was associated with a high share of arable lands. We showed that the analysis of nest lining material, mainly the remains of pellets, provides taxonomically informative data on beetle communities and can be a valuable tool in bioindicative assessments of Coleopteran biodiversity. Given the widespread nesting of White Stork near landfills (increasing the productivity of their local populations), further studies assessing the role of the Coleopteran component, particularly the contribution of necrophagous or saprophagous beetles, in the diet of early nestlings of this bird species are essential.

In Zeiten zunehmender Trockenheit der klimatischen Bedingungen infolge des Klimawandels und/oder beim Ersatz von Feuchtgebieten durch trockene Habitate wird die Rolle thermophiler Taxa wie bestimmter K & auml;ferarten (Coleoptera) in der Nestlingsnahrung oft untersch & auml;tzt. In dieser Studie analysierten wir den Anteil von K & auml;fern in der Nahrung von Wei ss storchk & uuml;ken, indem wir das Material des Nestbodens untersuchten, das aus fragmentierten Resten von Speiballen und erdartigem Material besteht, und haben die Gemeinschaftsindizes der K & auml;ferfauna mit der Landschaftsstruktur in einem Umkreis von 2,5 km um die Nester in Beziehung gesetzt. In acht Nestern, die im S & uuml;dosten Polens beprobt wurden, fanden wir eine enorme Ansammlung von K & auml;ferresten, die 32.277 einzelne erbeutete K & auml;ferteile umfassen, von denen 17.252 bis zur Familienebene bestimmt werden konnten. Unsere Analyse zeigte eine signifikante Beziehung zwischen der Landschaftsstruktur und der K & auml;fergemeinschaft sowie der H & auml;ufigkeit dominanter Beutetaxa und dem Anteil der drei wichtigen funktionellen Gilden (Herbivore, Aasfresser und Pr & auml;datoren). Der signifikante Beitrag von Aasfressern stand im Zusammenhang mit einem hohen Waldanteil rund um das Nest und nahm mit zunehmendem Anteil von Ackerfl & auml;chen und Mischkulturen ab, w & auml;hrend ein hoher Anteil herbivorer und r & auml;uberischer K & auml;fer mit einem hohen Anteil an Ackerland einherging. Wir konnten zeigen, dass die Analyse des Materials des Nestbodens, insbesondere der R & uuml;ckst & auml;nde von Speiballen, taxonomisch aufschlussreiche Daten zu K & auml;fergemeinschaften liefert und ein wertvolles Werkzeug f & uuml;r bioindikative Bewertungen der K & auml;ferbiodiversit & auml;t sein kann. Angesichts der weitverbreiteten Neststandorte von Wei ss st & ouml;rchen nahe M & uuml;lldeponien (welche die Produktivit & auml;t der lokalen Population steigern), sind weitere Studien zur Rolle des K & auml;feranteils, insbesondere zum Anteil aasfressender und saprophage K & auml;fer, in der Nahrung junger K & uuml;ken dieser Vogelart von gro ss er Bedeutung.

AB  - Recolonization of the Cascade Range in southern British Columbia, Canada, and Washington, USA, by wolverines (Gulo gulo (L., 1758)) is an ongoing process whose ultimate outcome is unknown. A reliable species distribution model for the wolverine in the Cascades (i.e., their first-order habitat selection) is urgently needed to help inform management and conservation strategies. Using Argos location data obtained on 10 resident adult wolverines (six females, four males) from 2008 to 2016, we generated a multi-covariate species distribution model for the wolverine in the Cascades. Our final model included three climatic covariates and their quadratic terms: Proximity to the Transitional Zone Near Alpine Tree Line, Number of Frost-free Days per Year, and Annual Precipitation as Snow. Model validations indicated that our model was robust and could identify areas of potential wolverine distribution in the Cascades reliably. Our model provides evidence that wolverine distribution in the Cascades is constrained by climatic conditions and that snowy and cold environments define the geographic areas that are overwhelmingly associated with resident wolverines. In addition, our model provides a reliable basis for monitoring the direct effects of climate change on wolverines in the Cascade Range and for predicting the extent to which climate change may impact their populations under various scenarios.

AB  - Herbivores often have highly variable impacts on plant fecundity. The relative contribution of different environmental factors operating at varying spatial scales in affecting this variability is often unclear. We examined how density-dependent seed predation at local scales and regional differences in primary productivity are associated with variation in the magnitude of pre-dispersal seed predation on Monarda fistulosa (Lamiaceae). Within M. fistulosa populations growing in a low-productivity region (LPR), Montana, USA, and a high-productivity region (HPR), Wisconsin, USA, we quantified the magnitude of pre-dispersal seed predation among individual plants differing in seed head densities. Out of a total of 303 M. fistulosa plants that were surveyed, we found half as many herbivores in seed heads in the LPR (n = 133 herbivores) compared to the HPR (n = 316). In the LPR, 30% of the seed heads were damaged in plants with low seed head density, while 61% of seed heads were damaged in plants with high seed head density. Seed head damage was consistently high in the HPR (about 49% across the range of seed head density) compared to the LPR (45% across a range of seed head density). However, the proportion of seeds per seed head that were destroyed by herbivores was nearly two times higher (similar to 38% loss) in the LPR compared to HPR (22% loss). Considering the combined effects of probability of damage and seed loss per seed head, the proportion seed loss per plant was consistently higher in the HPR regardless of seed head density. Nevertheless, because of greater seed head production, the total number of viable seeds produced per plant was higher in HPR and high-density plants, despite being exposed to greater herbivore pressure. These findings show how large-scale factors can interact with local-scale factors to influence how strongly herbivores suppress plant fecundity.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Cattle are fed a high-concentrate diet to improve their productivity; however, it alters the rumen ecosystem due to high structural carbohydrates level, resulting in ruminal acidosis. This study investigated the effect of changing diet on ruminal fermentation parameters, bacterial community composition, and expressed genes of Holstein Friesian cows, with changes induced by transition from a high-forage to two succeeding high-concentrate diets, and then returned to a high-forage diet. Ruminal pH drastically decreased; however, ammonia nitrogen, and individual and total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentrations increased during the high-concentrate diet period. High-concentrate diet also reduced rumen bacterial richness and diversity. Gene expression in rumen epithelia was affected and altered by changing diet through the obtained differentially expressed genes.
   Effects of changing diet on rumen fermentation parameters, bacterial community composition, and transcriptome profiles were determined in three rumen-cannulated Holstein Friesian cows using a 3 x 4 cross-over design. Treatments include HF-1 (first high-forage diet), HC-1 (first high-concentrate diet), HC-2 (succeeding high-concentrate diet), and HF-2 (second high-forage diet as a recovery period). Animal diets contained Klein grass and concentrate at ratios of 8:2, 2:8, 2:8, and 8:2 (two weeks each), respectively. Ammonia-nitrogen and individual and total volatile fatty acid concentrations were increased significantly during HC-1 and HC-2. Rumen species richness significantly increased for HF-1 and HF-2. Bacteroidetes were dominant for all treatments, while phylum Firmicutes significantly increased during the HC period. Prevotella, Erysipelothrix, and Galbibacter significantly differed between HF and HC diet periods. Ruminococcus abundance was lower during HF feeding and tended to increase during successive HC feeding periods. Prevotella ruminicola was the predominant species for all diets. The RNA sequence analysis revealed the keratin gene as differentially expressed during the HF diet, while carbonic-anhydrase I and S100 calcium-binding protein were expressed in the HC diet. Most of these genes were highly expressed for HC-1 and HC-2. These results suggested that ruminal bacterial community composition, transcriptome profile, and rumen fermentation characteristics were altered by the diet transitions in dairy cows.

AB  - Fencing is a ubiquitous feature of our agricultural landscape. Fences necessarily have the potential to reduce habitat connectivity for resident ungulate populations. Unsuccessful fence crossings have the potential to cause injury or death to wildlife, as well as resulting in damage to the fence in terms of time and maintenance costs. Wildlife friendly fence designs may provide landowners and ungulate managers the opportunity to mitigate risks associated with wildlife crossings. Using remote cameras (n = 12) along the perimeter fence of the Wainwright Dunes Ecological Reserve, Alberta, we quantified and compared elk crossing behaviors at standard 4 strand fences and gates as well as 3 strand fences and gates both with experimentally modified top and bottom strand heights. We found that wildlife friendly designs promoted behavioral options for elk of various demographic classes to cross fences. Our results suggest that the number of strands and the height of the top and bottom strand are important determinants for animals deciding to cross over, through, or under fences. While difficult or problematic crossings were primarily determined by how the individual crossed and made up a proportionally small number of crossings, the sheer volume of crossings we observed suggests that any modification which increases fence permeability to elk will likely result in less damage to fences and the crossing individuals.

AB  - In 2016, an application was prepared by the Malawian government for the Elephant Marsh on the Shire River to be granted RAMSAR status. As part of the support for that application and to help guide the resulting management plan, the eco-social holistic environmental flow assessment model DRIFT was set up for the Marsh. The aim was to predict the response of the Marsh to scenarios of changing water and sediment inflows, and to different levels of harvesting of its natural resources, in order to identify threats to and viable options for sustaining its biodiversity. The results of the DRIFT assessment provided three main points of guidance for the RAMSAR application and the subsequent development of a management plan. First, it was shown the Marsh has been fairly resilient to short-term changes in the inflows of water and sediments, having endured significant fluctuations in both in its history, and was able to recover in terms of biodiversity from extreme dry periods. Second, it was revealed that conservation efforts to protect biodiversity should concentrate on the central, eastern and southern areas, as they were less vulnerable to decreases in water flows than the other areas of the Marsh. Third, restricting access to some parts of the Marsh, in particular the core eastern, central and southern areas, could markedly improve its overall condition, increase many of its resources and improve its resilience to Climate Change. Of the access restrictions assessed, the greatest benefit to the ecological integrity of the Marsh would be achieved if all access to the central area was stopped, and if access to the eastern and southern areas was reduced to 50% of the 2014 baseline levels.

AB  - Subterranean termites are ecosystem engineers that modulate the flow of carbon from dead wood to the atmosphere and soil, yet their contributions to the latter pool are largely unaccounted for in carbon cycling models. The fate of C from wood utilized by Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar) was determined using a reductionist design in a closed system with delta C-13 labeled wood as a stable isotope tracer. The percentage of wood-based carbon in termite respiratory gases, tissues, and organic deposits (frass and construction materials) was measured for five colonies to budget wood-C mass distributed into metabolic and behavioral pathways during a 160-h incubation period. We found that termites emitted 42% of the C from wood as gas (largely as carbon dioxide), returned 40% to the environment as organic deposits (frass and construction materials), and retained 18% in their tissues (whole alimentary tracts and de-gutted bodies). Our findings affirm that termites are a source of greenhouse gases but are also ecosystem engineers that return approximately half the C from dead wood as organic deposits into their surrounding environment.

AB  - In general, many domestic breeds of livestock evolved to different geographical regions, Awassi sheep in particular, adapted to Fertile Crescent region where cradle of domestication took place. Awassi sheep has tremendous genetic diversity compared to other domestic sheep breeds of the world. Nowadays, Awassi sheep is in danger of losing their unique and ancient genetic diversity as a result mainly of unwarranted crossing with high-yielding exotic breeds. Another reason for losing diversity is reduction in the population size of Awassi sheep in their origin region of the Fertile Crescent. Unveiling genetic diversity marks the inaugural phase in the execution of breeding and conservation initiatives. Previous literature revealed that microsatellite markers were widely used and accepted until nowadays as useful molecular markers for evaluating genetic diversity of sheep populations along with other markers such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). Most studies based on microsatellite markers provided information on genetic diversity parameters (e.g. observed and expected heterozygosity, PIC, alleles number, inbreeding coefficient, effective population size, genetic distances values and cluster analyses) within and among Awassi populations. These markers enabled phylogenetic relationships among populations by tree building approach based on genetic distance values. On the other hand, crossbreeding practices are thought to contribute to the genetic erosion of the original Awassi sheep breed, while a reduction in population size is anticipated to have adverse effects on genetic diversity. In this work, we reviewed the microsatellite-based studies which have been published for detecting genetic diversity of Awassi sheep breed in various countries of Fertile Crescent.

AB  - Climate change and human activities have caused dramatic impacts on biodiversity. Although a number of international agreements or initiatives have been launched to mitigate the biodiversity loss, the erosion of terrestrial biome habitats is inevitable. Consequently, the identification of potential suitable habitats under climate change and human disturbance has become an urgent task of biodiversity conservation. In this study, we used the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt) to identify the current and potential future habitats of Asian elephants in South and Southeast Asia. We performed analyses for future projections with 17 scenarios using the present results as baseline. To optimize the modelling results, we delineated the core habitats by using the Core Mapper Tool and compared them with existing protected areas (PAs) through gap analysis. The results showed that the current total area of core habitats is 491,455 km(2) in size and will be reduced to 332,544 km(2) by 2090 under SSP585 (the shared socioeconomic pathway). The projection analysis under differential scenarios suggested that most of the core habitats in the current protected areas would remain stable and suitable for elephants in the future. However, the remaining 75.17% of the core habitats lay outside the current PAs, and finally we mapped approximately 219,545 km(2) of suitable habitats as priority protected areas in the future. Although our model did not perform well in some regions, our analyses and findings still could provide useful references to the planning of protected areas and conservation of Asian elephant.

AB  - Gut microbial communities provide essential functions to their hosts and are known to influence both their ecology and evolution. However, our knowledge of these complex associations is still very limited in reptiles. Here we report the 16S rRNA gene faecal microbiota profiles of two lizard species endemic to the Balearic archipelago (Podarcis lilfordi and P. pityusensis), encompassing their allopatric range of distribution through a noninvasive sampling, as an alternative to previous studies that implied killing specimens of these IUCN endangered and near-threatened species, respectively. Both lizard species showed a faecal microbiome composition consistent with their omnivorous trophic ecology, with a high representation of cellulolytic bacteria taxa. We also identified species-specific core microbiota signatures and retrieved lizard species, islet ascription, and seasonality as the main factors in explaining bacterial community composition. The different Balearic Podarcis populations are characterised by harbouring a high proportion of unique bacterial taxa, thus reinforcing their view as unique and divergent evolutionary entities.

AB  - Red deer populations, once extirpated in large parts of Europe, have recovered over the last century in many regions. In Switzerland, primarily inhabiting mountain forests, they have recently started to expand into human-dominated lowland landscapes. To study their habitat selection, we analyzed day- and nighttime positions of 15 GPS-collared red deer. Our results show that during daytime, all animals generally preferred forests; open land was mainly used at night. In summer and fall, some lowland individuals deviated from this pattern and used agricultural crops as daytime retreats. Human settlements were often avoided in the lowlands. Day-site selection in the lowlands occurred irrespective of the distance to trails and the probability of being accessed by humans, in contrast to the pattern observed in the mountains. At night, red deer preferred forest edges and open land. In the lowlands, human settlements were avoided. Trails and transport infrastructures had a marginal influence at night. Our study confirmed a high behavioral plasticity of red deer. The use of daytime retreats close to trails and in high-standing crops represent major extensions of their behavior. Our habitat models indicate that there is ample suitable habitat in the lowlands, which is of major relevance for their management.

AB  - Soil microbes drive nutrient cycle and strongly affect the fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs) globally. However, the mechanisms through which the key functional guilds regulate GHG fluxes from cropland remain unclear, especially those involving organisms at higher trophic levels of the soil micro-food webs. Therefore, the responses of key functional guilds to fertilization strategies and their contributions to the fluxes of dominant GHG were estimated to improve our mechanistic understanding. Typical fertilization regimes across the country were included in a long-term field experiment: regular synthetic fertilizers (NPK), partial synthetic nitrogen replacement with pig slurry (OMNPK) and crop straw (RSDNPK) plus a nil fertilizer control (Ctrl). The soil was a net sink of CH4, while fertilization treatments increased the fluxes of N2O and CO2. The cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions followed the order of RSDNPK > OMNPK approximate to NPK > Ctrl. Among the three GHGs, CO2 was the dominant one due to its high quantity and showed strong correlations with five soil labile and stable organic carbon and nitrogen fractions. The key functional guilds that strongly correlated with CO2 fluxes at the aggregate scale were composed of not only soil microbes, but also protists (14-19 %) and nematodes (3-4 %). Fertilization with organic amendments (OMNPK and RSDNPK) significantly changed the composition of the key functional guilds, which, along with key soil parameters, explained 26-35 % of the variation in CO2 fluxes. Protists were ranked as the 1st or 2nd most important biological group in determining the composition of the key functional guilds in all aggregate classes. Conclusively, soil biological groups at higher trophic levels, particularly protists, can serve as the important driver of GHG emissions. Manipulating their activities through targeted fertilization offers an alternative to mitigate the climate impacts of crop production.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa L.; Artiodactyla: Suidae) are found in every Arkansas county and are spreading throughout the southeastern USA. This is a public and animal health concern because wild pigs occupy the same geographical areas as humans and livestock, and can harbor over 45 animal patho-gens and parasites. Little research has been conducted on the tick species parasitizing Arkansas wild pigs. Tick collections for this study were taken from feral S. scrofa trapped for control purposes by Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, USDA APHIS Wildlife Services, and University of Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service personnel. Between Feb 2019 and Jan 2020, over 3,110 ticks were collected from 220 hogs from 11 Arkansas counties. Four tick species (Acarina: Ixodidae) were collected: Amblyomma americanum (L.) (95.4%; n = 2,966), Dermacentor variabilis (Say) (2.4%; n = 76), Amblyomma maculatum (Koch) (0.6%; n = 18), and Ixodes scapularis (L.) (0.3%; n = 9). Amblyomma americanum was collected from Jan to Nov 2019, and was the only species found in immature life stages. Dermacentor variabilis was collected from Apr 2019 to Oct 2019. Amblyomma maculatum was collected at 1 site in May 2019, and I. scapularis was collected at 1 site in Nov 2019.

AB  - The most extensively used method in Europe for stunning pigs before slaughter is exposure to carbon dioxide (CO2) in high concentrations (>80%). However, this method is controversial because it can result in variable degrees of aversive reactions during gas exposure. The variation in reaction among pigs is believed to be affected by different stressful conditions before or during the stunning phase. The stocking density in the gondola may be one factor influencing how stunning proceeds. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stocking density on the stunning progress of CO2 under commercial conditions. Both pigs' reaction to the gas (measured activity level using artificial intelligence (AI)) and induction time (time to loss of posture) were reduced by reducing the number of pigs in the gondola. The result indicates that pig welfare during CO2 stunning can be improved by reducing the stocking density. The result also leads to a point of attention to the ongoing initiatives to find alternatives to CO2. When comparing different gas methods, the number of pigs can be a crucial factor in making the right conclusions. Additionally, the results show that vision-based activity measures could be a useful tool to evaluate stunning. During the CO2 stunning of pigs, a variation in their reaction to the gas and the duration of the induction period is observed. The stunning process can be affected by several conditions, such as stressful events and previous experiences, but the stocking density in the gondola may also have an impact. The objective was to investigate the effect of stocking density on the stunning process under commercial conditions. To quantify the pigs' reactions under industrial settings with a stocking density of up to eight pigs pr. Gondola (3.91 m(2)), the activity level was measured using an AI solution. Compared with a simulation of the expected induction period, a significantly longer induction period was found in gondolas containing seven and eight pigs (p < 0.001) but not when the gondolas contained three or four pigs. Both high and mean activity levels were significantly higher when stocking density was increased from three or four pigs to seven or eight pigs. The stunning process was thus negatively affected when increasing the stocking density. More knowledge is needed to explain this effect and to make statements on optimal stocking density. The measured activity levels may be a useful tool for obtaining information under commercial conditions and for documenting animal welfare.

AB  - This study was aimed to determine allelic and genotypic frequencies of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in alpha (1) fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene and mucin 4 (MUC4) gene, and effects of these SNPs on sperm quality traits of Landrace and Yorkshire pigs. A total of 4771 ejaculates from 63 Landrace and 34 Yorkshire boars have been collected from May 2015 to July 2018 at nucleus breeding pig farm in Vietnam. The sperm quality traits were ejaculate volume, spermatozoa motility, sperm concentration and total number of spermatozoa in ejaculate. Hardy -Weinberg equilibrium was assessed using Fisher exact test. A mixed model was used to test the effects of fixed and random factors on the sperm traits. The fixed factors were genotype, breed, age of boar, month of the year, while boar ID number was included in the model as a random effect, allowing to properly model repeated measurements. These resistant genotypes were absent in Landrace. While the frequency of resistant genotypes AA for FUT1 (0.03) and GG for MUC4 (0.16) was relatively low in Yorkshire boar population. The only detected significant effect of FUT1 and MUC4 on semen quality traits had a positive effect of the resistant genotype GG of MUC4 on sperm motility (P = 0.015). The two SNPs located in FUT1 and MUC4 did not affect sperm traits except sperm motility. Consequently, the selection based on these resistant genotypes does not seem to negatively affect the monitored sperm traits.

AB  - In semi-arid drylands, landscape features such as water and trees are vital for individuals when reducing heat stress. In Australia, such landscapes have witnessed widespread canopy loss and considerable shifts in water availability due to anthropogenic processes, and are subject to greater frequencies of extreme temperatures. We explored the use of dammed watercourses and excavated earth tanks, and tree shade in two large macropod species, eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) and red kangaroos (Osphranter rufus) in the semi-arid drylands of south-western Queensland. Using a thermal drone, camera traps, and temperature sensors, we examined the relationship between temperature, and water and canopy shade use by both species. The likelihood of kangaroos being observed in the sun was negatively correlated with temperature, with the likelihood of observing eastern grey kangaroos in the sun dropping below 50 % when temperatures exceeded 28 degrees C, and 17 degrees C for red kangaroos. Probability of detecting kangaroos in the shade was positively correlated with temperature, with red kangaroos more strongly selecting shade than eastern grey kangaroos. For eastern grey kangaroos, we observed greatly increased activity at waterpoints when daily maximum temperatures exceeded 28 degrees C, with a preference for dammed watercourses over excavated earth tanks. Only a weak trend of using dammed watercourses at high temperatures (>36 degrees C) was detected for red kangaroos. As higher temperatures become more frequent due to climate change, our results suggest that the capacity of wildlife to persist may increasingly depend on the provision and maintenance of landscape features such as water and canopy shade.

AB  - Carnivores face important anthropogenic threats in agricultural areas from habitat loss and fragmentation, disturbance by domestic free-roaming dogs and cats, and direct hunting by humans. Anthropogenic disturbances are shifting the activity patterns of wild animals, likely modifying species interactions. We estimated changes in the activity patterns of the mesocarnivore guild of agricultural landscapes of the La Araucania region in southern Chile in response to land-use intensification, comparing intra- and interspecific activity patterns at low and high levels of forest cover, fragmentation, and land ownership subdivision. Our focal species comprise the guina or kod-kod (Leopardus guigna), two fox species (Lycalopex culpaeus and L. griseus), a skunk (Conepatus chinga), and one native mustelid (Galictis cuja), in addition to free-roaming dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) and their main mammalian prey species (i.e., Rodentia and Lagomorpha). In 23,373 trap nights, we totaled 21,729 independent records of our focal species. Our results show tendencies toward nocturnality at high land-use intensification, with potential impacts on species fitness. Nocturnal mesocarnivores decreased their diurnal/crepuscular activity, while cathemeral activity shifted to nocturnal activity at high land-use intensification, but only when in sympatry with a competitor. High land-use intensification decreased the activity overlap between native and domestic mesocarnivores but increased the overlap between native mesocarnivores. High intensification also reduced overlap with prey species. Notably, foxes displayed peaks of activity opposing those of dogs, and plasticity in activity pattern when in sympatry with dogs, such as strategies to avoid encounters. We stress the need to suppress the free-roaming and unsupervised activity of dogs to mitigate impacts of high land-use intensification on mesocarnivores.

AB  - The Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) modelling framework was used to develop a model of Algoa Bay and test the ecosystem impacts of the implementation of the Addo Elephant National Park Marine Protected Area (MPA). The Ecopath model included 37 functional groups ranging from phytoplankton to top predators and was fitted to 12 and 14 time-series of biomass and landings, respectively, from 2010 to 2019 (calibration period), using Ecosim. Two scenarios representing different degrees of fisheries closures in the MPA were explored through a 30% and a 100% reduction in fishing effort. Temporal simulations were run until 2059. The fitting procedure identified the best-fit model as the one including the effects of fishing, the six most-sensitive predator-prey interactions, and environmental forcing (primary production anomaly on small phytoplankton). Overall, the predicted biomass and catch time-series reasonably reproduced the observed time-series for 2010-2019, with the biomass of sardine Sardinops sagax, round herring Etrumeus whiteheadi, and African penguins Spheniscus demersus showing the best fits to data. Both MPA scenarios resulted in higher total biomass compared with the baseline by the end of the simulation and decreased catches due to less fishing effort. The most profound biomass increases under the MPA scenarios were observed in apex and pelagic elasmobranchs, yellowtail Seriola lalandi and African penguins. Future research is needed to improve the more-uncertain model parameters and include other key sectors in Algoa Bay, such as shipping. However, this model provides a good foundation for future work including the application of spatially explicit modelling of the bay using Ecospace.

AB  - Current lowland agricultural landscapes are characterized by a low representation of biodiversity-rich seminatural habitats. Even in structurally simple farmlands, the presence of in-field, non-farmed habitats may be beneficial for species persistence. Here, for the first time, we evaluated the importance of non-farmed habitats under high-voltage power line infrastructure for medium-sized mammals inhabiting the intensively-used agricultural landscape. We found the clear choice (in terms of visit frequency and use-intensity) of power pylons over adjacent farmland by individual mammalian species during the winter, with a clear preference for power pylons for dominant species (European hare, roe deer, and red fox). Similarly, our results also revealed that individual mammalian species spend more time and showed a higher share of comfort behavior (e.g., feeding, resting for herbivores, and sniffing for carnivores) under power pylons, while the species mainly passed through the adjacent farmland. Finally, analyses focusing on the effect of local and landscape characteristics on mammal useintensity underneath power pylons have revealed significant results only for European hare. European hare's useintensity increased with higher shrub density under power pylons, higher distance to the field edge, and shorter distance to shrub patches. Our findings demonstrated that power line infrastructure might represent crucial infield non-farmed habitats, offering suitable resting and foraging habitats for various mammal species in agricultural landscape. These habitats may significantly contribute to increasing the biological potential of structurally simple farmlands, which should be taken into consideration in conservation planning within agroecosystems.

AB  - In this paper, we apply standard zooarchaeological methods and novel osteological approaches to analyse faunal remains from five Middle-Late Holocene sites in the southern Tibetan Plateau (STP). Framed by direct radiocarbon dates on taxonomically classified bioarchaeological remains and compared with published palaeoclimate data, our findings revealed a three-stage process of agro-pastoral development in the STP ca. 5.5 to 1.0 ka. In the first phase, habitation was restricted to the lower southeastern part of the plateau and human subsistence essentially based on foraging and low-level pig-millet farming. With the onset of colder and drier climatic conditions ca. 3.8 ka, the study area witnessed a growing human presence at higher elevations in its central and western parts, together with a shift towards bovid husbandry and barley cultivation, that is, agricultural practices that originated in west Asia; these were likely introduced to the STP following the eastern margin of the TP and/or arrived by sub-Himalayan transfer. Climate and ecological degradation might have contributed to the decline of local game in favour of cold-and-dry-tolerant pastoral livestock and crops. Our work shows that Middle-Late Holocene climate change, ecological change, human subsistence shifts, and prehistoric cultural transmissions are intimately connected.

AB  - Quantifying spatiotemporally explicit interactions within animal populations facilitates the understanding of social structure and its relationship with ecological processes. Data from animal tracking technologies (Global Positioning Systems ["GPS"]) can circumvent longstanding challenges in the estimation of spatiotemporally explicit interactions, but the discrete nature and coarse temporal resolution of data mean that ephemeral interactions that occur between consecutive GPS locations go undetected. Here, we developed a method to quantify individual and spatial patterns of interaction using continuous-time movement models (CTMMs) fit to GPS tracking data. We first applied CTMMs to infer the full movement trajectories at an arbitrarily fine temporal scale before estimating interactions, thus allowing inference of interactions occurring between observed GPS locations. Our framework then infers indirect interactions-individuals occurring at the same location, but at different times-while allowing the identification of indirect interactions to vary with ecological context based on CTMM outputs. We assessed the performance of our new method using simulations and illustrated its implementation by deriving disease-relevant interaction networks for two behaviorally differentiated species, wild pigs (Sus scrofa) that can host African Swine Fever and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) that can host chronic wasting disease. Simulations showed that interactions derived from observed GPS data can be substantially underestimated when temporal resolution of movement data exceeds 30-min intervals. Empirical application suggested that underestimation occurred in both interaction rates and their spatial distributions. CTMM-Interaction method, which can introduce uncertainties, recovered majority of true interactions. Our method leverages advances in movement ecology to quantify fine-scale spatiotemporal interactions between individuals from lower temporal resolution GPS data. It can be leveraged to infer dynamic social networks, transmission potential in disease systems, consumer-resource interactions, information sharing, and beyond. The method also sets the stage for future predictive models linking observed spatiotemporal interaction patterns to environmental drivers.

AB  - Introduction: Plants and their insect herbivores represent a large fraction of the species in Amazonian forests and are often directly implicated in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity at local and regional scales. How these interactions may change over geographic distance is unknown because very few studies have investigated the herbivore fauna and defense chemicals of any host plant species at multiple sites in tropical forests. One hypothesis, the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution, predicts that if herbivore assemblages turn over in different parts of a plant's range, then plant defense chemicals should also change, reflecting local selection pressures.
   Methods: We tested this theory by studying 12 species of Protium (Burseraceae) trees that occur in both Iquitos, Peru, and Manaus, Brazil, in rainforests separated by 1500 km. We surveyed all insects observed directly feeding on the plants in both locations for 48 weeks in Manaus and 64 weeks in Iquitos. We analyzed the secondary metabolites in the leaves of all species in both locations using GC/MS and HPLC.
   Results and Discussion: Although in both locations we found that Protium herbivores were dominated by insects from the orders Hemiptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, we found almost complete turnover in the herbivore species composition in the two sites, and each host plant species had a different assemblage of herbivores in each location. Comparing the phylogenetic beta-diversity, we found low similarity in herbivore phylogenetic relatedness between host plant species in the two locations. However, the secondary metabolites found within a Protiumspecieswere similar across the two locations. We found no strong evidence that individuals from a host plant species in Iquitos or Manaus expressed locally-adapted defense chemicals, as individuals from geographic locations did not form clusters when looking at patterns of chemical similarity. These results are not consistent with the Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution. The most intriguing pattern we found was a strong correlation between the diversity of herbivores per host plant species in both locations. We also found that plants with high chemical richness had lower numbers of herbivore species and numbers of total herbivores in both locations. We conclude that high chemical diversity is the most effective strategy for Protium trees to reduce insect herbivore attacks. We speculate that each secondary metabolite is effective at repelling only a few insect herbivores, and that different chemicals are likely effective in different parts of a plants' geographic range. Future studies should investigate additional locations and additional natural enemies (i.e., fungal pathogens) to test the hypothesis that chemical diversity reduces attack from natural enemies and may explain the ecological and evolutionary success of rainforest trees over time and space.

AB  - Context. Wildlife viewing is a primary reason people visit parks and protected areas. However, high rates of visitation increase the potential for interactions between humans and wildlife. This close proximity of humans and wildlife can lead to habituation to human presence and pose a threat to both animals and humans. Aims. We describe human-mountain goat interactions in Cathedral Provincial Park (CPP), in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and examine management and mitigation strategies to reduce these interactions. Methods. This project was a collaboration with BC Parks. We used community-based participatory research methodologies, conducting interviews and surveys from July 2020 to November 2021 with park visitors, staff, and researchers. Key results. Most respondents encountered mountain goats in the park and understood the park's messaging; however, not all respondents took the necessary steps to reduce encounters. We recommend further education efforts focused on formal staff training and improved infrastructure in the park. Conclusions. Our results can be used to inform management decisions related to human-wildlife interactions, primarily in parks and protected areas. On a proximate level, we suggest further educational efforts and improved infrastructure in the park to help overcome perceived lack of action by some participants. Ultimately, there is a need to incorporate human aspects of human-wildlife interactions into management decisions aimed at addressing potential and existing problems. Implications. Using a multitude of approaches to management, informed by biological, social, and cultural knowledge, can improve responses and mitigation strategies in human-wildlife interactions. Collaboration among different stakeholders allows for the exchange of ideas and innovations that can contribute to positive movement towards coexistence of humans and wildlife in parks and recreational areas.

AB  - Rangeland ecosystems are changing worldwide with the abandonment of extensive pastoralism practices and greater interest for species coexistence. However, the lack of compiled data on current changes in the abundance and distribu-tion of herbivores challenges rangeland management decisions. Here we gathered and made available for the first time the most extensive set of occurrence data for rangeland herbivores in Iceland in an Open Access framework for trans-parent and repeatable science-based decisions. We mapped fine scale species distribution overlap to identify areas at risk for wildlife-livestock conflict and overgrazing. Nationwide and long term (1861-2021) occurrence data from 8 independent datasets were used alongside 11 predictor raster layers ("Big Data") to data mine and map the distribution of the domestic sheep (Ovis aries), feral reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus), pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus), and rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta islandorum) over the country during the summer. Using algorithms of Maxent in R, RandomForest, TreeNet (stochastic gradient boosting) and MARS (Splines) in Minitab-SPM 8.3, we computed 1 km pixel predictions from machine learning-based ensemble models. Our high-resolution models were tested with alter-native datasets, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) values that indicated good (reindeer: 0.8817 and rock ptarmigan: 0.8844) to high model accuracy (sheep: 0.9708 and pink-footed goose: 0.9143). Whenever possible, source data and models are made available online and described with ISO-compliant metadata. Our results illustrate that sheep and pink-footed geese have the greatest overlap in distribution with potential implication for wildlife-livestock con-flicts and continued ecosystem degradation even under diminishing livestock abundance at higher elevation. These na-tionwide models and data are a global asset and a first step in making available the best data for science-based sustainable decision-making about national herbivores affecting species coexistence and environmental management.

AB  - Simple Summary Lawsoniaintracellularis is an obligately intracellular enteric bacterium that infects intestinal epithelial cells causing porcine proliferative enteropathy, which is responsible for economic losses in the swine industry worldwide. This study evaluated the effects of a commercial, oral attenuated L. intracellularis vaccination (Enterisol(R) Ileitis) on the intestinal microbial community of weaned piglets. Piglets were experimentally vaccinated with different doses of the L. intracellularis vaccine, and the gut microbial shifts were measured at weeks 0 and 6 post-vaccination. The data presented here demonstrated that oral vaccination against L. intracellularis shapes the gut microbiota in weaned piglets. Alpha diversity analysis revealed that vaccination led to significant changes in species evenness but no changes in species richness of the gut microbiota. Beta diversity analysis revealed that vaccination against L. intracellularis caused a shift in the microbial community structure. At the phylum level, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in the intestinal microbiota of piglets regardless of treatment group and time points. At the genus level, there was a significant increase in Streptococcus and a significant decrease in Clostridium in the fecal microbiota of vaccinated pigs, regardless of the dose. Overall, this study sheds a new light on the potential role of the pig microbiota in modulating vaccine responses. Lawsoniaintracellularis, which causes porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE), is a common swine intestinal pathogen that is prevalent in pig production sites worldwide. In this study, the alteration in the microbiome composition of weaned pigs was investigated in response to vaccination against L. intracellularis, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A total of 64 crossbred (Duroc x [Landrace x Yorkshire]) healthy weanling pigs weaned at 4 weeks of age were randomly assigned to four treatment groups (four pigs/pen; four pens/treatment), using a randomized complete block design for the 42-day trial. Pigs in the treatment groups were orally administered with three different doses (1 dose = 2 mL) of vaccine against L. intracellularis (Enterisol(R) Ileitis, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica GmbH), namely the following: LAW1 (0.5 dose), LAW2 (1 dose), LAW3 (2 dose). A non-vaccinated group served as a negative control (CONT). Alpha diversity analysis revealed that vaccination led to significant changes in species evenness but not species richness of the gut microbiota. Beta diversity analysis revealed that vaccination against L. intracellularis caused a significant shift in the microbial community structure. At the genus level, there was a significant increase in Streptococcus and a significant decrease in Clostridium in the fecal microbiota of vaccinated pigs, regardless of dose.

AB  - The Vajo Salsone site is located at an altitude of 376m a.s.l. on the right slope of the Valpantena valley, in the Veneto Pre-Alps, north of the town of Verona. The site was discovered in 2017 during the construction of a truckable road. It is a small and narrow karst cavity filled with Pleistocene sediments that yield abundant Middle Palaeolithic artefacts and faunal remains, often coated by carbonate encrustations. The lithic assemblage shows the predominance of the Levallois method and is characterised by a large number of retouched elements, including foliated points. These artefacts, typical of the Late Middle Palaeolithic period in central and southeastern Europe, make Vajo Salsone an exceptional case, as their recovery is rather sporadic west of the Balkan Peninsula and south of the Alps. The fauna is dominated by ungulates, the most abundant being the red deer followed by roe deer, chamois and elk. Among the carnivores, wolf is common, while fox and bear are rare. This fauna suggests an environment characterised by open glades and closed forests, with a discontinuous presence of alpine grasslands and wetlands. Taphonomic analysis of the bone surfaces is complicated by the presence of concretions on most of the remains, which also show a high degree of fragmentation. Post-depositional fractures are common, and weathering is light. Only cervid bones show anthropogenic modifications related to hunting and hominin exploitation such as cut marks, scraping, impacts and burnt modifications. Some long bone diaphysis bear marks testifying to the use of these fragments as retouchers for flint artefacts. Such use has been evidenced at other Middle Palaeolithic sites in the area. Furthermore, the good state of preservation of the occlusal surface enamel of the cervid teeth allowed us to carry out meso and microwear analyses which provided data on seasonality and site occupation. With regard to dental wear analysis, the red deer from Vajo Salsone had mesowear suggesting a mixed feeding and grazing diets, whereas microwear analysis showed that the individuals had a diet between mixed feeding and browsing. The taphonomic study of the site has been integrated by X-RFS analysis of the alterations occurred to the lithic artefacts, which include deep patination and the formation of calcareous crusts. All the data presented here are consistent with the hypothesis of a short-distance displacement of the material from a single archaeological deposit possibly related to human occupation during the warm season.

AB  - Tick surveillance was conducted annually from February-November 2019-2021 at US Army Garrison (USAG) Humphreys, Pyeongtaek, Republic of Korea (ROK). Three general habitats, cut grasses, uncut grasses + herbaceous vegetation, and young mixed (deciduous and conifer) forest groves, were surveyed using tick drags. Ticks also were collected from Korean water deer, Hydropotes inermis argyropus, killed by vehicles at USAG Humphreys. A total of 53,428 ticks (18,004, 16,921, and 18,503 during 2019-2021, respectively) belonging to two genera and five species were collected by tick drag. Haemaphysalis longicornis (48,880; 91.49%) was the most frequently collected tick, followed by H. flava (2,501; 4.68%), Ixodes nipponensis (2,019; 3.78%), H. phasiana (27; 0.05%), and H. japonica (1; <0.01%). A total of 1,340 ticks belonging to two genera and three species were collected from 20/27 (74.07%) Korean water deer from January-December 2019-2021. Haemaphysalis longicornis (1,138; 84.93%) was the most commonly collected tick, followed by I. nipponensis (184; 13.73%), and H. flava (18; 1.34%). Ixodes nipponensis was collected from Korean water deer throughout the year, indicating that they were active during all seasons in the ROK. Haemaphysalis longicornis adults and nymphs were collected similarly from all habitats during March-November. Haemaphysalis flava was more frequently collected during the early and late seasons when there were relatively low temperatures. Unlike other species, I. nipponensis was collected more frequently in mixed forests from March-June. Adult male H. longicornis accounted for only 0.05% (3 male/5,76 female) of the total number of adults collected by tick drag, while no males (0 male/194 female) were collected from Korean water deer. In contrast, only H. flava males (15) were collected from Korean water deer, while both sexes of I. nipponensis (103 male/75 female) were collected during 2019-2021.

AB  - A study was carried out for documentation of ethnoveterinary practices prevalent among the various communities of the Dhemaji district of Assam. Personnel interviews, questionnaires, participatory rural appraisal, group discussions, and field visits were followed to collect the data. A total of 250 livestock farmers were selected across the district from 25 villages. The degree of adoption and effectiveness of each ethnoveterinary practice were expressed in percentage considering the responses of sampled farmers. A total of 62 ethnoveterinary practices were recorded where 43 plant species of 30 families were used to treat 33 common ailments in livestock and poultry. The highest, 28 practices were used for treatments of cattle followed by 21 for treatments of pigs, 8 for poultry, and 5 for Goat against the common issues related to the digestive system, fever, parasitic infestation, viral infection, bone fracture, retention of placenta (ROP), weakness and other health condition in livestock and poultry where the adoption was ranged from 6.00 to 89.33 percent. The present documentation will help the researchers, environmentalists, and other stakeholders towards better understanding in traditional knowledge, distribution of valuable resources and biodiversity conservation of the district.

AB  - Context Wild-pig hunting is a culturally significant recreational and commercial activity in Texas, but the overall impacts are contested. Except for one 1980s study, there has been no research to formally quantify any economic benefits of wild-pig hunting in Texas, which is an important component for weighing the costs and benefits of wild-pig presence in the state.Aims and methods To fill that research gap, we surveyed a sample of resident and non-resident 2018-2019 hunting-license holders in Texas about various topics related to their wild-pig hunting activities, including expenditures.Key results On the basis of the 37,317 responses received, we estimated that the marginal annual direct economic benefit of wild-pig hunting to the Texas economy ranges between US$68.5 million and US$188.0 million (2022 dollar values). Given that we were not able to distinguish whether purchases were made in or out of state for expenses provided, we believe this range is an upper estimate.Conclusion and implications Although hunting is an important consideration in the discussion of wild-pig management, this estimate is dwarfed by the estimated total damage costs associated with wild pigs in Texas.

AB  - Urban green areas can have a high impact on soil fauna due the environmental changes caused by human activities. This work aimed to assess earthworm populations in urban sites in the city of Curitiba, Parana, Brazil. Earthworms were sampled in two urban sites: the Campus Ecoville of the Universidade Positivo and the Casa Verde space and in two land use systems (Grass Lawn and Native Vegetation), in the summer of 2018 and 2019 and winter of 2019. A total of 1052 individuals were found, belonging to five families and 12 species were identified, of which five are native: Glossoscolex sp.55, Fimoscolex sp.36, Fimoscolex sp.37 (Glossoscolecidae), Andiorrhinus duseni (Rhinodrilidae) and Ocnerodrilidae sp.43 (Ocnerodrilidae) and seven are exotic species: Amynthas corticis, Amynthas morrisi, Metaphire californica, Metaphire schmardae (Megascolecidae), Dendrodrilus rubidus (Lumbricidae) and Pontoscolex corethrurus (Rhinodrilidae). Of the five native species found, four are new species and will be described in the future and the specie A. duseni belongs to the group known as giant earthworms (minhocucu) with specimens larger than 30cm. Despite the predominance of exotic species (n=932) compared to native species (n=114), the presence of new species may indicate that the managed environments can preserve native species. Moreover, the difference in the total number (native vs. exotic) can be attributed to the ability of the exotic species to survive human disturbances.

AB  - Introduction The Sanzenbacher Ranch deposit represents an early Permian plant assemblage in north-central Texas predominantly composed of pteridosperms, of which callipterids are dominant. This study investigates the interactions of a taxonomically broad range of plant hosts with insects, mites, and pathogens to assess the richness and frequency of damage.Methods We used standard methods of the functional feeding group--damage type system and analyses graphically illustrated as nonmetric multidimensional scaling.Results Of the total surface area represented, we quantified the fraction of the area herbivorized, providing a comparative perspective with regard to several similar studies of herbivory at nearby plant assemblages from the late Paleozoic. To assess insect herbivory, 1,361 plant specimens were analyzed, including fronds, leaves, reproductive structures, axes, and wood impressions. A total of 205 specimens presented one or more instances of insect herbivory (11.17%). Callipterid-peltasperms exhibited the highest number of interactions, with Autunia conferta, Rhachiphyllum schenkii, cf. Lodevia sp., cf. Comia sp., and an unidentified callipterid accounting for 49.34% of all interactions. Medullosans represented 10.53%, followed by lyginopterids with 8.55%. Forty-eight damage types (DTs) were recognized and classified into the nine functional feeding groups of hole feeding, margin feeding, surface feeding, piercing and sucking, oviposition, galling, seed predation, borings, and pathogens.Discussion When compared to analogous late Paleozoic plant assemblages in Texas, Sanzenbacher Ranch exhibited almost all herbivore functional feeding groups, high richness of DTs, and low herbivory index of 0.26. This record shows high plant diversity in a seasonally dry environment that supports a trend of an early Permian increase in DT diversity in southwestern Euramerica. Sanzenbacher Ranch, different from other early Permian plant assemblages, sheds light on the dynamic ecological interactions of these ancient ecosystems.

AB  - Distinguishing vegetation types from satellite images has long been a goal of remote sensing, and the combination of multi-source and multi-temporal remote sensing images for vegetation classification is currently a hot topic in the field. In species-rich mountainous environments, this study selected four remote sensing images from different seasons (two aerial images, one WorldView-2 image, and one UAV image) and proposed a vegetation classification method integrating hierarchical extraction and object-oriented approaches for 11 vegetation types. This method innovatively combines the Random Forest algorithm with a decision tree model, constructing a hierarchical strategy based on multi-temporal feature combinations to progressively address the challenge of distinguishing vegetation types with similar spectral characteristics. Compared to traditional single-temporal classification methods, our approach significantly enhances classification accuracy through multi-temporal feature fusion and comparative experimental validation, offering a novel technical framework for fine-grained vegetation classification under complex land cover conditions. To validate the effectiveness of multi-temporal features, we additionally performed Random Forest classifications on the four individual remote sensing images. The results indicate that (1) for single-temporal images classification, the best classification performance was achieved with autumn images, reaching an overall classification accuracy of 72.36%, while spring images had the worst performance, with an accuracy of only 58.79%; (2) the overall classification accuracy based on multi-temporal features reached 89.10%, which is an improvement of 16.74% compared to the best single-temporal classification (autumn). Notably, the producer accuracy for species such as Quercus acutissima Carr., Tea plantations, Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, Pinus taeda L., Phyllostachys spectabilis C.D.Chu et C.S.Chao, Pinus thunbergii Parl., and Castanea mollissima Blume all exceeded 90%, indicating a relatively ideal classification outcome.

AB  - Soils on the banks of a wadi in the area of a former antimony mine, which closed in 1952, were the subject of almost complete physicochemical characterisation. The soils were found to contain very high concentrations of antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As), as well as being contaminated by other metals (lead (Pb), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn)). These soils are mainly home to steppe species such as Artemisia herba-alba Asso, Lygeum spartum Loefl. ex L. and Thymus algeriensis Boiss. & Reut. This study aimed to identify the metals and metalloids most harmful to vegetation that must be stabilised or removed from contaminated soils. The study also aimed to identify the plant species that prefer metalliferous soils for use in phytostabilisation of polluted soils. To this end, floristic surveys were conducted in each soil sampling plot in which the abundance of each species present was recorded. We calculated species richness and Shannon's diversity index. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the effects of mine proximity, metalloids and metals on plant species diversity and plant species richness, and the impact of mining on plant species presence. The results demonstrated that arsenic (As) (450 mg.kg-1 maximum) and cadmium (Cd) (1.1 mg.kg-1 maximum) had a very significant and important impact on species richness, while mining proximity had a significant effect on species diversity. Mining proximity has indisputably affected the presence of several plant species. Our research clearly shows that several species, including Carthamus lanatus L., Centaurea sicula Leyss. ex DC. and Hippocrepis unisiliquosa L., prefer soils close to the mine and therefore those with the highest levels of metals and metalloids, particularly As and Cd. These species could therefore be suitable for soil remediation in the Sb mining area. Surprisingly, Sb (2600 mg.kg-1 maximum) at high concentrations seems to be less toxic than Cd at low concentrations. It would therefore appear that the study area requires more urgent action to eliminate or stabilise As and Cd than Sb. For soil stabilisation, the most effective approach is to use mainly species that prefer soils close to the mine.

AB  - Phenological responses to climate change vary across trophic levels. However, how trophic phenological synchrony determines species' distributions through its effects on population dynamics has rarely been addressed. Here, we show that phenological variation underlies population and geographical range dynamics in a range-shifting herbivore, and demonstrate its interplay with changing trophic interactions. Using a novel modelling approach, we identify drivers of variation in phenology and population growth (productivity) for populations of the brown argus butterfly (Aricia agestis) feeding on ancestral and novel host plants in the UK. We demonstrate host plant-specific links between phenology and productivity, highlighting their role in the consumer's range expansion. Critically, later butterfly phenology is associated with higher productivity in the annual second brood, especially on novel annual hosts where later activity improves synchrony with germinating plants. In turn, later phenology and higher second brood productivity are associated with more rapid range expansion, particularly in regions where only the novel hosts occur. Therefore, phenological asynchrony imposes limits on local population growth, influencing consumer resource selection, evolutionary responses and emergent range dynamics. How existing and future trophic phenological synchrony determine population dynamics will be critical for the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of climate change.

AB  - Understanding the factors influencing how fast populations can spread across the landscape will be crucial as species ranges shift due to climate change. While the role of abiotic factors in determining expansion speed has been well studied in theory and empirical research, how competition impacts speed has received far less attention. Here, we investigated how seed dispersal distances change in response to competition and how these changes to distributions of dispersed seeds impact expansion speed. We dispersed four genotypes of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana with variation in life history traits into greenhouse mesocosms of either empty habitat or habitat containing the annual grass competitor, Lolium multiflorum. We found that competition decreased both mean and maximum dispersal distance. We then built a simulation model of range expansion with experimental data from this and a prior experiment to explore whether competition slows species expansions primarily through decreasing dispersal or fecundity. We found that competition primarily slows expansion speed through decreases in dispersal, but that when competition impacts both dispersal and fecundity, expansions slow more than with dispersal alone. The genotype with traits associated with longer distance dispersal was the most affected by competition in both experimental dispersal and simulations. This research suggests that not only does competition slow range expansions through decreases in both fecundity and dispersal, but that there may be consequences for evolutionary processes at the leading edge.

AB  - Wild and semidomesticated reindeer are one of the key species in Arctic and subarctic areas, and their population dynamics are closely tied to winter conditions. Difficult snow conditions have been found to decrease the calving success and survivability of reindeer, but the economic effects of variation in winter conditions on reindeer husbandry have not been studied. In this study, we combine state-of-the-art economic-ecological modeling with the analysis of annual reindeer management reports from Finland. These contain local knowledge of herding communities. We quantify the occurrence probabilities of different types of winters from annual management reports and analyze the effects of this variation in winter conditions on reindeer husbandry using an age- and sex-structured bioeconomic reindeer-lichen model. Our results show that difficult winters decrease the net revenues of reindeer husbandry. However, they also protect lichen pastures from grazing, thereby increasing future net revenues. Nonetheless, our solutions show that the variability of winter conditions overall decrease the net income of herders compared to constant winter conditions. Low lichen biomass appears to make reindeer management more sensitive to the effects of difficult winter conditions. We also found that it is economically sensible to use supplementary feeding during difficult winters, but the net revenues still decrease compared to average winters because of the high feeding costs. Overall, our analysis suggests that the increasing variability of winter conditions due to climate change will decrease net revenues in reindeer husbandry. This decrease will still occur even if the most extreme effects of climate change do not occur. This study shows that combining a state-of-the-art bioeconomic model and practitioner knowledge can bring compatible insights, ideas, results, and a bottom-up perspective to the discussion.

AB  - Gopher Tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) is a keystone species of Longleaf Pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems and is legally protected throughout its distribution. Gopher Tortoise habitat has been reduced across the range of the species due to landscape-scale fire suppression and urbanization that have degraded habitat quality. The objective of our study was to understand the foraging ecology of an isolated population of Gopher Tortoises in a scrubby flatwoods ecosystem located in the southern portion of its distribution. We calculated Fiensinger's Proportional Similarity Index (PSI) to determine whether tortoises were generalist or specialist foragers. Based on our results, Gopher Tortoises were generalist foragers, feeding most often on multiple grass species (PSI = 0.788). We also calculated Jacob's Electivity Index (D) and Manly's alpha (a) to determine the selectivity of plant species consumed by tortoises, and these indices demonstrated that tortoises highly selected certain plant species including fruits of Hog Plum (Ximenia americana, D = 0.744; a = 0.121), foliage of Spurge Nettle (Cnidoscolus stimulosus, D = 0.821; a = 0.180) and Prickly Lettuce (Lactuca serriola, D = 0.772; a = 0.139). We calculated Shannon's Diversity Indices to test whether tortoises selected foraging trails that differ in diversity compared to random points within the surrounding landscape. Foraging trail plant diversity was not significantly different than the surrounding landscape plant diversity through equitability analysis of Shannon's diversity. Our results provide a better understanding of the foraging ecology of Gopher Tortoises, including their foraging selectivity.

AB  - We monitored the abundance of a non-native (Rhinogobius sp. OR) and two native stream gobies (R. fluviatilis and R. nagoyae) over a decade, from 1995 to 2004, in a fixed reach of a tributary of the Kamo River, southwestern Japan. The non-native Rhinogobius sp. OR appeared and reproduced in 1997, when an increased deposition of fine sediments occurred. However, after a severe spate in 1999, the non-native goby almost completely disappeared from the study reach, while the density of the native R. fluviatilis increased. The severe spate is likely to have prevented the establishment of the non-native goby. Our results provide an example of abiotic barriers to invasion.

AB  - The emergence of the plasmid-mediated tigecycline resistance gene tetX family in pig farms has attracted worldwide attention. The use of tetracycline antibiotics in pig farms has a facilitating effect on the prevalence of the tetX family, but the relationship among its presence, expression, and resistance phenotype in resistant bacteria is unknown. In this study, the presence and expression characteristics of tetracycline resistance genes (TRGs) in 89 strains of doxycycline-resistant E. coli (DRE) isolated from pig manure samples from 20 pig farms under low concentrations of doxycycline stress (2 mu g/mL) were analyzed. The detection rate of tetO was 96.63%, which is higher than those of other TRGs, such as tetA (94.38%), tetX (76.40%), tetB (73.03%), and tet(X4) (69.66%). At least three TRG types were present in DRE strains, which thus showed extensive resistance to tetracycline antibiotics, and 37% of these strains were resistant to tigecycline. In the presence of a low concentration of doxycycline, tetA played an important role, and the expression and existence ratio of TRGs indicated low expression of TRGs. Furthermore, the doxycycline resistance of DRE was jointly determined by the total absolute abundance of TRGs, and the absolute abundance of tetX and tet(X4) was significantly positively associated with tigecycline resistance in DRE (P < 0.05). Overall, DRE isolated from swine manure is an important reservoir of the tetX family, which suggests that DRE in swine manure has a high risk of tigecycline resistance, poses a potential threat to human health, and should be of public concern.

AB  - Lake ecosystems are impacted by anthropogenic disturbances and have become vulnerable worldwide. Highly disturbed lake ecosystems are not well understood due to the lack of data on changes in the structures and functions of ecosystems. In this paper, we focus on Lake Baiyangdian (BYDL), the largest shallow lake in North China. Following the establishment of the Xiong'an New Area (XNA) in 2017, concerted efforts to restore BYDL's aquatic environment have been undertaken, which has led to significant changes in the structures and functions of the ecosystems. We evaluated the biomass dynamics of main biological communities and detected the regime shifts of environmental factors in BYDL from 2016 to 2023. Further, we constructed a food web model for the BYDL ecosystem in 2023 by using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) and made a comparison with the reported results in 2018. The results showed significant changes in the ecosystem structure of BYDL over the last 6 years. In 2023, the submerged macrophytes biomass in the system increased by 4.2 times compared to 2018, leading to an increase in total system throughput. We found that BYDL changed from an algal-type lake to a macrophyte-dominated lake. In addition, we found TN, NH4+-N, and CODMn were significantly decreased in BYDL during the restoration. TN and NH4+-N had a change point in approximately 2021, indicating that a regime shift had occurred during restoration. Overall, the BYDL ecosystem was in an immature but developing state, as indicated by ecological network analysis indicators. Nutrient-loading reduction, hydrological regulation, and rational biomanipulation may be the potential driving factors of change in the BYDL ecosystem. We strongly recommend the timely harvesting of submerged macrophytes, the proliferation and release of herbivorous fishes, and the assessment of the ecological capacity of carnivorous fishes in the future ecological restoration of BYDL.

AB  - It is believed that grazing has an effect on the functioning and performance of flowers, as well as their association with pollinator preferences and plant reproduction. However, the effects of grazing time on nectar secretion and pollen removal are still not fully understood. We hypothesized that seasonal grazing influences pollinator visitation and pollen removal by altering aboveground biomass and nectar secretion. In this study, we conducted field experiments to measure above-ground biomass, flower number per capitulum and capitulum number per plant, nectar volume and concentration, pollinator visitation of male- and female-phase flowers, pollen removal (e.g., number of pollens exported and deposition on a pollinator body and stigma), seed set ratio, and seed number between summer and winter grazing pastures of Saussurea stella. Our findings demonstrated that summer grazing reduced the above-ground biomass, nectar secretion, and pollinator visitation of male-phase flowers, thereby decreasing pollen export. There was a positive correlation between nectar secretion and above-ground biomass, as well as between pollinator visitation and nectar secretion, the number of pollens exported, and pollinator visitation of male-phase flowers. Experiments involving the removal of leaves revealed that a decrease in above-ground biomass was associated with a decrease in nectar secretion, pollinator visitation of male-phase flowers, and pollen removal. However, plants growing in summer and winter grazing pastures had comparable nectar secretion, pollinator visitation of female-phase flowers, seed number, and seed set ratio. Our results suggested that seasonal grazing influences nectar rewards, pollinator preferences, pollen removal, and male fitness. These findings would shed new light on the influence of herbivores on plant-pollinator interactions in the Tibetan meadow.

AB  - Waste treatment using black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens L.) larvae is an emerging technology that reduces livestock manure disposal. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different growth stage BSF larvae on the decomposition potential (Experiment 1) and characteristics (Experiment 2) of pig manure. BSF larval instars were randomly divided in three groups according to their developmental stage, with three replicates per group, using a randomized block design. Each treatment group consisted of 1 kg of 2nd, 3rd, or 4th instar BSF larvae added in 10 kg of pig manure (Group 1, 2, or 3, respectively). In Experiment 1, 2nd and 3rd instar BSF larvae treatments resulted in greater decomposition levels of pig manure compared with 4th instar BSF larvae groups. In Experiment 2, BSF larvae improved the nutrient content of manure, leading to an increase in the total nitrogen levels and a decrease in total carbon content and C:N ratio, rendering it suitable for use as an organic fertilizer. In addition, the increased N levels of treated BSF manure were not related to lower pH levels. BSF larvae can greatly reduce ADF and NDF pig manure contents as a result of the larvae's waste reduction potential. Overall, BSF 3rd instar larvae have proven to be a useful tool for the sustainable management of pig manure by strongly increasing its decomposition ability and can be an organic fertilizer for agricultural purposes that reduce ADF and NDF contents through composting.

AB  - Plant-herbivore interactions are often regulated by a series of direct and indirect buffer mechanisms (compensatory or defensive plant responses, population control, alternative resources) that can determine the relative stability of the system. In plant-dominated marine environments, these mechanisms are particularly important given how vulnerable these systems are to strong consumer pressure. Here, we evaluate the presence and, where possible, the strength, of five mechanisms that get activated under high herbivory pressure and are capable of dampening their effects in a seagrass meadow ecosystem: 1) seagrass compensatory growth, 2) increase in plant resistance, 3) availability of alternative resources, 4) predatory control and 5) density-dependent control. We assessed these mechanisms for the interaction between the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus through a short-term series of controlled field and laboratory experiments after simulated or natural herbivory events. Of the five mechanisms tested, we found that three mechanisms - availability of alternative resources, increased predation rate and reduction in sea urchin numbers - effectively dampened herbivory and worked as potential buffering mechanisms. In contrast, plant compensatory growth and resistance did not show clear responses. While compensatory growth and plant resistance are direct plant mechanism to tolerate the effects of herbivory, the rest are indirect mechanisms that begin with a modification of a plant trait (i.e. canopy height) that influences other species preference and/or behaviour, which in turn influences plant consumption. These adaptive behaviours may be a crucial and often overlooked factor in the remarkable resilience that Mediterranean seagrass ecosystems show to herbivory.

AB  - 1. Public interest in nature-based recreation is growing, including visitation to protected areas. However, the level of recreation in these areas that causes detectable changes in wildlife behaviour remains unknown, and many studies that investigate wildlife responses to humans do so in high-visitation areas.
   2. We used camera traps to investigate the spatial and temporal responses of brown bears (Ursus arctos), black bears (Ursus americanus), moose (Alces alces) and wolves (Canis lupis) to experimentally manipulated levels of human activity in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska during summers 2017 and 2018. Human activity was restricted at some sites and concentrated at others, and these human impact treatments were swapped mid-season. The park has very low on-land visitation (similar to 40,000 on-land tourists per year), making it a unique study system to investigate wildlife responses to low levels of human activity.
   3. Detections did not exceed five per week for any species unless human activity was absent (zero photos of humans were taken). However, spatial and temporal patterns of wildlife activity in relation to human activity were nuanced and species specific. Moose shifted their activity patterns to better align with when people were most active. Black bears were more likely to be detected in areas of high human activity but used high-use areas less intensely than low-use areas. Wolves used areas of high human impact more intensely, but shifted their activity to be more strongly nocturnal.
   4. Our results highlight the importance of considering both spatial and temporal responses of wildlife to human activity. Additionally, and arguably most importantly, we detected changes in wildlife behaviour in response to humans in a national park with relatively low tourism. Although natural processes may dominate in protected areas, our results indicate that even low levels of human activity can alter wildlife behaviour.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated that nearly any level of human activity in a protected area may alter wildlife behaviour. However, it is unreasonable to expect protected areas to be completely devoid of human activity. Thus, management of these areas will need to balance the desires of humans to view wildlife with the likely impacts.

AB  - In order to determine whether organic production may be a viable option for goat farmers of the lower Mixteca region of Puebla, Mexico, in order to increase sustainability of their farms, we evaluated the extent to which these goat farms fulfill organic standards. Additionally, we revised their level of sustainability by calculating an Organic Livestock Conversion Index (OLCI) using 10 indicators and 36 variables. Information was obtained through two means: direct observation and a questionnaire applied to 119 goat farmers of six municipalities of the region. These goat farms principally consist of creole goats that graze in extensive communal rangelands and grasslands in non-arable lands with xerophytic vegetation, and their principal product is meat of adult goats. The goat farms had a moderate level of OLCI (48.0-53.6%) as well as a moderate level of sustainability (46.0-58%) for the goat farms included in this study). Five indicators showed limited compliance of the goat farms, with organic standards. Five showed a high level of compliance. The greater the OLCI value, the greater the sustainability of the goat farms. Increasing the level of compliance of the goat farms of the lower Mixteca region of Puebla, with the organic standards, which would in turn increase their level of sustainability, would require improving technical, social, environmental, and economic aspects of these farms, as well as co-responsibility in promoting sustainable organic goat farming by the different social actors involved (farmers, researchers, technical advisors, and policymakers).

AB  - Animal ecology and evolution have long been known to shape host physiology, but more recently, the gut microbiome has been identified as a mediator between animal ecology and evolution and health. The gut microbiome has been shown to differ between wild and domestic animals, but the role of these differences for domestic animal evolution remains unknown. Gut microbiome responses to new animal genotypes and local environmental change during domestication may promote specific host phenotypes that are adaptive (or not) to the domestic environment. Because the gut microbiome supports host immune function, understanding the effects of animal ecology and evolution on the gut microbiome and immune phenotypes is critical. We investigated how domestication affects the gut microbiome and host immune state in multiple pig populations across five domestication contexts representing domestication status and current living conditions: free-ranging wild, captive wild, free-ranging domestic, captive domestic in research or industrial settings. We observed that domestication context explained much of the variation in gut microbiome composition, pathogen abundances and immune markers, yet the main differences in the repertoire of metabolic genes found in the gut microbiome were between the wild and domestic genetic lineages. We also documented population-level effects within domestication contexts, demonstrating that fine scale environmental variation also shaped host and microbe features. Our findings highlight that understanding which gut microbiome and immune traits respond to host genetic lineage and/or scales of local ecology could inform targeted interventions that manipulate the gut microbiome to achieve beneficial health outcomes.

AB  - Arid and semi-arid environments are characterized by highly variable and unpredictable rainfall patterns, which significantly affect the structure and function of natural ecosystems. Understanding the interconnected relationship between climate variability, forage availability, and livestock dynamics in these regions is crucial to ensure sustainable management. This study provides novel insights into the effects of rainfall variability on natural forage resources and livestock populations in Botswana. In this arid region, traditional livestock farming remains a key economic and food security pillar. By employing a mathematical model based on plant-herbivore interactions, this article quantitatively evaluates the impact of changes in rainfall timing and intensity on forage biomass and, subsequently, livestock populations. A robust analysis of critical threshold values for ecosystem sustainability is possible when real-world climate data are incorporated. This study examines the effects of harvesting and rainfall variability on livestock dynamics across different locations in Botswana. Delayed rainfall leads to a sharp decline in livestock, while Sehitlwa sees biomass loss without a notable reduction in herd size. In Kgagodi, for example, livestock numbers decline by 37% without harvesting, but they remain stable with controlled harvesting. Conversely, Letlhakeng experiences a 6% increase in livestock numbers despite delayed rainfall, which results in a biomass decline. Both Mabutsane and Letlhakeng maintain stable livestock numbers. The findings confirm that early and intense rainfall enhances livestock productivity, while delayed or reduced rainfall leads to population decline, aligning with observed trends in historical data. Additionally, the study underscores the potential of adaptive livestock harvesting strategies as a viable approach to mitigating climate-related risks in grazing systems. As this work integrates theoretical modeling with empirical climate data, it contributes to understanding arid land dynamics, providing a predictive method for assessing ecosystem responses to climate variability. These insights are invaluable for policymakers, conservationists, and local farmers seeking sustainable livestock management practices in the face of changing climatic conditions.

AB  - Interspecific interactions (e.g., competition, predation) are core determinants of insect population evolution, geographical distribution, trophic dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Following its recent invasion of eastern Asia, the fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) co-inhabits maize fields with native lepidopteran herbivores, such as the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura. Here, drawing upon laboratory and field studies, we demonstrate how late-instar S. frugiperda larvae directly prey upon S. litura immature stages and competitively displace them from the maize whorl. Individual maize plants did not mediate the above interactions, with herbivore-damaged leaves not affecting the development rate of either species. In the field, ecological niches of S. frugiperda and S. litura overlapped, with species-specific occupancy rates of whorl-stage leaves (vegetative phase) and ears or tassels (reproductive phase) exceeding 70% and 90%, respectively. Field cage trials showed that S. frugiperda larvae either preyed upon or repelled S. litura larvae from maize plants, routinely resulting in more than 90% mortality of the latter. Field visits and cage studies in Yunnan (SW China) also revealed how-within an approx. 1-year time period-S. frugiperda has become a dominant species in local maize fields and co-infestation of both herbivores on the same plant is rare. Overall, our work shows how the invasive S. frugiperda exhibits a clear competitive advantage over native lepidopterans and could replace certain species within local agroecosystems. This study not only unveils the mechanistic causes of rapid ecological shifts within S. frugiperda-invaded cropping systems, but may also guide subsequent monitoring and management interventions.

This new fossil material that includes several elements of the appendicular skeleton comes from the French sites of Pontlevoy (MN5), A & eacute;rotrain (MN4), and Artenay (MN4). The postcranial skeleton of Amphimoschus is relevant to determine its phylogenetic affinities within the Pecora and to better understand the evolution of cervoids, the pecoran ruminants more closely related to deer. Our total-evidence tip-dating phylogenetic analysis recovers three well-supported main lineages of crown pecorans (Giraffomorpha, Bovidomorpha and Cervidomorpha) and places Amphimoschus as a basal member of a monophyletic Cervoidea. Thus, we reject the recent assignment of Amphimoschus to the Bovoidea, and confirm the presence of hornless forms at the base of the cervoid clade. We define the Cervoidea as the least inclusive clade of crown pecorans including Amphimoschus and the Cervidae. We also define the Cervidomorpha as the least inclusive clade of crown pecorans containing Namibiomeryx and the Cervidae. Cervidomorphs were relatively successful in the Miocene, spreading through Africa, Eurasia and North America during the Early-Middle Miocene. Amphimoschus xishuiensis Y.-K. Li et al., 2021 is recovered here as the closest sister group to the Bovidae and hence cannot be considered to belong to the genus Amphimoschus. We erect for it the new genus Dimidiomeryx. Our topology adds complexity to the recently revamped hypothesis based on molecular data regarding the single origin of the cranial appendages in pecoran ruminants. Amphimoschus probably had a sitatunga-like lifestyle, sporting sprawling-out fingers with very long third phalanges, long limbs and a general configuration of the appendicular skeleton that probably allowed it to live in swampy/semiaquatic environments.

AB  - In tropical montane South-East Asia, recent changes in land use have induced increased runoff, soil erosion and in-stream suspended sediment loads. Land use change is also contributing to increased microbial pathogen dissemination and contamination of stream waters. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is frequently used as an indicator of faecal contamination. Field rain simulations were conducted to examine how E. coli is exported from the surface of upland, agricultural soils during runoff events. The objectives were to characterize the loss dynamics of this indicator from agricultural soils contaminated with livestock waste, and to identify the effect of splash on washoff. Experiments were performed on nine 1 m(2) plots, amended or not with pig or poultry manure. Each plot was divided into two 0.5 m(2) sub-plots. One of the two sub-plots was protected with a mosquito net for limiting the raindrop impact effects. Runoff, soil detachment by raindrop impact and its entrainment by runoff, and E. coli loads and discharge were measured for each sub-plot. The results show that raindrop impact strongly enhances runoff generation, soil detachment and entrainment and E. coli export. When the impact of raindrops was reduced with a mosquito net, total runoff was reduced by more than 50%, soil erosion was on average reduced by 90% and E. coli export from the amended soil surface was on average 3 to 8 times lower. A coupled physics-based approach was performed using the Cast3M platform for modelling the time evolutions of runoff, solid particles detachment and transfer and bacteria transport that were measured for one of the nine plots. After estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil erodibility and attachment rate of bacteria, model outputs were consistent with measured runoff coefficients, suspended sediment and E. coli loads. This work therefore underlines the need to maintain adequate vegetation at the soil surface to avoid the erosion and export of soil borne potential pathogens towards downstream aquatic systems.

AB  - An organism's fitness depends strongly on its age and size at maturation. Although the evolutionary forces acting on these critical life history traits have been heavily scrutinized, the developmental mechanisms underpinning intraspecific variation in adult size and development time remain much less well-understood. Using RNA interference, I here show that the highly conserved sex-determination gene doublesex (dsx) mediates sexual size dimorphism (SSD) in the gazelle dung beetle Digitonthophagus gazella. Because doublesex undergoes sex-specific splicing and sex-limited isoforms regulate different target genes, this suggests that dsx contributes to the resolution of intralocus sexual conflict in body size. However, these results contrast with previous studies demonstrating that dsx does not affect body size or SSD in Drosophila. This indicates that intraspecific body size variation is underlain by contrasting developmental mechanisms in different insect lineages. Furthermore, although male D. gazella have a longer development time than females, sexual bimaturism was not affected by dsx expression knockdown. In addition, and in contrast to secondary sexual morphology, dsx did not significantly affect nutritional plasticity in life history. Taken together, these findings indicate that dsx signalling contributes to intraspecific life history variation but that dsx's function in mediating sexual dimorphism in life history differs among traits and species. More generally, these findings suggest that genes ancestrally tasked with sex determination have been co-opted into the developmental regulation of life history traits and may represent an underappreciated mechanism of life history evolution.

AB  - Classical biocontrol can be an efficient method to manage invasive plants, although the effectiveness of biocontrol agents (BCAs) is highly variable. The role of plant defenses and their response to environmental gradients and herbivore damage, may partially explain this variability. Air potato (Dioscorea bulbifera) is a highly invasive plant in the USA, particularly in Florida. Lilioceris cheni Gressitt and Kimoto 1961 (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), a specialist on D. bulbifera, successfully established as its BCA, although its efficacy varies across Florida. Phytochemicals in D. bulbifera, such as phenols or saponins, may mediate preference and performance of L. cheni. In the field, we recorded plant cover and beetle damage at thirteen populations across Florida. In the greenhouse, we conducted chemical and feeding bioassays by applying jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) to D. bulbifera plants and recorded beetle damage, and quantified saponin and phenol production. We also conducted olfaction-based choice bioassays to determine beetle preferences. We found that beetle damage was negatively correlated with plant cover in the field and that damage and saponin levels were positively correlated. In the greenhouse, JA-treated plants had higher herbivory and saponin levels than SA-treated plants. JA-treated and Beetle damaged plants were also preferred in choice bioassays. These findings imply potential synergistic effects of BCA feeding through induction of plant defenses, which may inform the timing and frequency of BCA field releases. Our findings that induced plant defenses increase BCA feeding, and potentially their effectiveness, may apply more broadly because all approved BCA are highly specialized on their host plants. Therefore, interactions between invasive plants and their BCAs, and how they are mediated by plant defenses, deserve more attention as potential methods to increase the effectiveness of classical biocontrol.

AB  - The main challenge of this work is to identify a novel approach to reuse and valorize brewers' spent grain (BSG) to produce a new source of income for the brewers in terms of self-consumption or selling goods. Therefore, this study explored the composting behavior of BSG mixed with different organic materials: wheat straw with pig slurry solid fraction and wheat straw with sheep manure, MIX1 and MIX2, respectively. The composting process was carried out in bins by comparing two different composting strategies: manual turning (MT) and static composting xxx- without turning operations (ST). During the experimental trial, BSG mixtures were chemically analyzed for pH, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen, total organic carbon, volatile solids, carbon to nitrogen ratio, and moisture content. Furthermore, the final composted materials were evaluated according to the physicochemical and biological limits fixed by the European regulation (2019/1009) and the Italian law (D.Lgs 75/2010). At the end of the composting process, the C/N ratio ranged from 11.6 to 15.5, the humification ratio ranged from 12.4 to 13.8 and the NH4+-N/NO3--N ratio was lower than 0.5 indicating, in all investigated treatments, a good degree of maturation. However, as evidenced by the high pH values and low Germination Index, the sheep manure, as starting material, proved less effective than the solid fraction of pig slurry, probably due to excessive trampling and slow litter change. Finally, concerning the two composting strategies investigated, the obtained results highlighted that the composting strategy did not affect the final compost quality.

AB  - Metagenomics can generate data on the diet of herbivores, without the need for primer selection and PCR enrichment steps as is necessary in metabarcoding. Metagenomic approaches to diet analysis have remained relatively unexplored, requiring validation of bioinformatic steps. Currently, no metagenomic herbivore diet studies have utilized both chloroplast and nuclear markers as reference sequences for plant identification, which would increase the number of reads that could be taxonomically informative. Here, we explore how in silico simulation of metagenomic data sets resembling sequences obtained from faecal samples can be used to validate taxonomic assignment. Using a known list of sequences to create simulated data sets, we derived reliable identification parameters for taxonomic assignments of sequences. We applied these parameters to characterize the diet of western capercaillies (Tetrao urogallus) located in Norway, and compared the results with metabarcoding trnL P6 loop data generated from the same samples. Both methods performed similarly in the number of plant taxa identified (metagenomics 42 taxa, metabarcoding 43 taxa), with no significant difference in species resolution (metagenomics 24%, metabarcoding 23%). We further observed that while metagenomics was strongly affected by the age of faecal samples, with fresh samples outperforming old samples, metabarcoding was not affected by sample age. On the other hand, metagenomics allowed us to simultaneously obtain the mitochondrial genome of the western capercaillies, thereby providing additional ecological information. Our study demonstrates the potential of utilizing metagenomics for diet reconstruction but also highlights key considerations as compared to metabarcoding for future utilization of this technique.

AB  - The margins of Paleolake Otero in southern New Mexico, USA, contain one of the largest concentrations of fossilized late Pleistocene (Rancholabrean) megafauna trackways in North America. These fossil footprints include tracks of Ice Age proboscideans, ground sloth, dire wolf, and camelids, as well as humans. Biomechanical interpretations of these fossil footprints suggest that prehistoric people in the basin regularly interacted with the megafauna. However, these trackway studies employ a geomorphic context that assumes an unlikely static landscape that changed very little after the human-megafauna interaction occurred during much of the terminal Pleistocene to the latest Holocene. In this study, we present a new lacustrine paleoclimate record from the western margin of Paleolake Otero to demonstrate that the lake underwent six developmental phases as lake levels waxed and waned at the end of the last Ice Age, reflecting a dynamic shoreline. We also reconcile how different factors have complicated the currently proposed timing of these human-megafauna trackway intersections; namely, the lake is now thought to have persisted during the terminal Pleistocene longer than previously thought, and multiple older pre-Ice Age trackways are thought to have been exhumed by Holocene wind erosion. Finally, we propose an alternative model that states that the human trackways are not contemporaneous with nearby megafauna trackways, but simply reflect humans crossing over re-exhumed, and much older, trackway surfaces.

AB  - Marking activity is important for intraspecific communication of carnivorans, and brown bear ( Ursus arctos L.), in particular. Marking, together with olfactory and visual signals, contribute to the spatial distribution of individuals, reduces the likelihood of unwanted encounters with representatives of same and other species, informs about the social status of individuals, facilitates the meeting of sexual partners during the rut, and accomplish the functions of territorial protection. Bears mainly choose trees as marking objects. To study brown bear communication system is important for understanding natural population processes whose disruption caused by human activities requires targeted conservation measures. The study site was located in the Vostochny Reserve on the eastern coast of Sakhalin Island (50 degrees 30'-50 degrees 42'N, 143 degrees 33'-143 degrees 42'E) in 2010-2012. The study area is characterized by mountainous relief with dark coniferous taiga as the dominant plant formation. We described 218 bear marking trees along routes in the basins of the Vengeri and Pursh-Pursh rivers and registered tree species and its trunk diameter, forest type, and terrain. To compare marking trees with unmarked, but available for bears' marking, we described all unmarked trees (n = 1479) within a 10 m radius from the marking trees, indicating their species and diameter. We registered and measured fresh (of the current year) and old signal marks on the trees: rubbing sings, debarking, and bear bites (See Fig. 1) and scratches. Brown bear pedal marks near marking trees were also registered. We found five species of trees marked by brown bears: Sakhalin fir ( Abies sachalinensis F. Schmidt) Mast.) ( See Fig. 2 ), Ayan spruce ( Picea ajanensis (Scibold & Zucc.) Carriere), Cajander larch ( Larix cajanderi Mayr), goat willow ( Salix caprea L.), and Erman's birch ( Betula ermanii Cham.). Most of the marking trees were Sakhalin fir (84.4% of all marking trees), which, according to the selection analysis were the only species preferred by bears (Jacobs' index = 0.23; see Fig. 3 ). Brown bears preferred to mark trees with a larger trunk diameter than available in the environment (average 29 and 25 cm, respectively; W = 191904; p < 0.001; see Table 1 ). Among the marking trees 90% were alive. Among the fresh marking signs on a marking trees rubbing signs were the most often (45.4%) and located at a height of 20 to 268 cm. The debarking of the current year was registered on 7.8% of marking trees, and the maximum damage height was 341 cm. Fresh bear claw scratches were on 35.2% of the marking trees. The average upper limit of scratches was 222.9 cm, with a maximum of 390 cm. Fresh bear bites were on 13.8% of the tree trunks, ranging up to a height of 321 cm. Many marking trees are permanent for bears and used annually; some of those are used most intensively. Repeated marking of the same objects by different individuals over a long period of time makes them communication centers of brown bears at the population level. We found bear pedal marks (depressions in the ground left by the bear's paws) around nine trees. They comprised 5-25 holes from paw prints. The nature of the marking signs left by the bears had similar features to those in the other parts of the species' area. Most of the marking trees (89.4%) were located in the floodplains and on the terraces, the rest were on the slopes of different exposure. Bears marked trees in the forests dominated by Sakhalin fir (73.9%), less often with dominance of Cajander larch (12.5%), Erman's birch (7.
   4%), Ayan spruce (5.1%), and in floodplain deciduous forests (1.1%). The vast majority of marking trees were located on bear trails (210 trees, 96.3%). The location of marking trees along the trails increases the effectiveness of trees involved in animals' communication activities, facilitating their detection. The marking complexes included two trees (27 times), three trees (10 times), four trees (5 times), five trees (2 times), and six and seven trees (1 time). The linear frequency of tree marking by bears on forest trails was 3.2 trees per 1 km. Such density of marked objects is relatively high, which is due to the relatively low anthropogenic pressure on the Reserve territory. The relative density of marking trees varies from site to site and depends on the bears number, the availability of trees suitable for marking, trails, anthropogenic pressure, and other factors. The frequency of tree -marking is a parameter that can be successfully used in determining the relative population density of brown bear and monitoring of its population state.

AB  - Because of climate change, heavy precipitation is likely to become frequent and intense, thereby increasing the risk of shigellosis occurrence. However, few studies examined the impact of heavy precipitation on shigellosis and its impact modifiers in developed countries. This study aims to analyze the association between heavy precipitation and shigel-losis in Taiwan, and to identify the vulnerable population and impact modifiers. We adopted a case-crossover design, and used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for shigellosis occurrence. Information were col-lected on the daily shigellosis cases, precipitation, temperature, and typhoons from 1994 to 2015, and yearly data of medical resources and environmental factors were obtained at the city level from 1998 to 2015. Stratification analyses were performed by age, sex, medical resource, and environmental factors. We discovered that heavy precipitation >= 80 mm/day considerably increased the risk of shigellosis occurrence. The ORs of heavy rain (80 to <200 mm/ day) were 2.08-2.26 at lags 0-1. The ORs of extremely heavy rain (>= 200 mm/day) increased to 2.17-4.73 at lags 5-8. Moreover, the effect of heavy precipitation was greater under high temperature condition (>= 23.6 degrees C). Adults were more susceptible to heavy-precipitation-associated shigellosis, especially the elderly. Males experienced margin-ally higher effects than females did. Moreover, cities with more medical resources and forest cover and higher percent-age of completed storm sewers had lower effects; however, dense population and higher pig density were the risk factors. Although the high water-supply penetration rate did not decrease Shigella infection after heavy precipitation, it did lower the risk of typhoon-related shigellosis. In conclusion, hot temperature could enhance the impact of heavy precipitation on shigellosis. Public health interventions should be introduced according to the lag period after heavy precipitation, particularly in areas with high population density, proportion of elderly people, and pig density. The improvement of medical resources and tree cover as well as the construction of storm sewers and piped water systems might be mitigation measures that can be considered.

AB  - By-catch is the most significant direct threat marine megafauna face at the global scale. However, the magnitude and spatial patterns of megafauna by-catch are still poorly understood, especially in regions with very limited monitoring and expanding fisheries. The Indian Ocean is a globally important region for megafauna biodiversity and for tuna fisheries, but has limited by-catch data. Anecdotal and scattered information indicates high by-catch could be a major threat. Here, we adapt a Productivity Susceptibility Analysis tool designed for data-poor contexts to present the first spatially explicit estimates of by-catch risk of sea turtles, elasmobranchs, and cetaceans in the three major tuna fishing gears (purse seines, longlines, and drift gill nets). Our assessment highlights a potential opportunity for multi-taxa conservation benefits by concentrating management efforts in particular coastal regions. Most coastal waters in the northern Indian Ocean, including countries that have had a minimal engagement with regional management bodies, stand out as high risk for fisheries interactions. In addition to species known to occur in tuna gears, we find high vulnerability to multiple gear types for many poorly known elasmobranchs that do not fall under any existing conservation and management measures. Our results indicate that current by-catch mitigation measures, which focus on safe-release practices, are unlikely to adequately reduce the substantial cumulative fishing impacts on vulnerable species. Preventative solutions that reduce interactions with non-target species (such as closed areas or seasons, or modifications to gear and fishing tactics) are crucial for alleviating risks to megafauna from fisheries.

AB  - We examined the genetic diversity and phlogeographic characters of European Roe Deer populations across its distribution range in Iran. Mitochondrial DNA from 46 samples were sequenced for 1138 bp of cytochrome b and 1020 bp of ND2 genes and analysed alongside the retrieved sequences from GenBank in a concatenated form. The results demonstrated a relatively low nucleotide diversity and high haplotype diversity in the Roe Deer populations of Iran. Two distinct clusters of Roe Deer populations, in the northern and in the western/northwestern part of the country, were recognised based on phylogenetic trees, haplotype network analyses, and Bayesian structuring tests. The presence of some individuals of the western/northwestern regions in the clade of the northern population can be assumed as evidence for occasional gene flow between these two regions. Furthermore, the samples from both populations of Iran were clustered with samples from European countries. It seems this species probably entered Iran from Europe through northern Iran, and then spread to the western/northwestern regions of the country over time.

AB  - Mesowear is a dietary proxy that relates attritive wear and abrasive wear to the shape of worn tooth cusps of ungulates. Traditional mesowear methods categorize cusps according to relief and sharpness. A geometric morphometric approach has the potential to measure shape with higher precision and to discover unrecognized aspects of cusp shape, possibly improving the efficacy of mesowear. We quantified mesowear in extant Ruminantia, using a 2-D semilandmark outline technique on upper second molar metacones generated from photographs. Among the 91 species sampled, 65 were preassigned to dietary categories, browser, grazer, mixed feeder, and frugivore based on substantiated documentation of diet in the wildlife literature. Metacone cusp shape and metacone mesowear score were found to be independent of size. Principal component and discriminant function analyses of Procrustes transformed semilandmark coordinates revealed two diet-related components of cusp shape. The primary component is related to the traditional mesowear variables of cusp height and side steepness. The secondary shape component reveals variation in the mesiodistal symmetry of the metacone and may relate to a proal vector during the power stroke phase or the relative orientation of the cusps with respect to the chewing stroke vector. Discriminant function analysis of semilandmark data accurately classified the diets of species more frequently (67.2%) than the traditional mesowear method (56.1%). The semilandmark data successfully recognized the diets of grazing and browsing species with correct classification rates ranging from 69% to 95%. The diets of frugivorous and mixed feeding species were less frequently correctly recognized (33%-53%). Mixed feeding diets may be more difficult to recognize due to more heterogeneous diets when compared to browsers and grazers. Frugivores are more difficult to recognize because their rounded cusp apices resemble those of mixed feeders and grazers. We conclude that quantitative shape analysis improves the potential of mesowear. When used as a dietary proxy, we anticipate that mesowear analysis will correctly categorize the diets of most species. When misclassifications are made, they may most often be misclassifications of generalist mixed feeders and frugivores as either browsers or grazers.

AB  - Intensively reared animals have higher levels of antibiotic resistance in feces than those living in small-scale and free-range ways, according to genotype and phenotype profiles of antibiotic resistance in animal feces from eight Chinese farms.
   Animal feces from livestock farming can be a major source of antibiotic resistance to the environment, but a clear gap exists on how the resistance reservoir in feces alters as farming activities intensify. Here, we sampled feces from eight Chinese farms, where yak, sheep, pig, and horse were reared under free-range to intensive conditions, and determined fecal resistance using both genotype and phenotype approaches. Animals reared intensively exhibited increased diversity of antibiotic resistance genes and greater resistance phenotypes in feces, which were cross-correlated. Furthermore, at the metagenome contig level, antibiotic resistance genes were co-located with mobile genetic elements at a higher frequency (27.38%) as farming intensified, with associated resistance phenotypes being less coupled with bacterial phylogeny. Intensified farming also expanded the multidrug resistance preferentially carried on pathogens in fecal microbiomes. Overall, farming intensification can increase antibiotic resistance genotypes and phenotypes in domestic animal feces, with implications for environmental health.

AB  - The global rise in plastic production has led to significant plastic deposition in aquatic ecosystems, releasing chemical compounds as plastics degrade. Among these, bisphenol A (BPA) is a major global concern due to its endocrine-disrupting effects and widespread presence in aquatic environments. Furthermore, the toxicity of BPA on aquatic organisms can be modulated by global change stressors such as temperature, which plays an essential role in the metabolism of organisms, including the degradation and accumulation of toxic compounds. In this study, we aimed to understand how temperature can modulate the toxic effect of BPA on a phytoplankton species (Cryptomonas ovata) and how this effect can be transferred to its herbivorous consumer (Daphnia magna). To do this, we first determined the sensitivity of C. ovata over a BPA gradient (0-10 mg L-1). Subsequently, we experimentally determined how the increase in temperature (+5 degrees C) could modify the toxic effect of BPA on the physiology, metabolism and growth of the phytoplankton. Finally, we investigated how this effect transferred to the growth rate of D. magna through food. Our results show a negative effect of BPA on C. ovata from 5 mg BPA L-1, affecting its photosynthetic yield of photosystem II, net primary production, respiration, and growth. This effect was accelerated when the temperature was higher. Additionally, the growth rate of D. magna also decreased when fed on C. ovata grown in the presence of BPA and high temperature. Our results indicate that high temperature can accelerate the toxic effects of BPA on organisms located at the base of the food web and this effect could be transferred to higher levels through food.

AB  - A 120-day experiment investigated the new organic raw materials for Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) feeding on growth, nutritional parameters, digestibility, and histology. An organic control diet (CON) and three diets with 100% organic raw materials-the rest of rainbow trout, visceral Iberian pig, and insects as a protein source (TRO, IBE, and INS)-were tested. After the experiment, growth, nutritional parameters, digestibility, and histology were measured. The CON diet-fed seabream obtained the highest weight; there was no difference between the experimental diets. The crude protein content was the highest in seabream fed the TRO and INS diets. Crude fat was the highest value observed in the CON diet. High digestibility was observed in seabream-fed IBE and INS diets. Except for EAA methionine (Met), there were no static differences in retention efficiency. The diet with the highest hydrolysis rate was IBE. Diet differences were significant but had the typical healthy liver morphology of seabream. Seabream fed on the TRO and INS diets had shorter distal gut measurements. In conclusion, the full substitution of fishmeal with organic raw materials, including rainbow trout remains, Iberian pig viscera, and insects, offers several benefits in terms of digestibility, histology, and growth performance and may help improve sustainable and healthy aquaculture practices.

AB  - Diet has been linked to the diversification of the bat superfamily Noctilionoidea, a group that underwent an impressive ecological diversification within Mammalia. For decades, studies have explored morphological adaptations and diversity of noctilionoid bats to reveal traits associated with their ecological diversity. Surprisingly, despite such interest and recent application of novel techniques, ecomorphological studies have failed to fully resolve the link between diet and a critical component of the feeding apparatus: dental morphology. Using multivariate dental topographic analysis and phylogenetic comparative methods, we examined the phylogenetic, biological and ecological signal in the dental morphology of noctilionoid bats. Analysing the lower first molars of 110 species, we explored relationships between diet and dental morphology, accounting for three different dimensions of diet (guild, composition, and breadth). Phylogenetic and size-dependent structuring of the dental topography data shows it does not correlate only to diet, highlighting the need to account for multiple sources of variation. Nectarivores showed reduced molar crown height and steepness, whereas animalivorous species had larger molars. Dietary composition suggested that the intensity of exploitation of a resource is also linked to different dimensions of dental morphology. Increasing carnivory positively correlated with molar area, whereas increasing frugivory explained the highest proportion of variation in all other variables. Based on dietary breadth, specialist herbivores and specialist animalivores represent extreme morphologies in terms of tooth steepness and crown height. Together, the results suggest that adaptations affecting different attributes of dental morphology likely facilitated the dietary diversity and specialisation found in Noctilionoidea.

AB  - Pathosystems often involve two or more insect vector species; their positive or negative interactions may play key roles in plant pathogen transmission. Although climate warming likely causes changes in interactions among insect vectors by altering their demographics and behaviors, the mechanistic links between climate warming, insect vectors' interactions, and epidemic dynamics remain largely unknown. To determine these links, we conducted a factorial experiment to determine how climate warming impacts the interactions between two coexisting insect vectors [Drosophila melanogaster (common) and Drosophila suzukii (invasive)] in relation to the development of the economically important grape sour rot disease by testing their demographic performance and pathogen transmission efficacy. To determine underlying mechanisms, we hypothesized that the wound-making behavior of D. suzukii, which breaks the skin of grapes when ovipositing (zigzag movement), is a temperature-dependent process and can be improved under warming. We found that D. suzukii promoted population growth of D. melanogaster but not vice versa, showing a commensal interaction. The co-occurrence of the two vector species accelerated pathogen transmission. Under warmer temperatures, D. suzukii made more wounds in grapes, resulting in more oviposition sites for D. melanogaster, which increased population density of D. melanogaster, and a more extensive occurrence of the plant disease. Our findings highlight a novel impact of climate warming on a pathosystem, wherein stimulation of the behavior of the invasive species facilitated the vectoring capacity of the common species, which exacerbated the occurrence of the native plant disease. This novel climate-driven process in agroecosystem provides guidance for future pest and disease prediction.

AB  - The booming digital economy is a new engine for sustainable agricultural development. However, there are few studies on the impact of digital rural construction on carbon emissions from animal husbandry, and this study utilized China's provincial panel data from 2011 to 2020 and employed fixed effect models and instrumental variable methods to investigate such effects. Results indicate that digital rural construction significantly inhibits carbon emission intensity in animal husbandry. Further, regional and livestock species heterogeneity exists in terms of how digital rural construction affects local animal husbandry's carbon emission intensity reduction process; beef cattle, live pigs, and animal husbandry in central regions are more likely to benefit from it. Lastly, promoting technological progress and optimizing agricultural structure are the key paths for digital rural construction to achieve carbon reduction. Therefore, the government needs to emphasize the role of digital rural construction in the green development of agriculture while developing the rural areas according to local conditions.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in livestock farms have attracted a growing attention with potential effects on human health. As one of the most important organic fertilizer, swine waste provided an ideal environment for understanding the dissemination and accumulation of ARGs in agricultural ecosystems. Here we conducted a year-round follow-up trace from swine waste to receiving environments, with the purpose of revealing the contamination profiles and ecological risks of ARGs at different seasons. Results indicated that a variety of common ARGs and even high-risk ARGs (i.e., blaampC, blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1 and mcr-1) were prevalent from swine waste to farmland soil, with changing in various degrees from season to season. Regarding the occurrence pattern of ARGs, tetracycline resistance genes (tet-ARGs) were predominant genes at four seasons in all fresh pig feces, swine manure, manured soil and wastewater. The levels of most ARGs in solid waste were reduced at a different degree via natural composting, and the removal effect was best in summer, while ARGs decreased poorly after wastewater treatment, especially in winter (up to 10-1 copies/16S copies in the residual level), which increased the possibility of propagation to receiving environment. This concern was also validated by the investigation on farmland environment with long-term application of manure, where causing an increase in ARG abundances in soils (approximately 0.9-32.7 times). To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the distribution pattern of ARGs from swine waste to its receiving farmland environment at all seasons on this integrity chain.

AB  - Context Vachellia nilotica (Benth.) Kyal. & Boatwr is a leguminous species subjected to competition from co-occurring grassland species in mesic grasslands, including Themeda triandra Forssk. In South Africa, Vachellia nilotica enhances soil nitrogen in nutrient-deficient mesic savanna. The addition of phosphorus and competition between the grass and legume may assist in maintaining balance between the two plant groups.Aims Improved P supply in nutrient-poor soils favours growth of legumes over grasses. This study aimed to assess how nutrient deficiency, P fertilisation, and competition with a dominant grass species, particularly Themeda triandra, affects the aboveground and belowground growth, N nutrition, and nodulation potential of Vachellia nilotica in the Ukulinga Grassland nutrient experiment.Methods Soils used in the study were collected from superphosphate-fertilised trials (+P, i.e. P-enriched) and non-superphosphate trials (-P, i.e. no P enrichment). V. nilotica seedlings were grown independently and in competition with T. triandra seedlings.Key results Our findings confirmed that soil in +P treatment had greater P and calcium concentrations than did the -P soils. Competition from T. triandra decreased the P concentration, specific nitrogen assimilation rates and the %NDFA in V. nilotica, but the opposite effect was observed for specific nitrogen utilisation rates.Conclusions Zero nodule formation in soils with low P concentrations and competition affected the N source reliance of V. nilotica.Implications The addition of P might maximise N inputs through increased legume growth performance and weaken the competitive effect of a grass species.

AB  - Mutualistic interactions between species are widespread and important for community structure and ecosystem function. In a changing environment, the proximate mechanisms that maintain mutualisms affect their stability and susceptibility to perturbation. In ant-plant mutualisms, ants defend their host plants against herbivores or competing plants in exchange for housing or food. While the phenomenon of species exchanging services for resources is well documented, how such arrangements are maintained is not. There are at least four hypothesized mechanisms through which plants use sugar to induce ant defense against herbivores. Three such hypotheses ("deficit", "fuel for foraging", "predictable rewards") predict that the appearance of a new sugar source near the host plant would increase the rate of ant attacks against herbivores, but the fourth hypothesis ("attract and distract") predicts the opposite. To examine how the mutualism between Triplaris americana and Pseudomyrmex dendroicus would be affected, we simulated the appearance of a novel sugar source at a random half of 34 T. americana trees with P. dendroicus colonies. Compared to control colonies, those with access to the sugar source were less likely to attack herbivorous insects (Nasutitermes sp. termites). Thus, our findings support the "attract and distract" hypothesis. We infer that this ant-plant mutualism could be destabilized by the appearance of an alternative sugar source, such as a nectar-producing plant or honeydew-excreting insect. More broadly, we conclude that the mechanisms responsible for maintaining mutualistic relationships are relevant for understanding how ecological communities are affected by environmental change.

AB  - Simple Summary Recently, the risk of tick-borne diseases (TBD) has drawn increasing attention from a public health perspective. Information about where ticks are distributed is important for the prevention of TBDs. In this study, we used the MaxEnt model to predict the potential distribution of six major tick species out of 16 tick species collected in the Kanto region, the central part of Japan, based on land-use, climate, and wildlife distribution, and to investigate the factors that contribute to each distribution of ticks. The distribution of raccoons contributed to the distribution of five tick species, and forest connectivity was a strong contributor to the distribution of all species. Background: Tick distributions have changed rapidly with changes in human activity, land-use patterns, climate, and wildlife distributions over the last few decades. Methods: To estimate potential distributions of ticks, we conducted a tick survey at 134 locations in western Kanto, Japan. We estimated the potential distributions of six tick species (Amblyomma testudinarium Koch, 1844; Haemaphysalis flava Neumann, 1897; Haemaphysalis kitaokai Hoogstraal, 1969; Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann, 1901; Haemaphysalis megaspinosa Saito, 1969; and Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899) using MaxEnt modeling based on climate patterns, land-use patterns, and the distributions of five common wildlife species: sika deer (Cervus nippon Temminck, 1838), wild boar (Sus scrofa Linnaeus, 1758), raccoon (Procyon lotor Linnaeus, 1758), Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides Gray, 1834), and masked palm civet (Paguma larvata C.E.H. Smith, 1827)). Results: We collected 24,546 individuals of four genera and 16 tick species. Our models indicated that forest connectivity contributed to the distributions of six tick species and that raccoon distribution contributed to five tick species. Other than that, sika deer distribution contributed to H. kitaokai, and wild boar distribution, bamboo forest, and warm winter climate contributed specifically to A. testudinarium. Conclusions: Based on these results, the dispersal of some tick species toward residential areas and expanded distributions can be explained by the distribution of raccoons and by forest connectivity.

AB  - Camellia oleifera, a key economic forestry species in southern China, struggles with low productivity due to suboptimal planting management. Recently, transforming old or unadopted varieties of C. oleifera plantations has been recognized as a means to enhance economic benefits and production. However, the impact of these transformations on soil properties and fungal communities has received little attention. In this study, we targeted pre-renewal old C. oleifera and post-renewal young C. oleifera, Pinus massoniana, and Cunninghamia lanceolata. Through field sampling and soil physicochemical property analysis, we developed a soil quality evaluation system that effectively analyzes fungal community structures and identifies key arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species for soil health. We found that the soil quality evaluation system for this region comprises pH, TK, AK, NO3-, PO4- BG, ACP, F.simpson, AMF.shannon, and AMF.ace, which collectively indicated significant improvements in soil quality following transformation. Notably, the nutritional characteristics of the dominant fungal communities underwent marked changes, with an increase in pathogenic fungi in young C. oleifera and an expansion of ectomycorrhizal fungi in P. massoniana forests. The AMF communities in all four types of forest exhibited aggregation, and Scutellospora and Diversispora emerged as key species in the AMF community of C. oleifera. Additionally, Mortierella and Trichoderma were found to enhance plant resistance to pathogenic fungi. This study demonstrates that forestland transformation positively impacts soil quality and fungal community structure in C. oleifera, which provides valuable insights for future soil management in the region, both in terms of soil quality evaluation and fungal conservation.

AB  - Sorting for specific parts or nutrients in feed is a natural behavior of ruminants, but for intensive dairy systems it is disadvantageous if it leads to nutritional imbalances for the individual or the herd. To prevent feed sorting in cattle, mixed rations (MR) are fed and forage components are cut as short as possible. In small ruminants, feed sorting is well documented but not well studied in relation to MR. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of dairy sheep and goats to feed sort in MR. Experiments were conducted with each of 12 pairs of female adult dairy sheep and goats. In the first experiment, three MR composed of different forages (hay, grass silage, maize silage) were tested consecutively, each in a long and short cutting length variant. In the second experiment, two short cut variants of a grass silage-hay MR were investigated that differed in nutritional value. For all experiments, animals received each variant of MR for five consecutive days. The composition of feed rests at 11:00, 15:00 and the next day were compared to the ration fed at 09:00. Both species sorted all of the offered MR for large particles, and sheep but not goats sorted for protein. In the short cut MR variants, particle size sorting was reduced in the first two hours after feed delivery (09:00-11:00), but cutting length had no relevant effect thereafter, or on protein sorting. The nutritional value of the MR had no detectable influence on feed sorting. Both species sorted for larger particles in both variants, and goats sorted against protein in the first two hours after feed delivery, whereas sheep sorted for protein thereafter. These results show that sheep and goats are able to change the composition of MR within two hours after feed delivery. A short cutting length delayed feed sorting to a limited extent. Maintaining the feed quality of a mixed ration throughout the day is important for the health and welfare of dairy sheep and goats but seems to be a major challenge for feeding management.

AB  - Airborne bacteria present on swine farms can adversely affect the health of pigs and livestock workers. However, many studies have intensively investigated the characterization of microbiota in pig feces and aerosol samples without considering the stepwise aerosolization process and the impact of antibiotic usage. This study aimed to comprehensively explore the bacterial communities of feces, surfaces, and bioaerosols during the aerosolization process and assess variations in bacterial resistance to antibiotic usage on swine farms. In this study, 32 samples were collected from six swine farms and categorized as high- or low-antibiotic-use farms based on the European Union's defined daily dose for animals (DDDvet). Fecal samples had significantly higher alpha diversities, followed by aerosol and surface samples (p <0.05). However, no alpha diversity indices showed significant differences according to antibiotic usage. Beta-diversity analyses revealed significant differences between bioaerosols and fecal samples depending on antibiotic usage. Notably, Staphylococcus spp., Corynebacteria spp., and Enterococcus spp. were significantly more prevalent in bioaerosols from high-antibiotic-use farms than in fecal samples (p <0.05), indicating a potentially high level of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the spread of antibiotic resistance among pigs and workers. For source tracking analysis, over 50 % of the aerosol samples contained bacteria from fecal and surface sources, contributing to the aerosol microbiome. These findings highlight that the aerosolization of fecal and surface particles within swine farms distinctly affects airborne bacterial communities. Our results showed that different antibiotic uses notably affected indoor bacterial communities and antibiotic resistance during stepwise aerosolization in swine farms.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the effects of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) in the freezing medium on functional and oxidative stress parameters and in vitro fertilization (IVF) rate of buffalo sperm. Collected samples were relocated to the laboratory for initial evaluation, gentle dilution in extenders, cooling (4 degrees C, 2 h), equilibration (4 degrees C, 4 h), packaging (straws, 0.5 mL), programmable freezing, and thawing (37 degrees C, 30 s). Statistical analysis depicted that adding CoQ10 (100 mu M) in a freezing medium caused a significant augmentation in total motility (%), average path, and straight-line velocities (mu m/sec) of buffalo sperm than control. Adding CoQ10 (100 mu M) improved sperm progressive motility, rapid velocity, and functional parameters (%) compared to the control and 10 mu M of CoQ10. Moreover, CoQ10 in a freezing medium caused a significant augmentation in seminal plasma catalase (U/mL) and glutathione reductase (GSH; nmol/10(9)) at 100 mu M than control and other treatments. CoQ10 inclusion (100 mu M) ameliorates seminal plasma superoxide dismutase (U/mL), glutathione-S-transferase (GST; nmol/mL/min) fructose (mu g/mL), and ATP (nmol/million) than control. Furthermore, CoQ10 at 100 mu M improved seminal plasma glutathione peroxidase (mu M) levels than control, 10 mu M, and 20 mu M. Lastly, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2; nM) production was significantly lower at 100 mu M than at control and 10 mu M. CoQ10 (100 mu M) caused a significant augmentation in the un-capacitated pattern followed by a reduction in the capacitated pattern, and apoptosis-like changes (%) than control, and other treatments, whereas viability was increased than control and other treatments. CoQ10 (100 mu M) significantly improved the IVF rate in comparison with control, CoQ10 at 10 mu M, and 20 mu M groups. In conclusion, the addition of CoQ10 (100 mu M) in the freezing medium can improve the quality and in vitro fertility of post-thawed buffalo semen via its antioxidative effect. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of CoQ10 on the in vivo fertility of buffalo bull semen.

T2  - SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST
LA  - English
AB  - Herein we report the first known collection of a larval Cryptobranchus a. alleganiensis (Eastern Hellbender) from Mississippi. We also document an extension of the known range of the species in Mississippi. Nearly all records of Eastern Hellbender in the state are from mainstem Bear Creek except for 1 collection in Pickwick Reservoir in 1981. However, we collected a larval Eastern Hellbender from Cripple Deer Creek, a tributary of Bear Creek, on 11 April 2023 while surveying for fish and crayfish. The individual was collected via kick sampling with a seine behind a half-submerged log. While habitat at the site of discovery did not seem typical of preferred Hellbender habitat, the streambed of Cripple Deer Creek at other locations may contain sandstone and limestone outcrops based on the surface geology of Mississippi. The collection of a wild-caught larval Hellbender is rare but encouraging for the conservation status of this species in Mississippi. Attempts in the last decade to detect Hellbenders in Bear Creek produced a single adult individual in 2015. To the authors' knowledge, no known studies have taken place within the inaccessible reaches of Cripple Deer Creek, and additional surveys are underway to assess if Cripple Deer Creek supports a reproducing population of Eastern Hellbenders.

AB  - Sympatric large mammalian herbivore species differ in diet composition, both by eating different parts of the same plant and by eating different plant species. Various theories proposed to explain these differences are not mutually exclusive, but are difficult to reconcile and confront with data. Moreover, whereas several of these ideas were originally developed with reference to within-plant partitioning (i.e. consumption of different tissues), they may analogously apply to partitioning of plant species; this possibility has received little attention. Plant functional traits provide a novel window into herbivore diets and a means of testing multiple hypotheses in a unified framework. We used DNA metabarcoding to characterize the diets of 14 sympatric large-herbivore species in an African savanna and analysed diet composition in light of 27 functional traits that we measured locally for 204 plant species. Plant traits associated with the deep phylogenetic split between grasses and eudicots formed the primary axis of resource partitioning, affirming the generality and importance of the grazer-browser spectrum. A secondary axis comprised plant traits relevant to herbivore body size. Plant taxa in the diets of large-bodied species were lower on average in digestible energy and protein, taller on average (especially among grazers), and tended to be higher in tensile strength, zinc, stem-specific density, and potassium (and lower in sodium, stem dry matter content, and copper). These results are consistent with longstanding hypotheses linking body size with forage quality and height, yet they also suggest the existence of undiscovered links between herbivore body size and a set of rarely considered food-plant traits. We also tested the novel hypothesis that the leaf economic spectrum (LES), a major focus in plant ecology, is an axis of resource partitioning in large-herbivore assemblages; we found that the LES was a minor axis of individual variation within a few species, but had little effect on interspecific dietary differentiation. Synthesis. These results identify key plant traits that underpin the partitioning of food-plant species in large-herbivore communities and suggest that accounting for multiple plant traits (and trade-offs among them) will enable a deeper understanding of herbivore-plant interaction networks.

AB  - Studying the seed trait-stem trait-individual spatial pattern system is helpful for understanding the developmental direction of plant dynamics and populations under grazing disturbance as well as the antagonistic relationship between animals and plants, but few systematic analyses of this spatial pattern system have been carried out. Kobresia humilis is the dominant species in alpine grasslands. We studied K. humilis seed traits and their relationship with K. humilis reproductive individuals, the relationship between reproductive and vegetative stems, and the weights and spatial patterns of reproductive and nonreproductive individuals under four grazing treatments: no grazing (control), light grazing, moderate grazing and heavy grazing. We explored the relationship among seed size and seed number with reproductive stems and vegetative stems along the grazing gradient and assessed the spatial pattern changes between reproductive and nonreproductive individuals. The results showed the following: (1) Seed size increased with increasing grazing intensity, and the coefficient of variation for seed size and seed number in the heavy grazing treatment was greater than 0.6. (2) The structural equation model showed that grazing treatment had a positive effect on seed number, seed size and reproductive stem number and a negative effect on reproductive stem weight. (3) Grazing treatment did not affect the resource allocation to reproductive stems and vegetative stems per unit length of reproductive K. humilis individuals. (4) Compared with the number of reproductive individuals in the no grazing treatment, the number in the heavy grazing treatment decreased significantly, and the negative correlation between reproductive individuals and nonreproductive individuals changed from a full-scale negative correlation to a small-scale negative correlation and a large-scale positive correlation. Our study showed that grazing could activate and change the resource allocation pattern of dominant species in a grassland and have significant positive effects on reproductive stem number, reproductive stem weight, seed number and seed size. Along a grazing intensity gradient, with the increase in distance between reproductive and nonreproductive individuals, the transformation of intraspecific relationships from a negative correlation to a positive correlation is an ecological strategy conducive to population survival.

AB  - The restoration of natural communities on anthropogenically disturbed lands is one of the world's problems. Our studies in Kuzbass show that even after 35-40 years, areas reclaimed in different ways do not create full-fledged conditions for mammals, inhabitants of the dark coniferous taiga forests. In all studied areas, the indices of the abundance and species richness in mammalian communities are significantly inferior to the original taiga communities. The similarity with indigenous communities of mammals was found in pine plantations adjacent to self-growing deforested areas of the dark coniferous taiga. These habitats are characterized by the highest indices of abundance and species richness among the studied sites. The most impoverished in terms of the species richness of small mammals and their number were terraced areas with a very insignificant soil layer, reclaimed by the European white birch Betula pendula Roth. and sea-buckthorn Hippophae rhamnoides L. The communities of small mammals that have formed here show a faunistic similarity with the population of dry meadows on the place of the felled dark coniferous taiga, but not with the indigenous taiga population. Large and medium-sized mammals in reclaimed areas are few or absent altogether. The reclamation methods should involve the formation of forage and protective functions for forest dwellers. During reclamation, it is necessary to abandon mono-plantings. To create vital conditions, it is necessary to mosaic planting of various groups of plants with the obligatory alternation of coniferous, mixed, and deciduous forest areas. The share of various shrubs is about 50%. Since animals are concentrated in ecotone areas, when carrying out forest reclamation, it is necessary to provide for the formation of an extended forest edge line, that is, to lay "forest glades" surrounded on all sides by woody plants and shrubs.

AB  - 1. Reintroduction programmes are an important tool for the conservation of threatened and endangered carnivores, but their effectiveness has rarely been assessed when wild-born, captive-raised orphans are released. 2.We monitored and evaluated the success of captive-raised orphaned cheetahs (n = 25) that were rehabilitated and released into the wild as adults across three private reserves in Namibia. We estimated time to independence, hunting success and prey composition, and for one reserve we derived prey preference and hunting habitat use. 3. Seventeen cheetahs achieved independence (68%) whereas eight were returned to captivity. With one exception, solitary or coalition cheetahs made their first kill 6 +/- 2 days post-release. Hunting success was on average 56%, with solitary females having the highest success. We documented 13 species of wild prey killed by rehabilitated cheetahs, primarily ungulates (n = 170). Steenbok (Raphicerus campestris) were the preferred prey, although avoided by artificially formed female cheetah coalitions, which primarily killed juvenile eland (Tragelaphus oryx). Cheetahs used a wide range of vegetation for hunting, although coalition males appeared to use somewhat denser areas. 4. Rehabilitated wild-born captive-reared cheetahs can be successfully released if prey availability and human-wildlife conflict potential are considered, and food supplementation and intensive monitoring are undertaken.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal disease of cervid species that continues to spread across North America and now in Europe. It poses a threat to cervid populations and the local ecological and economic communities that depend on them. Although empirical studies have shown that host home range overlap and male dispersal are important in the spread of disease, there are few mechanistic models explicitly considering those factors. We built a spatio-temporal, differential equation model for CWD spreading with restricted movement of hosts within home ranges. The model incorporates both direct and environmental transmission within and between groups as well as male dispersal. We compared the relative influence of host density, sex ratio, home range size, and male dispersal distance on the spreading speed using sensitivity analysis. We also assessed the effect of landscape heterogeneity, quantified as edge density, on the spreading speed of CWD because it jointly alters the host density and home range size. Our model binds the theoretical study of CWD spreading speed together with empirical studies on deer home ranges and sets a base for models in 2D space to evaluate management and control strategies.

AB  - After the first introduction of African swine fever (ASF) in the European Union in 2014, the ASF virus (ASFV) has steadily spread in the European Union. The virus has occasionally been transmitted over unexpectedly large distances that are believed to be related to human-mediated spread. Hunting tourism has been mentioned as a potential contributor to these long-distance jumps, although evidence is lacking. In this study, the possible role of hunters carrying ASFV-contaminated wild boar products (WBP) from hunting trips in affected countries was evaluated. A quantitative risk model was developed to estimate the expected annual number of ASF exposures of wild boar and domestic pigs in the Netherlands via this introduction route. Main input data into the model were the ASF prevalence in hunted wild boar, the number and destination of hunting trips of Dutch hunters, and the probabilities that hunters take WBP home and dispose leftovers such that wild boar or domestic pigs have access. The model indicated that the total expected annual number of exposures (wild boar and domestic pigs together) in the Netherlands is 0.048 (95% uncertainty interval 7.5 x 10-3 - 0.15). Model results were most sensitive to uncertainty on leftovers fed to domestic pigs (swill feeding), which is an illegal practice. Uncertainties on the ASF prevalence of hunted wild boar and the probabilities that hunters take WBP home also impacted model results. Default model results were based on the 2019 situation. Alternative scenarios were run with the model to account for the change of ASF status of Belgium (recovery of ASF-free status) and Germany (ASF-infected) in 2020. Results indicated that especially the presence of ASF in Germany increased the incursion risk. However, this increase might be counteracted by a change in travel behavior of hunters.

AB  - Habitat loss is often considered the greatest near-term threat to biodiversity, while the impact of habitat fragmentation remains intensely debated. A key issue of this debate centers on the problem of scale-landscape or patch-at which to assess the consequences of fragmentation. Yet patterns are often confounded across scales, and experimental designs that could solve this scaling problem remain scarce. We conducted two field experiments in 30 experimental landscapes in which we manipulated habitat loss, fragmentation, and patch size for a community of four insect herbivores that specialize on the cactus Opuntia. In the first experiment, we destroyed 2088 Opuntia patches in either aggregated or random patterns and compared the relative effects of landscape-scale loss and fragmentation to those of local patch size on species occurrence. This experiment focused on manipulating the relative separation of remaining patches, where we hypothesized that aggregated loss would disrupt dispersal more than random loss, leading to lower occurrence. In the second experiment, we destroyed 759 Opuntia patches to generate landscapes that varied in patch number and size for a given amount of habitat loss and assessed species occurrence. This experiment focused on manipulating the subdivision of remaining habitat, where we hypothesized that an increase in the number of patches for a given amount of loss would lead to negative effects on occurrence. For both, we expected that occurrence would increase with patch size. We find strong evidence for landscape-scale effects of habitat fragmentation, with aggregated loss and a larger number of patches for a given amount of habitat loss leading to a lower frequency of patches occupied in landscapes. In both experiments, occurrence increased with patch size, yet interactions of patch size and landscape-scale loss and fragmentation drove species occurrence in patches. Importantly, the direction of effects were consistent across scales and effects of patch size were sufficient to predict the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation across entire landscapes. Our experimental results suggest that changes at both the patch and landscape scales can impact populations, but that a long-standing pattern-the patch-size effect-captures much of the key variation shaping patterns of species occurrence.

AB  - Hibernation is linked with various hypotheses to explain the extended lifespan of hibernating mammals compared with their non-hibernating counterparts. Studies on telomeres, markers of ageing and somatic maintenance, suggest telomere shortening slows during hibernation, and lengthening may reflect self-maintenance with favourable conditions. Bats in temperate zones adjust body temperatures during winter torpor to conserve energy and exploit mild conditions for foraging. Climate change may impact the hibernation cycle of bats, but more research is needed regarding the role of telomeres in understanding their response to a changing climate. Here, relative telomere length (rTL) was measured in the long-lived greater horseshoe bat Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (n = 223 individuals) over three winters, considering climatic conditions. Cross-sectional analyses revealed between-individual variation in rTL with a strong year effect, likely linked to varying weather conditions and foraging success. Additionally, within-individual increases of rTL occurred in 51% of consecutive measurements, with evidence of increasing telomerase expression during hibernation in this species. These findings highlight the beneficial effects of hibernation on telomeres and potential consequences of changing climatic conditions for long-lived temperate bats. Understanding the interplay between hibernation, telomeres, and climate can provide insights into the adaptive capacity and survival of bat populations facing environmental challenges.

AB  - In recent decades, there has been an increase in European wild ungulate populations, often associated with a decline in health and spread of disease. This is true for the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), the most common European cervid, with populations apparently affected by fibropapillomatosis, an increasingly common cancer. To date, however, there has been little research into this disease, thus many interactions remain unclear and descriptions of tumour composition are poorly validated. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence and concentration of toxic heavy metals in roe deer skin tumours. Our results confirmed the presence of virtually all the metals tested for, i.e., Pb, Hg, Cd, As, Cr, Mn, Al, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, Zn, and Fe, with the highest average concentrations found for Cr (0.99 mg/kg(-1) +/- 2.23 SD), Cd (0.03 mg/kg(-1) +/- 0.03 SD), and Hg (0.02 mg/kg(-1) +/- 0.02 SD), exceeding FAO limits for meat from slaughtered animals. We also observed a significant positive relationship between heavy metal concentration and age, especially for Pb, As, Hg, Mn, Se, Al, Zn, and Ni. Our findings provide a strong baseline for further research on the impact of fibropapillomatosis, not only on the welfare and health status of game but also on the final consumer of venison, which in many respects is regarded as a high-quality, ecological, and renewable wild resource. While deer with this disease are not considered qualitatively or medically defective, they could represent a potential reservoir of substances toxic to humans and could affect substance levels in adjacent tissues or the animal as a whole.

AB  - The exploitation of deep-sea polymetallic nodules has attracted global attention. To mitigate its impact on deepsea ecosystems, accurate identification of benthic megafauna is essential for developing science-based mining strategies. Deep learning has emerged as an promising approach in biological identification, offering significantly improved efficiency and reduced reliance on taxonomic expertise. However, challenges such as similar species characteristics, occlusion, and species abundance imbalance hinder accurate recognition of deep-sea benthic megafauna. To address these issues, the present study proposes Benthic Megafauna-YOLO (BM-YOLO). backbone integrates deformable convolutions, attention mechanisms, and ResNet structures to improve feature extraction and reduce background interference. Additionally, a transformer-enhanced PAFPN incorporates global context, improving occluded target recognition. To address the challenge of low-abundance species, we introduce a varifocal head that enhances the focus of the model on rare species. To address the lack of relevant datasets, we constructed the Pacific Ocean Benthic Megafauna dataset using images collected during the China Oceanic 45 and 50 surveys. Notably, BM-YOLO achieved AP50 scores exceeding 90 % and 95 % for six and four species, respectively. Furthermore, the model achieved the mAP50 and mAP50:95 values of 85.9 % and 56.2 respectively, improving on YOLOv8s by 2.6 % and 4.6 % and YOLOv11s by 0.7 % and 1.5 %. On the public underwater dataset DUO, BM-YOLO achieved mAP50 and mAP50:95 values of 82.4 % and 62.7 %, respectively, outperforming YOLOv10s by 2.0 % and 2.9 %. These results highlight the potential of BM-YOLO in automated deep-sea species identification. We also identified key factors influencing species recognition accuracy through experimental analysis.

AB  - Human activities have substantially disrupted phosphorus (P) cycles in the ecosystem, affecting producers and consumers along the food chain. To assess the ecological effects of imbalanced P on producers as well as consumer reactions to changes in food quality, the effects of P concentrations (HP, MP, LP) on Scenedesmus obliquus, were investigated. To investigate the indirect effects of P levels on consumer feeding behavior and life history strategies, the algae were fed to Rotaria rotatoria. The results showed that P concentrations increased population density, environment capacity, cell size, specific growth rate, chlorophyll a, and chlorophyll b substantially. As a result of the P intracellular concentration of algae produced in HP and MP media, the algae were classified as two categories of food quality (P-rich, P-poor). Rotifers' grazing and filtration rates were significantly increased when they were fed P-poor algae. In reaction to a lack of P in their diet, rotifers extended their juvenile and reproductive periods, resulting in a longer life span, generation time, and life expectancy at rotifer hatching. Despite living longer than P-rich groups, rotifers fed P-poor algae produced much fewer offspring and had a significantly lower net reproductive rate, which was linked to the rotifers' longer generation period. According to the findings, phosphorus has a major impact on algal food quality, and herbivorous consumers are subjected to significant food quality variation of algae, which they respond to by modifying their life history strategies and feeding behavior.

AB  - Short-term, sublethal response variables are increasingly used to provide rapid indications of whole organism responses to future climate conditions. Accumulating evidence suggests, however, that these response variables may not consistently reflect whole organism responses which manifest over longer time scales. Here, we consider the effect of moderate warming on longer-term whole organism fitness, as reflected by survival, as well as two shorter-term response variables, feeding rate and oxygen consumption, for two tropical gastropod species. We found a significant reduction in survival under warming, despite no significant effect of warming on feeding or oxygen consumption rates. This result demonstrates that the maintenance of physiological rates alone is not sufficient to sustain organism survival under elevated temperatures; rather an increase in physiological process rates is likely required. Consequently, isolated short-term physiological processes may not adequately reflect longer-term whole organism responses to altered climate. For improved understanding, both short- and long-term responses need to be considered.

AB  - Roots can effectively consolidate and support the soil and are affected by external forces. To identify the survival strategies and soil reinforcement capability of roots against damaging forces, we investigated Hippophae rhamnoides taproots with a diameter of 1-4 mm in a coal mining subsidence area. To simulate root damage from erosion, an HG100 digital push&pull tester and self-developed experimental installation were used in situ. Relative growth rate, activity, tensile force, and strength of taproots were inhibited by damage. Significant differences occurred in these indicators depending on drawing damage type and level. Inhibition effects from persistent drawing damage on growth and tensile properties were markedly greater than those from instantaneous drawing. Inhibition effects of severe damage were markedly greater than those of mild damage. The number of living roots declined more after persistent drawing or severe injury than after instantaneous or mild damage. The taproots showed self-healing ability, and the inhibitory effect of drawing damage gradually weakened with the time of self-repair, ensuring H. rhamnoides taproots could continue to play a role in soil reinforcement. The self-healing ability of roots should be considered in vegetation restoration of erosion-prone areas to ensure that the roots' ability to resist erosion is accurately estimated. Novelty statement Research on the soil reinforcement ability of damaged plant roots is very limited at present. This study provides a new perspective for soil reinforcement: roots can be destroyed by erosional forces while providing support for soil, the self-healing ability of plants determines whether they can provide effective support for soil in the erosive environment.

AB  - The study explores the effects of environmental and climatic variables on the 813C, 815N and 818O values of carnivores from modern C3 dominated environments in South Africa. Stable isotope ratios of carnivores may reflect large-scale environmental patterns better than those of herbivores because carnivores integrate variation seen at lower trophic levels. To explore this further, we have analysed 813C and 815N in bone collagen and 813C and 818O in tooth enamel of 12 species of carnivores obtained mostly from game parks and nature reserves in the winter and year-round rainfall zones of southern Africa. Sampling localities span several vegetation types, with varying rainfall, temperature, etc. We developed regression models for carnivore 813C, 815N and 818O against nine meteorological variables: mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, mean annual soil moisture stress, mean annual potential evapotranspiration, relative humidity, summer aridity index, winter concentration of rainfall, moisture index and water deficit. There were significant correlations between 813Cenamel and 813Ccollagen and eight out of nine of the meteorological factors tested; the strongest correlations were with mean annual soil moisture stress (MASMS) (813Cenamel r2(adj) = 0.69 and 813Ccollagen r2(adj) = 0.66). 818Oenamel showed significant correlations with mean annual precipitation, mean annual potential evapotranspiration, summer aridity index, water deficit, relative humidity and the moisture index, but the r2 values were low. 815Ncollagen showed significant correlations with eight out of nine of the meteorological factors (r2 values up to 0.63); only summer aridity index was not significantly correlated). Correlations between consumer 813C values and mete-orological variables were stronger for carnivores than in a previously published study of herbivores from the same region; the opposite pattern was seen in 818O. Carnivore 813C and 815N are therefore effective integrators of environments. Where sample sizes permit, carnivores may be better proxies than herbivores for palae-oenvironmental reconstruction.

AB  - Despite evidence that certain diseases of marine wildlife are increasing, long-term infection data are often lacking. Archived samples of hosts from natural history collections offer a powerful tool for evaluating temporal changes in parasitism. Using vouchered fish collections from the Southern Caribbean, we investigated long-term (1905-2022) shifts in infections by the trematode Scaphanocephalus spp., which causes black spot syndrome (BSS) in reef fishes. Examination of 190 museum-preserved fishes from Cura & ccedil;ao and Bonaire revealed that Scaphanocephalus infections are not new, with histologically confirmed detections from as early as 1948. However, Scaphanocephalus was rare among archival surgeonfish and parrotfishes, with an infection prevalence of <10% and an average abundance of 0.25 metacercariae per fish. Contemporary collections of 258 ocean surgeonfish and parrotfishes (7 species) supported a 7-fold higher prevalence (71%) and a 49-fold higher abundance (12.1). These findings offer evidence that infections by Scaphanocephalus spp. have increased substantially over the past century and underscore the value of biological repositories in the study of emerging parasites within marine ecosystems. We emphasize the need for additional research to evaluate the geographical extent of BSS emergence, test proposed hypotheses related to shifts in host density or environmental characteristics and assess the consequences for affected species.

AB  - Apriona germari is one of the most serious wood-boring pests that cause damage to economic and landscaping trees and has adapted to a wide range of plants as diet. Gut bacteria play an important role in biology and ecology of herbivores, especially in growth and adaptation. To investigate how plant hosts shape A. germari gut microbiota, A. germari larvae were collected from Populus tomentosa and Malus pumilal, and gut microbiomes were sequenced based on 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 853,424 high-quality reads were obtained and clustered into 196 operational taxonomic units under a 97% similarity cutoff, which were annotated into 8 phyla, 10 classes, 21 orders, 34 families, 59 genera, and 39 species. Gibbsiella was the most dominant genus of intestinal bacteria, followed by Enterobacter and Acinetobacter. No significant difference was observed in larvae gut bacterial richness and diversity of A. germari collected from two hosts, though alpha diversity showed that the richness of gut bacteria in A. germari larvae collected on P. tomentosa was slightly higher than that in A. germari on M. pumilal, and beta diversity showed little difference between two host plants. The functional abundance analysis of the detected bacteria revealed fermentation, chemoheterotrophy, symbionts, and nitrate relative functions that highly possibly support wood-boring beetles to feed on woody tissues. Our study provided a theoretical basis for investigating the function of intestinal symbiosis bacteria of A. germari.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the changes in the composition and structure of humic acid (HA) following the application of different conditioners in combination with manure and straw. The experiment involved corn straw combined with pig manure (SZ), corn straw and pig manure plus biochar (SCZ), corn straw and pig manure plus boron slag (SBZ), corn straw and pig manure plus biological agent (SJZ), and corn straw and pig manure plus bio-organic fertilizer (SOZ), while corn straw only was used as control (SCK). This was measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), fluorescence spectroscopes, and C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 CPMAS NMR). Compared with SCK, the pig manure combined with straw improved soil organic carbon (SOC), and the application of biochar and boron slag was the effect for improving the accumulation of SOC and humus C fractions. The elemental composition and C-13 CPMAS NMR results demonstrated that the addition of pig manure combined with straw enhanced the ratio of H/C and the aliphatic C/aromatic C ratio of HA and reduced the O/C ratio, indicating enhanced aliphatic and conducive to simplifying HA molecular structure. In conclusion, SCZ was more conducive to simplifying HA molecular structure and enhancing aliphatic and hydrophobic. However, the addition of biological agents and bio-organic fertilizer reduced the soil humification factor and is detrimental to soil organic carbon fixation.

AB  - Simple Summary Genetic resource banks were created to preserve the genetic material of endangered, rare, valuable individuals or genetically relevant breeds. Sperm cryopreservation is a practical and widespread strategy to preserve these genetic materials. This study aimed to characterize the frozen-thawed sperm of the native pig breed Gochu Asturcelta, considering the effects of boar age and season of semen collection on post-thaw sperm quality. We found that the boar age did not have a significant effect on the sperm parameters assessed. However, the season significantly affected many of these parameters (motility, viability, acrosomal status, mitochondrial activity). In general, sperm samples collected in spring and summer showed higher quality post-thawing, the lowest in winter. Our findings demonstrated that the post-thawing sperm quality of Gochu Asturcelta was in the range of results for commercial breeds, bringing a good prospect for the use of assisted reproductive technologies in this local breed. Genetic resource banks (GRB) preserve the genetic material of endangered, valuable individuals or genetically relevant breeds. Semen cryopreservation is a crucial technique to reach these goals. Thus, we aimed to assess the sperm parameters of semen doses from the native pig breed Gochu Asturcelta stored at the GRB of Principado de Asturias (GRB-PA, Gijon, Spain), focusing on intrinsic and extrinsic (boar, season) factors. Two straws per boar (n = 18, 8-71 months of age) were thawed, pooled, and assessed after 30 and 150 min at 37 degrees C by CASA (computer-assisted sperm analysis system; motility and kinematic parameters) and flow cytometry (viability, acrosomal status, mitochondrial activity, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, and chromatin status). The effects of age, incubation, and season on post-thawing quality were determined using linear mixed-effects models. Parameters were on the range for commercial boar breeds, with chromatin status (SCSA: fragmentation and immaturity) being excellent. Incubation decreased sperm quality and functionality. The boar age did not have a significant effect (p > 0.05), but the between-boar variability was significant (p < 0.001). The season significantly affected many parameters (motility, kinematics, viability, acrosomal status, mitochondrial activity), especially after 150 min of incubation. In general, samples collected in spring and summer showed higher quality post-thawing, the lowest in winter. In conclusion, the sperm doses from the Gochu Asturcelta breed stored at the GRB-PA showed excellent chromatin status and acceptable characteristics after thawing. Therefore, boar and seasonal variability in this autochthonous breed could be relevant for cryobank management.

AB  - Citizen science invites the public to participate in both scientific thinking and data collection. Citizen science adds new collaborators whose contributions help to gather or analyse data on a large scale particularly relevant for emerging questions about the distribution and abundance of organisms across space and time. Syngnathids are cryptic fishes that inhabits temperate and tropical sheltered, coastal marine waters. Pipefishes and seahorses are threatened by habitat loss and degradation. Unfortunately, data on biological and ecological aspects and population trends are rarely available in most species. More than half of the thirteen-syngnathid species inhabiting Spanish coasts are considered Data Deficient for population evaluation. Citizen science is an opportunity to improve data availability for the study of syngnathid population tendencies and monitoring. This contribution describes and discusses the approach followed by Sea Watchers citizen science platform. We analysed and discussed the data provided by the observers, and the distribution data of species based on citizen science surveillance. Citizen science achieved the expansion of spatial and temporal dataset of syngnathid distribution. However, the obtained information is affected by observers' behaviour and suggest that the observers performed focussed surveys to find individuals of these slow motion iconic fishes, introducing biases in the data.

AB  - Three coarse herbaceous energy plants-such as Miscanthus (Miscanthus sinensis), sida (Sida hermaphrodita Rusby) and cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum L.)-were grown and investigated in the experimental fields of Vytautas Magnus University Agriculture Academy, and the technical means of plant processing and utilization for solid biofuel were investigated. The physical-mechanical properties and quality indicators (moisture content, biometrical properties, density, and resistance to compression) of coarse stem herbaceous plants milled and compressed into 6 mm diameter pellets were investigated. The moisture content of the tested pellets was sufficiently low and ranged from 8.7% to 9.6%. The highest density was that of sida pellets (1072.3 +/- 43.4 kg m(-3) DM), and the lowest density was that of Miscanthus pellets (713.5 +/- 67.1 kg m(-3) DM). In order to evaluate the influence of moisture content on the properties of biofuel pressed into pellets, the density and the destructive compressive force of the different-moisture pellets were investigated and their change in the range of 5-15% pellet moisture content was evaluated. Criterion k was calculated to determine the effect of moisture on the pellet quality indicators (density, destructive compressive force, and lower heating value), and the following results were obtained: the highest influence of moisture on density was observed in sida (k = 34.280), on destructive compressive force in Miscanthus (k = 14.5), and on the lower heating value, also in Miscanthus (k = 0.198). After a comprehensive investigation and evaluation of these properties, an empirical model suitable for practical use was developed and prepared. Emissions of harmful gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxides, were determined when various coarse stem herbaceous energy plants were burned. The determined emissions of harmful gases into the environment did not exceed the permissible values.

AB  - Simple Summary The Medog region in southeastern Tibet harbors diverse wildlife, yet our understanding of these mammals' species diversity, distribution, and conservation status remains inadequate. To address this, a camera-trapping survey was conducted in Gedang, Medog, spanning from April 2023 to May 2024. The study revealed 25 mammalian species across five orders and 14 families, including Endangered and Vulnerable species. Notably, the Gongshan muntjac's underrepresentation in the IUCN was addressed, and new insights into the coexistence of Himalayan red pandas and Chinese red pandas were documented. The White-cheeked macaque, Gongshan muntjac, and Himalayan serow were frequently detected with high RAI. However, the high detection of domestic dogs, livestock, and human disturbances may pose threats to wildlife. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these mammals and maintain ecological balance in the region.Abstract The Medog in southeastern Tibet is home to a diverse range of wild animals. However, research on these mammals' species directories, distribution, and conservation status remains insufficient, despite their crucial role in maintaining ecological balance. The study carried out a camera-trapping survey to assess mammal biodiversity and the significance of mammal protection in their natural habitats in Gedang, Medog. Future directions and application prospects of the study for wildlife conservation in the southeastern Tibetan mountains were also discussed. The survey, spanning from April 2023 to May 2024, with 19,754 camera trap days, revealed 25 mammalian species across five orders and 14 families. Among these, four classified as Endangered, five as Vulnerable, two as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List, nine were categorized as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the Red List of China's Vertebrates, and seven were China's national first-class key protected wildlife. The order Carnivora exhibited the highest diversity, comprising 12 species. Furthermore, the study filled the knowledge gap regarding the underrepresentation of Gongshan muntjac Muntiacus gongshanensis in IUCN and provided new insights into the recorded coexistence of the Himalayan red panda Ailurus fulgens and Chinese red panda Ailurus styani along the Yarlung Zangbo River for the first time, and also documented new upper elevation limits for four large to medium-sized species. Regarding the relative abundance indices (RAI) captured by camera traps, the most prevalent species identified was the White-cheeked macaque Macaca leucogenys, followed by the Gongshan muntjac and Himalayan serow Capricornis thar. The monitoring also captured a number of domestic dogs and livestock, as well as human disturbances. These findings underscore the importance of conserving these mammals and emphasize the need for conservation efforts to protect their habitats and reduce human activities that threaten their survival, thereby maintaining the ecological balance of the region. Additionally, the research highlighted Gedang's significance to global conservation efforts for mammalian diversity, providing essential data for effective wildlife conservation strategies.

AB  - Previous research showed that young domestic pigs learn through observation of conspecifics by using social learning mechanisms like social facilitation, enhancement effects, and even object movement re-enactment. The latter suggests some form of emulative learning in which the observer learns about the object's movements and affordances. As it remains unclear whether pigs need a social agent to learn about objects, we provided 36 free-ranging domestic pigs with varying degrees of social to non-social demonstrations on how to solve a two-step manipulative foraging task: observers watched either a conspecific or a human demonstrator, or self-moving objects ("ghost control"), or a ghost control accompanied by an inactive conspecific bystander. In addition, 22 subjects that were previously tested without any demonstrator were used as a non-observer control. To solve the task, the subjects had to first remove a plug from its recess to then be able to slide a cover to the side, which would lay open a food compartment. Observers interacted longer with the relevant objects (plugs) and were more successful in solving the task compared to non-observers. We found no differences with regard to success between the four observer groups, indicating that the pigs mainly learned about the apparatus rather than about the actions. As the only common feature of the different demonstrations was the movement of the plug and the cover, we conclude the observer pigs learned primarily by emulation, suggesting that social agents are not necessary for pigs when learning through observation.

AB  - The time interval between fires is a critical component of the fire regime that affects plant species persistence in fire-prone ecosystems. Fire intervals that are too short or too long may not support regeneration from seed banks or resprouting. Fire intervals that support adequate regeneration may also vary with other factors such as climate, herbivory, and population structure. Using field data on flowering and canopy seed banks, we modelled post-fire reproduction for woody fire-killed (obligate seeding) and resprouting species under varying rainfall and herbivory along a 35-year fire age chronosequence in Banksia woodlands in southwestern Australia. We found that fire-killed species attained reproductive maturity rapidly after fire with predicted juvenile periods (time to 50% flowering) of 1.5-2.3 years for shrubs and 4 years for trees. Resprouting species had similar juvenile periods to fire-killed species (1-3.5 years for resprouting shrubs, 4.4 years for resprouting trees). Reproduction varied with rainfall and herbivory with juvenile periods at least doubling under low rainfall or high herbivory for some species. Serotinous species produced cones (woody fruits containing seeds) shortly after flowering commenced, with some evidence of seed bank decline in the oldest sites. While reproduction was clearly correlated with time since fire, plant size was a much stronger predictor. Some species form multi-cohort populations which can introduce large variation into post-fire reproductive trajectories, and this should be considered when making decisions about fire intervals that may impact species persistence. This study provides critical information to assess fire interval-related threats for Banksia woodlands and suggests that woody species of these woodlands are generally tolerant of a wide range of fire intervals. Only the slowest-maturing, fire-killed species (Banksia prionotes, Proteaceae) may require fire intervals > 10 years to reduce immaturity risk under the least favourable growing conditions, and this species often occurs in discrete patches in the landscape such that fire management can be tailored accordingly.

AB  - Ecological and conservation research has focused on documenting wildlife's behavioural and demographic responses to anthropogenic disturbance. Yet, a significant gap remains in our understanding of the physiological mechanisms that underlie behavioural or demographic adaptations to human activities. Glucocorticoid concentrations (GCCs) are widely considered as relevant endpoints to assess the physiological response of wildlife to natural or anthropogenic stressors, yet recent studies show mixed outcomes concerning GCC shifts in disturbed populations. Consequently, uncertainties remain around the role of GCCs as reliable indicators of the effect of anthropogenic disturbance on organisms' physiology, likely due to the masking effect of several confounding factors. To unveil generalizable patterns of physiological effects of human disturbance on wildlife, we collected GCCs measured in conspecific populations living in undisturbed and disturbed areas from 121 studies and 114 species of terrestrial vertebrates, and assessed the roles of disturbance type and species traits in shaping GCC shifts using a phylogenetic meta-analysis of log response ratios (lnRR Delta). We found a 36% increase in GCCs due to human disturbance in mammals (lnRR Delta = 0.304), but no evidence of a generalizable effect for birds, non-avian reptiles and amphibians. Mammals showed similar responses to all forms of anthropogenic disturbance, while birds showed 24.6% increase in GCCs for habitat conversion only (lnRR Delta = 0.221). Furthermore, change in GCCs tended to be higher in large-sized than in small-sized mammals, but comparatively lower in herbivorous mammals. Finally, we found non-migratory birds to elicit stronger responses compared with migratory birds (lnRR Delta = 0.234). Our study provides novel evidence supporting the influential roles of diet and body mass in mammals, and migratory behaviours in birds, in shaping glucocorticoid responses to human disturbance, establishing a link between magnitude of physiological responses and pace-of-life-related traits. Furthermore, we found GCC trends to be coherent with known demographic and behavioural responses, suggesting that GCC shifts might be costly to sustain, thus serving as potential early-warning signals of population decline. Finally, we found consistency in the magnitude of GCC shifts in mammals facing all types of human disturbance, highlighting that even seemingly innocuous interactions with humans may still induce substantial physiological changes.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Understanding the trophic ecology of the giant Pacific octopus Enteroctopus dofleini is challenging in developing marine ranches and in reestablishing its regional stocks against the severe stress of fishing. We adopted carbon and nitrogen stable isotope techniques (termed 813C and 815N, respectively) to identify the trophic niche (i.e., pathways and positions) of this species systematically in the entire food webs of two marine ranches off the east coast of the Korean peninsula. While a slight spatial shift in the isotopic nestedness of faunal communities was observed, the 813C and 815N values of consumers were distinct and separate among functional groups at both ranches. The consumer 813C values spanned a broad range between pelagic and benthic sources of organic matter, and their 815N values recorded a stepwise trophiclevel enrichment, indicating that suspension feeders and herbivore-deposit feeders served as baselines of pelagic-and benthic-based trophic pathways, respectively. The 813C values of predators, including E. dofleini, were arrayed between the two primary consumer groups. Neither 813C nor 815N values showed any remarkable variations with increasing octopus weight. Dietary mixing-model calculations indicated that E. dofleini is a generalist predator relying on both benthic-and pelagic-affinity prey, similar to some teleost species that consume a diverse spectrum of prey. In contrast, other teleost groups showed prevalent trophic links with either pelagic-or benthic-based pathways. The trophic-level estimations revealed that E. dofleini occupies an intermediate position slightly below the teleosts. A lack of discrete trophic positions between E. dofleini and teleosts seemed to be indicative of the released teleost predation but instead reflects the imposed food competition. Overall, the results demonstrated that despite compositional changes in the taxa constituting individual trophic groups, E. dofleini occupied a very similar trophic niche in both ranching systems. Finally, as extracted from information based on octopus marine ranches launched on natural rocky bottoms, our isotopic evidence provides a greater understanding of the trophic ecology of this octopus species in nearshore natural habitats along the southwestern margin of its distribution range.

AB  - Post-introduction evolution of plant defense traits is fundamental to several important theories for plant invasiveness. Research on chemical defense traits of invasive plants has focused mostly on targeted chemical analysis, however, such analyses restrict novel insights to known compounds. Here, we provide an untargeted metabolomic analysis of native and invasive Purple Loosestrife populations and we experimentally test if admixture between introduced populations provides a basis for rapid defense chemistry evolution. Invasive populations showed improved growth and generalist herbivore resistance, but lower resistance to a specialist weevil, consistent with the Shifting Defense Hypothesis of plant invasions. Metabolomic profiling revealed large shifts in chemistry between native and invasive populations, including differences in alkaloids and flavonoids. Experimental admixture increased chemical diversity and plant growth in the native populations, indicating its potential to fuel rapid evolution, but admixture did not affect generalist and specialist herbivory. Our untargeted metabolomics analysis provides novel insights in the evolutionary changes in the chemistry of invasive plants, and reveals the chemical associations of a shift from defenses against specialist to generalist herbivores in invasive populations.

AB  - Plants and insect herbivores are two of the most diverse multicellular groups in the world, and both are strongly influenced by interactions with the belowground soil microbiome. Effects of reciprocal rapid evolution on ecological interactions between herbivores and plants have been repeatedly demonstrated, but it is unknown if (and how) the soil microbiome could mediate these eco-evolutionary processes on a shared host plant. We tested the role of a plant-beneficial soil bacterium Acidovorax radicis in altering eco-evolutionary interactions between different aphid genotypes (Sitobion avenae, genotypes Sickte and Fescue) feeding on barley Hordeum vulgare. We measured fecundity, longevity and population growth of two aphid genotypes reared separately or together (population mixture) on three different barley varieties that were inoculated with or without A. radicis. Results showed that across all plant varieties A. radicis increased plant growth and suppressed aphid populations via reduced longevity and fecundity. The strength of effect was dependent on aphid genotype and barley variety, while the direction of effect was altered by aphid population mixture. Using Lotka-Volterra modelling, we demonstrated that while A. radicis inoculation decreased growth rates for both aphid genotypes it increased the competitiveness of one genotype against the other. In general, in the presence of A. radicis, the Fescue aphid genotype became more inhibitory of Sickte aphids, while Sickte aphids facilitated the growth of Fescue aphids. Our work demonstrates that plant rhizosphere microbiomes exert community-level influences by mediating eco-evolutionary interactions between herbivores and host plants. By altering competitive interaction outcomes among aphids and thus impacting processes such as rapid evolution, soil microbes contribute to the short- and long-term structure and functioning of terrestrial habitats.

AB  - Damage caused by cloven-hoofed game and wild animals is a serious problem in Slovakia and neighboring countries. In 2022, the damage to forests in Slovakia was estimated at a level of almost EUR 2.9 million. Despite several implemented measures, the situation is so severe that successfully restoring some trees in some heavily attacked stands is impossible. This paper deals with the preventive elimination of damage caused by red deer in forest stands by the biological method of applying tannin-based mineral licks. Specifically, licks containing tannin obtained from the edible chestnut were used for testing. Several positive effects are attributed to tannins in developing livestock and animal fitness status. To date, however, the question of using tannins as biological agents for the possible protection of forest stands has not been addressed. Therefore, red deer damage was assessed at two localities with similar natural conditions in the central part of the Western Carpathians to explore such a possibility. After the initial sample measurement of the bark-stripping damage caused by the red deer in the autumn, mineral licks with tannin were placed in one selected study area over the winter. The levels of and differences in forest damage by deer between areas with the application of licks with tannin and without tannin were detected in spring of the following year. In the location treated with tannin, the number of damaged sample plots decreased, and the mean plot damage did not increase (no statistically significant differences were registered in mean plot damage between autumn and spring). Meanwhile, in the control location, the total amount of bark-stripped area doubled, mainly due to a statistically significant increase in mean plot damage between autumn and spring. Based on this, we conclude that tannin had a significant preventive effect and considerably reduced the extent of bark stripping. Such promising results indicate that tannin licks can effectively mitigate the problem of bark-stripping damage in areas heavily attacked by red deer.

AB  - Simple Summary Human activities have left indelible traces in the gene pool of livestock as well as recently domesticated wild animal species which are manifested by changes in their genome structure, often accompanied by the significant loss of biodiversity, especially in the case of small local populations. Despite the benefits of deer farming, intensive artificial selection associated with domestication can lead to several negative effects, including founder effects, inbreeding depression, or rapid decline in effective population size, which are also often present in traditional livestock. This study investigates the effect of human-mediated selection on the diversity of seven farmed red deer populations compared to two wild populations through the quantification of the level of genomic heterozygosity, inbreeding, admixture, and gene flow. These results will help to improve traditional breeding schemes and assist in a more sustainable utilisation of available animal genetic resources. In this study, we analysed the effect of human-mediated selection on the gene pool of wild and farmed red deer populations based on genotyping-by-sequencing data. The farmed red deer sample covered populations spread across seven countries and two continents (France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, New Zealand, Poland, and Slovakia). The Slovak and Spain wild red deer populations (the latter one in a large game estate) were used as control outgroups. The gene flow intensity, relationship and admixture among populations were tested by the Bayesian approach and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). The highest gene diversity (H-e = 0.19) and the lowest genomic inbreeding (F-HOM = 0.04) found in Slovak wild population confirmed our hypothesis that artificial selection accompanied by bottlenecks has led to the increase in overall genomic homozygosity. The Bayesian approach and DAPC consistently identified three separate genetic groups. As expected, the farmed populations were clustered together, while the Slovak and Spanish populations formed two separate clusters. Identified traces of genetic admixture in the gene pool of farmed populations reflected a strong contemporary migration rate between them. This study suggests that even if the history of deer farming has been shorter than traditional livestock species, it may leave significant traces in the genome structure.

AB  - The Lake Kinneret (Sea of Galilee) ecosystem has undergone physical and biological changes over the past 25 years, including a shift from a dinoflagellate Peridinium gatunense)-dominated system to one in which Cyanobacteria play a major role. The Saint Peter's fish, Sarotherodon galilaeus, the most valuable commercial fish in the lake, was a prime consumer of P. gatunense. Sarotherodon galilaeus has adapted to the ecosystem changes and the scarcity of its primary food source, affecting interactions with other fish in the lake, such as the stocked silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix. To examine the food habits of the two fish species following the changes in the lake, a total of 300 S. galilaeus and 150 H. molitrix individuals were randomly collected over a five-year period from various places and times in Lake Kinneret. The contents of their stomachs were identified and analyzed. Results showed that a major dietary shift from herbivory to omnivory has occurred since the 1970s in both S. galilaeus and H. molitrix, with H. molitrix now preying almost exclusively on zooplankton. As a result of the dietary changes, both species have had to compete with other fish species for the limited zooplankton resources present in the lake, as well as contending with Cyanobacterial blooms. These changes in the lake's food web require modifications in the management of the lake and its fisheries.

AB  - Understanding the often antagonistic plant-herbivore interactions and how host defenses can influence herbivore dietary breadth is an area of ongoing study in ecology and evolutionary biology. Typically, host plants/fungi that produce highly noxious chemical defenses are only fed on by specialists. We know very little about generalist species that can feed and develop on a noxious host. One such example of generalists feeding on toxic host occurs in the mushroom-feeding Drosophila found in the immigrans-tripunctata radiation. Although these species are classified as generalists, their acceptable hosts include deadly Amanita species. In this study, we used behavioral assays to assess associations between one mushroom-feeding species, Drosophila guttifera, and the deadly Amanita phalloides. We conducted feeding assays to confirm the presence of cyclopeptide toxin tolerance. We then completed host preference assays in female flies and larvae and did not find a preference for toxic mushrooms in either. Finally, we assessed the effect of competition on oviposition preference. We found that the presence of a competitor's eggs on the preferred host was associated with the flies increasing the number of eggs laid on the toxic mushrooms. Our results highlight how access to a low competition host resource may help to maintain associations between a generalist species and a highly toxic host.
   We used a variety of behavioral assays to assess the association between a generalist feeder and a highly toxic host fungus. Our results suggest that access to a resource with lower competition may help to maintain this association.image

AB  - Subsistence farmers in elephant rangelands suffer food insecurity, economic losses and emotional stress from crop damage by elephants, resulting in reduced local support toward elephant conservation. To foster human-elephant co-existence in a dynamic social-ecological system, we explored the validity of Classification Tree (CT) analysis application to identify human-elephant hotspots in an effort to target approaches to reduce human-elephant conflicts. The CT analysis revealed that the most important factors affecting occurrence of crop damage were crop types, field sizes and distance to nearest road and river. From CT generated thresholds, we propose establishment of multi-criteria-based risk zones, as an alternative approach, to quickly identify and prioritize future human-elephant conflict (HEC) hotspots for improved agrarian livelihood and elephant conservation outcomes. We also explained the limitations of CT models. This study contributes to the existing theory and body of work on elephant habitat use at the human-elephant interface.

AB  - BACKGROUNDThe tomato russet mite (TRM), Aculops lycopersici, is a strictly herbivorous and economically significant pest that infests Solanaceae plants, but its host suitability varies, showing high performance on tomatoes. Although symbiotic bacteria have been suggested to play crucial roles in the host adaptation of herbivores, their effects on TRM remain unclear.RESULTSIn this study, using next generation high-throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA data, we identified the bacterial diversity and community composition of TRM feeding on tomato, eggplant, and chili. Our results show no significant difference in the bacterial community composition of TRM across three host plants. However, the relative density of Escherichia coli (TRM_Escherichia) showed 9.36-fold higher on tomato than on eggplant and chili. These results align with the observed TRM performance among three host plants. When TRM_Escherichia was reduced using antibiotics, the treated TRM decreased the population density on tomato. However, when we transferred TRM from eggplant to tomato, the population density of TRM increased, coinciding with an increase of the TRM_Escherichia density. These results indicate that TRM_Escherichia may affect the host suitability of TRM. Our fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results further showed that TRM_Escherichia is primarily distributed in the salivary glands. Metagenomic data results suggest that TRM_Escherichia functions in food digestion and energy metabolism.CONCLUSIONWe provided the first comprehensive analysis of TRM bacterial communities. Our findings demonstrate that the symbiotic bacterium TRM_Escherichia may play crucial roles in the suitability of TRM feeding on different Solanaceae hosts. (c) 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - To optimize soil health, land use, and soil management decisions need to be guided by an understanding of the underlying soil health. Although widely used fertilizers guarantee crop production, they ultimately damage agricultural soil environmental quality and threaten the overall food chain safety. Thus, an integrative assess-ment considering both environmental safety and soil fertility is required for the sustainable development of long-term fertilization systems. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of soil health using 20 soil physical, chemical, and biological indicators and assessed them according to four heavy metals-copper, zinc, cadmium, and lead. This experiment was conducted in an area where there is an ongoing, 23-year-long fertil-ization experiment in a typical red soil region of southern China, including four treatments of common inorganic chemical fertilizer (CF), CF mixed with micronutrients (CF + T), CF mixed with pig manure (PM), and PM mixed with micronutrients (PM + T). To assess the soil fertility quality, we selected a minimum data set consisting of soil water-stable aggregates mean weight diameter, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon, and dehydrogenase activity. The results revealed that soil fertility quality followed the order of PM + T & AP; PM > CF + T > CF. We also used a modified potential ecological risk index to assess the soil environmental quality. This approach considered the acid-soluble and exchangeable fraction of heavy metals as the bioavail-ability component. Both PM and PM + T treated soils were significantly contaminated by heavy metals, with particularly large amounts of Cd contamination. The soil health index escalated from CF, CF + T, PM to PM + T, which indicated that the use of pig manure allowed for more fertile soil relative to standard chemical fertil-ization. Moreover, applying additional micronutrients also had a significant influence on soil fertility. Therefore, our study revealed that long-term fertilization using organic pig manure was beneficial to overall soil fertility; however, these benefits were coupled with significant limitations regarding heavy metal contamination. Collectively, this study provides a better supporting method for soil health management and long-term fertil-ization strategies.

AB  - The intensification of livestock farming worldwide has generated growing concern about its environmental impact. In the Peruvian highlands, llama farming has not yet been assessed from a sustainability perspective. The objective of our research was to assess the sustainability of llama farming in the San Pedro de Racco Communal Cooperative (Pasco), using the SAFA (Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems) methodology. The study was developed in four phases: mapping, contextualization, selection and evaluation of indicators, and preparation of the final report. The information was collected through surveys and review of management documents provided by the cooperative. Following their evaluation and adaptation to the llama production system, 19 themes, 37 subthemes, and 67 indicators were selected and evaluated to assess their sustainability. The results revealed poor performance in the good governance dimension, average performance in the environmental integrity and economic resilience dimensions, and good performance in the social well-being dimension. It was concluded that the cooperative does not have a management focused on the sustainability of llama breeding, which could affect environmental conservation and economic resilience in the long term, putting the continuity of this traditional productive activity at risk. We believe that our research provides valuable knowledge that not only benefits the local community, but also promotes more sustainable livestock systems in the Peruvian Andes and new for future research.

AB  - Simple Summary An interesting anthropological question is whether, over the last 10,000 years, humans have domesticated animals by actually selecting the tamest and least aggressive individuals. These characteristics-known as 'domestication syndrome'-should be present from the very early stages of life of domesticated animals. Because social play is the most important 'friendly' contact between very young individuals, we verified whether piglets (with both domestic pig parents) were more playful and less aggressive than hybrid pups (with wild boar father and domestic pig mother). To this purpose, we investigated three litters of piglets and three litters of wild boar hybrids, all raised in northern Italy (Parva Domus farm, Cavagnolo, Torino) in the same grassland/woodland environment and under similar farming conditions. We found that piglets played more and in a 'less chaotic' way than wild boar hybrids, especially after the first three weeks of life but also that piglets were more aggressive than hybrids, with piglet aggression being more frequently unbalanced in favour of one individual. Thus, the domestication syndrome does not fully apply to either social play or aggression, possibly because artificial selection may have produced greater tameness of pigs towards humans than towards other pigs. The 'domestication syndrome' defines a suite of features that domesticated animals possess as the result of the artificial selection operated by Homo sapiens since the Neolithic. An interesting anthropological question is whether such features, including increased tameness and reduced aggression, apply to all domesticated forms. We investigated this issue in the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). We video-recorded and analysed aggression and social play (mostly play-fighting) sessions from piglets (three litters; n = 24) and wild boar hybrids (domestic pig mother x wild boar father; three litters; n = 27) from 6-50 days of age, raised in the same woodland/grassland habitat and extensive farming management (ethical farm 'Parva Domus', Cavagnolo, Torino). Play and aggression session structure was assessed via Asymmetry (AI; offensive/defensive pattern balance), Shannon (H '; pattern variability), and Pielou (J; pattern evenness) indices. We found that piglets played more (especially after the 20th day of life) and engaged in less variable and uniform sessions than wild boar hybrids. Compared to hybrids, piglets showed less variable but more frequent (especially when approaching weaning) and asymmetrical aggressive events. Thus, the domestication syndrome does not seem to fully apply to either social play or aggression, possibly because artificial selection has produced greater tameness of pigs towards humans than towards conspecifics.

AB  - Migratory storks could be vectors of transmission of bacteria of public health concern mediated by the colonization, persistence and excretion of such bacteria. This study aims to determine genera/species diversity, prevalence, and co-colonization indices of bacteria obtained from tracheal (T) and nasal (N) samples from storks in relation to exposure to point sources through foraging. One-hundred and thirty-six samples from 87 nestlings of colonies of parent white storks with different foraging habits (natural habitat and landfills) were obtained (84 T-samples and 52 N-samples) and processed. Morphologically distinct colonies (up to 12/sample) were randomly selected and identified by MALDI-TOF-MS. About 87.2% of the total 806 isolates recovered were identified: 398 from T-samples (56.6%) and 305 from N-samples (43.4%). Among identified isolates, 17 genera and 46 species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were detected, Staphylococcus (58.0%) and Enterococcus (20.5%) being the most prevalent genera. S. sciuri was the most prevalent species from T (36.7%) and N (34.4%) cavities of total isolates, followed by E. faecalis (11.1% each from T and N), and S. aureus [T (6.5%), N (13.4%)]. Of N-samples, E. faecium was significantly associated with nestlings of parent storks foraging in landfills (p = 0.018). S. sciuri (p = 0.0034) and M. caseolyticus (p = 0.032) from T-samples were significantly higher among nestlings of parent storks foraging in natural habitats. More than 80% of bacterial species in the T and N cavities showed 1-10% co-colonization indices with one another, but few had >= 40% indices. S. sciuri and E. faecalis were the most frequent species identified in the stork nestlings. Moreover, they were highly colonized by other diverse and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Thus, storks could be sentinels of point sources and vehicles of bacterial transmission across the "One Health" ecosystems.

AB  - Multiple species of the elephant fishes (Mormyridae) commonly coexist in sympatry in most African tropical rivers and lakes. In this study, we investigated the trophic ecology and potential trophic niche partitioning of eleven mormyrid fish species from the Sanaga River system in Cameroon using the stable isotope composition of carbon and nitrogen in the muscle samples. Albeit most mormyrids mainly feed on invertebrates, we found differences in isotope ratios, and we report signs of the trophic niche partitioning among species. We further found significant differences in isotopic signatures within the Mormyrus genus, suggesting ecological niche diversification among three closely related species. We have also evaluated differences in the isotopic signals between seasons in four species, which could be possibly caused by species migration and/or anthropogenic agricultural activities. To evaluate body shape, we applied geometric morphometric analyses, and we show that most of the species are clearly morphologically separated. We focused on the mormyrid ecomorphology to identify a possible interaction between shape and ecology, and we found a relationship between the delta 13C (but not delta 15N) isotopic signal and morphology, suggesting their interplay during mormyrid evolution. Overall, we present robust evidence of the trophic niche partitioning within the mormyrid species community, and we integrate trophic ecology with morphometrics, shedding light on the enigmatic evolutionary history of these fascinating African fishes.
   The study is focused on the trophic ecology of Mormyridae based on the stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen. We report on differences of the isotopic signal among eleven mormyrid species from the Sanaga River in Cameroon, and we provide evidence for trophic niche differentiation within the genus Mormyrus. We also noticed a potential relationship between the snout shape and the trophic position, and we further found an effect of seasonality on isotopic signatures.image

AB  - Many marine megafauna taxa are tied to the sea surface for breathing which makes them vulnerable to vessel collisions. Sea turtles have developed efficient mechanisms to reduce surface time for breathing to a few seconds, but they can extend their surface periods to rest or to rewarm after diving into deep and colder waters. However, knowledge of collision occurrences is limited to data of turtles stranded along the coastline worldwide, whereas events occurring offshore go likely underestimated due to the sinking of carcasses. Here we performed a spatially explicit assessment to identify, for the first time, oceanic areas of higher exposure for sea turtles from maritime traffic in the Tyrrhenian Sea, Western Mediterranean. Satellite-tracking data were used to estimate utilization distributions of loggerhead turtles using Brownian bridge kernel density estimation. Maritime traffic density maps based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data were extracted from open-access data layers, provided by the European Maritime Safety Agency, summarized, and used for the exposure analysis. Turtle occurrences were also investigated in response to vessel densities and seasonal patterns by fitting a generalized additive model to the data. Our results demonstrated that loggerhead turtles are potentially exposed to maritime traffic across the entire basin, especially in the easternmost part. The exposure varies among spring/summer and autumn/winter months. Highest turtle occurrences were found in regions primarily subjected to cargo, tanker, and passenger transportation. This study represents the first-ever effort to characterize the exposure of oceanic loggerhead turtles to maritime traffic and highlights oceanic areas of higher exposure where research and conservation efforts should be directed to understand the effective impact of this stressor on the species.

AB  - The estimation of foliar traits has numerous potential applications, with the evaluation of ecosystem productivity generally regarded as one of the most widely used. In this study, we linked information regarding the concen-tration of various canopy traits to landscape-level forest health and pest susceptibility using remote sensing technology. Foliar traits that can affect insect herbivory, including nutritive elements such as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and copper (Cu), non-nutritive elements such as iron (Fe) and calcium (Ca), and defensive parameters such as equivalent water thickness (EWT) and leaf mass per area (LMA), were estimated. We used Sentinel-2 and site data to develop trait estimation models in a forest dominated by spruce and fir. Several machine-learning algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were tested. Based on the model performances, where normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) values were taken into account, XGB algorithm was selected to estimate Ca (nRMSE: 0.16), EWT (nRMSE: 0.12), Fe (nRMSE: 0.19), and K (nRMSE: 0.14). On the other hand, RF was used to model Cu (nRMSE: 0.18), LMA (nRMSE: 0.14), N (nRMSE: 0.16), and P (nRMSE: 0.22). Almost all best-performing models included Sentinel-2 red-edge indices and depth to water table (DWT) as the most important variables. We propose a novel framework to establish a connection between the concentration of foliar traits in SBW host foliage and tree susceptibility to the pest. This approach could allow for the assessment of host susceptibility on a landscape level based on the concentrations of foliar traits.

AB  - In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were used to investigate kinship, genetic diversity and inbreeding within a globally significant area for the Critically Endangered giant shovelnose ray, Glaucostegus typus (Anonymous [Bennett] 1830). Sampling for G. typus was conducted in the eastern Indian Ocean, along an expansive (similar to 1000 km) stretch of the Western Australian coastline. Single-read sequencing was performed using a Glaucostegus DArTseq (TM) platform, with a high-density assay of 2.5 million sequence reads. Kinship, genetic diversity and inbreeding were investigated for G. typus using between 564 and 4126 SNPs. Four full and four half sibling dyads were detected amongst 90 genotyped G. typus, including one pair of half siblings separated by > 600 km of coastline, providing evidence of long-distance, likely parental, movement. Observed heterozygosity (H-O= 0.29-0.30) and gene diversity (H-S= 0.32-0.33) were relatively low compared to other rays, although a lack of previous studies using SNP data may reduce the effectiveness of comparisons. Moderate levels of inbreeding were detected at each site (F-IS = 0.07-0.13) and across all sites, combined (F-IS = 0.09). Long-distance movement of G. typus between sampled assemblages reduces the risk of localised extinctions across the study area; additional work is required to determine whether the sampled assemblages are genetically distinct from one another, as well as other G. typus populations throughout its Indo-West Pacific range.

AB  - Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) are a partially migratory species wherein some individuals undergo long-distance anadromous migrations, and others stay as residents in their native freshwater streams. The decision to migrate is known to be highly heritable, and yet, the underlying genes and alleles associated with migration are not fully characterized. Here we used a pooled approach of whole-genome sequence data from migratory and resident trout of two native populations-Sashin Creek, Alaska and Little Sheep Creek, Oregon-to obtain a genome-wide perspective of the genetic architecture of resident and migratory life history. We calculated estimates of genetic differentiation, genetic diversity, and selection between the two phenotypes to locate regions of interest and then compared these associations between populations. We identified numerous genes and alleles associated with life history development in the Sashin Creek population with a notable area on chromosome 8 that may play a critical role in the development of the migratory phenotype. However, very few alleles appeared to be associated with life history development in the Little Sheep Creek system, suggesting population-specific genetic effects are likely important in the development of anadromy. Our results indicate that a migratory life history is not controlled by a singular gene or region but supports the idea that there are many independent ways for a migratory phenotype to emerge in a population. Therefore, conserving and promoting genetic diversity in migratory individuals is paramount to conserving these populations. Ultimately, our data add to a growing body of literature that suggests that population-specific genetic effects, likely mediated through environmental variation, contribute to life history development in rainbow trout.

AB  - The intra-montane Guadix-Baza Basin is one of the few continental basins in Europe that hosts a well-dated set of fossiliferous sites spanning from the latest Miocene to the late Middle Pleistocene. The Cullar de Baza 1 (CB-1) represents a key site to investigate the effects of the Early-Middle Pleistocene Transition, considered a fundamental transformation in the Earth's climate state. Our review and update of the large mammal assemblage, and particularly equids, is of paramount relevance to understand the systematic affinities and the evolution of the Early and Middle Pleistocene European horses. We confirm the occurrence of two different taxa, the medium sized Equus altidens and the larger E. suessenbornensis. Moreover, we illustrate that CB-1 is essential for the biochronological studies of the latest Early Pleis-tocene/Middle Pleistocene transition (Epivillafranchian/Galerian ELMA); in particular with regard to the Last Occurrences of the Etruscan rhino Stephanorhinus etruscus and the large deer Megaloceros savini and the First Occurrence of the water-rat Arvicola mosbachensis in the Iberian peninsula. Finally, a develop-ment of a mosaic environment characterised the CB-1 site contrasting with the conditions reported for other Iberian late Early and Middle Pleistocene localities.

AB  - Sexual competition is increasingly recognized as an important selective pressure driving species distributions. However, few studies have investigated the relative importance of interpopulation versus intrapopulation competition in relation to habitat availability and selection. To explain spatial segregation between sexes that often occurs in non-territorial and central place foragers, such as seabirds, two hypotheses are commonly used. The 'competitive exclusion' hypothesis states that dominant individuals should exclude subordinate individuals through direct competition, whereas the 'niche divergence' hypothesis states that segregation occurs due to past competition and habitat specialization. We tested these hypotheses in two populations of an extreme wide-ranging and sexually dimorphic seabird, investigating the relative role of intrapopulation and interpopulation competition in influencing sex-specific distribution and habitat preferences. Using GPS loggers, we tracked 192 wandering albatrosses Diomedea exulans during four consecutive years (2016-2019), from two neighbouring populations in the Southern Ocean (Prince Edward and Crozet archipelagos). We simulated pseudo-tracks to create a null spatial distribution and used Kernel Density Estimates (KDE) and Resource Selection Functions (RSF) to distinguish the relative importance of within- versus between-population competition. Kernel Density Estimates showed that only intrapopulation sexual segregation was significant for each monitoring year, and that tracks between the two colonies resulted in greater overlap than expected from the null distribution, especially for the females. RSF confirmed these results and highlighted key at-sea foraging areas, even if the estimated of at-sea densities were extremely low. These differences in selected areas between sites and sexes were, however, associated with high interannual variability in habitat preferences, with no clear specific preferences per site and sex. Our results suggest that even with low at-sea population densities, historic intrapopulation competition in wide-ranging seabirds may have led to sexual dimorphism and niche specialization, favouring the 'niche divergence' hypothesis. In this study, we provide a protocol to study competition within as well as between populations of central place foragers. This is relevant for understanding their distribution patterns and population regulation, which could potentially improve management of threatened populations.

AB  - Numbers and distribution of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana) have significantly declined from historic levels throughout their range in Mexico. Consequently, we documented survival rates of adult female and male desert bighorn in Sonora from 2019 to 2021, emphasizing adult females given the sensitivity of population rate-of-increase to adult female survival, and further evaluated survival with respect to precipitation patterns. Survival in 2019 (females = 0.88; males = 0.57) was comparable to other North American desert bighorn populations, but declined to the lowest levels documented for adult desert bighorn during severe droughts in 2020 and 2021 (<= 0.50). Survival was most strongly associated with total annual precipitation; odds of desert bighorn survival increased 1.01x for each 1 mm increase in total precipitation. Survival was also influenced by precipitation during the post-monsoon period, which coincides with the periods of highest energetic demands on bighorn. Survival-days were similarly influenced by precipitation during these same time periods, as well as landscape greenness during the post-monsoon period. Recovery of desert bighorn will be challenging due to the impact of precipitation on survival and the increasing frequency and severity of drought in Sonora, as management options to mitigate drought-induced declines are extremely limited.

AB  - Fast-growing and slow-growing plant species are suggested to show integrated economics spectrums and the tradeoffs of fast growth are predicted to emerge as susceptibility to herbivory and resource competition. We tested if these predictions also hold for fast-growing and slow-growing genotypes within a silver birch, Betula pendula population. We exposed cloned saplings of 17 genotypes with slow, medium or fast height growth to reduced insect herbivory, using an insecticide, and to increasing resource competition, using naturally varying field plot grass cover. We measured shoot and root growth, ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal production using ergosterol analysis and soil N transfer to leaves using N-15-labelled pulse of NH4+. We found that fast-growing genotypes grew on average 78% faster, produced 56% and 16% more leaf mass and ergosterol, and showed 78% higher leaf N uptake than slow-growing genotypes. The insecticide decreased leaf damage by 83% and increased shoot growth, leaf growth and leaf N uptake by 38%, 52% and 76%, without differences between the responses of fast-growing and slow-growing genotypes, whereas root mass decreased with increasing grass cover. Shoot and leaf growth of fast-growing genotypes decreased and EM fungal production of slow-growing genotypes increased with increasing grass cover. Our results suggest that fast growth is genotypically associated with higher allocation to EM fungi, better soil N capture and greater leaf production, and that the tradeoff of fast growth is sensitivity to competition, but not to insect herbivory. EM fungi may have a dual role: to support growth of fast-growing genotypes under low grass competition and to maintain growth of slow-growing genotypes under intensifying competition.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: Negative interactions with wildlife hinder biodiversity conservation, and attempts to devolve wildlife management to local communities near protected areas have had limited success. This study applied Citizen Science Theory (CST) as a bottom-up approach to examine the role of Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in reducing human-wildlife conflicts in the eastern buffer zone of the Selous Game Reserve. Methods: Data were collected from 240 households through surveys, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. Qualitative data were analyzed via content analysis, while quantitative data were processed using SPSS version 26. Results: Following the establishment of WMAs, 67.5% and 83% of respondents reported decreases in illegal wildlife offtake and habitat destruction, respectively. However, incidents of crop damage, livestock predation, and human attacks caused by wild animals increased by 28.6%, 40.6%, and 79.2%, respectively. Regarding interaction patterns, annual crop damage was higher near WMAs, averaging 7.2 +/- 0.1 acres, compared to 0.6 +/- 0.1 acres in areas farther away. Similarly, approximately 83 livestock were attacked within 500 meters of WMA boundaries, while only 11 livestock were attacked beyond 30 kilometers. About 72% of respondents indicated that human attacks occurred primarily during farming activities, with lions, leopards, hyenas, crocodiles, elephants, buffalo, and hippopotamuses identified as the responsible species. Conclusion: We concluded that the expansion of wildlife habitats through a community-based conservation approach increased wildlife populations; however, it also heightened the challenges posed by wild animals to local communities. Implications for conservation: WMAs inception is paramount to wildlife conservation particularly those requiring large home ranges. Enhancing wildlife control by encouraging local monitoring, using sound and odor deterrents, and promoting public education on safely interacting with wild animals, strengthening traditional enclosures using predator-proof materials such as thorny bushes or modern steel fences to reduce nighttime attacks, should be prioritized to mitigate negative interactions with wildlife.

AB  - Nature-based solutions (NbS) are gaining attention as viable strategies for restoring water-rich ecosystems such as the pa<acute accent>ramo. However, the lack of evidence on their effectiveness, coupled with a limited understanding of their political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal (PESTEL) context, hinders their widespread adoption. To address this gap, we propose a multi-method framework that (i) captures PESTEL factors influencing the implementation of passive ecological restoration in pa<acute accent>ramo ecosystems as a measure of NbS and (ii) assesses its associated environmental impacts. Our approach integrates a scoping review with remote sensing techniques, water quality assessment, and correlation analyses. Focusing on the Upper Pita and Upper Cutuchi River Basins-key water sources for Andean communities in Ecuador, we reveal that the deterioration of their pa<acute accent>ramo ecosystems in the 20th century was mainly due to camelid grazing and pine timber production. In response to these threats, bottom-up management efforts starting in 1999, guided by various PESTEL factors, promoted policies, regulations, social agreements, and financial support for achieving passive ecological restoration between 2010 and 2017 in the Upper Pita River Basin. As a result, the conservation of 73.4% of natural pa<acute accent>ramo with excellent water quality in 2022. By contrast, top-down management in the Upper Cutuchi River Basin was ineffective because national strategies failed to tackle the local environmental challenges posed by the PESTEL factors. Hence, only 31.6% of the natural pa<acute accent>ramo remained withpoor water quality by 2022. Our study is the first to demonstrate that passive ecological restoration benefits these ecosystems, while its absence results in significant changes that require additional restoration strategies.

AB  - A central goal in ecology is to predict what governs a species' ability to establish in a new environment. One mechanism driving establishment success is individual species' traits, but the role of trait combinations among interacting species across different trophic levels is less clear. Deliberate or accidental species additions to existing communities provide opportunities to study larger scale patterns of establishment success. Biological control introductions are especially valuable because they contain data on both the successfully established and unestablished species. Here, we used a recent dataset of importation biological control introductions to explore how life-history traits of 132 parasitoid species and their herbivorous hosts interact to affect parasitoid establishment. We find that of five parasitoid and herbivore traits investigated, one parasitoid trait-host range-weakly predicts parasitoid establishment; parasitoids with higher levels of phylogenetic specialization have higher establishment success, though the effect is marginal. In addition, parasitoids are more likely to establish when their herbivore host has had a shorter residence time. Interestingly, we do not corroborate earlier findings that gregarious parasitoids and endoparasitoids are more likely to establish. Most importantly, we find that life-history traits of the parasitoid species and their hosts can interact to influence establishment. Specifically, parasitoids with broader host ranges are more likely to establish when the herbivore they have been released to control is also more of a generalist. These results provide insight into how multiple species' traits and their interactions, both within and across trophic levels, can influence establishment of species of higher trophic levels.

AB  - The Falkland Islands marine environment host a mix of temperate and subantarctic species. This review synthesizes baseline information regarding ontogenetic migration patterns and trophic interactions in relation to oceanographic dynamics of the Falkland Shelf, which is useful to inform ecosystem modelling. Many species are strongly influenced by regional oceanographic dynamics that bring together different water masses, resulting in high primary production which supports high biomass in the rest of the food web. Further, many species, including those of commercial interest, show complex ontogenetic migrations that separate spawning, nursing, and feeding grounds spatially and temporally, producing food web connections across space and time. The oceanographic and biological dynamics may make the ecosystem vulnerable to climatic changes in temperature and shifts in the surrounding area. The Falkland marine ecosystem has been understudied and various functional groups, deep-sea habitats and inshore-offshore connections are poorly understood and should be priorities for further research.

AB  - Despite being resident or reintroduced to multiple South African protected areas, spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta) have been subject to limited population monitoring and are not managed in the same intensive way as other large carnivores. Considering the species' significant influence on ecosystem processes, robust estimates of population density are necessary to inform conservation management. In this study, we ran a single-season camera trap survey in the Main Camp section of Addo Elephant National Park (Addo), South Africa, and used spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models to estimate spotted hyaena population density. Spotted hyaena density was estimated to be 11.13 (+/- SE 1.96) individuals/100 km(2), with an estimated abundance of 37 (+/- SE 6.44) individuals. Using our database of sexed spotted hyaena individuals, we found no significant difference for sex-specific SCR parameters (baseline encounter probability and spatial scale parameter), suggesting the incorporation of sex-specific information may not be as necessary for spotted hyaena as it is for territorial felids and other species with more pronounced differences in range size. Spotted hyaena density in Addo was comparable to previous SCR studies and towards the higher end of known densities. Our estimate provides an important baseline for monitoring reintroduction success in Addo, and we advocate for increased SCR monitoring of spotted hyaena in South African protected areas to inform a metapopulation approach to the species' management.

AB  - Maternal effects are ubiquitous. Yet, the pathways through which maternal effects occur in wild mammals remain largely unknown. We hypothesise that maternal immune transfer is a key mechanism by which mothers can affect their offspring fitness, and that individual variation in maternally derived antibodies mainly depends on a mother's characteristics and the environmental conditions she experiences. To test this, we assayed six colostrum-derived antibodies in the plasma of 1447 neonates in a wild red deer population. Neonatal antibody levels were mainly affected by maternal genes, environmental variation and costs of prior reproductive investment. We found consistent heterogeneity in maternal performance across traits, with mothers producing the heaviest calves also having calves with more antibodies. Unexpectedly, antibody levels were not associated with calf survival. We provide a unique example of how evolutionary theory on maternal effects can be used to gain insight into the causes of maternal effects in wild populations.

AB  - Wildfires burn heterogeneously across the landscape and create complex forest structures. Quantifying the structural changes in post-fire forests is critical to evaluating wildfire impacts and providing insights into burn severities. To advance the understanding of burn severities at a fine scale, forest structural attributes at the individual tree level need to be examined. The advent of drone laser scanning (DLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) has enabled the acquisition of high-density point clouds to resolve fine structures of individual trees. Yet, few studies have used DLS and MLS data jointly to examine their combined capability to describe post-fire forest structures. To assess the impacts of the 2017 Elephant Hill wildfire in British Columbia, Canada, we scanned trees that experienced a range of burn severities 2 years post-fire using both DLS and MLS. After fusing the DLS and MLS data, we reconstructed quantitative structure models to compute 14 post-fire biometric, volumetric, and crown attributes. At the individual tree level, our data suggest that smaller pre-fire trees tend to experience higher levels of crown scorch than larger pre-fire trees. Among trees with similar pre-fire sizes, those within mature stands (age class: > 50 years) had lower levels of crown scorch than those within young stands (age class: 15-50 years). Among pre-fire small- and medium-diameter trees, those experiencing high crown scorch had smaller post-fire crowns with unevenly distributed branches compared to unburned trees. In contrast, pre-fire large-diameter trees were more resistant to crown scorch. At the plot level, low-severity fires had minor effects, moderate-severity fires mostly decreased tree height, and high-severity fires significantly reduced diameter at breast height, height, and biomass. Our exploratory factor analyses further revealed that stands dominated by trees with large crown sizes and relatively wide spacing could burn less severely than stands characterized by regenerating trees with high crown fuel density and continuity. Overall, our results demonstrate that fused DLS-MLS point clouds can be effective in quantifying post-fire tree structures, which facilitates foresters to develop site-specific management plans. The findings imply that the management of crown fuel abundance and configuration could be vital to controlling burn severities.

AB  - Both fire and predators have strong influences on the population dynamics and behaviour of animals, and the effects of predators may either be strengthened or weakened by fire. However, knowledge of how fire drives or mediates predator-prey interactions is fragmented and has not been synthesised. Here, we review and synthesise knowledge of how fire influences predator and prey behaviour and interactions. We develop a conceptual model based on predator-prey theory and empirical examples to address four key questions: (i) how and why do predators respond to fire; (ii) how and why does prey vulnerability change post-fire; (iii) what mechanisms do prey use to reduce predation risk post-fire; and (iv) what are the outcomes of predator-fire interactions for prey populations? We then discuss these findings in the context of wildlife conservation and ecosystem management before outlining priorities for future research. Fire-induced changes in vegetation structure, resource availability, and animal behaviour influence predator-prey encounter rates, the amount of time prey are vulnerable during an encounter, and the conditional probability of prey death given an encounter. How a predator responds to fire depends on fire characteristics (e.g. season, severity), their hunting behaviour (ambush or pursuit predator), movement behaviour, territoriality, and intra-guild dynamics. Prey species that rely on habitat structure for avoiding predation often experience increased predation rates and lower survival in recently burnt areas. By contrast, some prey species benefit from the opening up of habitat after fire because it makes it easier to detect predators and to modify their behaviour appropriately. Reduced prey body condition after fire can increase predation risk either through impaired ability to escape predators, or increased need to forage in risky areas due to being energetically stressed. To reduce risk of predation in the post-fire environment, prey may change their habitat use, increase sheltering behaviour, change their movement behaviour, or use camouflage through cryptic colouring and background matching. Field experiments and population viability modelling show instances where fire either amplifies or does not amplify the impacts of predators on prey populations, and vice versa. In some instances, intense and sustained post-fire predation may lead to local extinctions of prey populations. Human disruption of fire regimes is impacting faunal communities, with consequences for predator and prey behaviour and population dynamics. Key areas for future research include: capturing data continuously before, during and after fires; teasing out the relative importance of changes in visibility and shelter availability in different contexts; documenting changes in acoustic and olfactory cues for both predators and prey; addressing taxonomic and geographic biases in the literature; and predicting and testing how changes in fire-regime characteristics reshape predator-prey interactions. Understanding and managing the consequences for predator-prey communities will be critical for effective ecosystem management and species conservation in this era of global change.

AB  - Marine reserves can increase the abundance and size of harvested fish species, but the indirect effects of protection on wider fish assemblages are less well understood. Better understanding how marine reserves indirectly effect reef fish is essential to interpreting changes in non-targeted taxa and informing management expectations as to the long-term effects of marine protection. We investigated how reef fish assemblages and habitats have changed within New Zealand's oldest marine reserve after 40 years of no-take protection (1978 to 2018), and how they differed inside and outside the reserve in 2018. Reef fish assemblages differed between 1978 and 2018, and between reserve and fished sites, and these effects were greatest at depths where habitats had changed. We report an overall increase in fish biomass in the reserve, but a long-term decline in total fish density. The increase in biomass under protection was largely driven by an increase in six target species. Eleven species exhibited longterm declines in the marine reserve; three likely a result of indirect effects related to habitat change and/or increased predation, while other declines likely reflect large-scale changes independent of reserve protection. Predicted indirect effects associated with large-scale habitat change were not apparent, except for an increase in one non-target herbivore species alongside increased kelp abundance. While further work is needed to confirm the mechanisms driving individual indirect effects, the results demonstrate that the long-term indirect effects of protection on reef fish are less common, more complex and more difficult to predict than direct effects.

AB  - The polar bear Ursus maritimus is one of the species most endangered by the rapidly declining sea-ice cover in the Arctic, which they use as a platform to hunt fatty, high-energy seals. In recent decades, more polar bears have been forced to remain longer on land, so their access to seals is limited. The importance of terrestrial food to polar bears is disputable, and more data are needed. Terrestrial ungulates could be an attractive substitute prey for them. Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus are prevalent and their distribution is completely within the range of polar bears. They constitute an attractive potential prey offering a significant energy return. Pre-2000 sources state that polar bears do not attack Svalbard reindeer. This report is the first description and documentation of the complete course of a polar bear hunt for adult reindeer in Hornsund, SW Spitsbergen, and also of the bear's hunting behaviour and the reindeer's response. Further, we report several other recent instances of bear-reindeer interactions in Svalbard, suggesting that polar bears now hunt reindeer more frequently than they used to. This increase in hunting is probably linked to the reduced ice cover, with bears spending more time on land, and a growing reindeer population. This study adds to earlier papers on how polar bears in Svalbard have increasingly shifted to a more terrestrial diet, and indicates that they may have an enhanced role as an apex predator in the terrestrial ecosystem.

AB  - Biological invasions are regarded as a major threat to native biodiversity, with cascading ecological and economic consequences within invaded areas. Anticipating and managing these invasions requires a better understanding of the interactions between non-native and native species. We compiled a list of alien plant species and their native insect herbivores from various terrestrial habitats in the Kashmir Himalaya. On alien plants, a total of 15 native insect herbivores were found, four of which were specialists (Aglais caschmirensis on Urtica dioica, Agrotis sp. and Chrysolina herbacea on Mentha longifolia and Nezara viridula on Verbascum thapsus) and the rest were generalists. Altica himensis is the most common native insect herbivore, feeding on nearly 31 alien plants. Various diversity indices show a quantitative estimate of the alien plant and native insect herbivore network. A total of 42 alien plants were recorded throughout the course of 2 years (2018-2020), with Plantago major having the highest relative abundance of 9.7. The study provides a baseline information on the challenging issue of biological invasion by highlighting the role of native insect herbivores as natural biocontrol agents against invasive alien plants.

AB  - Seagrass meadows are an important habitat for Testudines (sea turtles) and Sirenia (dugong and manatee) megaherbivores. Megaherbivores can influence the structuring of seagrass meadows; for example, foraging patterns have been found to relate to seagrass phenological strategy. However, as these observations are derived from uncontrolled field studies, it is unclear whether grazing drives such changes or if the changes are related to other factors (e.g., temperature, tidal depth, light). In the present study, a mesocosm experiment was designed to test the impacts of grazing on metrics of flowering of Zostera muelleri over two consecutive flowering seasons. Prior to each flowering season, plants were cropped to 3 cm and 1 cm lengths to represent turtle and dugong grazing, respectively. This study measured the timing of flowering, the number of flowering shoots, the height of the flowering shoot, and the number of spathes (sheathing bracts containing seeds) per flowering shoot in each replicate (n = 5) weekly. Cropping had no significant influence on the timing of flowering (i.e., number of days to first and peak flowering) indicating that it is not a trigger for flowering. However, cropping significantly reduced the maximum density of flowering shoots and spathes, which was proposed to be due to resource allocation differences between clonal growth and flower production. A reduction in the flowering ratio was observed in both cropped plant groups and the relatively high density and the ratio of flowering observed in the 1 cm group indicate that the plant was adapting to cope with stress. Morphology of flowering (i.e., the maximum height of flowering shoot and the maximum number of spathes per flowering shoot) was not significantly affected by cropping and these two variables were strongly correlated. The results suggest that cropping can influence the overall flowering densities in a season but not the timing of flowering. This study demonstrated that cropping prior to the flowering season can reduce the expected production of spathes in seed nurseries and suggests it may be beneficial to consider megaherbivores in seed-based restoration activities.

AB  - Tree leaves emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in response to mechanical wounding by insect folivores. However, BVOCs are also released from leaves in response to damage to other tree organs. In this study, we hypothesized that if trees utilize BVOCs to defend against leaf herbivory, BVOCs emitted in response to leaf wounding would be different from those emitted in response to other types of mechanical damage. To test this hypothesis, we measured BVOCs emitted from the leaves of four Ficus species in response to leaf-cutting, branch-cutting, leaf-branch-cutting, and control (constitutive BVOCs). We found that leaf-cutting triggered the emission of BVOCs, but their emission patterns were species-specific, and the overall BVOC composition did not significantly differ from that of constitutive BVOCs. In contrast, branch-cutting triggered the emission of many BVOCs, some known as parasitoid attractants and herbivore deterrents. Our study suggests that plant defense mediated by BVOCs is highly species-specific and not effective for attracting herbivore enemies when unrelated disturbances such as tree falls and windstorms occur. Additionally, we recommend avoiding ex situ BVOC sampling of cut plants, as this method alters BVOC emission patterns from both intact and damaged leaves.

AB  - We studied species composition and monthly patterns of roadkill of large and medium sized mammal species along 778 km of Slovenian highways in the period 2018-2020. Apart from providing the first comprehensive data on monthly patterns of roadkill as a proxy of wildlife-vehicle collisions at Slovenian highways and identifying linear collision hotspots (using KDE + methodology), we also tested the impact of acoustic deterrents installed at highway interchanges in late 2018 on WVC frequency. In the three-year period, we registered in total 2046 roadkill cases, with red fox (Vulpes vulpes), (N = 790; 39.6%), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (N = 592; 28.9%), and European badger (Meles meles), (N = 423; 20.7%) being the most exposed species. Temporal collision patterns with evident species-specific monthly peaks reflect the behaviour and activity of these three species. We identified 268 KDE + hotspots, accounting for 48.5% of all roadkill and covering 9.3% (72.6 km) of the highway network. Recognising these hotspots is crucial for implementing mitigation measures to reduce WVC on Slovenian highways. However, our findings indicate no decrease in roadkill after installation of acoustic deterrents (2019-2020), therefore additional effort is needed to find adequate and effective approach for reducing roadkill and hence increasing road safety.

AB  - Overgrazing and injudicious nitrogen applications have increased emissions of greenhouse gases from grassland ecosystems. To explore the effects and potential mechanisms of grazing, nitrogen application, and their interaction with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, field experiments were conducted on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau for three consecutive years. Alpine meadow plots were subjected to light (8 sheep ha-1) and heavy (16 sheep ha-1) stocking rates, with or without ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) (90 kg N ha-1 yr-1) treatment to simulate soil nitrogen deposition. During early warm growth season (May-June), peak growth season (July-September), and early cold season (October-November), static-chamber gas chromatography was used to analyze the soil's greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O, and CH4). Results indicated that light stocking rate (LG) led to an increase in cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions, while also promoting CH4 uptake. Conversely, heavy stocking rate (HG) produced contrasting outcomes. Additionally, nitrogen applications significantly increased the short-term CO2 and N2O fluxes peaks. Combined treatment of nitrogen application and light stocking rate (LG + N) resulted in increased CO2 and N2O emissions while decreased CH4 uptake, consequently leading to a significant increase in global warming potential. According to the structural equation model, we discovered that nitrogen application and grazing affected GHG fluxes both directly and indirectly through their impact on the environmental factors. Our findings suggest that in the context of increasing nitrogen deposition in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a moderate increase in stocking rate is more effective than reducing grazing intensity for mitigating global warming potential in alpine meadow.

AB  - Human tolerance for wildlife is a key consideration for managers and has been measured with attitudes, normative beliefs, and behaviors. The study objectives were to determine, in the context of Alabama hunters' tolerance for non-native, invasive wild pigs, 1) the convergent validity among three cognitive measures of tolerance, and 2) the strength of association between the cognitive measures of tolerance and behavioral measures of tolerance. Results revealed that general attitudes and wildlife acceptance capacity had high convergent validity suggesting that both quantify similar and highly related psychological aspects of tolerance. Conversely, the standard cognitive measures had low predictive associations with most behavioral measures suggesting a lack of interchangeability of behavioral and cognitive measures for purposes of operationalizing tolerance. We highlight how our findings are affected by the complexity of hunter-wild pig interactions and emphasize the importance of assessing tolerance in different contexts to provide greater conceptual clarity.

AB  - Goat lice (Anoplura: Linognathidae) are important ectoparasites in pediculosis. However, their molecular classification and identification remain challenging owing to a lack of molecular data in GenBank. This study aimed to establish a molecular method for identifying Anoplura spp. Goat lice were captured in Yulin, China, and morphologically identified as Linognathus africanus (L. africanus). Sequences from across Anoplura were downloaded from GenBank and conserved motif analysis showed that ribosomal DNA (rDNA) 18S V4, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 12S, and 16S were candidate gene fragments suitable for universal primer design because of abundant sequences and long conserved motifs with few mutations. These three gene fragments of the lice specimens were successfully amplified and sequenced, and their divergences were 0.1-1.7%, 0-0.6%, and 0.3-1.3%, respectively, indicating that the lice specimens belonged to the same species. BLAST analysis showed that the 18S sequences were only aligned with Linognathus, while the 12S and 16S sequences showed 98.8-99.4% and 98.7-99.3% similarities, respectively, with those of L. africanus from Pakistan. Therefore, the lice specimens were molecularly identified as L. africanus without geographical isolation. In conclusion, the goat lice specimens were identified to L. africanus. 12S and 16S are potential DNA barcodes of Anoplura spp. (c) 2024 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA).

AB  - Florida Key deer mortality data (1966-2017) showed that about 75% of all reported deer mortalities were related to collisions with vehicles. In 2001-2002, the eastern section of US Hwy 1 on Big Pine Key (Florida, USA) was mitigated with a wildlife fence, 2 underpasses, and 4 deer guards. After mitigation, the number of reported Key deer road mortalities reduced substantially in the mitigated section, but this was negated by an increase in collisions along the unmitigated section of US Hwy 1 on Big Pine Key, both in absolute numbers and expressed as a percentage of the total deer population size. The data also showed that the increase in Key deer collisions along the unmitigated highway section on the island could not be explained through an increase in Key deer population size, or by a potential increase in traffic volume. The overall Key deer road mortality along US Hwy 1 was not reduced but was moved from the mitigated section to the nearby unmitigated section. Thus, there was no net benefit of the fence in reducing collisions. After mitigation, a significant hotspot of Key deer-vehicle collisions appeared at the western fence-end, and additional hotspots occurred further west along the unmitigated highway. Exploratory spatial analyses led us to reject the unmitigated highway section on Big Pine Key as a suitable control for a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) analysis into the effectiveness of the mitigation measures in reducing deer-vehicle collisions. Instead, we selected highway sections west and east of Big Pine Key as a control. The BACI analysis showed that the wildlife fence and associated mitigation measures were highly effective (95%) in reducing deer-vehicle collisions along the mitigated highway section. Nonetheless, in order to reduce the overall number of deer-vehicle collisions along US Hwy 1, the entire highway section on Big Pine Key would need to be mitigated. However, further mitigation is complicated because of the many buildings and access roads for businesses and residences. This case study illustrates that while fences and associated measures can be very effective in reducing collisions, wildlife fences that are too short may result in an increase in collisions in nearby unmitigated road sections, especially near fence-ends. Therefore it is important to carefully consider the appropriate spatial scale over which highway mitigation measures are implemented and evaluated.

AB  - Testosterone is known to be essential for sexual maturation as well as for the display of behavioural traits linked to reproduction. At the same time, external factors such as the presence of receptive females may affect testosterone levels, stressing the hormone's substantial role in reproductive success. It is therefore of major interest to investigate the links between androgens, behaviour and the social environment especially in species that rely on a resilient reproduction rate, such as the white rhinoceros (WR). We collected faecal samples of 16 male Southern WR (Ceratotherium simum simum) aged between 1 and 44 years from 11 European zoos. Audio and video recordings were simultaneously taken from five of the study males that were sexually mature and had direct contact with receptive females. Our results showed a positive correlation of faecal testosterone metabolite (fTM) concentrations and progressing age up until adulthood followed by a decline in older males. While previous reproductive success did not show any effect, the access to receptive females resulted in higher fTM levels. Thereby, fTM concentrations remained at the same level regardless of the receptivity phase, while social cohesion with respective females, affiliative behaviour as well as call rates of Pant and Hiss distinctly peaked during the receptive compared to the non-receptive periods. Conclusively, the immediate presence of receptive females poses a female effect that enhances the overall androgen levels in males and, thus, might facilitate their reproductive success. However, androgens do not seem to be the main driver of behavioural changes during courtship or mating. By linking endocrinological and socio-behavioural factors, we were able to provide an applicable basis for non-invasive monitoring of reproductive behaviour in male WR in captivity, thereby contributing to deeper understanding of potential reproduction impairments in a species whose population in captivity remains not fully self-sustaining.

AB  - This review focuses on biological control interactions in arid areas and is motivated by the need to devise sustainable agricultural practices for a warming and drying world. Parasitoids, important natural enemies of crop pests, are diverse and abundant in natural arid habitats. Dryland croplands, which are usually irrigated, are also rich in local parasitoids. Nevertheless, biological control projects in arid croplands mostly involve imported parasitoids (classical biological control) rather than the conservation of native relative humidity, sparse vegetation, and low host densities. Heat resistance combines local genetic adaptations, behavioral and physiological flexibility, and microbial symbioses, but how parasitoids cope with other aridity-related challenges is insufficiently understood. How dryland conditions impact host-parasitoid population dynamics also requires further study.

AB  - Thoroughly understanding tropical forest secondary succession requires insights into the processes occurring in the forest understory, the vegetation component where the regenerating community develops. Although sapling growth is essential to this process, information on how it changes along succession is scarce. Here, we examine relative growth rates (RGR) of woody species saplings along a broad successional gradient in a tropical dry forest based on height and basal area data gathered over 15 years of vegetation monitoring in permanent plots differing in successional age (1-73 years) plus a mature forest plot. We used mixed-effects models to examine the link between individual size, fallow age, and plant traits, and from this link model their relationship with sapling RGR. Despite sizable RGR variability, growth was generally slow over the successional gradient, except in the first 10 years of succession, when growth rates were highest for most groups. Species' successional guild and their identity as members of the Leguminosae family were the main factors responsible for growth in basal area, while for growth in height, the main factors involved were successional guild and growth form. A generalized decrease in sapling growth rates in the understory suggests that this process is increasingly limited by light rather than by water towards later successional stages. Enhanced knowledge of the dynamics of the regenerating community in tropical dry forests is fundamental for gaining a comprehensive view of their recovery.
   El conocimiento de los procesos que ocurren en el sotobosque, el componente de la vegetaci & oacute;n que representa la comunidad en regeneraci & oacute;n, permite comprender a fondo la sucesi & oacute;n secundaria de los bosques tropicales. El crecimiento es un componente esencial de este proceso pero se sabe poco sobre los cambios que experimenta a lo largo de la sucesi & oacute;n. En este trabajo analizamos las tasas relativas de crecimiento (TRC) de brinzales de especies le & ntilde;osas en un gradiente sucesional amplio en un bosque tropical caducifolio. Datos de di & aacute;metro basal y altura obtenidos durante 15 a & ntilde;os de monitoreo en parcelas permanentes con diferentes edades sucesionales (1-73 a & ntilde;os) y una parcela de bosque maduro permitieron aproximar los valores de TRC. Utilizamos modelos de efectos mixtos para determinar los nexos entre el tama & ntilde;o individual, la edad de la parcela y los rasgos funcionales, y a partir de ellos modelamos su relaci & oacute;n con las tasas de crecimiento de los brinzales. A pesar de la alta variabilidad en las TRC, en general el crecimiento fue muy lento a lo largo del gradiente sucesional, excepto en los primeros 10 a & ntilde;os de la sucesi & oacute;n, cuando hubo tasas m & aacute;s altas para la mayor & iacute;a de los grupos. El gremio sucesional y la adscripci & oacute;n a Leguminosae fueron los principales factores involucrados en el patr & oacute;n de crecimiento en & aacute;rea basal, mientras que el gremio sucesional y la forma de crecimiento fueron los principales factores que afectan el crecimiento en altura. Una disminuci & oacute;n generalizada de las TRC de los brinzales en el sotobosque sugiere que este proceso se ve progresivamente limitado por la luz, y no por el agua, hacia las etapas sucesionales avanzadas. Un conocimiento m & aacute;s amplio sobre la din & aacute;mica de la comunidad en regeneraci & oacute;n de los bosques tropicales secos es fundamental para obtener una visi & oacute;n integral de su recuperaci & oacute;n.

AB  - Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations in the western United States have undergone widespread declines and extirpations since the late nineteenth century as a consequence of introduced diseases, competition with livestock, and unregulated hunting. Washington, Idaho, USA, and British Columbia, Canada were historically thought to be occupied by 2 bighorn lineages or subspecies: Rocky Mountain (O. c. canadensis) and California (O. c. californiana). The putative California lineage was completely extirpated in the United States, and reintroductions to reestablish populations were sourced directly or indirectly from a single region in southern British Columbia. Restoration efforts have attempted to maintain the diversity and divergence of these 2 lineages, sometimes referred to as subspecies although taxonomic classifications have changed over time. In this study we describe genetic variation in a subset of native and reintroduced herds of California and Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep. We examined genetic diversity and divergence between bighorn sheep herds using 15 microsatellite loci, including 4 loci linked to genes involved in immune function. We analyzed 504 samples from reintroduced herds in Washington (n = 10 California herds, n = 4 Rocky Mountain herds) and Idaho (n = 5 California), and source herds in Oregon (n = 1 Rocky Mountain) and British Columbia (n = 5 California, 1 Rocky Mountain). Genetic structure reflected known reintroduction history, and geographic proximity also was associated with decreased genetic divergence. Herds in Washington and Idaho sourced from California bighorn sheep were less genetically diverse than those sourced from Rocky Mountain herds. Also, levels of relatedness within and across California herds were higher than in Rocky Mountain herds and similar to what would be expected for full and half siblings. Lower diversity and higher relatedness among California herds is a concern for long-term fitness and likely related to past population bottlenecks, fewer source populations, and management history, such as entirely sourcing California herds from British Columbia. Genetic divergence of neutral loci between California and Rocky Mountain herds was greater than that of adaptive loci, potentially indicating that balancing selection has maintained similar genetic diversity across lineages in loci associated with immune and other adaptive functions. Thus, we recommend future reintroductions and augmentations should continue to use source populations from the appropriate California or Rocky Mountain lineage to avoid potential outbreeding depression and maintain possible adaptive differences. This could be accomplished by obtaining sheep from >= 1 source within the genetic lineage, while avoiding sourcing from admixed herds. Future work encompassing a broader geographic sampling of populations and a greater portion of the genome is necessary to better evaluate the degree to which contemporary divergence between lineages is associated with recent founder effects and genetic isolation or evolutionary adaptation.

AB  - This study is a comparative analysis of the biochemical, hormonal, and mineral compositions of follicular fluid in preovulatory and cystic follicles of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). In total, reproductive tracts from 215 buffalo along with intact ovaries were collected randomly from an abattoir. The incidence of cystic conditions found in this study was 3.72% (8/215), involving the right ovary in 62.5% of instances and the left ovary in 37.5% of instances during the non-breeding season. Follicular fluid was aspirated from preovulatory follicles (12-15 mm diameter, oestrogen-active, follicular phase or stage IV corpus luteum on one of the two ovaries, n = 10) and cystic follicles (at least 20 mm diameter, no corpus luteum on any one of the two ovaries, n = 8). The follicular fluid samples were assayed for biochemical components (uric acid, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol, total protein, glucose, ascorbic acid, and alkaline phosphatase), hormones (progesterone, estradiol, and insulin), and minerals (calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, zinc, and cobalt). Cystic follicles had greater (P < 0.05) concentrations of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterol, progesterone, copper, zinc, and cobalt, and lesser (P < 0.05) concentrations of uric acid, glucose, ascorbic acid, estradiol, insulin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus compared with preovulatory follicles. These results indicated the marked differences in follicular fluid composition between preovulatory and cystic follicles in buffalo. Some of the changes were indicative of oxidative stress and disturbed steroidogenesis, two important mechanisms shown to be associated with cystic ovarian disease in various species. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether these differences are directly or indirectly involved in the formation of cystic follicles or are mere manifestations of the condition.

AB  - Despite extensive research in the last two decades, exploring the potential mechanisms underlying the sensitivity and resistance of marine organisms to ocean acidification is still imperative. Species interactions can play a role in these mechanisms, but the extent to which they modulate organismal responses to ocean acidification remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated how ocean acidification (pH 7.7) affects energy homeostasis and fitness of mussels (Mytilus coruscus) by assessing their physiological responses, intestinal microbiome and nutritional quality of their food (microalgae). Under ocean acidification, the mussels had reduced feeding rates by 34 % and reduced activities of digestive enzymes (pepsin by 39 %, trypsin by 28 % and lipase by 53 %) due to direct exposure to acidified seawater and increased phenol content of microalgae. Richness and diversity of intestinal microbiome (OTU, Chao1 index and Shannon index) were also lowered by ocean acidification, which can undermine nutrient absorption. On the other hand, energy expenditure of mussels increased by 53 % under ocean acidification, which was associated with the upregulation of antioxidant defence (SOD, CAT and GPx activities). Consequently, energy reserves in mussels decreased by 28 %, which were underpinned by the reduction in protein, carbohydrate and lipid contents. Overall, we demonstrate that ocean acidification could disrupt herbivore-algae and host-microbe interactions, thereby lowering the energy balance and impairing the health of marine organisms. This can have ramifications on the population and energy dynamics of marine communities in the acidifying ocean.

AB  - Rhizosphere microbes play pivotal roles in regulating the soil ecosystem by influencing and directly participating in the nutrient cycle. Evidence shows that the rhizosphere microbes are highly dependent on plant genotype and cultivars; however, their characteristics in soils with different tea (Camellia sinensis L.) cultivars are poorly understood. Therefore, the present study investigated the rhizosphere soil properties, microbial community composition, and their potential functions under four tea cultivars Huangjinya (HJY), Tieguanyin (TGY), Zhongcha No.108 (ZC108), and Zijuan (ZJ). The study found a minor impact of cultivars on rhizosphere soil properties but a significant influence on microbial community structure. Except for available potassium (AK) (HJY > TGY > ZC108 > ZJ), tea cultivars had no significant impact on other soil properties. The tea cultivars resulted in substantial differences only in the diversity of soil bacteria of lower taxonomic levels (family to species), as well as significantly changed communities' structure of bacteria and fungi (R-2 = 0.184, p = 0.013 and R-2 = 0.226, p = 0.001). Specifically, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteriota, and Firmicutes accounted for approximately 96% of the bacterial phyla in the tea soils, while Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, Rozellomycota, Basidiomycota, and Monoblepharomycota (90% of the total) predominated the soil fungal community. Redundancy analysis (RDA) identified soil pH (14.53%) and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N; 16.74%) as the key factors for the changes in bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. Finally, FAPROTAX analysis predicted significant differences in the carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (C-N-S)-cycling among the soils with different tea cultivars, specifically, ZJ cultivar showed the highest C-cycling but the lowest N- and S-cycling, while FUNGuild analysis revealed that the pathotroph group was significantly lower in ZC108 than the other cultivars. These findings improve our understanding of the differences in microbial community characteristics among tea cultivars and provide a basis for precisely selecting and introducing excellent tea varieties in the agriculture practices.

AB  - Feces in livestock farms is a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), which can disseminate into sur-rounding soil and air, bringing risks to human health. In this study, seasonal dissemination of ARGs in a livestock farm and implications for human exposure was explored. The experimental results showed that ARGs abundance basically ranked as feces > soil > air, and significant seasonal dependence was observed. The total ARGs in pig feces was relatively higher in autumn (109.7 copies g-1) and winter (1010.0 copies g-1), and lower in summer (105.0 copies g-1). Similarly, the lowest total ARGs in soil and air were also observed in summer. There were correlations among ARGs, integron intI1, and bacterial community. Total organic carbon was an important factor affecting ARGs distribution in the feces, and pH and moisture content significantly affected soil ARGs. The daily intakes of integron intI1 and ARGs from air were 10 degrees.5 copies h-1 and 102.3 copies h-1 for human exposure, respectively. Pseudomonas was a potential pathogenic host of blaTEM-1 in feces, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were potential pathogenic hosts of multiple ARGs in soil, while ARGs in air did not migrate into pathogens.

AB  - The expansion of urban areas and anthropogenic activities have intensified human-wildlife interactions, increasing zoonotic disease emergence and transmission. Understanding factors influencing urban wildlife movement and their interactions with humans is critical for addressing disease transmission. We examine factors driving zoonotic risks in urban ecosystems, emphasizing the human-wildlife interactions, and suggest their integration into a One Health framework. Urban environments facilitate contact with wildlife reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens such as rabies, Lyme disease, and SARS-CoV-2. Factors such as green spaces, altered wildlife behavior, and human mobility amplify disease spillover risks. We emphasize applying movement ecology concepts, particularly for understanding how animals and humans navigate and use urban spaces to identify hotspots interaction and inform management strategies. Despite advancements, challenges such as data standardization and limited interdisciplinary collaboration persist. We advocate for an integrative approach combining animal movement ecology, human mobility, and public health to foster coexistence and safeguard human health.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is induced by a protein found in cervid brains called prions that cause folding of other neural proteins. These prions are transmitted among individual cervids via direct (individual to individual), indirect (e.g., individual to environment), and self (e.g., licking an infected area) contacts. Supplemental feeding tends to concentrate deer (Odocoileus spp.), with implications for inter-individual prion transmission. Prion transmission depends on deer behaviors, yet information on behaviors at various forage settings is lacking. We quantified behaviors thought to play a role in prion transmission exhibited by white-tailed deer (O. virginianus) at baited sites, food plots, and areas used for foraging in the surrounding landscape (hereafter landscape forage areas [LFAs]) using camera trapping and road-based transect surveys during the post-breeding period (January through April 2021-2023). We conducted 4,172 deer observations across all forage settings (15% from LFA transects, 69% from bait sites, 16% from food plots), and found fewer direct contacts (i.e., deer to deer) at food plots and LFAs compared to bait sites. We found a lower number of self-contacts (e.g., deer licking a body part) at food plots compared to bait sites and observed fewer environmental contacts (e.g., deer potentially ingesting soil) at food plots and LFAs compared to bait sites. At bait sites, we found that yearling males had a greater tendency to directly contact male and female adults, with this tendency greatest when >2 adults were visible. We also measured deer fecal deposition at forage settings, as prions in feces are potentially available for uptake by uninfected individuals. The probability of finding a deer fecal pellet at food plots and LFAs was lower than at bait sites, but amount of fecal material did not vary among forage settings. Ordinal day negatively affected the probability of finding a deer pellet across all forage settings. Our findings indicate that the probability of direct and environmental contacts at bait sites exceeds contacts at food plots and LFAs. Additionally, higher probability of fecal deposition coupled with more environmental contacts at bait sites increases potential transmission of prions. In areas of concern for CWD, food plots and LFAs appear to offer less risky food sources for deer during the post-breeding period compared to bait sites.

AB  - Fossilized plant-insect herbivore associations provide fundamental information about the assembly of terrestrial communities through geologic time. However, fossil evidence of associations originating in deep time and persisting to the modern day is scarce.<br /> We studied the insect herbivore damage found on 284 Eucalyptus frenguelliana leaves from the early Eocene Laguna del Hunco rainforest locality in Argentinean Patagonia and compared damage patterns with those observed on extant, rainforest-associated Eucalyptus species from Australasia (> 10 000 herbarium sheets reviewed).<br /> In the fossil material, we identified 28 insect herbivory damage types, including 12 types of external feeding, one of piercing-and-sucking, five of galls, and 10 of mines. All 28 damage types were observed in the herbarium specimens.<br /> The finding of all the fossil damage types on extant Eucalyptus specimens suggests long-standing associations between multiple insect herbivore lineages and their host genus spanning 52 million years across the Southern Hemisphere. This long-term persistence, probably enabled through niche conservatism in wet eucalypt forests, demonstrates the imprint of fossil history on the composition of extant insect herbivore assemblages. Although the identities of most insect culprits remain unknown, we provide a list of Eucalyptus species and specific population locations to facilitate their discovery, highlighting the relevance of fossils in discovering extant biodiversity.

AB  - Cumulative costs of reproduction are predicted by life-history theories of aging, but empirical support for cumulative costs of reproduction in ungulates is limited. Examinations of the relationship between previous reproductive effort and future reproductive output are often limited to successive years. We analyzed pregnancy status, lactation duration, and age class of Elk (Cervus canadensis) in Utah, United States, from 2019 to 2022 to better understand the relationship between previous reproductive effort and future reproductive output, particularly in nonsuccessive years. Pregnancy status 1 year prior, pregnancy status 2 years prior, and age had no effect on the likelihood of pregnancy in Elk. However, lactation duration 1 year prior and lactation duration 2 years prior had a negative effect on the likelihood of pregnancy. The best-fitting model to explain the relationship between pregnancy status and previous lactation was the positive interaction between lactation duration 1 year prior and lactation duration 2 years prior. The results of our study suggest long-lasting (i.e., multiple-year), cumulative costs of reproduction can influence reproductive output in female Elk, but differences in individual quality may have an even greater influence. High-quality individuals may be able to override the costs of reproduction and minimize reproductive trade-offs.
   We analyzed reproductive patterns of female Elk to better understand the relationship between previous reproductive effort and future reproductive output. Long-lasting costs of reproduction were associated with lactation, but costs were limited for highly productive individuals.

AB  - The male pregnancy of seahorses is unique, but their reproductive response to environmental disturbances has not yet been clarified. Tributyltin (TBT) is known to have an endocrine disrupting effect on the reproductive system of coastal marine organisms. This study evaluated the potential effects of exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TBT on the development of gonads and brood pouch of the lined seahorse (Hippo campus erectus). Physiological, histological, and transcriptional analyses were conducted, and results showed that high levels of TBT bioaccumulation occurred in male and female seahorses. TBT led to ovarian follicular atresia and apoptosis with the elevation of androgen levels, accompanied by the induction of genes associated with lysosomes and autophagosomes. Comparative transcriptional analyses revealed the likely inhibition of spermatogenesis via the suppression of cyclic AMP and androgen synthesis. Notably, the transcriptional profiles showed that TBT potentially affects the immune system, angiogenesis, and embryo nourishment of the brood pouch, which indicates that it has negative effects on the male reproductive system of seahorses. In summary, this study reveals that environmental levels of TBT potentially affect the reproductive efficiency of seahorses, and may ultimately lead to a reduction in their populations in coastal environments.

AB  - Cryptic species diversity is a major challenge regarding the species-rich community of parasitoids attacking oak gall wasps due to a high degree of sexual dimorphism, morphological plasticity, small size and poorly known biology. As such, we know very little about the number of species present, nor the evolutionary forces responsible for generating this diversity. One hypothesis is that trait diversity in the gall wasps, including the morphology of the galls they induce, has evolved in response to selection imposed by the parasitoid community, with reciprocal selection driving diversification of the parasitoids. Using a rare, continental-scale data set of Sycophila parasitoid wasps reared from 44 species of cynipid galls from 18 species of oak across the USA, we combined mitochondrial DNA barcodes, ultraconserved elements (UCEs), morphological and natural history data to delimit putative species. Using these results, we generate the first large-scale assessment of ecological specialization and host association in this species-rich group, with implications for evolutionary ecology and biocontrol. We find most Sycophila target specific subsets of available cynipid host galls with similar morphologies, and generally attack larger galls. Our results suggest that parasitoid wasps such as Sycophila have adaptations allowing them to exploit particular host trait combinations, while hosts with contrasting traits are resistant to attack. These findings support the tritrophic niche concept for the structuring of plant-herbivore-parasitoid communities.

AB  - Seed dispersal influences the survival and distribution of plant species and is an important mechanism for maintaining floristic diversity. Bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are large mammals of indigenous forests and well -wooded areas of eastern and southern Africa and may play an important role as seed dispersers. However, the diversity of fruits consumed and the effect of digestion on seeds remains poorly understood. This study was conducted from October 2018 to January 2019 and gives first insights into seed dispersal by bushpigs in the Soutpansberg Mountain range, South Africa. Here, we collected bushpig faeces and assessed the number of seeds and seed species found. Furthermore, germination experiments with digested and nondigested seeds and fruits were conducted. Our results show that bushpigs are omnivorous, consuming fruits and seeds of 126 different plant species. The proportion of seeds per plant species found in faeces was unhomogeneously distributed with a few hyperabundant species, in particular Searsia chirindensis (55%). The germination experiments showed that gut passage did, overall, not influence germination or seedling growth rates. However, seeds remaining within fruits showed reduced growth, pointing to a high importance of fruit consumption for seed fate. Our results suggest that bushpigs are major seed dispersers of a large variety of fruiting plant species in wooded areas of Africa.

AB  - Natural areas in cities are important refugia for wildlife, but some species also use developed areas. Such adaptation may be facilitated at the ecotone between natural and residential areas where wildlife encounter anthropogenic resources. We quantified human activities and objects that potentially attract coyotes (Canis latrans) by providing shelter, food, prey habitat, and novelty items where backyards back onto natural areas in Edmonton, Canada. We related attractant abundance and human demographic variables to coyote access to backyards, scat abundance, and the number and nature of reports detailing interactions with coyotes near the ecotone. Among 468 surveyed backyards, 31% were accessed by coyotes, and we detected 2055 instances of attractants. Coyotes selectively accessed unfenced backyards with food and novelty items, and backyard access was most common along transects where fences were infrequent, and shelter was abundant. Evidence of deer on transects was weakly correlated with increased prevalence of scats. Public reports describing conflict with coyotes were more frequent in areas with more coyote access to backyards, fewer fences, and more shelter. Weak evidence indicated that food abundance, scat prevalence, and backyard access were higher in areas with larger houses and more university-educated and retired residents. These results suggest that coyotes frequently access attractants at the ecotone between natural and residential areas, which may promote habituation, food conditioning, and human-wildlife conflict. These effects could be reduced, and coexistence could be promoted with clearer boundaries separating natural and residential areas, opposing conventional recommendations for reserve design that encourage gradual transition zones.

AB  - We aim to extend our understanding of the seasonal formation of cellular cementum, and its functional relationships in fallow deer (Dama dama) from Mediterranean ecosystems, in order to achieve reliable cementochronology applications. We provide a specific reference for fallow deer in a specific ecosystem, as needed for forensic, paleontological and wildlife ecology research. A semi-quantitative rating of the last outermost increment deposited in the cellular cementum interradicular pad of the lower first molar (M1), together with the knowledge of the animal's date of death, provided the methodological basis of this study. We also analyzed the occurrence of each cementum state by season, as well as the influence of the photoperiod and seasonal diet quality variations, using indices such as cell wall digestibility (CWD), protein (N), and carbohydrate (C). In adults more than 4 years old we detected a significant seasonal cementum growth pattern in spring-summer, whereas the formation of rest lines took place mainly from October to February. All of our findings show a photoperiod control of cementum seasonal growth patterns, linked to the organism's annual growth cycle, whereas N and C probably do not influence seasonal deposition patterns. The deposition of the cementum begins to stop when the photoperiod begins to decrease, i.e. when the days begin to be shorter, which in the Mediterranean ecosystems of southern Spain takes place in the autumn and winter months. At this time, the amount of dry matter in food consumed increases, and voluntary food intake decreases. The amount of dietary protein and carbohydrate seems to influence the amount of cementum deposited each year, rather than the seasonal deposition pattern, at least in adults. No significant seasonal pattern was found for the younger fallow deer. Until this seasonal pattern is clarified, young specimens should be excluded from cementochronology applications, such as season-at-death estimations. Studies on the quantitative thickness of cementum increments should also be performed in order to confirm cementochronology as a useful tool for studying climatic variations and their biological impacts.

AB  - There is an important gap in how variations in herbivore dung composition affect GHG emissions on pastures, especially due to differences in dry matter (DM) and nitrogen contents. Oversimplifications can compromise the accuracy of mitigation strategies. This study aims to address this gap by investigating how the chemical composition of dung from different species influences GHG emissions in pasture systems. The results showed that drier dung led to higher cumulative N2O emissions. The highest emissions were observed from goat at 9.47 mg NN2O g-1 dry soil, followed by sheep at 5.95 mg N-N2O g-1 dry soil, beef cattle at 5.44 mg N2O g-1 dry soil, dairy cattle at 2.67 mg N2O g-1 dry soil, and horse at 0.83 mg N2O g-1 dry soil. It was observed that higher dung moisture content generally corresponded to increased CH4 emissions, except for horse dung. The highest cumulative CH4 emission was for dairy cattle dung (8.29 mg C-CH4 g-1 dry soil), followed by beef cattle (3.89 mg CCH4 g-1 dry soil), sheep (2.32 mg C-CH4 g-1 dry soil), goats (1.89 mg C-CH4 g-1 dry soil), and horses (1.66 mg CCH4 g-1 dry soil). Principal Component Analysis illustrated that PC1, named as diet quality, explained 61.9% of the variance, was positively correlated with N2O and negatively correlated with fiber content and C/N ratio, while PC2, named as acetrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, explained 19.6% of the variance, linking VS to reduced CH4 emissions. This study establishes relationships between manure chemical composition and GHG emissions, filling a fundamental knowledge gap and supporting the development of cause-and-effect models.

AB  - Objectives: Con Co Ngua is a complex, sedentary forager site from northern Vietnam dating to the early seventh millennium BP. Prior research identified a calcified Echinococcus granulosis cyst, which causes hydatid disease. Osteolytic lesions consistent with hydatid disease were also present in this individual and others. Hydatid disease is observed in high frequencies in pastoralists, and its presence in a hunter-gatherer community raises questions regarding human-animal interaction prior to farming. The objective of this article is to identify and describe the epidemiology of hydatid disease in the human skeletal assemblage at Con Co Ngua.
   Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty-five individuals were macroscopically assessed for lesions. Of these, eight individuals were radiographed. Hydatid disease was diagnosed using a new threshold criteria protocol derived from clinical literature, which prioritizes lesions specific to the parasite.
   Results: Twenty-two individuals (14.2%) presented with osteolytic lesions consistent with hydatid disease, affecting the distal humerus, proximal femur and forearm, and pelvis. Seven individuals radiographed (4.5%) had multilocular cystic lesions strongly diagnostic for hydatid disease. All probable cases had lesions of the distal humerus. The remaining lesions were macroscopically identical to those radiographed and were considered possible cases.
   Discussion: While hydatid disease has previously been found in pre-agricultural communities, the high prevalence at Con Co Ngua is non-incidental. We propose that the presence of wild canids and management of wild buffalo and deer increased the risk of disease transmission. These findings further reveal subsistence complexity among hunter-gatherers living millennia prior to the adoption of farming in Southeast Asia.

AB  - Large parts of the Earth are experiencing environmental change caused by alien plant invasions, rising atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2 ), and nutrient enrichments. Elevated CO2 and nutrient concentrations can separately favour growth of invasive plants over that of natives but how herbivory may modulate the magnitude and direction of net responses by the two groups of plants to simultaneous CO2 and nutrient enrichments remains unknown. In line with the enemy release hypothesis, invasive plant species should reallocate metabolites from costly anti-herbivore defences into greater growth following escape from intense herbivory in the native range. Therefore, invasive plants should have greater growth than native plants under simultaneous CO2 and nutrient enrichments in the absence of herbivory. To test this prediction, we grew nine congeneric pairs of invasive and native plant species that naturally co-occurred in grasslands in China under two levels each of nutrient enrichment (low-nutrient vs. high-nutrient), herbivory (with herbivory vs. without herbivory) and under ambient (412.9 +/- 0.6 ppm) and elevated (790.1 +/- 6.2 ppm) levels of CO2 concentrations in open top chambers in a common garden. Elevated CO2 and nutrient enrichment separately increased total plant biomass, while herbivory reduced it regardless of the plant invasive status. High-nutrient treatment caused the plants to allocate a significantly lower proportion of total biomass to roots, while herbivory induced an opposite pattern. Herbivory suppressed total biomass production more strongly in native plants than invasive plants. The plants exhibited significant interspecific and intergeneric variation in their responses to the various treatment combinations. Overall, these results suggest that elevated CO2 and nutrients and herbivory may separately, rather than synergistically, impact productivity of the invasive and co-occurring native plant species in our study system. Moreover, interspecific variation in resource-use strategies was more important than invasive status in determining plant responses to the various treatment combinations.

AB  - Urban deer management (UDM) decision-makers face social, ecological, regulatory, and economic pressures when creating an agreeable deer management plan for stakeholders. Historically, decision making techniques (e.g. consensus-based analyses) have not effectively balanced UDM elements leading to short-lived management progress. Structured decision making (SDM) is a formal, values-based approach to identifying an optimal management solution. Although SDM has been applied to other wildlife management decisions, it has not been applied in UDM. We provide the first case-study of SDM-based UDM and streamline the process for wildlife managers. We focused on one suburban and one semi-rural community near Atlanta, Georgia, USA. We established a problem statement to capture what decision-makers must address in UDM programs and reviewed the primary literature and UDM plans from five states to establish four fundamental objectives. We then utilized a support-effectiveness analysis to identify acceptable UDM alternatives and gathered expert insights to calculate the consequences of alternatives on objectives. Finally, we asked each community's decision-makers to weigh objectives against each other. Using this framework, education was the most optimal UDM technique to implement in the suburban community, and sharpshooting was the most optimal UDM technique to implement in the semi-rural community. This paper positions SDM as a transparent, defensible, inclusive, and adaptive approach to UDM. Furthermore, our SDM framework provides managers with the means and justification to create an optimal plan of action for communities in need of UDM.

AB  - Understanding the dynamics of ungulates is crucial for proper wildlife management and conservation efforts. Where high densities of ungulates are present and exceed the carrying capacity, damage occurs in both the forestry and agriculture sectors, moreover human safety is endangered through road accidents. This study explores the evolution of deer populations in the Baltics, Central, and Eastern Europe through the analysis of hunting bag data, which represents the total number of specimens harvested annually. By utilizing hunting bag statistics reported by wildlife managers and hunters, this research aims to provide a more reliable indicator for population trends compared to traditional wildlife monitoring techniques, which may suffer from issues such as double counting, underreporting, or different estimation methods. The study focuses on the evolution of hunting bag numbers for red deer (Cervus elaphus L.), roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.), and fallow deer (Dama dama L.) between 2012 to 2022. The primary metrics used in the description of growth and statistical analyses were the hunting bags and population parameters such as the sex ratio. The findings of this study indicate that hunting bag data have shown an increasing trend during the study period. The sex ratio of the harvested specimens seems to play a role in annual growth only in the case of roe deer. Based on different harvesting rates, the population estimates for the year 2022 were projected. This research confirms similar trends in population growth for the studied species and also indicates an increase in damage caused by high densities of ungulates. The study underscores the significance of integrated approaches in assessing ungulates populations and their ecological roles, contributing to future wildlife management practices.

AB  - Dental microwear texture (DMT) analysis is used to differentiate abrasive dental wear patterns in many species fed different diets. Because DMT parameters all describe the same surface, they are expected to correlate with each other distinctively. Here, we explore the data range of, and correlations between, DMT parameters to increase the understanding of how this group of proxies records wear within and across species. The analysis was based on subsets of previously published DMT analyses in guinea pigs, sheep, and rabbits fed either a natural whole plant diet (lucerne, grass, bamboo) or pelleted diets with or without added quartz abrasives (guinea pigs and rabbits: up to 45 days, sheep: 17 months). The normalized DMT parameter range (P4: 0.69 +/- 0.25; M2: 0.83 +/- 0.16) and correlation coefficients (P4: 0.50 +/- 0.31; M2: 0.63 +/- 0.31) increased along the tooth row in guinea pigs, suggesting that strong correlations may be partially explained by data range. A comparison between sheep and guinea pigs revealed a higher DMT data range in sheep (0.93 +/- 0.16; guinea pigs: 0.47 +/- 0.29), but this did not translate into more substantial correlation coefficients (sheep: 0.35 +/- 0.28; guinea pigs: 0.55 +/- 0.32). Adding rabbits to an interspecies comparison of low abrasive dental wear (pelleted lucerne diet), the softer enamel of the hypselodont species showed a smaller data range for DMT parameters (guinea pigs 0.49 +/- 0.32, rabbit 0.19 +/- 0.18, sheep 0.78 +/- 0.22) but again slightly higher correlations coefficients compared to the hypsodont teeth (guinea pigs 0.55 +/- 0.31, rabbits 0.56 +/- 0.30, sheep 0.42 +/- 0.27). The findings suggest that the softer enamel of fast-replaced ever-growing hypselodont cheek teeth shows a greater inherent wear trace consistency, whereas the harder enamel of permanent and non-replaced enamel of hypsodont ruminant teeth records less coherent wear patterns. Because consistent diets were used across taxa, this effect cannot be ascribed to the random overwriting of individual wear traces on the more durable hypsodont teeth. This matches literature reports on reduced DMT pattern consistency on harder materials; possibly, individual wear events become more random in nature on harder material. Given the species-specific differences in enamel characteristics, the findings suggest a certain species-specificity of DMT patterns.

AB  - There are obvious differences in quality between different varieties of the same plant, and it is not clear whether they can be effectively distinguished from each other from a bacterial point of view. In this study, 44 tea tree varieties (Camellia sinensis) were used to analyze the rhizosphere soil bacterial community using high-throughput sequencing technology, and five types of machine deep learning were used for modeling to obtain characteristic microorganisms that can effectively differentiate different varieties, and validation was performed. The relationship between characteristic microorganisms, soil nutrient transformation, and tea quality formation was further analyzed. It was found that 44 tea tree varieties were classified into two groups (group A and group B) and the characteristic bacteria that distinguished them came from 23 genera. Secondly, the content of rhizosphere soil available nutrients (available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium) and tea quality indexes (tea polyphenols, theanine, and caffeine) was significantly higher in group A than in group B. The classification result based on both was consistent with the above bacteria. This study provides a new insight and research methodology into the main reasons for the formation of quality differences among different varieties of the same plant.

AB  - Taxifolin is a plant flavonoid effective as an antioxidant. This study aimed to assess the effect of adding taxifolin to the semen extender during the cooling period before freezing on the overall post-thawing sperm variables of Bermeya goats. In the first experiment, a dose-response experiment was performed with four experimental groups: Control, 10, 50, and 100 mu g/ml of taxifolin using semen from 8 Bermeya males. In the second experiment, semen from 7 Bermeya bucks was collected and extended at 20 degrees C using a Tris-citric acid-glucose medium supplemented with different concentrations of taxifolin and glutathione (GSH): control, 5 mu M taxifolin, 1 mM GSH, and both antioxidants. In both experiments, two straws per buck were thawed in a water bath (37 degrees C, 30 s), pooled, and incubated at 38 degrees C. Motility (CASA) was assessed at 0, 2, and 5 h, and sperm physiology was assessed at 0 and 5 h by flow cytometry (viability, intact acrosome membrane, mitochondria membrane potential, capacitation, intracellular reactive oxygen species-ROS-, mitochondrial superoxide, and chromatin status). In experiment 2, an artificial insemination trial (AI) was included with 29 goats for testing the taxifolin 5-mu M treatment on fertility. Data were analyzed with the R statistical environment using linear mixed-effects models. In experiment 1 and compared to the control, T10 increased progressive motility (P < 0.001) but taxifolin decreased total and progressive motility at higher concentrations (P < 0.001), both post-thawing and after the incubation. Viability decreased post-thawing in the three concentrations (P < 0.001). Cyto-plasmic ROS decreased at 0 and 5 h at T10 (P = 0.049), and all doses decreased mitochondrial superoxide post-thawing (P = 0.024). In experiment 2, 5 mu M taxifolin or 1 mM GSH (alone or combined) increased total and progressive motility vs. the control (P < 0.01), and taxifolin increased kinematic parameters such as VCL, ALH, and DNC (P < 0.05). Viability was not affected by taxifolin in this experiment. Both antioxidants did not significantly affect other sperm physiology parameters. The incubation significantly affected all the parameters (P < 0.004), overall decreasing sperm quality. Fertility after artificial insemination with doses supplemented with 5 mu M taxifolin was 76.9% (10/13), not significantly different from the control group (69.2%, 9/13). In conclusion, taxifolin showed a lack of toxicity in the low micromolar range and could benefit goat semen cryopreservation.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The coexistence of multiple species competing for a finite set of resources is a widely debated topic in community ecology. Species with strongly overlapping niches are expected to drive each other towards exclusion, but such species may also coexist if they have similar competitive abilities. This compromise can lead to a peculiar pattern of clumped coexistence, where multiple species share similar niches, leaving gaps open in the theoretically available niche space. Large mammal herbivores may be a good example of this, where species' dietary niches clump as either grazers, browsers, or intermediate-feeders, rather than being continuously distributed over the resource gradient. Here, we develop a model of such emergent neutrality amongst species competing for a set of predefined resources each distributed along a finite niche axis. The model is commensurate with stable isotope niches, thus allowing us to compare its predictions with empirical evidence for changes in community niche structure over evolutionary time. We present stable carbon and oxygen isotope evidence for six discontinuous Late Quaternary assemblages from the central interior of South Africa, demonstrating the emergence of a clumped niche structure from an initial pattern of strongly overlapping diets. We show that species tend to cluster on parts of the niche axis where resource availability is highest, mirroring the proliferation of grazer species as landscapes became more grass-dominated. However, the presence of competition means that species' niches continue to differentiate, explaining the persistence of browser and intermediate-feeder species even in these open, predominantly treeless landscapes. These results highlight that species interactions are a necessary factor for robust inferences about the evolutionary dynamics of palaeocommunities.

AB  - Internal feeding is considered to shield sessile herbivorous insects from exposure to nonsystemic insecticides aerially sprayed against forest defoliators, although this has not been tested. It is, however, established that leaf damage caused by defoliators affects the survivorship and oviposition behavior of sessile herbivores. Thus feeding ecology and competition may mediate nontarget effects of insecticides on these insects. We tested the ecological sensitivity of 3 guilds of sessile herbivores (upper-surface leaf-miners, lower-surface leaf-miners, and gall-inducers) to the lipophilic larvicides diflubenzuron and tebufenozide aerially applied either at operational rates (12 g active ingredient [a.i.]/ha and 69.6 g [a.i.]/ha, respectively) or at maximum legal rates (60 g [a.i.]/ha and 180 g [a.i.]/ha, respectively), in German oak forests. Diflubenzuron affected leaf-miners at different life stages depending on their position on the leaf but had no effect on gall-inducers. Tebufenozide showed a similar, but not significant, pattern in leaf-miners and did not affect gall-inducers. By reducing the incidence of chewing damage on leaves, both insecticides offset the negative effect of competition on leaf-miner and gall-inducers. The net outcome of insecticide treatment was positive for guilds avoiding exposure, but negative for upper-surface leaf-miners. Exposure to insecticides in situ can be mediated by subtle differences in species biology and species interactions, with potential implications for organisms usually considered safe in risk assessment studies.

AB  - This article examined changes in perceived agency trust, risks to deer and humans, and beliefs about chronic wasting disease (CWD) management in Illinois between 2012 and 2022. Data were obtained from two surveys of resident deer hunters in 2012 (n = 5,663) and 2022 (n = 1,237). Trust in the Illinois Department of Natural Resources and perceived risk to humans did not differ between the two years. The 2012 hunters, however, were more concerned about the risk to deer by CWD and thought hunters were effective in controlling the disease more than the 2022 hunters. The 2022 hunters were more likely to perceive negative impacts of CWD on deer, believe that the agency should do more to eliminate CWD from Illinois, and were neutral on sharpshooting. All six indices were used to predict beliefs about sharpshooting. For both 2012 (R2 = 56%) and 2022 (R2 = 49%), the belief indices consistently had larger coefficients than trust or risk.

AB  - The diversity of South American deer genera during the Quaternary is considered one of the greatest in the world. However, this was established during the beginning of the twentieth century, when the recognition of new extinct deer taxa was based only on differences in antler morphology. Thus, South American extinct deer taxa need a detailed taxonomic revision, and this is the case of the Andean deer genera Agalmaceros and Charitoceros. First, both taxa are diagnosed by the presence of thorns in their antlers. Consequently, by taxonomic priority, Agalmaceros is a senior synonym of Charitoceros. Second, we recognize here that the thorns of the antlers of Agalmaceros are the symptom of a pathology that also affects some extant deer. Excluding the thorns of the antlers, the antler of Agalmaceros is identical to that of Odocoileus virginianus, indicating that Agalmaceros is a junior synonym to this extant deer. The recognition of epizootic hemorrhagic disease as the possible cause for the thorny antlers of Andean O. virginianus and the ample record of this affecting antlers in deer from the tropical Andes suggests that an epidemic occurred in this region in the Late Pleistocene. Before describing a new taxon, taxonomists must exhaust all possibilities to explain morphological variations. In this regard, this contribution provides an interesting, important and weakly explored area in paleontology, namely taxonomic revision under a paleopathology context. With the taxonomic invalidation of Agalmaceros and Charitoceros proposed here, the diversity of South American deer genera during the Pleistocene is poorer than previously established and includes 11 taxa - seven extant and four extinct.

AB  - The management of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus) and burros (E. asinus) in the United States has been referred to as a "wicked problem " because, although there are population control options, societal values will ultimately determine what is acceptable and what is not. In the United States, free-roaming equids are managed by different types of organizations and agencies, and the landscapes that these animals inhabit vary widely in terms of access, size, topography, climate, natural resources, flora, and fauna. This landscape diversity, coupled with contemporary socioeconomic and political environments, means that adaptive management practices are needed to regulate these free-roaming populations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) currently manages free-roaming equids on 177 herd management areas in the United States by applying fertility control measures in situ and/or removing horses, which are either adopted by private individuals or sent to long-term holding facilities. The BLM off-range population currently includes > 50,000 animals and costs approximately $50 million USD per year to maintain; on-range equid numbers were estimated in March 2022 to be approximately 82,384. On-range populations can grow at 15-20% annually, and current estimates far exceed the designated appropriate management level of 26,715. To reduce population recruitment, managers need better information about effective, long-lasting or permanent fertility control measures. Because mares breed only once a year, fertility control studies take years to complete. Some contraceptive approaches have been studied for decades, and results from various trials can collectively inform future research directions and actions. Employing 1 or more fertility control tools in concert with removals offers the best potential for success. Active, iterative, cooperative, and thoughtful management practices can protect free-roaming horses while simultaneously protecting the habitat. Herein, we review contraceptive vaccines, intrauterine devices, and surgical sterilization options for controlling fertility of free-roaming horses. This review provides managers with a "fertility control toolbox " and guides future research.

AB  - Grazing fish play a role of controlling autochthonous primary production and converting it to secondary production by consuming benthic algae. Moreover, they will also provide autochthonous particulate organic matter (POM) for freshwater ecosystems by dislodging the benthic algal matrix while feeding. However, it has not been confirmed whether grazing fish induce POM production during their feeding on benthic algae. To verify this POM production during grazing by fish, short-term (90 min) feeding experiments were conducted by introducing grazing fish Plecoglossus altivelis into indoor aquaria with benthic algal mats. We found that the fish can generate POM by feeding on benthic algae. Although POM was generated in the aquaria where the fish had not grazed on the benthic algal mats at all, the concentration of POM in the aquaria increased with the frequency of the acts of scraping benthic algae by the fish. Furthermore, we observed that the fish egested faeces which corresponded to about 44% on average of the ingested benthic organic matter. In some cases, the fish generated POM that corresponded to 88% of the removed (dislodged and ingested) benthic organic matter through their feeding and defecation. This study suggested that grazing fish have a function of providing autochthonous POM to freshwater ecosystems both via dislodging benthic algae during feeding and through egestion of consumed benthic algae.

AB  - The challenge to reconcile agricultural production with the conservation of biodiversity and associated ecosystems services has triggered interest in the design of pest suppressive landscapes. However, the uniqueness of species -spe-cific responses to management and landscape context hamper our ability to make generalizations for landscape design, and we often lack quantitative indicators to make inferences about the pest suppressive potential of landscape designs. Here I examine the literature to underpin design principles based on source-sink theory. The potential of landscapes to support herbivore populations is associated with the area of source habitat, source strength, and the ability of herbivores to detect host plants. The potential of natural enemies to suppress herbivore populations is asso-ciated with their potential for numerical response, time to colonization and natural enemy diversity. Insecticide appli-cations and other intensive management practices can turn treated fields into sinks. The analysis reveals that landscape features or management practices influence multiple processes at the same time, and that well-documented landscape features associated with high pest suppression potential generally discourage herbivores and/or favour natu-ral enemies. The evaluation of landscapes in terms of source habitats for specific herbivores and their natural enemies may reveal context-specific information that allow a better quantitative understanding of pest suppression potential of landscapes.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The management of free-roaming horses (Equus ferus) and burros (E. asinus) in the United States has been referred to as a "wicked problem" because, although there are popula-tion control options, societal values will ultimately determine what is acceptable and what is not. In the United States, free-roaming equids are managed by different types of organizations and agencies, and the landscapes that these animals inhabit vary widely in terms of access, size, topography, climate, natural resources, flora, and fauna. This landscape diversity, coupled with contemporary socioeconomic and political environments, means that adaptive management practices are needed to regulate these free-roaming populations. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) currently manages free-roaming equids on 177 herd management areas in the United States by applying fertility control measures in situ and/or removing horses, which are either adopted by private individuals or sent to long-term holding facilities. The BLM off-range popula-tion currently includes >50,000 animals and costs approximately $50 million USD per year to maintain; on-range equid numbers were estimated in March 2022 to be approximately 82,384. On-range populations can grow at 15-20% annually, and current estimates far exceed the designated appropriate management level of 26,715. To reduce population recruitment, managers need better information about effective, long-lasting or permanent fertility control measures. Because mares breed only once a year, fertility control studies take years to complete. Some contraceptive approaches have been studied for decades, and results from various trials can collectively inform future research directions and actions. Employing 1 or more fertility control tools in concert with removals offers the best potential for success. Active, iterative, cooperative, and thoughtful management practices can protect free-roaming horses while simultaneously protecting the habitat. Herein, we review contraceptive vaccines, intrauterine devices, and surgical sterilization options for controlling fertility of free-roaming horses. This review provides managers with a "fertility control toolbox" and guides future research.

AB  - Ciguatera Poisoning (CP) is a widespread and complex poisoning syndrome caused by the consumption of fish or invertebrates contaminated with a suite of potent neurotoxins collectively known as ciguatoxins (CTXs), which are produced by certain benthic dinoflagellates species in the genera Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa. Due to the complex nature of this HAB problem, along with a poor understanding of toxin production and entry in the coral reef food web, the development of monitoring, management, and forecasting approaches for CP has lagged behind those available for other HAB syndromes. Over the past two decades, renewed research on the taxonomy, physiology, and toxicology of CP-causing dinoflagellates has advanced our understanding of the species diversity that exists within these genera, including identification of highly toxic species (so called "superbugs") that likely contribute disproportionately to ciguatoxins entering coral reef food webs. The recent development of approaches for molecular analysis of field samples now provide the means to investigate in situ community composition, enabling characterization of spatiotemporal species dynamics, linkages between toxic species abundance and toxin flux, and the risk of ciguatoxin prevalence in fish. In this study we used species-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probes to investigate Gambierdiscus species composition and dynamics in St. Thomas (USVI) and the Florida Keys (USA) over multiple years (2018-2020). Within each location, samples were collected seasonally from several sites comprising varying depths, habitats, and algal substrates to characterize community structure over small spatial scales and across different host macrophytes. This approach enabled the quantitative determination of communities over spatiotemporal gradients, as well as the selective enumeration of species known to exhibit high toxicity, such as Gambierdiscus silvae. The investigation found differing community structure between St. Thomas and Florida Keys sites, driven in part by differences in the distribution of toxin-producing species G. silvae and G. belizeanus, which were present throughout sampling sites in St. Thomas but scarce or absent in the Florida Keys. This finding is significant given the high toxicity of G. silvae, and may help explain differences in fish toxicity and CP incidence between St. Thomas and Florida. Intrasite comparisons along a depth gradient found higher concentrations of Gambierdiscus spp. at deeper lo-cations. Among the macrophytes sampled, Dictyota may be a likely vector for toxin transfer based on their widespread distribution, apparent colonization by G. silvae, and palatability to at least some herbivore grazers. Given its ubiquity throughout both study regions and sites, this taxa may also serve as a refuge, accumulating high concentrations of Gambierdiscus and other benthic dinoflagellates, which in turn can serve as source pop-ulations for highly palatable and ephemeral habitats nearby, such as turf algae. These studies further demon-strate the successful application of FISH probes in examining biogeographic structuring of Gambierdiscus communities, targeting individual toxin-producing species, and characterizing species-level dynamics that are needed to describe and model ecological drivers of species abundance and toxicity.

AB  - The agricultural industry produces a substantial quantity of organic waste, and finding a suitable method for disposing of this highly biodegradable solid waste is a difficult task. The utilisation of anaerobic digestion for agricultural waste is a viable technological solution for both renewable energy production (biogas) and waste treatment. The primary objective of the study was to assess the composition of biogas, namely the percentages of methane, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and hydrogen sulphide. Additionally, the study aimed to quantify the amount of biogas produced and determine the methane yield (measured in NmL/g VS) from different agricultural substrates. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) measurements were conducted in triplicate using the BPC Instruments AMPTS II instrument. The substrates utilised in the investigation were chosen based on their accessibility. The substrates used in this study comprise cattle manure, chicken manure, pig manure, tomato plants, tomatoes, cabbage, mixed fruits, mixed vegetables, dog food, and a co-digestion of mixed vegetables, fruits, and dog food (MVMFDF). Prior to the cleaning process, the makeup of the biogas was assessed using the BIOGAS 5000, a Geotech Analyser. The AMPTS II flow cell automatically monitored and recorded the volume of bio-methane produced after the cleaning stage. The data were examined using the Minitab-17 software. The co-digestion of mixed vegetables, mixed fruits, and dog food (MVMFDF) resulted in the highest methane level of 77.4%, followed by mixed fruits at 76.6%, pig manure at 72.57%, and mixed vegetables at 70.1%. The chicken manure exhibited the greatest levels of ammonia (98.0 ppm) and hydrogen sulphide (589 ppm). Chicken manure had the highest hydrogen sulphide level, followed by pig manure (540 ppm), tomato plants (485 ppm), mixed fruits (250 ppm), and MVMFDF (208 ppm). Ultimately, the makeup of biogas is greatly affected by the unique qualities of each substrate. Substrates containing elevated quantities of hydrogen sulphide, such as chicken manure, require the process of biogas scrubbing. This is because they contain substantial amounts of ammonia and hydrogen sulphide, which can cause corrosion to the equipment in biogas plants. This emphasises the crucial need to meticulously choose substrates, with a specific focus on their organic composition and their capacity to generate elevated methane levels while minimising contaminants. Substrates with a high organic content, such as agricultural waste, are optimal for maximising the production of methane. Furthermore, the implementation of biogas scrubbing procedures is essential for efficiently decreasing carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide levels in biogas. By considering and tackling these problems, the effectiveness of biogas generation can be enhanced and its ecological consequences alleviated. This strategy facilitates the advancement of biogas as a sustainable energy source, hence contributing to the attainment of sustainable development goals (SDGs).

AB  - With the rapid increase in the number of sheep breeding, sheep manure as breeding waste is arbitrarily stacked to produce toxic gases, resulting in serious environmental pollution, and it is easy to ignore the use value of sheep manure. At present, simple sheep manure fermentation cannot make full use of the value of sheep manure, with the study found that through sheep manure fermentation can produce high value of chemicals. Therefore, based on the theory of biochemical humic acid formation, biochemical humic acid was synthesized by adding different proportions of lignite and sheep manure for solid phase reaction, using microorganisms to degrade cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in sheep manure and lignite to provide carbon sources. The results showed that the addition of lignite and sheep manure accelerated the microbial degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in sheep manure, and the addition of lignite also significantly increased the content of biochemical humic acid in sheep manure. The content of biochemical humic acid in 10% lignite increased from 15.5% to 30.0% on the 12th day, which was 13.125% higher than that in the blank group. The contents of total humic acid, free humic acid, water-soluble humic acid, reaction temperature, water content, organic matter content, seed germination rate, infrared and ultraviolet spectra were also determined. The changes of functional groups were analyzed by infrared and ultraviolet spectra, which showed that the addition of lignite could promote the decomposition of organic matter in sheep manure into biochemical humic acid. Therefore, the addition of lignite can be used as an exogenous substance to help improve the composting process of sheep manure, and can effectively increase the content of biochemical humic acid.

AB  - Coastal wetlands face threats from climate change-induced flooding and biological invasions. Plants respond to these stressors through changes in their phytochemical metabolome, but it is unclear whether stressors affecting one tissue compartment (e.g., leaves) create vulnerabilities in others (e.g., roots) or elicit similar responses across tissues. Additionally, responses to multiple simultaneous stressors remain poorly understood due to the focus on individual metabolites in past studies. This study aims to elucidate how the phytochemical metabolome of three Phragmites australis (Cav.) lineages, common in the Mississippi River Delta, responds to flooding and infestation by the non-native scale insect Nipponaclerda biwakoensis (Kuwana). Among these lineages, one is non-native and poses a threat to North American wetlands. Results indicate that metabolomic responses are highly specific, varying with lineage, tissue type, stressor type, and the presence of multiple stressors. Notably, the non-native lineage displayed high chemical evenness, while the other two showed stressor-dependent responses. The 10 most informative features identified by a machine learning model showed less than 1% overlap with known metabolites linked to water and herbivory stress, underscoring gaps in our understanding of plant responses to environmental stressors. Our metabolomic approach offers a valuable tool for identifying candidate plant genotypes for wetland restoration.

AB  - Mechanisms promoting stable coexistence allow multiple species to persist in the same trophic level of a given network of species interactions. One of the most common stabilizing mechanisms of coexistence is niche differentiation, such as temporal and spatial patchiness. To understand the limits of coexistence between species we have to understand the limits of competitive interactions which translate in species exclusion or patterns of non-co-occurrence.
   We evaluated spatiotemporal niche-based mechanisms that could promote stable coexistence between ants and spiders which forage on extrafloral nectary (EFN)-bearing plants. We observed co-occurrence and overlapping patterns between ants and spiders in a temporal and spatial scale in nine different EFN-bearing plant species in a Neotropical savanna, using both community and species-level approach.
   Ants and spiders showed asynchrony of their abundances over the year with low temporal overlapping patterns between them (temporal niche specialization). Greater abundance of ants occurred between September and March, whereas greater abundance of spiders occurred between March and August, exactly at the time when the abundance of ants decreases on plants. However, there might also be some levels of temporal overlapping, but then individual ants and spiders occupy different branches (spatial segregation). Finally, we also observed a spatial negative effect of the abundance of ants on the presence of spiders.
   Our results suggest that spatiotemporal partitioning between ants and spiders may be one of the potential mechanisms behind a stable coexistence between these two groups of organisms that forage on EFN-bearing plants in the Brazilian savanna.

AB  - Ocean warming and the associated changes in fish herbivory have caused polarward distributional shifts in the majority of canopy-forming macroalgae that are dominant in temperate Japan, but have little effect on the alga Sargassum fusiforme. The regeneration ability of new shoots from holdfasts in this species may be advantageous in highly grazed environments. However, little is known about the factors regulating this in Sargassum species. Moreover, holdfast tolerance to high-temperature and nutrient-poor conditions during summer has rarely been evaluated. In the present study, S. fusiforme holdfast responses to the combined effects of temperature and nutrient availability were compared to those of sexually reproduced propagules. The combined effects of holdfast fragmentation and irradiance on regeneration were also evaluated. Propagule growth rate values changed from positive to negative under the combination of elevated temperature (20 degrees C-30 degrees C) and reduced nutrient availability, whereas holdfasts exhibited a positive growth rate even at 32 degrees C in nutrient-poor conditions. The regeneration rate increased with holdfast fragmentation (1 mm segments), but was unaffected by decreased irradiance. These results suggest that S. fusiforme holdfasts have a higher tolerance to high-temperature and nutrient-poor conditions during summer than propagules, and regenerate new shoots even if 1-mm segments remain in shaded refuges for fish herbivory avoidance.

AB  - Introduction Xenophyophores are large benthic agglutinated Foraminifera that are a major component of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone megafauna.Methods Two xenophyophore specimens were obtained and submitted to genomic investigations.Results For both specimens, it was possible to obtain a ca. 25 kb circular xenophyophore-associated mitochondrial genome (XAM) showing similar gene contents with other Retaria, with which they are associated by a maximum likelihood multiprotein phylogeny. One of the specimens yielded a complete cluster of nuclear rRNA genes, the first to be obtained from a xenophyophore. Another full cluster of rRNA, likely belonging to Endomyxa parasites, was found within both specimens.Discussion Although the agglutinated nature of xenophyophores currently prevents a definitive conclusion, the mitogenomes obtained may represent the first to be obtained from those foraminifera. Deeper enquiries are required in order to properly ascribe these genomes to their host organism and to clarify the nature of the possibly parasitic Rhizaria associated with the xenophyophores.

AB  - Invasive species can alter the ecology of protected areas, substantially lowering the habitat quality for vertebrate communities. The Lower Imenti Forest on Mt. Kenya's northeastern slope has experienced habitat disturbance, degrading the system and resulting in the establishment of invasive species, including lantana (Lantana camara), throughout the area. Following reports of high mortality and poor conditions among the African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) inhabiting the area, we assessed the status of two endocrine indicators of their physiological condition. Specifically, we assessed the physiological stress response by measuring faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (fGCM) and the nutritional stress response by measuring faecal thyroid (fT3) concentrations in elephant faecal samples collected in the forest. To better interpret the hormone levels, we compared the hormone concentrations in the Imenti faecal samples to concentrations from reference levels indicative of extreme nutritional stress (from faecal samples of elephants experiencing drought-induced mortality) and adrenal stress (from elephants experiencing high levels of human-elephant conflict). The concentrations of fT3, a biomarker of nutritional stress response, found in elephant faecal samples from the Lower Imenti Forest were lower than the drought-stressed reference levels, suggesting lower levels of energy intake and assimilation of forage resources in elephants from this area. The concentration of fGCM, a biomarker of physiological stress response, was higher than the human-elephant conflict reference levels, suggesting the elephants in Lower Imenti were experiencing a higher physiological stress response. We found no differences between fT3 and fGCM concentrations in samples assigned to different age classes (juvenile, subadults, adults), suggesting the physiological problems were not age specific. Findings from our physiological study suggest that restricted movement and reduced forage availability due to lantana infestation in the Lower Imenti Forest may be driving the elevated nutritional stress, potentially contributing to the concerning mortality observed in the area. We discuss the use of endocrine markers to ascertain wildlife responses to degraded habitats.
   Hormonal monitoring can provide useful information on the physiological state of animals for the conservation and management of threatened species. We found that elephants in the Lower Imenti Forest of Kenya, which is dominated by invasive lantana plants, had higher physiological stress and lower metabolic stress response compared to elephants in agropastoral areas, where human-elephant conflict is prevalent, and compared to elephants within Samburu National Reserve during extreme drought conditions.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study, we utilized the methods of spatiotemporal analysis to reveal and visualize the areas in the Russian Federation where an increased density of wild boar population might be related to the concentration of African swine fever (ASF) cases in wild boar. We demonstrated the areas (at the municipality level), where the elevated wild boar population density has continued to rise in recent years, that may be treated as high-risk areas, subject to the application of enhanced surveillance and population control measures.Abstract African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious disease that affects both domestic pigs (DPs) and wild boar (WB). The WB population plays an important role in the spread of ASF as the WB acts as a natural reservoir of the virus and transmits it to other susceptible wild and domestic pigs. Our study was aimed at revealing the areas with a high concentration of the WB population, and their potential relationships with the grouping of ASF cases in WB during the course of the ASF spread in the Russian Federation (2007-2022). We collected the annual data on WB numbers by municipalities within the regions of the most intensive ASF spread. We then conducted spatiotemporal analysis to identify clustering areas of ASF cases and compare them with the territories with a high density of WB population. We found that some of the territories with elevated ASF incidence in WB demonstrated spatial and temporal coincidence with the areas with a high WB population density. We also visualized the zones ("emerging hot spots") with a statistically significant rise in the WB population density in recent years, which may be treated as areas of paramount importance for the application of surveillance measures and WB population control.

AB  - Simple Summary A primary cause of heavy metal pollution in the environment is human economic activity associated with increased industrialisation and urbanisation, agricultural development, transport, and energy production. The present study determines the degree of contamination by cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal, based on its concentrations in the organs of animals living in regions of Poland. Our findings indicate that Cd is present in the highest concentrations in the southern regions of Poland, where the mining, energy, metallurgical, and steel industries are located. Surprisingly, high Cd concentrations were also found in the northeastern region, which is generally considered to be unpolluted.Abstract The aim of this study was to determine the concentration of cadmium (Cd) in the organs of game animals from areas with different degrees of industrialisation and to assess its intake following the consumption of the livers of these animals. The material for this study consisted of liver and kidney samples taken from roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa) from five regions differing in land use and industrialisation. Compared to the kidneys, the liver was an indicator of the current state of the environment and Cd intake, while the kidney was used to assess the long-term accumulation of Cd in the body. The cadmium concentration in the samples was determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry. The cadmium concentrations of the organs were found to vary according to geographical location, with the highest levels being observed in Southern Poland, i.e., areas characterised by the highest degree of industrialisation and the presence of heavy industry. However, high Cd concentrations were also reported in the northeastern region. Examples of excessive cadmium levels in the kidneys were noted in all tested regions. Cd intake by humans was evaluated by calculating the estimated daily cadmium intake, and this was compared with the tolerable weekly intake (TWI). The TWI was only exceeded by children frequently consuming wild boar liver from the southwest region.

AB  - Simple Summary Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis are widely distributed pathogens in vertebrates. Both protozoa are among the major causes of diarrhoea in humans. Wild boars are known hosts of both parasites and are able to harbour zoonotic species. The main goal of this study was to molecularly evaluate the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis in faecal samples taken from hunted wild boar in eastern Spain. This area is experiencing a rapid increase in the wild boar population, which is colonising all habitats, including urban and peri-urban areas, thereby increasing interactions with humans. Both parasites were found in our study, evidencing a high prevalence, mainly of Cryptosporidium scrofarum and Cryptosporidium suis, which have been previously reported to affect humans. These results point out the potential for wild boar-human transmission because of close contact interactions, such as space sharing or dressing for meat consumption. The protozoans Giardia duodenalis and Cryptosporidium spp. are common causes of gastrointestinal disease in humans and animals. While both are commonly documented in domestic animals, few studies have analysed their presence in wildlife. To assess the prevalence of both parasites in wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the Valencian Community (eastern Spain), 498 wild boar faecal samples were collected from 2018 to 2022. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected by performing a nested PCR targeting a 578 bp sequence of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (SSU rRNA), followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. For G. duodenalis, a qPCR amplifying a fragment of 62 bp from the SSU rRNA was employed. Positive samples were genotyped for glutamate dehydrogenase and & beta;-giardin genes. Different epidemiological factors were considered potential modulating variables in the transmission of both parasites. G. duodenalis prevalence was 1.20%, while Cryptosporidium spp. prevalence reached 21.7%. Coinfection was observed in 0.2%. Genotyping of G. duodenalis isolates only detected genotype E. Two species of Cryptosporidium spp. were identified: Cryptosporidium scrofarum and Cryptosporidium suis. The results of this study demonstrate that the exposure to Cryptosporidium spp. in wild boars is high, particularly among young individuals belonging to the Typical Mediterranean climate. Moreover, the probability of infection is dependent on both the season and the density of wild boars. On the other side, exposure to G. duodenalis seems scarce and is influenced, in turn, by the climate. Both Cryptosporidium species detected in the present study have been reported in humans. Due to wild boar increasing in number and their colonisation of urban and peri-urban areas, this could represent an inherent health risk for the human population.

AB  - Ghar-e Boof is a Paleolithic cave site in Iran, known for being the type locality for the early Upper Paleolithic (UP) Rostamian lithic industries. Defining the Rostamian cultural group has significant archaeological implications for the Zagros Mountains. First, it highlights the cultural diversity of the UP in the Zagros. Second, it evinces a more complex scenario for the spread of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) across Southwest Asia. Despite this, little is known about human subsistence strategies during the Rostamian. In this paper, we present the results of a zooarchaeological analysis that allows us to reconstruct prey choice, transport decisions, and carcass processing at Ghar-e Boof. Wild sheep/goat was the main prey at the site, but other taxa such as partridges, tortoises, and gazelles represented important dietary supplements. Mortality data indicate that Rostamian hunters primarily targeted prime-aged adult ungulates. Anatomical representation also shows that there was no selective transport of animal carcasses to the site, so hunting activities most likely took place nearby. Although many specimens in the assemblage were covered by thick concretions, the presence of cut marks demonstrates defleshing, filleting, dismemberment, and even the removal of internal organs of prey. Percussion impacts and cone fractures also suggest the processing of bones for marrow. Chronologically, moving from the oldest to the youngest layers, there is a decrease in large game in parallel with a progressive increase in small, fast-moving animals. Following the prey choice model of optimal foraging theory, this diachronic variation might track regional resource stress or an increase in hunting pressure. Our results, along with the analysis of lithic artifacts and changes in the rates of sedimentation during the Rostamian sequence, indicate an increase in occupation intensity through time.

AB  - Although many marine ecosystems have been adversely impacted by human activities,(1) some are now recovering due to reductions in fishing pressure.(2-4) Here, we document the recovery of an ecosystem subjected to intense anthropogenic activity for over 200 years, the Clyde Sea.(5) This region once had productive fisheries for herring (Clupea harengus) and other fish, but these disappeared at the turn of the century.(6,7) Using acoustic surveys of the pelagic ecosystem, we found that the Clyde Sea supports 100 times as many forage fish as in the late 1980s. However, herring has now been replaced by sprat (Sprattus sprattus), despite virtually no fishing on herring for 20 years. A combination of a warming sea,(6) bycatch of herring in the prawn (Nephrops norvegicus) fishery,(8,9) and susceptibility of herring to poor recruitment may have contributed to this unexpected recovery. We compare this to similar unexpected "recoveries"involving unforeseen ecosystem effects, such as the return of hake (Merluccius merluccius) to the North Sea;(10,11) the recent expansion of the pelagic squat lobster, "munida,"(Pleuroncodes monodon) off Peru;(12) and the increase in scallop (Placopecten magellanicus) numbers on Georges Bank.(13) The lack of a current sprat fishery in the Clyde presents a unique opportunity to develop an alternative industry for its seafaring community: ecotourism. Charismatic megafauna (whales, dolphins, and seabirds) that people will pay to see(14) will, in time-if not already(15,16)-be drawn in by the abundance of forage fish now present, further restoring the biodiversity of the region after centuries of overexploitation.

AB  - Overreliance on fishmeal (FM) as an aquafeed ingredient has become economically and ecologically unsustainable because wild stocks of forage fish are declining causing disruptions in aquatic food webs. On the other hand, the crocodile skin business generates substantial quantities of crocodile meat whose demand for human consumption is extremely low. The potential value of crocodile meat meal (CMM) as a FM alternative in fish diets is unknown. Therefore, this short-term, preliminary study investigated the effect of replacing FM with raw or cooked CMM on feed utilization, growth performance, haemato-biochemical parameters, and tissue nutrient composition in juvenile dusky kob (Argyrosomus japonicus, Temminck and Schlegel, 1843). Diets were formulated by replacing FM in a commercial diet (control) with 1. cooked CMM at 50 % (CCR50), 2. raw CMM at 50 % (RCR50), 3. raw CMM at 100 % (RCR100), and 4. cooked CMM at 100 % (CCR100). Fingerlings (7.55 +/- 0.87 g) were offered diets at 2.8 % body weight, twice daily, in a recirculating aquaculture system (20 tanks; 110 fish/ tank) for 5 weeks. Weight was measured weekly while blood and fillet samples were collected in week 5. Complete replacement of FM with CMM significantly reduced feed intake, weight gain, specific growth rate (SGR), and protein efficiency ratio (PER) while increasing FCR over the 5-week period. The RCR100 and CCR100 diets also resulted in higher levels of urea, alkaline phosphatase, and lower triglycerides in the serum of fish. Complete replacement of FM with CMM increased palmitoleic and oleic acids in fish muscle compared to the control. Regardless of level of FM substitution, CMM had an adverse impact on linoleic acid, linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid concentration of the dusky kob fillet. A supplementation strategy using oils rich in n-3 fatty acids could mitigate the negative impact of dietary CMM on feed utilization, growth performance, and polyunsaturated fatty acid levels in dusky kob fillet without raising economic and ecological costs.

AB  - There is a growing recognition of the importance of conservation beyond protected areas, in spaces of human-wildlife coexistence. Negative human-wildlife interactions are a key challenge, but a better understanding of the forms of tolerance and mutual accommodation would be useful for coadaptation toward coexistence. To date, however, studies of human-wildlife often have been limited by a largely quantified positivist epistemology, which elides the diverse cultural and ecological contexts which enable tolerance and coexistence between humans and wildlife to develop and adhere. In Gudalur, a plantation landscape in South India, about 150 elephants share space with a quarter of a million people. Using a quantified survey coupled with ethnographic fieldwork, we aim to better understand human diversity and tolerance of elephants that allows for coexistence. We find a marked difference between communities, with ethnicity being a better predictor of tolerance than the more tangible socio-economic or geographic variables such as income, education, land holding or cropping patterns. Using qualitative data, we identify three socio-cultural variables that are relevant to tolerance-a shared history of living with elephants, mode of subsistence and type of agricultural crops, and most importantly, ontology or the fundamental understanding of "what is an elephant?" Hunter-gatherer conceptualisations of elephants as "other-than-human persons" prove to be the ontological stance best suited to coexistence, as it allows for elephant individuality and interpersonal negotiations of shared space, which is limited in other world-views, including the worshiping of elephants as Ganesha, the elephant headed deity in the Hindu Pantheon. Having identified some important differences among ethnic communities in human-elephant interactions, we consider the implications of the research for improving the management and practice of human-wildlife coexistence not only in the Nilgiri region but within the broader context of conservation and development.

AB  - Leaves are critical to plant photosynthesis and the loss of leaf area can have negative consequences for an individual's performance and fitness. Variation in plant defenses plays a large role in protecting their leaves from attack by insect herbivores. However, trade-offs in allocation among growth, reproduction, and defense may limit the availability of resources for any one aspect of a plant's life-history strategy, which would lead to greater herbivory in those plants that allocate more resources to growth or reproduction than to defense. Patterns of sex-biased herbivory in dioecious plants are well documented yet are known to vary in the direction (female or male) of their bias. A greater concentration of conspecifics may also increase herbivore attack through negative density dependence. In order to test the hypothesis that sex-biased herbivory varies as a function of conspecific density, we measured standing herbivory on 2350 leaves on 302 trees of the dioecious understory tree Iryanthera hostmannii (Myristicaceae) situated in a large forest dynamics plot in a lowland tropical rain forest in Ecuador. We found no difference in standing herbivory between the 169 male and 133 female trees, nor for focal trees surrounded by higher densities of conspecifics. The slow-growing, shade-tolerant growth patterns of I. hostmannii may contribute to suppressed differential expression of secondary sex characters in leaf defenses, leading to similar levels of herbivory between males and females. Considering the factors that most strongly affect herbivory in dioecious species is important in understanding the evolution of sex-related traits more broadly.
   Las hojas son fundamentales para la fotos & iacute;ntesis de las plantas, as & iacute; que la p & eacute;rdida del & aacute;rea de la hoja puede tener consecuencias negativas para el desempe & ntilde;o y la aptitud del individuo. La variaci & oacute;n en las defensas de las plantas juega un papel importante contra el ataque de insectos herb & iacute;voros. Sin embargo, las compensaciones en la asignaci & oacute;n de recursos entre crecimiento, reproducci & oacute;n y defensa pueden limitar la disponibilidad de recursos para cualquier aspecto de la estrategia de historia de vida de una planta, lo que llevar & iacute;a a una mayor herbivor & iacute;a en aquellas plantas que asignan m & aacute;s recursos al crecimiento o la reproducci & oacute;n que a la defensa. Los patrones de herbivor & iacute;a sesgada por el sexo est & aacute;n bien documentados en plantas dioicas, y se sabe que pueden variar en la direcci & oacute;n de su sesgo (hacia machos o hembras). Igualmente, una gran concentraci & oacute;n de cong & eacute;neres podr & iacute;a incrementar el ataque por herbivor & iacute;a a trav & eacute;s de un efecto negativo dependiente de la densidad. Para probar la hip & oacute;tesis de que la herbivor & iacute;a sesgada por el sexo var & iacute;a en funci & oacute;n de la densidad de cong & eacute;neres, se midi & oacute; la herbivor & iacute;a acumulada en 2350 hojas en 302 & aacute;rboles de la especie dioica de sotobosque Iryanthera hostmannii (Myristicaceae), localizados en una parcela de din & aacute;mica forestal en un bosque tropical lluvioso de tierras bajas en Ecuador. No se encontr & oacute; diferencia en la herbivor & iacute;a acumulada entre los 169 & aacute;rboles machos y los 133 femeninos, ni en & aacute;rboles focales rodeados por una mayor densidad de cong & eacute;neres. El patr & oacute;n de crecimiento lento y tolerante a la sombra de I. hostmannii puede contribuir a suprimir la expresi & oacute;n diferenciada por el sexo en las defensas de las hojas, lo que llevar & iacute;a a similares niveles de herbivor & iacute;a entre machos y hembras. Considerar los factores que m & aacute;s fuertemente afectan la herbivor & iacute;a en especies dioicas es importante para comprender de manera m & aacute;s amplia la evoluci & oacute;n de los rasgos relacionadas con el sexo.

AB  - In coastal systems, marine-protected areas (MPAs) have been shown to increase the diversity, abundance, and biomass of wildlife assemblages as well as their resilience to climate change. The effectiveness of pelagic MPAs is less clear, with arguments against their establishment typically based on the highly mobile nature of pelagic taxa. We used mid-water stereo-baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS) and spatial predictive models to characterize the pelagic wildlife assemblage at the head of the Perth Canyon, one of the largest submarine canyons in Australia, over a 7-yr period (2013-2019). The total number of unique taxa and mean values of taxonomic richness, abundance, fork length, and biomass demonstrated strong interannual stability, although mean taxonomic richness and abundance were significantly lower in 2018 relative to other years. Seasonal variability was absent in 2016, but in 2018, taxonomic richness and abundance were three times greater in the Austral spring than in the autumn. Some mobile megafauna were only recorded at the Perth Canyon Marine Park (PCMP) in the autumn, suggesting a seasonal component to their occurrence. The fine-scale distribution of pelagic taxa at the canyon head was largely stable over time, with many areas of higher relative probability of presence located outside protected zones. Despite a degree of variability that may relate to the effect of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on the Leeuwin Current, the PCMP assemblage demonstrates a relatively high degree of spatiotemporal stability. Stronger protection of the PCMP (IUCN II or higher) would potentially improve conservation outcomes for many species of pelagic wildlife.

AB  - Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies is an acute infectious viral disease in a variety of mammals caused by Suid herpesvirus 1, a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and the family Herpesviridae. This virus causes significant economic losses in agriculture of numerous countries. In particular, in pig farming, the main losses are currently associated with restrictions of international trade, as well as the cost of vaccination or slaughter of infected animals. The main reservoirs species of this disease are considered to be wild boars and domestic pigs. So, in this article the authors performed a comparative retrospective analysis of the prevalence of Aujeszky's disease among these species in Ukraine over 2009-2020 by systematizing and analyzing the epizootic data and results of serological studies. As a result of the conducted research, there is a clear trend that shows the reduction in the number of locations in Ukraine (farms, households, etc.) with domestic pigs affected by Aujeszky's disease. Thus, in 2009 four such farms were found, and in 2018 -only one. During 2014-2016 and 2019-2020, affected farms and locations were not registered for this disease. In total, 21 such points with infected pigs were registered during the analyzed period. As for wild boars, during the analyzed 12 years, locations with animals affected by Aujeszky's disease were registered only in 2013 and 2014 (two and one, respectively). It should be noted that all of those with infected wild boars were found in the AR Crimea. For the twelve years, the number of tested sera samples from domestic pigs amounted to 378,678 (7.4% were positive) and from wild boars -9,052 (19.8% were positive). As a result of comparative geographical analysis of the obtained data on the detection of specific humoral antibodies to the Aujeszky's disease virus among both species for 12 years in the regions of Ukraine, there is no established clear correlation between the spread of the disease among wild boars and domestic pigs. Thus, the highest seroprevalence rates among wild boars were observed in the northern and northeastern parts of Ukraine, and in domestic pigs, on the contrary, in the southern and central parts of this country. It should be noted, that since 2014 the number of serological tests among both species for carriers of Aujeszky's disease has significantly decreased.

AB  - In shallow eutrophic lakes, submersed macrophytes are essential for maintaining a clear water state, and they are affected markedly by fishes directly through herbivory and indirectly by fish-invertebrate-periphyton complexity, a pathway that presently is not well understood in subtropical lakes but probably vital to lake managements. We conducted a mesocosm study involving benthic fish (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), snails (Radix swinhoei) and submersed macrophyte (Vallisneria natans), aiming to examine whether benthic fish is detrimental to reestablishment of clear-water macrophyte-dominated state in eutrophic degraded lakes. In addition, we aimed to investigate the cascading effect that benthic fish might have on periphyton and phytoplankton and to what extent snails can alleviate this effect. Our results showed that benthic fish promoted nutrient release from the sediment and thereby facilitated the growth of phytoplankton and periphyton, leading to reduced growth of submerged macrophytes due to shading. Snails consumed the periphyton attached on the leaves of macrophytes, thereby being beneficial to the plant growth, albeit it could not fully counteract the adverse effects from benthic fish. The water quality indicators in terms of nutrients concentrations, phytoplankton biomass and light extinction coefficient along the water column was affected primarily by benthic fish, followed by macrophytes and snails. To target a clear-water condition, the water quality was best at the presence of macrophytes alone or in combination with snails, and worst at the presence of benthic fish. Our results implied that the removal of benthic fish should be a useful ecological restoration method for rehabilitation of submersed macrophytes and water quality improvement in subtropic, eutrophic, shallow lakes following external nutrient loading reduction.

AB  - Tannins have traditionally been avoided in animal nutrition due to their anti-nutritive effects. However, recent studies reported hydrolysable tannins as beneficial additives that have antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic, antidiarrheal, and antiulcerogenic effects on animals. In a study testing the inclusion of hydrolysable tannins as a potential nutritive factor to reduce boar taint in entire males, significant enlargement of the parotid glands (parotidomegaly) was observed. In this study, we aimed to determine the morphological and immunohistochemical basis for the observed parotidomegaly. We discovered that enlargement of glandular lobules and acinar area, an increased ratio between the nucleus and cytoplasm of serous cells, and increased excretion of proline-rich proteins (PRPs) were characteristic of the experimental group that received the highest dietary tannin intake. The mandibular salivary gland, on the other hand, did not show significant morphological changes among the experimental groups. This suggests increased functional activity of the parotid salivary glands as the first and most important line of defense against high dietary tannin and its potential negative effects.
   The ingestion of hydrolysable tannins as a potential nutrient to reduce boar odor in entire males results in the significant enlargement of parotid glands (parotidomegaly). The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of different levels of hydrolysable tannins in the diet of fattening boars (n = 24) on salivary gland morphology and proline-rich protein (PRP) expression at the histological level. Four treatment groups of pigs (n = 6 per group) were fed either a control (T0) or experimental diet, where the T0 diet was supplemented with 1% (T1), 2% (T2), or 3% (T3) of the hydrolysable tannin-rich extract Farmatan (R). After slaughter, the parotid and mandibular glands of the experimental pigs were harvested and dissected for staining using Goldner's Trichrome method, and immunohistochemical studies with antibodies against PRPs. Morphometric analysis was performed on microtome sections of both salivary glands, to measure the acinar area, the lobular area, the area of the secretory ductal cells, and the sizes of glandular cells and their nuclei. Histological assessment revealed that significant parotidomegaly was only present in the T3 group, based on the presence of larger glandular lobules, acinar areas, and their higher nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. The immunohistochemical method, supported by color intensity measurements, indicated significant increases in basic PRPs (PRB2) in the T3 and acidic PRPs (PRH1/2) in the T1 groups. Tannin supplementation did not affect the histo-morphological properties of the mandibular gland. This study confirms that pigs can adapt to a tannin-rich diet by making structural changes in their parotid salivary gland, indicating its higher functional activity.

AB  - Plants have been shown to change their foraging behaviour in response to resource heterogeneity. However, an unexplored hypothesis is that foraging could be induced by environmental stressors, such as herbivory, which might increase the demand for particular resources, such as those required for herbivore defence. This study examined the way simulated herbivory affects both root foraging for and uptake of cadmium (Cd), in the metal-hyperaccumulating plant Arabidopsis halleri, which uses this heavy metal as herbivore defence. Simulated herbivory elicited enhanced relative allocation of roots to Cd-rich patches as well as enhanced Cd uptake, and these responses were exhibited particularly by plants from non-metalliferous origin, which have lower metal tolerance. By contrast, plants from a metalliferous origin, which are more tolerant to Cd, did not show any preference in root allocation, yet enhanced Cd sharing between ramets when exposed to herbivory. These results suggest that foraging for heavy metals, as well as their uptake and clonal-sharing, could be stimulated in A. halleri by herbivory impact. Our study provides first support for the idea that herbivory can induce not only defence responses in plants but also affect their foraging, resource uptake and clonal sharing responses.

AB  - The astragalus acts as a crucial intermediary in the tarsal joint, facilitating the transfer of body weight to the lower extremities while also ensuring both stability and mobility through its articulation with adjacent bones, enabling efficient movement. This study investigates the morphological diversity of the astragalus in three modern cattle breeds, one goat breed, and three sheep breeds using three-dimensional geometric morphometric methods. A total of 225 specimens were analyzed in this study. Large bovids, such as the Holstein and Simmental cattle breeds, had a more developed lateral edge of the proximal trochlea and a more rounded astragalus. In small bovids, the Akkaraman and Morkaraman sheep breeds displayed a more prominent medial edge and a rounded astragalus form, while the Hair goat breed exhibited a rectangular structure with a well-developed lateral projection. The results of this study demonstrate that the astragalus serves as a reliable morphological marker for differentiating between large and small bovids, as well as between closely related taxa such as sheep and goats. These shape variations, particularly observed in the proximal trochlea, reflect functional adaptations to size, body mass, and locomotor demands, making the astragalus a critical element for taxonomic identification and biomechanical analysis.

AB  - 1. Wildlife translocation is an important conservation tool for restoring species and reducing global biodiversity decline; however, this practice is challenging for wildlife, and translocated individuals must adjust to their release landscapes for restoration success. The period following release is a vulnerable time for wildlife and determining when animals acclimate following translocation improves long-term estimates of population dynamics and allows researchers to efficiently tailor translocation design and post-release management to each population's needs.2. We evaluated demographic acclimation and investigated changes in post-release survival of a population of 106 elk Cervus canadensis translocated to Missouri, USA, in 2011-2013 using generalized survival modelling. We defined the acclimation period as the duration of time prior to stabilization in mortality risk relative to time from release, and we evaluated acclimation duration from flexible plots of estimated mortality hazards across time. We simultaneously investigated factors contributing to post-release survival and compared survival rates and mortality sources observed during acclimation and post-acclimation periods.3. Elevated mortality risk for translocated elk spanned a 5-month acclimation period following release, with an additional 1-year period reflecting reduced, but still elevated, mortality hazards. Baseline hazards during the initial 5-month acclimation period were approximately four times higher than the subsequent 4.4 years following release.4. Release cohort, but not age class or sex, was associated with post-release mortality risk, and mortality sources within the acclimation period tended to be undetermined with greater frequency relative to mortalities occurring after the acclimation period.5. Our results highlight the utility of flexible modelling approaches to evaluate dynamic post-release responses of translocated populations. Translocated elk demonstrated a pronounced demographic acclimation period that spanned 5 months following release. Changes in mortality sources and the timing of stabilization in mortality hazards suggest that demographic acclimation in translocated elk was associated with adjustments in physiological stress and movement rates which stabilized over a similar post-release duration. Improving post-release monitoring and assessment of restored populations by evaluating temporal dynamics of manifold biological and ecological responses as translocated animals acclimate to their new landscapes is vital to successful restoration efforts.

AB  - The late Villafranchian is one of the pivotal timespans in the succession of Pleistocene European faunal assemblages, setting the bases for the major faunal renewal that characterized the continent during the Epivillafranchian. Bison is one of the most important and successful large mammals to spread in Europe at the latest stages of the Early Pleistocene. Here we describe the remains of a large bovid from the late Villafranchian site of Pietrafitta (ca. 1.5 Ma), previously attributed to Leptobos. Our analyses allow to refer this sample to the genus Bison. The primitive characters featured by this sample suggest the attribution to the subgenus Eobison, a long-debated taxon which includes all the earliest forms of Bison. At Pie-trafitta, thus, one of the largest and most complete record of primitive Bison is recorded. The vague diagnosis and confused taxonomic history of Eobison called for a reappraisal of its status. We present a re-definition of the diagnostic characters and a review of the Eurasian record of Eobison with a focus on the late Villafranchian samples from the Mediterranean area. We recognize at least three valid species of Eobison remarking, however, the extreme morphological variability of this group. The comparative analysis of Eobison and its closest relatives (i.e., Leptobos and Bison s.s.), confirms that both the lep-tobovine and bisontine clades underwent to an increase of stoutness of the appendicular skeleton in response to the shrinking of forested habitats and the onset of colder, arid climate during the Pleistocene.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Simple Summary The carbon footprint (CF) is, at present, the most widely used indicator to quantify the impact of livestock farming on global warming, fulfilling also the purpose of identifying production practices that develop more efficient uses of available resources, as well as ways to minimize their environmental impact. The aim of this study was to characterize the CF in the four different production systems of autochthonous dairy goat breeds currently occurring in Andalusia (S Spain), from confined to pastoral systems, also considering the carbon sink ability by vegetation associated with land-based livestock systems. Despite the difficulties of calculation, the relevance of using a species-specific standardization equation and of taking into account land carbon sink ability was demonstrated. The four production systems analyzed obtained similar CF values, all showing room for improvement. This must be translated into the adoption of specific actions for each production system and territory, particularly regarding the improvement of grazing activity, optimal use of farm resources, and appropriate management of manure or the use of local food. Professional advice, training, and the use of specific management tools are essential for the implementation of these strategies to move towards low-carbon goat production.Abstract The small ruminant livestock sector faces the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Carbon footprint (CF) studies on dairy goats, the most widely used indicator to quantify the impact of livestock farming on global warming, are still few. The aim of this study was to calculate the CF of the different production systems of autochthonous dairy goat breeds presently occurring in Andalusia (S Spain) and identify systems and practices that can minimize their environmental impact in these terms. Twenty-one farms were monitored during a year, obtaining valuable information that allowed the CF calculation on a "cradle-to-gate" approach, taking into account both GHG emissions at the farm level and carbon sink by vegetation associated with land-based systems. Results showed similar CF values for the analyzed systems (1.42, 1.04, 1.15, and 1.17 kg CO2-eq kg-1 fat-protein corrected milk for indoor systems without associated crops, indoor systems with associated crops, grazing systems with high feed supply, and pastoral systems, respectively). To minimize their environmental impact, specific actions must be developed for each system, particularly regarding genetic improvement, reproductive and feeding management, including pasture management, and the integration of livestock activity into the bio-circular economy with the help of professional advice.

AB  - The faunal remains from the late Neolithic site of Ness of Brodgar on the Orkney Islands (UK) provide a unique opportunity to investigate past adaptations of animal husbandry strategies to the Northern island environment, as well as the potential management of red deer. In this study, sheep and red deer mandibles and loose teeth (dP(4) & M-3) from the Ness of Brodgar were studied to construct age-at-death profiles, and analysed for delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta O-18. The mortality profile showed that around half of the analysed sheep were slaughtered when they reached maturity (i.e. after 2-4 years of life), consistent with a husbandry regime targeted at meat production. The stable isotope evidence indicates seaweed consumption in winter by several sheep (domesticates), but not by red deer (wild, possibly managed fauna). This dietary difference may have resulted from anthropogenically mediated influences, e.g. restriction of red deer habitats to upland areas. The varying extent of seaweed consumption between individual sheep and between Neolithic Orkney sites suggests differences in sheep husbandry practices across Orkney, indicating that the adaptation to consume seaweed was not ubiquitous on Orkney in the Neolithic, and did not follow a linear development.

AB  - 1. Fear of predators ('fear effects') is an important determinant of foraging decisions by consumers across a range of ecosystems. Group size is one of the main behavioural mechanisms for mitigating fear effects while also providing foraging benefits to group members. Within coral reef ecosystems, fear effects have been shown to influence the feeding rates of herbivorous fishes, a key functional group that prevents macroalgal overgrowth. Yet, how fear effects and group size interact to shape macroalgal removal on coral reefs remains unclear.
   2. Here, we conducted field-based experiments using models of a common piscivorous fish, the leopard coral grouper Plectropomus leopardus and a series of macroalgal Sargassum ilicifolium assays positioned at increasing distances from the models (1, 2, 3 and 4 m) on two coral reefs in Singapore to investigate how acute fear effects shape the intensity of herbivory, and whether these effects were influenced by variation in the group size of herbivorous fishes feeding on the assays.
   3. We found acute fear effects strongly influenced the foraging behaviour of herbivorous fishes over small spatial scales. Rates of Sargassum biomass removal, feeding rates and the total number of individual feeding events were all lower near the predator model. These effects dissipated rapidly with increasing distance from the predator model and were undetectable at a distance of 4 m. We also found generally larger group sizes of herbivorous fishes further from the predator model, presumably reflecting decreased risk. Furthermore, the number of individual bites/event increased significantly with increasing group size for two common browsing fishes, Siganus virgatus and Siganus javus.
   4. Our findings highlight that acute fear effects influence the distribution and intensity of herbivory over small spatial scales. Fear effects also interacted with herbivore group size resulting in changes in the number of individual feeding events and bite rates that collectively shape the realized ecosystem function of macroalgal removal on coral reefs. Group size is an important context-dependent factor that should be considered when examining fear effects on coral reefs.

AB  - In temperate environments, forage availability and quality are known to influence life history traits of wild ungulates. However, variations in foraging strategies of these mountain dwellers with changing plant availability have received little attention. The seasonal vegetation availability in temperate climatic conditions of Kajinag National Park (KNP) was assessed by plot method at different altitudes (1900-3600 m a.s.l.) from 2018 to 2020 on seasonal basis. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of availability of vegetation on seasonal diet composition of Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral) inhabiting the National Park. We recorded 61 plant species whose availability differed significantly across seasons (F-3,F-240 = 20.14, p < 0.05). We found seasonal variation in the diet composition of Himalayan goral depicting a strong relationship between plant consumption and dynamic availability in the study area. Himalayan goral consumed herbs in spring (dominated by Dioscorea deltoidea relative importance value (RIV) = 27.20, Poa pratensis RIV = 14.99 and Themeda spp. RIV = 12.87), grasses in summer (dominated by Themeda spp. RIV = 34.12, P. pratensis RIV = 30.14, Bothriochloa ischaemum RIV = 22.72) and autumn (dominated by Themeda spp. RIV = 34.64, P. pratensis RIV = 30.14, Stipa spp. RIV = 29.73) and shrubs in winter (dominated by Indigofera heterantha RIV = 47.05, Prunus tomentosa RIV = 17.51 and Lonicera spp. RIV = 16.98). The annual diet of Himalayan goral was dominated by graze species (72.66%). The proportion of graze items in the diet showed a sharp decline from spring (90.67%) to winter (19.23%) whereas that of browse showed a huge increment from spring (4.67%) to winter (74.43%). This shift shows a survival or foraging strategy of a temperate ungulate in harsh winters with limited forage availability.

AB  - Research Highlights: The regeneration of Quercus species is usually very difficult in many oak woodlands transformed by livestock farming. Some studies have reported that shrubs can facilitate regeneration. However, the strength of interaction may vary depending on, among other factors, the shrub species and the stress tolerance of the oak species. Moreover, further studies are necessary to clarify the relative importance of the two facilitation mechanisms in the same community. Background and Objectives: Cytisus multiflorus (L'Her.) Sweet is a predominant shrub species in the Mediterranean grazed open-oak-woodlands found in the central west of the Iberian Peninsula (bioclimatic limit) and is present with Quercus pyrenaica Willd and Quercus ilex subsp. ballota Samp trees. Thus, we assessed the effect of these native shrubs and acorn size, and the effect of excluding large herbivores, on the seedling emergence of two contrasting co-occurring Quercus species under a bioclimatic limit. Materials and Methods: A manipulative field experiment was carried out considering four treatments as a combination of shrubs (shrub/no-shrub) and fence (fenced/open) factors. A total of twenty plots, five replicates for each treatment were available. In each plot, 20 acorns were sown: 10 acorns (5 small and 5 large) for each Quercus species. Acorn emergence was recorded during the first four years following the sowing. Results: Seedling emergence took place mostly in the spring of the first year after sowing. The presence of shrub was the main significant factor and incremented the emergence of both Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica. The effect of the fence depended on the Quercus species considered, improving only the emergence of Q. pyrenaica. A negative effect with the small acorns was detected but only for Q. pyrenaica. In all treatments, Q. ilex emerged more than Q. pyrenaica. Conclusions: C. multiflorus had a clear facilitative effect on the seedling emergence of Q. ilex and Q. pyrenaica, which was much greater than the physical effect that acorn size and excluding large herbivores had. As such, this native shrub may have a key role in oak regeneration in Mediterranean grazed areas. Furthermore, in these areas of contact between marcescent and sclerophyllous Quercus species, Q. ilex currently emerges more than Q. pyrenaica. This could be indicative of a shift towards more xeric climatic conditions, which could lead to a change in the dominant tree species in the future. However, this change could be modulated by the effects of native shrub and large herbivores.

AB  - Fossil remains of Gymnogyps californianus (California Condor) from Mule Ears Peak Cave, Big Bend National Park, Texas, recovered in the 1930s were reexamined to determine a precise age for nesting condors in this region. Bones of at least 6 prefledged chicks account for most (15, or 65%) of the 23 skeletal elements from this cave and a new osteology collection of known-age condor chicks at the U.S. National Museum, Division of Birds, now allows accurate estimate of the age of death of these fossil condor chicks based on their bone development and porosity. Current and previous radiocarbon dates on juvenile and adult bones, respectively, indicate the presence of condors at this site beginning at similar to 15,000 calendar years before present (cal yrs BP), with definite nesting occurring at similar to 13,000 cal yrs BP. Stable isotope analysis (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of bone collagen on 2 bones of adult condors reflects a diet similar to other fossil condors previously analyzed from the inland western U.S. The delta C-13 values in the Mule Ears Peak condors indicate a diet of megafauna that subsisted on C-4 plants in a desert grassland ecosystem. These results support the hypothesis that condors were extirpated from the inland west with the loss of megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene. Further, Big Bend National Park with its vast open space and cliffs and canyons for nesting condors should be considered as an additional release site for captive-reared condors as part of the current Condor Recovery Program.

AB  - Conventional distance sampling is a logistically feasible method for estimating densities of unmarked animals. The probability density function (PDF) of the sampling area specifies the expected proportion of the population that occurs at each distance from the observer and is a fundamental component of distance sampling models. Current approaches set this PDF either to equal probability at each distance, for line transects, or an increasing probability for point transects (because sampling area increases with radial distance from a point). Geographic Information Systems allow measurements of the area viewable from a given location (i.e. the viewshed), the structure of which may not reflect theoretical PDFs for either line (rectangular) or point (circular) transects. We simulated three datasets to test how variation in the viewshed structure affects estimates of detection probability, abundance, and density. We then implemented a novel application of Bayesian distance sampling models to test the magnitude of parameter bias recovered by accounting for incomplete viewsheds. Lastly, we compared parameter estimates from Bayesian hierarchical models that used either traditional or custom PDFs to analyse a dataset of 95 county-level spotlight surveys of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Iowa, USA. For empirical data, viewable sampling area decreased with distance at an average rate of 3% every 100 m (range from 1% to 7% among counties). Our model correction decreased county-level density estimates by an average of 18% (range from 13% to 27% among counties), which depended on how sharply visibility declined. We suggest incomplete viewsheds be handled by considering the expected distribution of animals inside and outside of the viewshed. More generally, we show that customizing a PDF to more accurately reflect the study system improves density estimates and offers flexibility when the distribution of animals from the observer deviates from traditional assumptions.

AB  - Tree size often predicts the occurrence of bark beetles that breed in the inner bark (phloem) of trees. A notable example is mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, which primarily kills large, old trees during out-breaks. The tree mortality pattern is often attributed to increasing phloem thickness with tree size, although tree size-dependent defences may also be important. Age effects may confound interpretations of tree size effects. We examined phloem and anatomical defence traits in single-cohort lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta, stands as a function of tree size and age within and across young mature stands (trees 25-45 years old) and old stands (115-140 years old). Phloem thickness increased linearly with tree size within and across stands, more strongly for trees in young stands that had thicker phloem than same-sized trees in old stands. Phloem nitrogen was greater in young stands and did not vary with tree size. Resin duct investment was generally greater in larger trees within stands, but young trees had more and larger ducts than old trees. These results are consistent with canopy dominance of larger trees within stands that can acquire more carbon for both growth and defence; relationships between tree size and both phloem and defence traits were weaker across stands of different ages. Greater defence in young trees may reflect greater risk and costs of herbivory that might be associated with higher phloem nitrogen in younger stands. Our results suggest that the best phloem resources (quantity and quality) are found in relatively large trees in young stands, which is a poor match for the pattern of attacks by mountain pine beetles that favour large trees in old stands. Lower defences in old stands may also explain the pattern of tree mortality by beetles. Other benefits of large trees merit more attention in understanding the importance of tree size to bark beetles.

AB  - The South American Pleistocene-Holocene transition has been characterized by drastic climatic and diversity changes. These rapid changes induced one of the largest and most recent extinctions in the megafauna at the continental scale. However, examples of the extinction of small animals (e.g., insects) are scarce, and the underlying causes of the extinction have been little studied. In this work, a new extinct dung beetle species is described from a late Pleistocene sequence (similar to 15.2 k cal yr BP) at the paleoarcheological site Pilauco, Chilean Northern Patagonia. Based on morphological characters, this fossil is considered to belong to the genus Onthophagus Latreille, 1802 and named Onthophagus pilauco sp. nov. We carried out a comprehensive revision of related groups, and we analyzed the possible mechanism of diversification and extinction of this new species. We hypothesize that Onthophagus pilauco sp. nov. diversified as a member of the osculatii species-complex following migration processes related to the Great American Biotic Interchange (similar to 3 Ma). The extinction of O. pilauco sp. nov. may be related to massive defaunation and climatic changes recorded in the Plesitocene-Holocene transition (12.8 k cal yr BP). This finding is the first record of this genus in Chile, and provides new evidence to support the collateral-extinction hypothesis related to the defaunation.

AB  - Migration schedules and the timing of other annual events (e.g., pair formation and molt) can affect the distribution of genetic diversity as much as where these events occur. The greater white-fronted goose (Anser albifrons) is a circumpolar goose species, exhibiting temporal and spatial variation of events among populations during the annual cycle. Previous range-wide genetic assessments of the nuclear genome based on eight microsatellite loci suggest a single, largely panmictic population despite up to five subspecies currently recognized based on phenotypic differences. We used double digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD-seq) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data to re-evaluate estimates of spatial genomic structure and to characterize how past and present processes have shaped the patterns of genetic diversity and connectivity across the Arctic and subarctic. We uncovered previously undetected inter-population differentiation with genetic clusters corresponding to sampling locales associated with current management groups. We further observed subtle genetic clustering within each management unit that can be at least partially explained by the timing and directionality of migration events along with other behaviors during the annual cycle. The Tule Goose (A. a. elgasi) and Greenland subspecies (A. a. flavirostris) showed the highest level of divergence among all sampling locales investigated. The recovery of previously undetected broad and fine-scale spatial structure suggests that the strong cultural transmission of migratory behavior restricts gene flow across portions of the species' range. Our data further highlight the importance of re-evaluating previous assessments conducted based on a small number of highly variable genetic markers in phenotypically diverse species.

AB  - (1) Background: Beetles in the superfamily Scarabaeoidea are one of the most important groups of Coleoptera. They are found in various ecosystems all over the world and belong to coprophagous, necrophagous, saproxylophagous, phyllophagous and rhizophagous types. The aim of the study is to describe the fauna and distribution of Scarabaeoidea in the Republic of Mordovia (central part of European Russia); (2) Methods: The study was conducted from 2003 to 2023. Collection material (specimens from 1972 and 1986) was also used. Specimens were collected using traditional Coleoptera collecting methods (manual collecting, light trap, collection of rotten remains and pitfall traps). For each observation, the coordinates, number of specimens and dates were recorded; (3) Results: The dataset contains 3198 occurrences. We examined 11,011 specimens of Scarabaeoidea. The dataset contains information on 88 species of Scarabaeoidea. Of these, five species (Aphodius pedellus, Nobius serotinus, Phaeaphodius rectus, Planolinus fasciatus and Onthophagus medius) are listed for the region for the first time. Another seven species are additionally known from others taken from the literature (but were not found during the present field survey); (4) Conclusions: Species diversity of Scarabaeoidea of Mordovia accounts for 95 species from 4 families (Geotrupidae, Trogidae, Lucanidae and Scarabaeidae). Ten species (Protaetia marmorata, Anoplotrupes stercorosus, Cetonia aurata, Protaetia cuprea volhyniensis, Oxythyrea funesta, Platycerus caraboides, Serica brunnea, Melolontha hippocastani, Trichius fasciatus and Protaetia fieberi) constitute the main population of Scarabaeoidea fauna given in the dataset. The species diversity of Scarabaeoidea of the Republic of Mordovia is roughly similar in number of species to that of neighboring or more northern regions.

AB  - Long-term use of organic and inorganic fertilizers can have a negative impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient stoichiometry in paddy soil. However, production of sufficient crops to meet food and feed demands globally requires the use of fertilizer in crop production. In the present study, we assessed the environmental impacts of five fertilizer treatments in a rice-rice-fallow cropping system: no fertilizer (CK); inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers (NPK); manure (M); inorganic phosphorus and potassium fertilizers with manure (PKM); and inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers with manure (NPKM). Soil parameters were analyzed to examine the relationships between GHG emissions, net ecosystem carbon budgets (NECBs), and soil nutrient stoichiometric ratios. Both the PKM and NPKM treatments increased grain yield and the soil carbon-nitrogen (C:N), carbon-phosphorus (C:P), and nitrogen-phosphorus (N:P) ratios compared to the CK treatment; they also decreased the nitrogen-potassium (N:K) ratio. In the combined fertilization treatments, the fallow season accounted for 9-13% of annual methane (CH4) emissions, whereas early rice accounted for 55-62 % and late rice contributed 38-45 %. Compared to the CK, PKM and NPKM fertilization increased the annual nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 52-73 % and 103-115 %, respectively, in both the rice and fallow seasons. In early rice, the C:P ratio and GHG intensity (GHGI) were negatively correlated with CH4 and N2O emissions, whereas both yield and CH4 emissions had strong positive associations with global warming potential (GWP). In the late rice season, GHGI was negatively correlated with carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 emissions, and N2O had strong positive associations with GWP. CO2 and N2O emission levels were greater from late rice than from early rice, although CH4 emissions from early rice contributed more to the annual GWP, resulting in higher carbon equivalent emissions but a lower carbon efficiency ratio in early rice output. A Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) optimization analysis suggested that PKM was the best fertilization method to improve yield while minimizing negative environmental impacts, followed in descending order by the NPKM, NPK, and M treatments.

AB  - Female density and distribution are dependent on resource phenology and female availability strongly influences male mating behaviour and success. When a male adopts a 'resource defence' tactic, his reproductive success depends on the location and attractiveness of his territory. Environmental factors associated with territory quality are expected to influence mating success, for example, through territory features or male-male competition. In a protected population of a mountain-dwelling polygynous herbivore, the Alpine chamois Rupicapra r. rupicapra, we investigated the relationships among mating opportunities, some environmental variables (snow depth, topographic features and size of territories) and male intra-sexual competition for mating. We recorded the mating behaviour and territory size of 15 GPS-GSM radio-tagged territorial males, during five rutting seasons (early November to early December: N = 8 individuals in 2011, N = 9 in 2012, N = 8 in 2015, N = 11 in 2016, N = 7 in 2017; 80% of them were observed for more than one mating season) and related them to snow depth and topography of territories. In ruts with deep snow cover, territorial males had smaller territories and higher number of mating opportunities than in ruts with lower snow cover. Smaller territories showed the highest values of terrain roughness, in turn with little or no snow cover in the mating season, and were visited by a greater number of females, than larger territories. Number of wins was positively influenced by snow depth and negatively related to the frequency of aggressions. The frequency of male-male aggressive interactions was greater during ruts with deep snow cover and for males with territories at higher elevations; additionally, it was negatively related to interactions won. Thus, snow depth, which influences resource distribution and female movements, is confirmed as a strong determinant of male mating opportunities and mating behaviour.

AB  - Learning about past biological interactions is possible thanks to the study of trace fossils, such as coprolites found in archaeological sites. The multiproxy analysis of coprolites may provide evidence of direct and indirect consumption of diet items and thus reconstructing the ecological dynamics of past ecosystems. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of the content of plant fragments, pollen and silica phytoliths in coprolites found in the archaeological site Cerro Casa de Piedra 5 (47 degrees 57'S; 72 degrees 05'W), located in the Perito Moreno National Park, Santa Cruz, Argentina, in an archaeological layer dated to 6540 +/- 110 years C-14 BP (7402 cal years BP), with the aim to recognize dietary habits in those times. According to their morphological features and content, the coprolites were assigned to omnivores (humans/canids) and herbivores (camelids). The multiproxy analysis of these coprolites allowed us to reach a higher taxonomic resolution in the identification of some plant items in the diet, to make inferences on the indirect consumption of vegetation through the consumption of stomachs and other viscera of camelids by omnivores, and to observe similarities and complementarities in terms of the presence and abundance of taxa. The limitations and potentialities of multiproxy analysis to infer past dietary habits are discussed. The information obtained provides greater knowledge about the predator-prey interactions of the Middle Holocene in south-western Patagonia.

AB  - Seahorses are small sedentary fish considered flagship species of the conservation efforts. They are particularly vulnerable to human pressures because inhabiting threatened coastal ecosystems. Indeed, the worldwide decline of local populations in the last decades led to the inclusion of all seahorse species on the IUCN Red List, where most species, including Hippocampus guttulatus, were classified as ''Data Deficient'' on a global level due to the lack of relative data on several biological and ecological traits. Because of such sensitive conservation status, improvement of the current knowledge on the diet composition of wild animals and its differences among habitats could be of great importance as it could help understanding the way the environment is exploited. In the present study, we used a non-invasive DNA metabarcoding technique to further elucidate long-snouted seahorse diet and expand our understanding of prey choice among different habitats. We identified 24 families, 22 genera and 26 species, and according to the results, most of the seahorse samples contained taxa such as Amphipoda, Decapoda, Isopoda, and Mysida. Several non-native species were discovered in the diet, suggesting their dietary incorporation that could mirror high anthropogenic impacts and habitat modifications. We found significant differences in the diet composition among investigated habitats, thus indicating trophic flexibility of H. guttulatus among diverse habitats, a characteristic that may be essential for the resilience of this iconic yet sensitive species.

AB  - Surface waters are warming due to climate change, potentially pushing aquatic organisms closer to their thermal tolerance limits. However, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to occur more often with rising temperature, increasing the likelihood of poor-quality food available for herbivorous zooplankton. Zooplankton can adapt locally by genetic differentiation or via adaptive phenotypic plasticity to increasing temperatures, but there is limited knowledge on how these processes may be affected by food quality limitation imposed by cyanobacteria. To test the effects of cyanobacteria-mediated food quality on local temperature adaptation, we measured juvenile somatic growth and reproduction of five Daphnia magna clones from different latitudinal origin grown on three food qualities at 20, 24, and 28 degrees C. Additionally we estimated short-term heat tolerance, measured as knockout time (time to immobility) at lethally high temperature, of two clones acclimated to the three temperatures and two food quality levels to test for the effects of food quality on adaptive plastic responses. As expected, clones from lower latitudes showed on average better somatic growth and reproduction than clones from higher latitudes at higher temperatures. However, the difference in somatic growth diminished with increasing cyanobacteria abundance in the diet, suggesting constraints on local genetic adaptation under predicted decreases in food quality. As expected, short-term heat tolerance of the clones generally increased with increasing acclimation temperature. However, heat tolerance of animals acclimated to the highest temperature was larger when grown at medium than at good food quality, whereas the opposite response was observed for animals acclimated to the lowest temperature. This suggests a better adaptive phenotypic response of animals to elevated temperatures under higher cyanobacteria abundance, and thus shows an opposite pattern to the results for somatic growth. Overall, we demonstrate that food quality limitation can mediate responses of D. magna life history traits and heat tolerance to increasing temperatures, and that the effects differ depending on the time scale studied, that is, mid-term (somatic growth) versus short-term (tolerance to acute heat stress). These aspects will need further attention to accurately predict of how organisms will cope with future global warming by local adaptation and adaptive phenotypic plasticity.

AB  - Simple Summary Scrapie is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy affecting sheep and goats. Due to similarities with mad cow disease (BSE) which is transmissible to humans, scrapie is considered of significance for its theoretical zoonotic potential. A variety of control strategies have been proposed and applied over the years. While herd depopulation, culling of affected susceptible animals, and disinfection measures are poorly successful, selective breeding schemes focused on amino acid substitutions (polymorphisms) in prion protein (PrP) would be the best way for eradication. In sheep, the association between PrP gene polymorphism argininine on codon 171 is highly effective for scrapie resistance breeding. Although in goats this polymorphism is absent, three other candidate PrP amino acid polymorphisms have been recognized for resistance breeding. For Greece with the largest goat population in Europe, the frequencies of these polymorphisms has yet to be sufficiently documented. This study performed a large-scale, cross-sectional survey for a large part of the country, regarding PrP polymorphic codons 110, 146, 211, and 222, and estimated effects of these polymorphisms on (i) the likelihood to be infected by scrapie, and (ii) scrapie status at the herd level, revealing possible candidate PrP amino acid polymorphisms to be used in breeding for scrapie-resistance programs. Scrapie is considered an endemic disease in both sheep and goats in Greece. However, contrary to sheep, in goats more than one prion protein (PrP) polymorphism has been recognized as a candidate for resistance breeding against the disease. For an impression, candidates which are circulating, (i) brain samples (n = 525) from scrapie-affected (n = 282) and non-affected (n = 243) animals within the national surveillance program, and (ii) individual blood samples (n = 1708) from affected (n = 241) and non-affected (n = 1467) herds, in a large part of mainland Greece and its islands, were collected and assayed. A dedicated Taqman method was used to test for amino acid polymorphisms 110T/P, 146N/S/D, 211R/Q, and 222Q/K. Highly prevalent genotypes were 110TT, 146NN, 211RR, and 222QQ. The frequencies of polymorphisms in blood and negative brain samples for codons 110P, 211Q, and 222K were 4.0%, 3.0%, and 1.9%, respectively, while 146D (0.7%) was present only on Karpathos island. Codon 110P was exclusively found in scrapie-negative brains, and homozygous 110P/P in two scrapie-negative goats. It is concluded that breeding programs in Karpathos could focus on codon 146D, while in other regions carriers of the 110P and 222K allele should be sought. Case-control and challenge studies are now necessary to elucidate the most efficient breeding strategies.

AB  - PurposeTick diversity in Algeria has garnered increasing interest due to its implications for animal health and zoonotic diseases. Recent reports of abnormal ulcerative lesions in goats and sheep in the Cheria region of northeastern Algeria have raised concerns about a potential association with tick infestations. The aim of this study is to hypothesize the potential involvement of ticks in these unusual lesions.Materials and methodsA total of 52 tick specimens were collected from the affected animals, comprising 24 adult males, 24 adult females, and four engorged females. A morphological examination was performed to identify the tick species.ResultsThe morphological analysis identified the non-engorged ticks as Rhipicephalus fulvus. The observed ulcerative lesions were likely caused by reactions to the tick's saliva. Notably, this finding marks the first recorded presence of R. fulvus in Algeria since its original description by Neumann in 1913.ConclusionIdentifying R. fulvus highlights its reemergence in the region and suggests a potential impact on livestock health. This discovery underscores the need for enhanced tick surveillance and further studies to understand the tick's origin, distribution, and role in animal health.

AB  - Aggregation behavior is pervasive across a broad range of animals and the outcome of this behaviour has both risks and rewards. Large aggregations of animals are a distinctive characteristic of migratory caribou ( Rangifer tarandus (Linnaeus, 1758)), primarily in response to the environment factors such as predation, although caribou may also aggregate during high summer temperatures, likely in an effort to mitigate parasitic biting flies. To see if caribou in the Cape Churchill Caribou Herd of the Eastern Migratory caribou ( Rangifer tarandus groenlandicus (Borowski, 1780)) Designatible Unit, also displayed aggregation behavior in relation to warmer summer temperatures, we collected trail camera photos with associated temperature readings during the summer period (May to September) from 2017 to 2020 in their summer range in Wapusk National Park, Manitoba, Canada. We found that summer caribou aggregation size was positively associated with ambient temperature, with aggregations increasing in size as temperature increased. The mechanism behind this behaviour should be investigated, as we predict more frequent and large caribou aggregations as summer temperatures continue to warm.

AB  - Here, we provide an overview on Reeves' muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) in Austria, a deer species originating from southeastern China and introduced to Europe at the end of the 19(th) century. Muntiacus reevesi is currently established in several countries of the European mainland and the British Isles, and was included in the list of invasive alien species of Union concern, due to its potential detrimental impacts, such as feeding damage, competition, and car accidents. In Austria three confirmed observations of Reeves' muntjac in the wild were reported, in the federal states Salzburg, Upper Austria and Styria. All observations were made between 2016 and 2022 and were of single individuals that had likely escaped from captivity. Most recently, in April 2022 in Upper Austria a male individual has been observed for several days and was captured thereafter. Although to date there is no evidence of persistent populations in the wild, we argue that future establishment of the species in Austria is possible due to several factors. Those include the ongoing spread of Reeves' muntjac in several countries of the European mainland, its elusive lifestyle and low detectability in initial invasion stages, as well as its ability to thrive from very small founding populations. In the light of the precautionary principle, we advocate for careful monitoring and rapid reaction while still feasible.

AB  - Human activities have a detrimental impact on ecosystems. Despite the awareness of their advantages, their effective management is seldom implemented, leading to a conflict between humans and diverse natural ecosystems. In this context, the community's silvopastoral activities in the Paramo del Almorzadero (Santander, Colombia) have suffered various attacks on sheep and goats due to the alleged presence of a feline. To confirm such information, we met virtually and face -to -face with the community and collected biological data from where the attacks happened. From the analysis of all the information obtained, we found that no feline had been seen except in the person-to-person accounts and that the attacks were by domestic dogs. This is not unrelated to situations in other areas of the country explained by the increasing closeness of man and dog, which results in overlooking the responsibility implied in the possession of these domestic animals.

AB  - Tetracycline is an antibiotic with extensive veterinary use in the livestock industry. However, their widespread application poses risks to soil health as residue in livestock feces, and their removal is crucial for sustainable soilecosystem development. Physical and chemical approaches to extract tetracycline may have adverse effects on soil ecosystems, but no studies have thus far examined the potential for biological methods, such as collective degradation action of soil fauna. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and earthworms (Eisenia fetida) on biodegradation of tetracycline residues in sheep manure. We assessed earthworm biomass, tetracycline residue, and bacterial communities in both earthworm intestines and vermicompost. Earthworm biomass and tetracycline degradation efficiency increased significantly with LAB addition, with a degradation rate of up to 80.16%. This increase may be attributable to LAB acting as electron donors to spur tetracycline degradation. Additionally, we noted that tetracycline presence significantly influenced bacterial communities in earthworm intestines and vermicompost, elevating the abundance of potential pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Flavobacterium, Gammaproteobacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae). This finding suggests that heightened environmental stress from antibiotics could actually facilitate the growth of less prevalent bacteria, including potential pathogens. In conclusion, our study provides evidence supporting the effectiveness of LAB and earthworms in degrading tetracycline residues. In particular, LAB appears to mitigate stress from tetracycline exposure in earthworms, thus increasing their vermicomposting efficacy. Our work has important implications for soil management, with the potential to enhance pollution clean-up rates while minimizing negative side-effects to soil microbial communities.

AB  - Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most concerned food-borne mycotoxins in the global agricultural field, mainly produced by Fusarium. This study investigates the role of microbial communities in organic fertilization for DON degradation and the impact of DON on these microorganisms during the degradation process. Eight diverse fertilizer samples including earthworm farms (expE1, expE2), horse farms (expH), cattle farms (expC), sheep farms (expS1, expS2), chicken farms (expG), and pig farms (expP), were collected. Following co-incubation with 100 mu g/mL DON at 30 degrees C and 130 rpm for 96 h, expC and expP samples exhibited significant DON degradation rates of 93.3% and 74.9%, respectively. DON was confirmed to be transformed into de-epoxy DON in expC. The study also examined the impact of DON on bacterial flora using 16S rDNA flux sequencing. The diversity of bacterial communities was affected in both expC and expP. This study provides valuable insights into the utilization of organic fertilization and fermentation technology for DON degradation, along with the impact of DON on microbial communities within fertilizers.

AB  - Mineral requirements are poorly described for most wildlife. Consequently, the role of forage minerals in movement and productivity are poorly understood for sedentary and migratory ungulates, such as reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). We applied estimates of maintenance, lactation, body mass change, and antler growth to production curves (body mass, daily intake, and milk yield) for female caribou to calculate their mineral requirements over summer. The total requirements (mg or g<middle dot>d(-1)) were divided by the daily intake (kg<middle dot>d(-1)) to estimate the minimum concentration of minerals required in the diet (mg or g<middle dot>kg(-1)) to balance demand. The daily requirements (mg<middle dot>d(-1)) of all minerals increased from parturition to the end of summer. The minimum dietary concentrations (mg<middle dot>kg(-1)) of macro-minerals (Ca, P, Mg, Na, K) declined as food intake (kg<middle dot>d(-1)) increased over summer. The minimum dietary concentrations (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn) were heavily influenced by body mass gain, which increased through late lactation even though food intakes rose. Our modeling framework can be applied to other wild ungulates to assess the impacts of changing forage phenology, plant community compositions, or environmental disturbances on movement and productivity.

AB  - In nature, most parasitoids attack more than one host species, and nearly all hosts are attacked by several species of parasitoids. This opens many potential opportunities for association networks in invaded communities. Despite this, few studies have examined the direct and indirect impacts of biological invasion on parasitoid-host associations. This review examines what is known of these relationships from the most recent literature and suggests future research priorities. We conclude that parasitoid-host association networks in invaded communities are complex, dynamic, and subject to trophic intrusions from invasive plants, herbivores, plant pathogens, parasitoids, and hyperparasitoids. Future studies should take a holistic systems approach to understanding the impact of biological invasion and its consequences in shaping community structure through altering existing native, coevolved parasitoid-host association networks.

AB  - This study investigates the faunal assemblage from excavations in Podersdorf am See (easternmost Austria) dating between the 4th and 6th century AD. The site is located in a flat area east of Lake Neusiedl (Hungarian: Ferto to), surrounded by numerous (palaeo-)lake depressions and comprises remains of small-scale rural installations from three phases between the 2nd and 13th century AD. In contrast with previous studies, which focus on urban sites or villae rusticace, Podersdorf offers the opportunity to examine the Late Antiquity period of transition at a peripheral, small-scale, rural site. In total, 904 animal bones were investigated. Although several features hint at a rural site of producers, such as the dominance of female sheep/goats there are, also indications for animal imports, including a high number of male/castrated cattle and pigs along with the presence of three different cattle morphotypes. Age and sex profiles of the main domesticated species (cattle, sheep/goats and pigs) show a slight emphasis on meat consumption. Chop and cut marks on horse and dog bones indicate cynophagy and hippophagy. Compared with contemporaneous sites in north-eastern Austria, Podersdorf has the highest NISP number of wild mammals, the second highest number of horses, and the second highest number of birds.

AB  - Suboptimal culture conditions during in vitro maturation (IVM) affect oocyte developmental competence and the viability of the resulting embryo. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems provide a more biologically appropriate environment compared to traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of liquid marble (LM) microbioreactors as a 3D culture system on IVM and the subsequent embryo development of prepubertal goat oocytes. The cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) recovered from prepubertal goat ovaries underwent IVM in drops under oil (the 2D system and the control group) and in the 3D LM system (the LM group). After IVM, oocytes were parthenogenetically activated and cultured until the blastocyst stage. The control and LM groups showed similar rates of nuclear maturation (52.17% and 44.12%) and blastocyst formation (10.64% and 10.10%). Reactive oxygen species and glutathione levels and the density of transzonal projections (TZPs) in oocytes did not differ between groups. The LM system increased mitochondrial activity and modified the organization of these organelles in the oocyte cytoplasm compared to the control group. The LM microbioreactor demonstrated the ability to improve the mitochondrial status of the oocytes and was not harmful for oocyte IVM and subsequent embryo development. Therefore, LM could be used as a 3D cost-effective culture system for the IVM of prepubertal goat oocytes.

AB  - Climate and agricultural land-use change has increased the likelihood of infectious disease emergence and transmissions, but these drivers are often examined separately as combined effects are ignored. Further, seldom are the influence of climate and agricultural land use on emerging infectious diseases examined in a spatially explicit way at regional scales. Our objective in this study was to spatially examine the climate, agriculture, and socio-demographic factors related to agro-pastoralism, and especially the combined effects of these variables that can influence the prevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in dromedary camels across northern Kenya. Our research questions focused on: (1) How MERS-CoV in dromedary camels has varied across geographic regions of northern Kenya, and (2) what climate, agriculture, and socio-demographic factors of agro-pastoralism were spatially related to the geographic variation of MERS-CoV cases in dromedary camels. To answer our questions, we analyzed the spatial distribution of historical cases based on serological evidence of MERS-CoV at the county level and applied spatial statistical analysis to examine the spatial relationships of the MERS-CoV cases between 2016 and 2018 to climate, agriculture, and socio-demographic factors of agro-pastoralism. Regional differences in MERS-CoV cases were spatially correlated with both social and environmental factors, and particularly ethno-religious camel practices, which highlight the complexity in the distribution of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels across Kenya.

AB  - Our evolving understanding of ecosystem functioning along with the advent of computational power have paved the way for the development of complex mathematical models that explicitly represent the functional diversity of biotic communities and multiple biogeochemical cycles. The ever-growing demand for more complex models underscores the importance of robust sensitivity analysis (SA) to elucidate the impact of the uncertainty on model inputs and to untangle the parameter covariance patterns that ultimately lead to the emergence of equifinality problems. In this study, we propose a novel multi-pronged SA framework that integrates advanced statistical and machine learning (ML) techniques. Principal component analysis (PCA) is first applied to dissect the wide array of predictive outputs and identify modes of variability in time and/or space. Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis is then used to identify a set of splitting decisions connecting threshold values of key state variables and model parameters with different ranges of predictive outputs with management interest. Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are implemented as a final step to unravel any non-linear associations between model parameters and responses. As a proof-of-concept, we used a complex aquatic biogeochemical model developed for the Bay of Quinte, a eutrophic embayment in Lake Ontario, to examine competition patterns and structural shifts among multiple functional phytoplankton (diatoms, N-fixing cyanobacteria, and Microcystis) and zooplankton (herbivores and omnivores) groups. Our sensitivity analysis framework showed that the parameters representing the dependence of growth and metabolic processes on temperature are particularly influential to recreate plankton community dynamics during the cold period of the year, whereas the interplay among the interspecific resource competition, strength of the prey-predator interactions, and phosphorus availability mainly regulate their dynamics during the growing season. The growth strategies of diatoms, their nutritional quality that determines the assimilation efficiency by zooplankton, along with the ambient nutrient availability deter-mine our capacity to reproduce patterns of cyanobacteria dominance and faithfully depict the severity of harmful algal blooms. Finally, our study discusses the benefits of a broader use of the ML-based SA framework to unravel influential parametric interactions in modulating the behaviors of complex mathematical models.

AB  - Grazing birds like geese can have a big impact on agricultural land, potentially causing damage to crops. Their exploitation of agricultural land varies within and between seasons, and these temporal grazing patterns can be influenced by management. Furthermore, management practices using scaring and accommodation aim to influence local grazing pressures. To achieve efficient goose management we need a good understanding of the effects of timing and intensity of grazing on grass development and subsequent yield loss. We performed an exclosure study on twelve fields in Friesland (Frysla<SIC>n), the Netherlands to study the effect of grazing on grass development and potential yield loss. Grazing was prevented either from November or from early April until farmers anticipated their first harvest. Every two weeks we measured grass height and calculated growth in exclosures and in ungrazed plots, and performed dropping counts. The results show that the difference in grass height between grazed and ungrazed plots increases with grazing pressure, but less so for higher grazing pressures. We also find that both winter and spring grazing can result in a larger difference in grass height between grazed and ungrazed plots, and grazing into the growing season delays the start of grass growth. This appears due to the relationship between grass height and growth rate. Because the optimal height for growth increases over the season, spring grazing has a much larger impact on grassland yields than winter grazing. Overall these results show that the amount of yield loss depends on different aspects of grazing, most prominently the recovery time, duration and grazing intensity. We hypothesize that barnacle geese may select fields with denser swards and may stimulate sward density by frequent grazing throughout winter and early spring as well as across consecutive years. Future studies should look into the effect of harvest delays and sward density on the size and quality of yield across the season and especially at the last cut. Management with scaring and accommodation may be able to reduce overall yield losses, but the effect may depend on the timing and location of scaring.

AB  - 1. Insect herbivory can affect interactions between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi through herbivore-modified root carbon pools, while the specific metabolic changes underlying fungal responses to herbivory are poorly understood.
   2. Here we explored the impacts of foliar herbivory and mechanical wounding on AM colonisation and AM community composition of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) and the role of root metabolites in mediating these effects.
   3. Foliar insect herbivory enhanced AM colonisation, whereas mechanical wounding only enhanced AM colonisation in combination with application of caterpillar oral secretions. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of Glomus species was increased in root endosphere, rhizoplane and rhizosphere soils after foliar herbivory. Foliar herbivory also increased the concentrations of fatty acids in roots but decreased phenolics, and their concentrations were significantly correlated with AM colonisation. Addition of exudates from plants exposed to herbivory resulted in increases in AM colonisation of plants without herbivory. Moreover, widely targeted metabolomic analyses revealed that foliar herbivory enhanced the relative abundance of lipids and decreased phenols in root exudates.
   4. Synthesis. We show that plants can enhance their associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi when subject to above-ground herbivory, possibly mediated by herbivore-induced increases in the levels of root lipids. Our findings highlight the role of root lipids in above-below-ground biological interactions, providing novel insights into plant-AM fungi integrative responses to biotic stresses.

AB  - Funding for rare plant conservation is limited. In addition, many aspects of the biology and ecology of rare plants are unknown. Therefore, low-cost data generation approaches to fill these gaps should be pursued. Herbarium specimens can be used as a low-cost alternative to learn about the basic biology and ecology of rare plant species. The information provided on herbarium labels has dramatically increased in recent decades to include precise locality (i.e., latitude/longitude), exact dates, habitat, associated species, and substrate. In addition, herbarium specimens are being digitized and the resulting images and data are available via clearinghouses such as GBIF and SEINet. Already, herbarium specimens of rare plants have been used to develop habitat suitability models, predict range shifts, and assess changes in flower phenology due to climate change. Herbarium specimens can also provide a wealth of information about the reproductive biology and biotic interactions of rare plants. In this paper, we will demonstrate how this information can be accessed and present a practical application for using this information to populate an important federal listing document in the USA, Species Status Assessments (SSA). We will provide examples from the literature, as well as case studies from our own research, to demonstrate how this information can be collected from herbarium specimens and how and where to incorporate this information into SSAs. More generally, data gleaned from herbarium specimens can become part of a conservationist's tool kit to further our knowledge of past, present, and future trends for rare plants. Additional knowledge of a species' biology and ecology allows land managers and conservationists to make more informed decisions and allows for greater protection of listed species.

AB  - Identifying sources, transfer, conversion and retention of diet sources in consumers of aquatic and terrestrial food webs is essential to understand how dietary nutrients are conveyed within and across ecosystems. Here we review current knowledge of trophic biomarkers and introduce state-of-the-art research of diet tracers. In addition to commonly used bulk stable isotopes we synthesise how lipids and their fatty acids are used as diet tracers in aquatic and terrestrial food webs and pay particular attention to recently developed compound-specific stable isotopes of fatty acids and show how carbon and hydrogen stable isotopes of fatty acids can be applied to answer questions of ecosystem-specific diet sources and endogenous conversion of ingested fatty acids. We provide examples of organisms in aquatic food webs and present data showing that hydrogen stable isotopes of fatty acids (d2HFA) vary much more strongly than their carbon stable isotopes (d13CFA), indicating that d2HFA values are more sensitive to environmental and ecophysiological changes than d13CFA values. This chapter covers examples of diet tracers in aquatic and terrestrial food webs and finishes with perspectives on diet source characterisation using fatty acids and stable isotopes, and a combination thereof of terrestrial, aquatic and avian food webs.

AB  - The effects of environmental change on zooplankton communities, and more broadly, pelagic ecosystems are difficult to predict due to the high diversity of ecological strategies and complex interspecific interactions within the zooplankton. Trait-based approaches can define zooplankton functional groups with distinct responses to environmental change. Analyses across multiple mesozooplankton groups can help identify key organizing traits. Here, we use the pronounced cross-shore environmental gradient within the California Current Ecosystem in a space-for-time substitution to test potential effects of ocean warming and increased stratification on zooplankton communities. Along a horizontal gradient in sea-surface temperature, water column stratification, and light attenuation, we test whether there are changes in zooplankton species composition, trait composition, and vertical habitat use. We employ DNA metabarcoding at two loci (18S-V4 and COI) and digital ZooScan imaging of zooplankton sampled in a Lagrangian manner. We find that vertical distributions of many mesozooplankton taxa shift to deeper depths in the cross-shore direction, and light attenuation is the strongest predictor of magnitude of change. Vertical habitat shifts vary among functional groups, with changes in vertical distribution most pronounced among carnivorous taxa. Herbivorous taxa remain associated with the chlorophyll maximum, especially in clear offshore waters. Our results suggest that increased stratification of this ocean region will lead to deeper depths occupied by some components of epipelagic mesozooplankton communities, and may result in zooplankton communities with more specialized feeding strategies, increased egg brooding, and more asexual reproduction.

AB  - Simple Summary Human activities often affect the access and supply of water to wildlife, e.g., via water pumping, spring diversion, dam construction, and fencing. For this reason, wildlife managers have been provisioning surface water to wildlife in arid/semi-arid ecosystems for decades, typically via the construction of artificial water points. In this study, camera traps were used to examine for the first time the Cyprus mouflon's (Ovis gmelini ophion) use of artificial water troughs in Pafos Forest-the stronghold of Cyprus' threatened and endemic wild sheep. The ten monitored water troughs are part of the larger grid installed by the Game and Fauna Service to provide water to the mouflon during the prolonged dry season. Mouflon drinking was positively related to temperature, visiting the water troughs significantly more during late morning and midday hours of warmer days. There was no evidence of mouflon temporally avoiding water troughs used by predators (red foxes, feral dogs) or during hunting days. The findings suggest that water provision can be an important management tool for mediating, partially at least, the impact of global warming on water-dependent species such as the Cyprus mouflon, and therefore, additional studies focused on improving water trough effectiveness (e.g., regarding their spatiotemporal deployment) are advised. For large herbivores inhabiting arid/semi-arid environments, water can be a limiting resource affecting their distribution and abundance for periods when water requirements are not met via forage. The Cyprus mouflon (Ovis gmelini ophion) is such a species, which is endemic to the mountain habitats of Cyprus. Recognizing water scarcity to be a major pressure to the mouflon, and with global warming projected to intensify hot and dry periods in the region, the Game and Fauna Service has been maintaining a network of locally designed watering troughs in Pafos Forest-the mouflon's stronghold-since 1997. This study describes the mouflon's use of the water troughs and examines whether visitation rates differed at the daily or weekly scale in response to environmental, climatic or anthropogenic parameters. Using camera traps, ten troughs were monitored from September 2017 to March 2018 (1,065 days; range 29-164 days per trough). Mouflon were detected at seven troughs (mean herd size 1.5 +/- 1.2) during 373 independent detections (>= 30 min interval between photographs), with visits peaking during late morning and midday hours. Generalized mixed-effect models showed mouflon visiting water troughs more frequently during hotter days, regardless of recent precipitation. Visits were also more frequent at water troughs located close to tar roads. Moreover, there was no evidence of mouflon avoiding water troughs used by predators (red foxes, feral dogs) at either daily or weekly scale, or during hunting days. The study supports the value of artificial water troughs for mediating, partially at least, the effects of climate change on mountain ungulates such as the Cyprus mouflon. Additional studies are proposed that will examine both mouflon drinking patterns across all seasons and ways of improving the effectiveness of the current water trough grid.

AB  - Capture and handling of animals is an essential component of wildlife research. Human population growth, coupled with rapid land use changes, have resulted in increased wildlife-human interactions and subsequently increased public awareness and sensitivity to animal welfare. However, few publications have compared capture techniques in terms of effectiveness, economics, and animal safety across the same environment. We evaluated capture effectiveness, monetary cost, and safety for drop nets and both single and tandem helicopters with net-gunning techniques for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer). We captured 32 (drop nets), 68 (single helicopter), and 71 (tandem helicopters) deer over 6 study periods (3 autumn and 3 spring) from August 2011 to February 2014. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE, person hours/deer) was lowest for tandem helicopters (2.3) followed by single helicopter (2.7) and then drop nets (65.8). Animals captured using drop nets heavily favored younger males compared to both helicopter and net-gunning techniques. Capture cost (total cost/deer) was greater for drop nets ($655 USD) than either single helicopter ($164) or tandem helicopters ($231). Total mortality (capture-related and postcapture myopathy) was highest for drop nets at 12.5% followed by 5.9% for single helicopter and 4.2% for tandem helicopters. While all 3 techniques were safe and effective methods for deer capture, the tandem helicopter technique was superior in balancing effectiveness, cost, safety, and maximizing spatial coverage, all of which must be considered when selecting among available capture methods.

AB  - Studies have reported goat Polled Intersex Syndrome(PIS) a 11.7-kb deletion triggers intersexuality and polledness in goats. To determine the effect of PIS region on horned phenotype of Guanzhong dairy goats, four specific primers (PIS1-1, PIS1-2, PIS2 and PIS3) covering PIS fragment were designed, and four DNA fragment were amplifed and sequenced. A 12.814kb sequence was assembled containing the whole goat PIS region both in horned goats and in polled goats, which mean there were no 11.7 kb deletion in the Guanzhong dairy goats. The polymorphisms sites in PIS region of horned and polled Guanzhong dairy goats were identified, and a total of 30 polymorphisms sites were confirmed (A648T, T652C, G1107C, T2594C, G2820A, G3556A, A3573G, T3621C, A5329T, T5392G, G5878A, C5996T, A6187G, C6228A, G6969T, G7045T, T7057C, C7266G, C7417T, T8327G, T9029G, C10034A, A10846G, del 10861-10862TT, G11842A, G12157A, G12104A, del 12431-12432AT, G12665A and del 12771-12772TT) in the 12.814 kb sequence. The further annotation results showed that a tRNA was located at 4218-4290bp, STR1 (TGTGTGTGTGTG) and STR2 (ATATATATATAT) were located at 9473-9484bp and 12451-12462bp, respectively. Three micro RNAs, dme-mir-1, dme-mir-263a and cbr-mir-354 were confermed to locate at 3002-3023bp, 9078-9094bp and 10866-10882bp, respectively. There is a CpG island at 4390-4540 bp. Our results showed that the PIS regions have no effect on polled phenotype of Guanzhong dairy goat, genetic diversity in PIS region of the goat were identified and the key gene polymorphism sites still waiting to be determined.

AB  - Wild boars can directly or indirectly transmit numerous zoonotic helminths to humans in rural communities as they serve as reservoir hosts. This study was conducted to determine the occurrence and molecular characterisation of cystic metacestode forms of helminth parasites in wild boar and to identify haplotypes. To this end, 23 wild boar carcasses shot by hunters during the 2023 hunting season were necropsied and all internal organs were examined. Cysticercus tenuicollis (n = 07) and hydatid cyst (n = 10) isolates were obtained from the examined boars. Species identification of Cysticercus and hydatid cyst isolates was performed by amplification of partial fragments of the cox1 gene. According to BLAST search, all sequences of C. tenuicollis isolates were identified as Taenia hydatigena. Out of the hydatid cyst isolates, seven were classified as Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1/G3) and one sample was identified as Echinococcus canadensis (G6/G7). All isolates of E. granulosus s.s. (G1/ G3) were re-amplified with the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (nad5) in order to distinguish between G1 and G3 genotypes. Based on the sequence analysis, it was found that five of the E. granulosus s.s. isolates were classified as G1, while two were classified as G3. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that the G1 genotype is the most prevalent genetic variant among wild boar populations in Bingol province, T & uuml;rkiye. In this study, a total of five novel haplotypes were identified. A previously unidentified haplotype was revealed through the haplotype analysis of E. canadensis (G6/G7). All isolates in the haplotype network of T. hydatigena were shown to exhibit distinct and geographically specific haplotypes. According to the findings of the study, wild boars include a substantial amount of genetic variety in E. granulosus s.s. And T. hydatigena.

AB  - Coral reef resilience is greatly influenced by herbivory. There is a need to identify key fish species fulfilling this critical function in biogeographically distinct regions. This experimental in situ study investigated fish herbivory in coral reefs of the lower Gulf of Thailand characterized by a considerably low herbivorous fish biomass and diversity, but high live coral and low macroalgal cover. This provided an intriguing situation for macroalgal browsing research. Visual census techniques assessed the abundance of local herbivorous fish species, and filmed single-choice assays using the macroalga Turbinaria evaluated mass-standardized bites (ms-bites) and biomass removal. Multiple-choice assays offering four locally abundant macroalgae identified specific biomass removal and ms-bites to uncover selection and avoidance patterns of observed fish species. The rabbitfish Siganus virgatus constituted only 39% of herbivore biomass but accounted for 90% of ms-bites. In multiple-choice assays, fishes took most (61%) bites on Sargassum, followed by Padina (28%) and Turbinaria (11%), while Lobophora was avoided. S. virgatus exhibited the most generalized browsing pattern of all species observed. Coinciding with recent studies, our findings suggest that S. virgatus plays a key functional role in reefs characterized by low diversity of herbivores and low functional redundancy.

AB  - The Gerlache Strait is a narrow channel that separates the western coast of the Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) from the Palmer Archipelago. This area is characterized by the presence of interconnected fjords, bays, islands, and channels that serve as a refuge for megafauna during summer. Through the framework of FjordPhyto - a citizen science collaboration with the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) vessels - we assessed phytoplankton biomass and composition in surface waters of six under-explored nearshore areas connected to the Gerlache Strait (between 64 degrees and 65 degrees S) during three consecutive seasons, from November to March (2016-2019). During the first two seasons, we found significant differences in the phytoplankton community distribution and successional patterns to the north and south of the sampling area; the greatest differences were evidenced mainly in the months of high biomass, December and January. During December, cryptophytes bloomed in the north, while microplanktonic diatoms dominated in the south, and during January, small centric diatoms dominated in the north, while prasinophytes bloomed in the south. This spatial distinction in phytoplankton communities were mainly associated with the occurrence of a surface thermal front in the Gerlache Strait around 64.5 degrees S. The presence of the front separating warm waters to the north and colder waters to the south, during the months of December to February, was confirmed by the analysis of 10 years of remote sensing data. By contrast, during the third season, low biomass prevailed, and no differences in the phytoplankton composition between the north and south areas were observed. The third season was the coldest of the series, with smaller differences in water temperature north and south of the usual front location. This study shows for the first time a complete overview of the phytoplankton composition throughout the entire growth season (November through March) in the nearshore areas of the WAP between 64 degrees and 65 degrees S. The results of this work contribute to the understanding of the phytoplankton community in relation to small scale physical features during the Antarctic austral summer.

AB  - The citrus industry produces a high amount of organic waste that contaminates the environment; using byproducts of this industry to feed small ruminants gives livestock farmers a socioeconomic advantage. The objective was to evaluate the drying of orange peel (OP) and the density of flies on it with different levels of limestone, and the performance in sheep and goats fed with a proportion of OP in a diet dehydrated with the inclusion of limestone. The results indicated that including 10% limestone decreased the proliferation of flies and dried the OP. The 50:50 amount caused more mois- ture loss and less fly proliferation in OP, but more limestone was wasted, and the calcium level in the formulated diet increased. Limestone inclusion improved the appearance of OP and visually decreased bagasse oxidation. Female lambs and goats were fed an energy ration with 10% OP dried with limestone, and conventionally, no significant differences (p >= 0.05) in weight gain, feed consumption, and feed conversion were observed. The calcium and phosphorous content in the blood serum of the lambs and goats in this study indicates a normal status, and there were no significant differences (P>0.05) between the groups. In conclusion, limestone as a source of CaCO3 did not increase the economic cost of the diet; the proliferation of flies and the oxidation of OP were significantly reduced, making the preparation of the diets and their storage easier.

AB  - In terrestrial mammals, the parotid and mandibular glands secrete different types of saliva into the oral cavity. Both glands were obtained from two female lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris) and one female aardvark (Orycteropus afer) from the Wroclaw Zoological Garden (Poland) and examined by light microscopy (hematoxylin and eosin, mucicarmine, periodic acid-Schiff, Alcian blue pH 1.0, Alcian blue pH 2.5, Alcian blue pH 2.5/PAS, and Hale's dialysed iron). Both the parotid glands observed in the lowland tapir and aardvark were compound alveolar serous secretory units, and in both species, the secretion was composed of neutral and acidic mucopolysaccharides (sialo and sulfated mucins). However, in both the lowland tapir and aardvark, a histological examination found the stroma of the mandibular gland was divided into very large lobes by poorly marked connective tissue. While many interlobar and striated ducts were found in the aardvark, very few were found in the lowland tapir. The mandibular gland was a branched tubular (mucous secretion) type in the lowland tapir, but it was a branched tubuloalveolar (mucous-serous) type in the aardvark. In all tested glands, the secretion was composed of neutral mucopolysaccharides, acid-sulfated mucosubstances, and sialomucins.

AB  - The brown macroalgal genus Lobophora plays important ecological roles in many marine ecosystems. This group has received much attention over the past decade, and a considerable number of new species have been identified globally. However, our knowledge of the genus diversity and ecology along south-east Asian coasts are still limited. Given the growing body of research that uses a combination of molecular and morphological data to identify cryptic species, this study investigates the diversity of Lobophora in the western Gulf of Thailand using morphological and molecular data, as well as their interactions with scleractinian corals. A total of 36 Lobophora specimens were collected from 15 sites in the western Gulf of Thailand and used for molecular and morphological analyses. One mitochondrial (cox3) and two chloroplast (psbA and rbcL) genes were amplified and sequenced for molecular phylogenetic analyses. Based primarily on phylogenetic evidence, two new species were formally described, L. chumphonensis sp. nov. and L. thailandensis sp. nov. Additionally, L. lamourouxii was newly recorded from Thailand. Two new lineages of Lobophora obscura were identified, L. obscura12 and L. obscura13. Among the Lobophora species identified, three were found in interaction with corals, the most notable of which was the massive coral Porites. Lobophora chumphonensis sp. nov. only interacted with Porites by growing on bare coral skeleton between Porites colonies. Furthermore, L. obscura13 was observed under the branching coral Pocillopora. Our findings revealed that Lobophora presented both effects and absence of effects on coral. A thorough understanding of Lobophora diversity and ecology is essential for ongoing and future research on coral-macroalgal ecological relationships.

AB  - African Swine Fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, listed as notifiable by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). It causes substantial economic losses to pig farming in the affected countries, with consequent enormous damage to livestock production due to mortality of the animals, and to the restrictions on national and international trade in pigs and derivative products that the presence of the infection implies. To prevent or reduce the risk of ASF introduction, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the OIE recommend preventive and control measures, such as the ban of live swine and their products traded from ASF-affected to ASF-free countries or zones. The current spread of ASF into Europe poses a serious risk to the industrialized and small-scale pig sector, as demonstrated by observed cases in different EU areas. In this paper the authors discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASF, and the indirect effects including the impact on animal health and disease management. They suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected animal disease surveillance control. ASF requires rapid responses and continuous monitoring to identify outbreaks and prevent their spread, and both aspects may have been greatly reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Due to the logistical and financial challenges in studying migratory marine species, there is relatively limited knowledge of the reproductive biology, behavior, and habitat use of many ecologically important marine megafauna species, including the Atlantic tarpon Megalops atlanticus. Here, we present a novel observation using consumer-grade aerial drones to observe, quantify the scale of, and classify behaviors within a previously unreported tarpon aggregation (N = 182) over the course of a 2-day fish aggregation event. After the event, we analysed and compared observed behaviors (e.g., cruising and clustering) with those of other fish species with well-documented reproductive behaviors, revealing behaviors potentially consistent with courtship, leading us to believe this to be a possible spawning aggregation or aggregation of reproductive/migratory significance. This aggregation occurred in highly altered and urbanized habitat off the coast of South Florida, during the winter, and outside of tarpon's previously reported spring and summer spawning season. Although few studies to date have used drones to monitor teleosts, this study reinforces their potential value as a tool for monitoring fish populations, behavior, and movement.

AB  - Bycatch, the non-intentional capture or killing of non-target species in commercial or recreational fisheries, is a world wide threat to protected, endangered or threatened species (PETS) of marine megafauna. Obtaining accurate bycatch estimates of PETS is challenging: the only data available may come from non-dedicated schemes, and may not be representative of the whole fisheries effort. We investigated, with simulated data, a model-based approach for estimating PETS bycatch from non-representative samples. We leveraged recent development in the statistical analysis of surveys, namely regularized multilevel regression with post-stratification, to infer total bycatch under realistic scenarios of data sampling such as under-sampling or over-sampling when PETS bycatch risk is high. Post-stratification is a survey technique to re-align the sample with the population and addresses the problem of non-representative samples. Post-stratification requires to sub-divide a population of interest into potentially hundreds of cells corresponding to the cross-classification of important attributes. Multilevel regression accommodate this data structure, and the statistical technique of regularization can be used to predict for each of these hundreds of cells. We illustrated these statistical ideas by modeling bycatch risk for each week within a year with as few as a handful of observed PETS bycatch events. The model-based approach led to improvements, under mild assumptions, both in terms of accuracy and precision of estimates and was more robust to non-representative samples compared to more design-based methods currently in use. In our simulations, there was no detrimental effects of using the model-based even when sampling was representative. Estimating PETS bycatch ideally requires dedicated observer schemes and adequate coverage of fisheries effort. We showed how a model-based approach combining sparse data typical of PETS bycatch and recent methodological developments can help when both dedicated observer schemes and adequate coverage are challenging to implement.

AB  - Prescribed fire has been encouraged as a management tool to increase oak regeneration across the southeastern United States. The least utilized part of the burn window in this region is during fall, but burning in this season with the objective of oak regeneration has been discouraged because of the potential negative consequences on subsequent germination. While exposure to fire decreases acorn viability, acorns cached in recently burned areas increases their survival. By following the fate of unburned acorns added to those areas, previous studies identified post-fire habitat characteristics (e.g., altering vegetation structure, decreased leaf litter, etc.) as a cause of increased acorn establishment success. However, exposing acorns to fire may also contribute to fate of surviving acorns by changing consumer removal rates. We exposed acorns to fire and established cafeteria-style experiments in unburned forests to compare burned and unburned acorn selection and removal rate of eight oak species by caching and non-caching consumers (i.e., predator type). Exposing acorns to fire did not appear to affect selection of oak species but affected overall removal risk for acorns differently by species of consumers. For example, while one important non-caching consumer (white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus) and caching consumer (southern flying squirrel, Glaucomys Volans) showed strong selection of burned acorns, other important consumers in each predator type showed little discrimination or strong selection of unburned acorns (e.g., southern fox squirrel Sciurus niger). Exposure to fire reduced the overall rate of removal of acorns and when an acorn was removed, fire significantly reduced the probability that it would be removed by a caching consumer. Overall, our experiment demonstrates that shifts in consumer removal for exposed acorns may play an important role in the net effects of fall burning on oak regeneration.

AB  - Aversive memories can enter a labile state during reactivation, allowing its content to be modified. Molecular changes induced by distinct interventions such as physical exercise can either facilitate or impair the strength of the original memory. However, the effect of the physical exercise performed at distinct time-points around memory reactivation remains poorly understood. Here we investigated how a single treadmill exercise bout delivered at different moments before or after a 5, 15 or 30-min reactivation session influences the reconsolidation and extinction of contextual fear conditioned memory in rats. Our results indicate that physical exercise of low-intensity 24 h and 10 min before the reactivation impairs reconsolidation and facilitates extinction. However, when the exercise protocol is performed immediately after the reactivation session, it facilitates reconsolidation and impairs extinction memory. Our results suggest that the specific time-point in which the physical exercise is performed plays an essential role in the reconsolidation and extinction outcome in fear conditioned animals.

AB  - Strained (Torba) yogurts were produced using cow milk as well as the blends of cow-sheep, cow-goat, and cow-sheep-goat milk in equal proportions, combined with probiotic bacteria (Lacticaseibacillus casei and Bifi- dobacterium longum). These yogurts were fortified with medicinal and aromatic plants, including thyme (Origanum onites L.), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) and mint (Mentha piperita L.). The antimicrobial activity and probiotic-enhancing effects of these probiotic-strained yogurts were evaluated over a 30-day storage period. The yogurts containing these plants showed significant antimicrobial effects (P < 0.05) against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Additionally, the plant-containing formulation demonstrated probiotic protective and stimulatory effects. However, the inclusion of medicinal plants in the probiotic strained yoghurt negatively impacted the sensory properties over the storage period. (c) 2024 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herbivory is one of the key processes shaping life history traits linked to plant fitness and the leaf -cutting ants are amongst the most voracious and polyphagous herbivores of the Neotropics. They extensively harvest aboveground plant parts to grow their symbiotic fungus, including vegetative and reproductive tissues. Although leafcutting ant herbivory is expected to reduce plant reproductive success, the potentially different outputs of damage to vegetative and reproductive parts are still poorly known. This study investigates the influence of Atta opaciceps herbivory on the reproductive success of three plant species native to the Caatinga dry forest: Croton argyrophylloides (Euphorbiaceae), Cenostigma pyramidale , and Indigofera suffruticosa (Leguminosae). We selected 10 adult and active nests of A. opaciceps based on the presence of individuals of the three focal plant species in their vicinity. For each colony, we marked four individuals of each plant species (totaling 12 individuals per colony), which were then subjected to one of four herbivory treatments: (1) ant herbivory on both reproductive and vegetative parts, (2) manually simulated herbivory on the reproductive parts alone, (3) ant herbivory exclusively on vegetative parts, and (4) no herbivory. From January to April 2020, we monitored all 120 individuals, recording the number of inflorescences, flower buds, flowers, fruits, and the proportion of flowers maturing into fruits (fruit set, as a proxy of reproductive success). Results revealed variations in reproductive structure production and divergent responses to leaf -cutting ant herbivory among our focal species. In terms of inflorescence, flower bud production, and fruit set C. argyrophylloides showed reduced numbers when subjected to higher levels of total herbivory (reproductive and vegetative parts), but increased inflorescence and flower bud production when plants suffered only leaf damage. Cenostigma pyramidale individuals under partial herbivory displayed lower flower bud numbers than protected ones. In contrast, I. suffruticosa displayed conflicting results, with fully exposed plants producing more inflorescences than partially exposed counterparts and more flowers than leaf -damaged and protected individuals. Despite the varied effects on different plant parts across all three study species, the overall reproductive success (i.e. fruit set) of only one species ( C. argyrophylloides ) was significantly reduced by leaf -cutting ant herbivory. The resilience of the two other plant species to leaf -cutting ant pressure may be attributed to compensatory mechanisms, shedding light on the intricate interplay between herbivores and plants in the Caatinga dry forest. As leaf -cutting ants proliferate in response to anthropogenic disturbances, the patterns described in this study may become more pronounced, potentially affecting the organization of plant communities in the Caatinga dry forest.

AB  - Yongle Atoll was the largest atoll in the Xisha Islands of the South China Sea, and it was a coral reef ecosystem with important ecological and economic values. In order to better protect and manage the coral reef fish resources in Yongle Atoll, we analyzed field survey data from artisanal fishery, catches, and underwater video from 2020 to 2022 and combined historical research to explore the changes in fish species composition and community structure in Yongle Atoll over the past 50 years. The results showed that a total of 336 species of fish were found on Yongle Atoll, belonging to 17 orders and 60 families. Among them, Perciformes had the most fish species with 259 species accounting for 77.08% of the total number of species. The number of fish species in the coral reef of Yongle Atoll was exponentially correlated with its corresponding maximum length and significantly decreases with its increase. The fish community structure of Yongle Atoll changed, and the proportion of large carnivorous fish decreased significantly, while the proportion of small-sized and medium-sized fish increased. At the same time, Yongle Atoll has 18 species of fish listed on the IUCN Red List, 15 of which are large fish. The average taxonomic distinctness (Delta+, ?+) and the variation taxonomic distinctness (Lambda+, ?+) in 2020-2022 were lower than the historical data, and the number of fish orders, families, and genera in Yongle Atoll has decreased significantly, which indicates that the current coral reef fish species in Yongle Atoll have closer relatives and higher fish species uniformity. In addition, the similarity of fish species in Yongle Atoll was relatively low at various time periods, further proving that the fish community structure has undergone significant variation. In general, due to multiple impacts, such as overfishing, fishing methods, environmental changes, and habitat degradation, the fish species composition of Yongle Atoll may have basically evolved from carnivorous to herbivorous, from large fish to small fish, and from complexity to simplicity, leaving Yongle Atoll in an unstable state. Therefore, we need to strengthen the continuous monitoring of the coral reef ecosystem in Yongle Atoll to achieve the protection and restoration of its ecological environment and fishery resources, as well as sustainable utilization and management.

AB  - Background and Research Aims: Native vertebrate scavenger communities may be affected by free-ranging dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), but little information is available on this subject. We aimed to evaluate the influence of free-ranging dogs on a community of native vertebrate scavengers and to propose management and conservation actions.Methods: Between November 2014 and June 2016, we systematically monitored 37 ungulate carcasses in the buffer zone of Antisana National Park, Andes of Ecuador at an elevation range between 3000 and 4150 m asl. We monitored carcasses with camera traps operating 24 hours per day.Results: We obtained 1010 independent events and recorded seven vertebrate scavenger species. Free-ranging dogs were present at carcasses for 40.39% of the total activity time, but the most frequently recorded species were the Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) and the Carunculated Caracara (Phalcoboenus carunculatus). The scavenging birds were diurnal, the Andean fox was mostly nocturnal, and the free-ranging dogs were active in all periods of the day. Native scavenger species changed their peak of activity to times when the free-ranging dogs were less active, probably to avoid agonistic encounters. The presence of free-ranging dogs negatively influenced the number of independent events of the native species.Conclusion: The presence of free-ranging dogs showed a negative relationship with the residence time and the number of independent events of native scavenging species. Furthermore, their presence modified the hour of the peak in the activity patterns of the scavenger community.Implications for Conservation: The presence of free-ranging dogs may have important implications for the conservation of the Vulnerable Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) in Ecuador. To achieve the conservation goals of native vertebrate scavengers, particularly of Andean Condors, it is necessary to develop environmental education programs, provide technical training in responsible dog ownership, and conduct campaigns to sterilize and control dogs.

AB  - Investigators have speculated that the climate-driven "greening of the Arctic" may benefit barren-ground caribou populations, but paradoxically many populations have declined in recent years. This pattern has raised concerns about the influence of summer habitat conditions on caribou demographic rates, and how populations may be impacted in the future. The short Arctic summer provides caribou with important forage resources but is also the time they are exposed to intense harassment by insects, factors which are both being altered by longer, warmer growing seasons. To better understand the effects of summer forage and insect activity on Arctic caribou demographic rates, we investigated the influence of estimated forage biomass, digestible energy (DE), digestible nitrogen (DN), and mosquito activity on the reproductive success and survival of adult females in the Central Arctic Herd on the North Slope of Alaska. We tested the hypotheses that greater early summer DN would increase subsequent reproduction (parturition and late June calving success) while greater biomass and DE would increase adult survival (September-May), and that elevated mosquito activity would reduce both demographic rates. Because the period when abundant forage DN is limited and overlaps with the period of mosquito harassment, we also expected years with low DN and high harassment to synergistically reduce caribou reproductive success. Examining these relationships at the individual-level, using GPS-collared females, and at the population-level, using long-term monitoring data, we generally found support for our expectations. Greater early summer DN was associated with increased subsequent calving success, while greater summer biomass was associated with increased adult survival. Mosquito activity was associated with reductions in adult female parturition, late June calving success, and survival, and in years with low DN, had compounding effects on subsequent late June calving success. Our findings indicate that summer nutrition and mosquito activity collectively influence the demographic rates of Arctic caribou, and may impact the dynamics of populations in the future under changing environmental conditions.

AB  - The contents of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in soil-microorganisms-plant significantly affect tea quality by altering the main quality components of tea, such as tea polyphenols, amino acids, and caffeine. However, few studies have quantified the effects of these factors on the main quality components of tea. The study aimed to explore the interactions of C, N, and P in soil-microorganisms-plants and the effects of these factors on the main quality components of tea by using the path analysis method. The results indicated that (1) The contents of C, N, and P in soil, microorganisms, and tea plants were highly correlated and collinear, and showed significant correlations with the main quality components of tea. (2) Optimal regression equations were established to estimate tea polyphenol, amino acid, catechin, caffeine, and water extract content based on C, N, and P contents in soil, microorganisms, and tea plants (R2 = 0.923, 0.726, 0.954, 0.848, and 0.883, respectively). (3) Pathway analysis showed that microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP), root phosphorus, branch nitrogen, and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were the largest direct impact factors on tea polyphenol, catechin, water extracts, amino acid, and caffeine content, respectively. Leaf carbon, root phosphorus, and leaf nitrogen were the largest indirect impact factors on tea polyphenol, catechin, and water extract content, respectively. Leaf carbon indirectly affected tea polyphenol content mainly by altering MBP content. Root phosphorus indirectly affected catechin content mainly by altering soil organic carbon content. Leaf nitrogen indirectly affected water extract content mainly by altering branch nitrogen content. The research results provide the scientific basis for reasonable fertilization in tea gardens and tea quality improvement.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs) are on the increase due to shrinking space that results in increased competition for land, water, and other natural resources between humans and wildlife. Investigating the occurrence of HWCs is important in that the results can be used to formulate better management policies and strategies. In this paper, we describe the nature of HWCs emerging between humans and the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) and between humans and the African hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius; hippo) on Lake Kariba, Zimbabwe. Lake Kariba is the second largest manmade lake by volume in the world. Conflicts involving humans and these species are readily noticeable and played out around water bodies, which are sources of daily human sustenance and important habitats for aquatic wildlife. We used a mixed-methods approach to gather data on these conflicts, including questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, focus group discussions, and participant observation. The research participants involved national parks officials, fishing camp residents, and HWC victims. Our research confirmed that crocodiles and hippos have negatively affected humans through deaths, injuries, instilling fear, and destruction of sources of livelihood for fishermen such as fishing nets and boats. In retaliation, humans have implemented lethal methods to remove problem animals. The results of this research can inform the conservation community about the severity of the conflicts, which have been exacerbated by current economic hardships, to better inform conservation policies.

AB  - Despite their interdependence, community ecology and evolutionary biology have proven difficult to synthesize empirically in studies of community assembly. This is primarily due to differing temporal and spatial scales of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, ranging from broad-scale processes like speciation and environmental filtering to local-scale past and present-day niche dynamics. Phylogenetic generalized linear mixed modeling (PGLMM) offers a solution to this problem, it can be used to integrate through time by modeling the evolution of trait-based community assembly, and across space ranging from broad-scale environmental sensitivities to local-scale co-occurrences. As such, PGLMM provides the ability to compare the relative strength of deep versus shallow-time drivers of biodiversity by including them in a single model. Despite its unique value, the application of PGLMM has been limited because statistical advances have not been adequately matched by conceptual progress. Recent expansion in the availability of cross-clade assemblage data and phylogenetic tools have increased the urgency of conceptual unification. Here we describe the potential of PGLMM for parsing the evolutionary and ecological drivers of community assembly, focusing on how three major drivers - environmental sensitivities, within-clade interactions (e.g. competition), and cross-clade associations (e.g. herbivory) - shape historical and present-day assemblages. We outline three fundamental questions that PGLMM can address, linked to each of the aforementioned drivers: 1) are species' regional-scale environmental responses evolutionarily constrained? 2) Do evolved responses to past competition minimize or enhance present-day competition? 3) Are cross-clade associations evolutionarily constrained? For each question, we review conceptual advances and opportunities, and demonstrate the application of PGLMM in a supplementary tutorial. We focus on the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of PGLMM and describe the value of these outcomes for conservation and natural resource management, in order to move PGLMM beyond statistical complexities and toward a future with clear conceptual and practical goals.

AB  - Sexually selected weapons are tools that are used in physical fights over mating opportunities. Individuals can face dire fitness consequences if they break their weapon and can no longer fight effectively; however, the costs and consequences of weapon damage have largely been ignored. In this study, the literature was systematically searched to examine the prevalence of weapon damage, and a phylogenetically controlled proportional meta-analysis was conducted to explore factors influencing the patterns of weapon damage across the animal kingdom. A total of 36 suitable studies were identified across 74 species and 13 orders for a total of 82 effect sizes. We found that weapon damage is common across taxa, with an average rate of damage of 9.4% across all observations. We found strong evidence that regenerative ability influences the patterns of weapon damage, with species capable of weapon regeneration exhibiting high prevalence of weapon damage. Herein, we discuss additional factors that may affect the likelihood, costs and consequences of weapon damage, including weapon size, weapon allometry, fighting behaviour and when and to what degree a species can regenerate its weapon. We argue that the risk of weapon damage is an important but underappreciated cost that could affect strategic fighting decisions, providing new insights into the role of weapon damage on the evolution of weapon morphology and contest behaviour within and among species.

AB  - Super Typhoon Saola (2309) skirted past south-southeast of Hong Kong within 40 km on the night of 1 September 2023, posing a significant storm surge threat to Hong Kong. Given the close proximity of Saola with a peak intensity of about 210 km/h within 300 km of Hong Kong, a close call of the "super typhoon direct-hit" scenario, this case provides valuable insights from a hindcast review of storm surge forecasts and warning operation using the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model, which is the operational storm surge model adopted by the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). The performance of the HKO's PRobabilistic Inundation Map Evaluation System (PRIMES) using both statistical and model ensemble approaches was also reviewed in this paper. Saola was a challenging case for operational forecasting of a compact TC structure with changes in storm size and intensity when it came close to Hong Kong. With major observations of storm structure using weather radar and dense automatic weather station, tide gauge and water level gauge networks, the high sensitivity of storm surge forecasts to the storm size parameter and the distance of closest approach was clearly revealed in the case of Saola. Even with a circularly symmetric TC parametric model like SLOSH, the hindcast review results illustrated that the model outputs were reasonably accurate during the closest approach of Saola given an accurate storm size and distance of closest approach were input, and using a highly computationally efficient storm surge model made it possible for the nowcasting of storm surges to handle compact and intense TC direct-hit cases in operational TC forecasting. Taking a nowcasting approach not only helps provide more reliable storm tide forecasts, but also facilitates the formulation of a better warning strategy when making final-call decisions in emergency response actions, based on the more frequent real-time analysis of TC position, intensity and storm size and the more accurate prediction of these parameters. A nowcasting workflow for storm surge operation was proposed in this paper.

AB  - Asian elephants play a pivotal role in their ecosystem. Understanding the potential distribution area of this species is vital for effective conservation efforts and mitigation of human-elephant conflicts. In this study, we used the maximum entropy to simulate the potential distribution area of Asian elephants across South and Southeast Asia, leveraging Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and presence data sourced from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). The analysis revealed that the potential distribution area of Asian elephants spans 530,418 km2 2 (10.59% of the study area), with significant potential distribution areas observed in Indonesia (136,890 km2) 2 ) and Malaysia (119,497 km2). 2 ). Vegetation type emerged as the dominant environmental factor influencing model outcomes, encompassing aspects such as broadleaved evergreen tree coverage, broadleaved deciduous closed tree coverage and EVI. The potential distribution area of Asian elephants overlaps with regions inhabited by 55.25 million people, with 6.07 million people residing in highly suitable habitats. India and Malaysia have high potential for human-elephant conflict (HEC) due to the high number of people living in potential and highly suitable habitats for elephants. Bangladesh and Nepal, on the other hand, have fewer people living in these habitats suitable for elephants, but they face relatively high human population density in these areas.

AB  - Using the 16 S rDNA high-throughput sequencing, the effects of interplanted pecan (Carya illinoinensis) in a typical tea (Camellia sinensis) plantation on soil bacterial species composition and marker species were comparatively analyzed to determine whether nested pecan increases soil microbial diversity in the tea tree rhizosphere. We explored the effects of the underlying mechanisms of this complex ecosystem on tea quality by determining soil physicochemical properties using two types of planting modes: intercropping with pecan versus tea tree monoculture. Our results showed that Rhizobium (Allorhizobium, Neorhizobium, Pararhizobium, and Rhizobium), and Enterobacter, had pollution-degrading effects and were enriched in the soil bacterial communities of the pecan interplanted model. There was a significant enrichment of prebiotic functional bacteria, such as Pedosphaeraceae and Coriobateriaceae_UCG-002, which stimulate plant growth and improve disease resistance, while the functions of Chloroflexi and Firmicutes, which are dominant denitrifying bacteria in the soil, were inhibited. The average degree of soil microbial co-occurrence network increased from 13.40 to 18.17, and the number of nodes in the network increased from 117 to 166, indicating that the network increased in complexity and decreased in mutual exclusivity, and the complex interactions among bacterial populations tended to be stable. The intercropping mode reduced the phenol/ammonia ratio in tea from 2.37 to 1.38, improving the tea quality. Therefore, the soil microbial community composition under this complex model promotes material cycling in microecosystems and effectively reduces the transmission risk of soil-borne diseases. The soil microbial community structure of the tea rhizosphere could be re-balanced and shifted toward a more favorable tea quality formation by the introduction of pecan into tea plantations.

AB  - The human-caused proliferation of cyanobacteria severely impacts consumers in freshwater ecosystems. Toxicity is often singled out as the sole trait to which consumers can adapt, even though cyanobacteria are not necessarily toxic and the lack of nutritionally critical sterols in cyanobacteria is known to impair consumers. We studied the relative significance of toxicity and dietary sterol deficiency in driving the evolution of grazer resistance to cyanobacteria in a large lake with a well-documented history of eutrophication and oligotrophication. Resurrecting decades-old Daphnia genotypes from the sediment allowed us to show that the evolution and subsequent loss of grazer resistance to cyanobacteria involved an adaptation to changes in both toxicity and dietary sterol availability. The adaptation of Daphnia to changes in cyanobacteria abundance revealed a sterol-mediated gleaneropportunist trade-off. Genotypes from peak-eutrophic periods showed a higher affinity for dietary sterols at the cost of a lower maximum growth rate, whereas genotypes from more oligotrophic periods showed a lower affinity for dietary sterols in favour of a higher maximum growth rate. Our data corroborate the significance of sterols as limiting nutrients in aquatic food webs and highlight the applicability of the gleaner-opportunist trade-off for reconstructing eco-evolutionary processes.

AB  - Sun exposure is a major threat to the survival of cacti seeds in desertic environments. During summer, fruits of the columnar cactus Pachycereus pringlei from San Esteban Island, northwestern Mexico, are eaten by herbivorous iguanas, and after digestion, seeds are deposited within their scats. We compared the germination percentage of wild seeds exposed to the sun while lying on the ground of the island, with that of seeds collected directly from the fruit, and seeds obtained from old and recently deposited iguana scats. Our results indicate that direct sun exposure causes drastic reduction in seed germination, and this negative effect is reduced in seeds shielded inside feces, although with a cost on germination.

AB  - High elevation imposes unrelenting and unavoidable hypoxia on species inhabiting these environments, providing an excellent natural setting for studying convergent or divergent evolution. By integrating measures of phenotypic variation, gene regulation, and functional performance, our study demonstrates that recent colonizers of high-elevation environments exhibit fundamentally different cardiovascular changes compared to long-term natives of these environments. Through the studying of heart morphological phenotypes, we showed that recent colonizers exhibit signs of cardiac hypertrophy, reflected by increased relative heart mass (heart mass/body mass) and cardiomyocyte size compared to their low-elevation relatives. In contrast, native species show no signs of cardiac hypertrophy and instead have 3-fold higher capillary densities than the colonizers, a change that likely enhances tissue oxygen diffusing capacity in the former. Using phylogenetic principal component analysis to quantify multivariate trait divergence, we show that native species are similar in cardiovascular phenotype and underlying gene expression, but differ appreciably from recent colonizers. We further demonstrate, using a functional assay, that differential expression of two genes (IRS2 and AKT1) in a conserved regulatory pathway mediates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which could explain the observed variation in cardiomyocyte size between native species and recent colonizers. This regulatory basis of variation in cardiac phenotype involves the differential expression of genes in a cardiomyocyte hypertrophy pathway that is conserved across birds, humans and other mammals. Collectively, our study highlights that evolutionary history is a critical determinant of cardiovascular variation in high-elevation environments.

AB  - To study the dynamic changes of soil organic carbon (SOC) content in coastal wetlands over the past 23 years, we use the third core area of the Dafeng Elk Nature Reserve in Jiangsu Province, China as the study area. A normalized difference soil spectral index (NDSOC), which is directly related to SOC, was constructed by using the spectral reflectance of Landsat images, and six auxiliary environmental variables related to SOC were extracted: surface temperature, surface moisture, soil salinity, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), surface brightness, and soil texture information. The coastal wetland soil surface SOC inversion model was constructed by multiple linear regression, support vector machine, and particle swarm optimization-based random forest regression (PSO-RFR). By using the best inversion model, we obtain the dynamic distribution of soil surface SOC in the third core area of the Dafeng Elk Reserve for the past 23 years. The results indicate (1) that the NDSOC index constructed based on the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands 1 and 2 of the Landsat images has a strong indication of SOC. Among the extracted auxiliary environmental variables, the NDVI, soil clay content, surface temperature, and soil salinity contribute more strongly to the SOC content of coastal wetlands, which averaged 27.9 %, 24.4 %, 22.1 %, and 18 %, respectively. (2) The PSO-RFR algorithm provided the best simulation of the surface SOC content of coastal wetlands: the model determination coefficient R2 is 0.731, the average fitting root mean square error RMSE is 0.917 g/kg, and the fitting uncertainty standard deviation was 0.362 g/kg. (3) From 2000 to 2022, the organic carbon storage and organic carbon density in the third core area of the Dafeng Elk Reserve gradually increased, the highest value was reached in 2016, they were 4.017 (104 t) and 1.718 kg/cm2, respectively.

AB  - With the widespread use of biochar, the cascading effects of biochar exposure on soil fauna urgently require deeper understanding. A meta-analysis quantified hierarchical changes in functional traits and community diversity of soil fauna under biochar exposure. Antioxidant enzymes (24.1 %) did not fully mitigate the impact of MDA (13.5 %), leading to excessive DNA damage in soil fauna (21.2 %). Concurrently, reproduction, growth, and survival rates decreased by 20.2 %, 8.5 %, and 21.2 %, respectively. Due to a 39.7 % increase in avoidance behavior of soil fauna towards biochar, species richness ultimately increased by 80.2 %. Compared to other feeding habits, biochar posed a greater threat to the survival of herbivores. Additionally, macrofauna were the most sensitive to biochar. The response of soil fauna also depended on the type, size, concentration, and duration of biochar exposure. It should be emphasized that as exposure concentration increased, the damage to soil fauna became more severe. Furthermore, the smaller the biochar sizes, the greater the damage to soil fauna. To mitigate the adverse effects on soil fauna, this study recommens applying biochar at appropriate times and selecting large sizes in low to medium concentrations. These findings confirm the threat of biochar to soil health from the perspective of soil fauna.

AB  - Fish maintain their body fluid ionic and osmotic homeostasis using sophisticated iono-/osmoregulation mech-anisms through gills ionocytes. Pesticide-induced ionic imbalance in fish has been recognized as a valuable tool to determine its toxic effects. Acute exposure to synthetic and organo-chemical pesticides on the regulation of ionic (Na+, Ca2+, P) metabolism in freshwater catfish Mystus keletius was evaluated. Fish were exposed to sub-lethal concentrations (mg/l) of selected pesticide for a period of 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Results indicated that chemical pesticides -Impala and Ekalux -evoked adverse toxic effects on selected tissues compared to organo-chemical pesticide tested. Statistical analysis of the summative data using two-way ANOVA was significant (p-value<0.001). Variations in the cellular parameters analysed were attributed to the physiological acclimatization of fish to the pesticide exposed. Based on the results it is concluded that organic pesticides may be preferred for rice field application considering safety aspects.

AB  - Carnivores, especially top predators, are important because they maintain the structure and function of ecosystems by top-down control. Exploring the coexistence between carnivores belonging to different ecological guilds can provide the data needed for the development of effective conservation strategies of endangered species. We used scats and camera traps to molecularly analyze the dietary composition of four predators that inhabit the Everest region and assess their activity patterns. Dietary analysis revealed 22 food Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) of 7 orders and 2 classes. Snow leopard (Panthera uncia) and wolf (Canis lupus) had high dietary overlap (Pianka's index = 0.95), as they both mainly preyed on ungulates (%PR = 61%, 50%), while lynx (Lynx lynx) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) mainly consumed small mammals (%PR = 62%, 76%). We observed lower dietary overlaps (Pianka's index = 0.53-0.70) between predators with large body size difference (snow leopard versus lynx, snow leopard versus red fox, wolf versus lynx, wolf versus fox), and dietary difference was significant (p < .01), proving dietary partitioning. In activity pattern analysis, predators exhibited higher temporal overlaps with the more frequently consumed prey species, showing that predator activity can be regulated by prey availability. We observed no obvious temporal avoidance between snow leopard and wolf because they had high activity overlap (Delta = 0.87). Red fox had the lowest coefficients of activity overlap with snow leopard and wolf (Delta = 0.60, 0.59), suggesting that fox tends to avoid snow leopard and wolf temporally. In this study, we revealed how dietary and temporal partitioning facilitates the coexistence of carnivores in Everest. These results will help to increase the understanding of coexistence mechanism of carnivore communities, and provide the scientific foundation for the conservation of wildlife living in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.

AB  - Adaptative convergences of ecomorphological traits are widespread in several animal lineages. Among Neotropical deer there are very similar species characterized by a set of homoplasies: small body sizes, spiked antlers, and front legs shorter than the rear legs. These species are in different phylogenetic clades among larger and branched-antlered sympatric species, which are considered ancestral traits. It is hypothesized that the convergence of these morphological traits is an adaptation to living in dense forests. This study tested whether the spiked-antlered species are more associated with forest environments compared with branched-antlered species, which antler type-spike or branched-represents the ancestral morphotype, and if there is a correlation between phylogenetic distance (PD) and ecological difference (ED) in this species group. We found that spiked-antlered species had a more significant association with forest environments than branched-antlered species, with the latter morphotype being associated with higher body mass. Our ancestral state reconstructions indicate the branched-antlered morphotype as the ancestral trait. The correlation between PD and ED was weak in this group. The evolutionary pathway of this antler morphology underscores the remarkable plasticity of this trait in Neotropical deer.

AB  - Management of large herbivores often involves increasing availability of forages sufficient in nutrient density to allow animals to meet dietary demands. Nutritional carrying capacity (NCC) models commonly are used to compare plant communities and management strategies, but failure to use the most limiting nutrient could result in overestimating NCC. Moreover, the relationship between limiting nutrients often is not considered, which may influence the utility of NCC models based on a single nutrient, especially when herbivores must simultaneously meet multiple constraints. We examined crude protein and phosphorus concentrations in 131 plant species commonly eaten by white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus) to determine whether they would meet a minimum 14% crude protein and 0.3% phosphorus constraint for a lactating female. Crude protein and phosphorus demands were met in 43.9% and 18.8% of sampled forages, respectively. Concentrations of crude protein and phosphorus were greatest in young forb tissue, with an average of 18.6% crude protein and 0.28% phosphorus. Protein and phosphorus concentrations were positively correlated, but not all plants which met protein requirements simultaneously provided sufficient phosphorus. We created NCC models using crude protein and phosphorus and documented phosphorus tended to be more limiting, but variation existed among sites. Given that limiting nutrients may vary spatiotemporally, focusing conservation efforts on providing a diversity of plants, particularly to include forbs that simultaneously meet multiple nutritional demands, is likely the most practical management approach.

AB  - Wildlife is an important reservoir of zoonotic pathogens. The objective of the present study was to assess the importance of wild ungulates in the epidemiology of Rickettsia spp. Ticks and spleen samples were collected from 262 red deer (Cervus elaphus) and 83 wild boar (Sus scrofa) hunted in southwestern Spain over a 5-year period. DNA was extracted from tick pools (n = 191) and spleens (n = 345), and two nested PCR assays targeting the rOmpA and rOmpB genes were used to detect Rickettsia DNA. Five tick species were identified (Hyalomma lusitanicum, Dermacentor marginatus, Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus bursa and Haemaphysalis sulcata). Rickettsia DNA was detected in 31 (16.2%) tick pools and two red deer spleen samples (0.8%). Four validated Rickettsia species (R. slovaca, R. monacensis, R. helvetica and R. raoultii), one uncultivated species (Candidatus R. rioja) and two uncharacterized Rickettsia spp. were detected in ticks. R. helvetica and R. slovaca were also detected in spleen samples from red deer. The overall prevalence in ungulate spleen samples was lower than in tick pools suggesting that these ungulates do not play a major role in the transmission of Rickettsia spp. However, their importance as spreaders of positive ticks cannot be ruled out. The results present a challenge for the veterinary and public health communities since most of the Rickettsia spp. detected are pathogenic. Furthermore, the new Rickettsia species could be potential pathogens. For these reasons, identifying Rickettsia species present in ticks and wildlife is of particular interest to clarify their sylvatic cycle and establish appropriate control measures.

AB  - Desert bighorn (Ovis canadensis mexicana) have declined throughout Mexico, necessitating actions to inform habitat management and guide population restorations. We used a generalized resource-area-dependence analysis and univariate modeling of home range sizes to identify habitat quality for, and distribution v. availability (i.e., "habitat use") analyses to further identify habitat associations of, 37 satellite/GPS collared adult desert bighorn in Sonora, Mexico. We found that sarcocaul shrubland and greater terrain ruggedness were most associated with desert bighorn home ranges. Sarcocaul shrubland was the only vegetation type related to home range size (i.e., habitat quality) of desert bighorn (adult females), and was also the only vegetation type significantly overrepresented in home ranges of both sexes. Similarly, greater terrain ruggedness was consistently associated with both sexes. Our results reflected availability of preferred foods and greater security for desert bighorn in Sonora. Our individual-based, telemetry-based data provide a rigorous basis for evaluating habitat potential and planning population restorations of bighorn in Mexico, and provide a quantitative guide for conservation of desert bighorn habitat and populations in Sonora and throughout arid Mexico.

AB  - The massive die-off of the sea urchin Diadema antillarum in 1983-1984 is one the main reasons for low coral recruitment and little coral recovery in the Caribbean. As the natural recovery of D. antillarum is slow to non-existent, multiple restoration studies have been attempted. There are currently three different approaches to obtain individuals for restocking: the translocation of wild-collected juveniles or adults, lab-reared juveniles cultured from wild-collected settlers, or lab-reared juveniles cultured from gametes. All three methods are costly and can only be applied on a relatively small scale. We here propose a fourth, new, approach, which we term assisted natural recovery (ANR) of D. antillarum populations. ANR, a concept already applied in terrestrial restoration to restore forests and grasslands, can accelerate succession by removing barriers to natural recovery. In this study, performed on the Dutch Caribbean island of Saba, suitable settlement substrate was provided in the form of bio ball streamers that were attached to the reef shortly before the settlement season. At the end of the experiment, reefs with streamers had significantly higher D. antillarum recruit densities than control reefs without additional settlement substrate, indicating that the lack of settlement substrate is an important factor constraining natural recovery. However, D. antillarum recruit abundance was low compared to the measured settlement rates, possibly due to low post-settlement survival. The size distribution of recruits showed that recruits almost never became larger than 20 mm, which is likely due to predation. We conclude that, next to low settlement availability, low post-settlement survival and high predation on recruits also constrain the natural recovery of D. antillarum populations on Saba. To improve the survival of settlers till adults, we propose to 1) reduce predation on settlers by using bio balls or other substrates that can provide shelter to larger individuals and 2) optimize the reef habitat by removing macroalgae, either manually or by facilitating other herbivores. To improve the survival of recruits, we suggest to 1) choose sites with a known lower predation density or 2) protect recruits with a corral around the reef underneath the streamers. The combination of these measures could improve prospects for ANR, and we expect this new approach can contribute to the recovery of D. antillarum populations in the future.

AB  - The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in various physiological functions of the host and can be modulated by numerous factors, including feeding habit or trophic level. In this study, the impact of host feeding habits on the gut microbiota of freshwater fish was explored. Ten fish species, classified into four feeding habit categories (herbivorous, omnivorous, planktivorous, and carnivorous) were sampled from West Lake, a renowned urban scenic lake, and their gut content microbiota was analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. A total of 2531 operational taxonomic units, belonging to 34 bacterial phyla, were identified, with 33.4% shared across all feeding habits. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla. However, at the family level, Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae_1 were the most dominant. Microbiota composition diversity was highest in herbivorous fish, followed by omnivores, carnivores, and planktivores. Statistically significant differences in microbiota diversity were found between different feeding categories, except for the omnivores, which did not differ from the carnivores or planktivores. The most abundant predicted metabolic pathways across all feeding habits were similar, with amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, and metabolism of other amino acids being dominant. However, comparing the relative abundance of gene functions between different feeding habits revealed notable variations across most comparisons. Co-occurrence network analysis for each feeding habit revealed that all networks were dominated by the strong positive correlation among pairs of bacterial genera abundances, while the basic properties varied, implying differences in gut microbiota interactions based on the feeding habit. In conclusion, these results confirmed that the feeding habit could affect the structure and composition of the gut content microbiota but also changed their functions and interactions.

AB  - Knowledge of the distribution and residency of pelagic marine megafauna, particularly deep-diving species, is scarce due to their high mobility over difficult-to-access oceanic areas and long periods underwater. However, the threatened status of many of these species, such as the sperm whale Physeter macrocephalus, increases the need to obtain quantitative data to support conservation measures. In the warm temperate waters of Macaronesia (Eastern North Atlantic), sperm whales occur year-round in a set of island systems (the Azores, Madeira, and the Canaries), mainly in social groups of females and juveniles with the occasional visits of mature males. Although it is known that they perform inter-archipelago movements, information on site fidelity and residency times is still scarce. Here, based on photographic-identification data, site fidelity and residency times of sperm whales were estimated for subareas of the Azores and the Madeira archipelagos, with a preliminary assessment for a subarea of the Canaries. The Azores and Madeira subareas presented similar proportions of individuals with recaptures (similar to 25%), mainly inter-annual, while in the subarea of the Canaries, only <10% of the individuals were recaptured. Standardized Site Fidelity Indexes showed very low values (<0.01) for both the Azores and Madeira subareas. Lagged identification rates based on models including emigration and reimmigration estimated that an average of 44.8 individuals (SE=4.9) spent 12.9 days (SE=1.5) in the Azores before leaving for 99.1 days (SE=12.5), while 8.4 individuals (SE=16.1) spent 0.8 day (SE=6.6) in Madeira before leaving for 8.6 days (SE=6.9), with a very low mortality rate. This study i) indicates a degree of residency of about 1/4 of the identified individuals for the Azores and Madeira subareas and ii) supports that these oceanic archipelagos constitute an important habitat for a Vulnerable species in the Atlantic. Moreover, it also highlights the importance of combining data from opportunistic and dedicated surveys and joint national and international efforts toward the conservation of marine megafauna.

AB  - Yellow Camellia is an endangered and protected wild plant with unique medicinal value. Among the Camellia Sect. Chrysantha Chang, certain species (e.g. Camellia limonia) can grow in karst regions. The karst region is a highly sensitive ecosystem with low environmental capacity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the adaptation of yellow camellia to karst regions remain unclear. Here, we present a high-quality genome with 15 chromosome groups with an N50 of 198.92 Mb. The divergence between C. limonia and Camellia sinensis occurred approximately 6 million years ago, indicating that the Himalayan uplift event may led to species differentiation. This enables C. limonia to thrive in a unique ecological environment like the karst region. Flavonoid compounds play a significant role in the interaction between plants and their environment. In comparison to Theaceae family genomes, C. limonia exhibits an increased number of gene family members involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, including UDPglycosyltransferases and chalcone reductase. Additionally, two gene clusters associated with flavonoid biosynthesis were identified in the genome of C. limonia. Furthermore, comparative genomics analysis revealed the expansion of genes associated with karst environment adaptation in the genome of C. limonia, such as calmodulin genes and genes related to Calcium ion trans- membrane transport. Additionally, at the gene expression level, it was observed that the secondary metabolism-related genes may be involved in the calcium tolerance of C. limonia. These findings provide important insights into the evolution of C. limonia, offering references for the study of plants in karst areas.

AB  - Elephants are attracted to nutrient hotspots created through short duration overnight cattle corralling (hereafter kraaling) in natural rangelands at Debshan, a mixed cattle-wildlife private ranch in central Zimbabwe, causing severe tree damage. We determined the effect of age of nutrient hotspot (i.e., time after kraal use) on elephant use and the extent of tree damage. Elephant use and tree damage were assessed in nutrient hotspots of varying ages (6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months after kraal use) and in surrounding landscape. We also compared Acacia karroo bark nutrient and soil nutrient concentration between nutrient hotspots (24 months after kraal use) and the surrounding landscape. Elephant use of nutrient hotspots was highest at 12 and 24 months after kraaling. The most severely damaged trees were in the 12-, 24- and 36-month-old nutrient hotspots. Acacia karroo bark nutrient concentrations (nitrogen, potassium, calcium, magnesium and iron) were higher in nutrient hotspots than surrounding vegetation, while soil nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium and potassium) were higher in nutrient hotspots than surrounding landscape. We concluded that elephants mostly used nutrient hotspots 12 and 24 months after kraaling, while severe tree damage occurred 12, 24 and 36 months after kraal use.

AB  - Quantifying animal abundance, density, and distributions affords the opportunity to understand the effects of landscape structure and change on species of conservation interest, but estimating these parameters can be difficult for rare and cryptic species. Noninvasive sampling methods, such as remote cameras or scat DNA, can mitigate the challenges of studying rare and cryptic species while also minimizing effects on species of conservation interest or concern. Data derived from these methods can be integrated into robust, contemporary quantitative methods, including spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models, which provide a hierarchical framework for jointly estimating animal abundance, distribution, and, consequently, density. Herein, we developed an integrated SCR model to estimate the abundance, density, and distribution of a large carnivore of conservation interest, the cougar (Puma concolor), in a rugged and remote protected area, Yosemite National Park, California, USA. We combined spatial encounter data from DNA-based individual identification of scats with detection count data derived from remote cameras to estimate cougar density and detection probability in Yosemite. We further estimated how cougar density and detection probability varied as a result of vegetation, topography, anthropogenic and natural linear features, and survey effort. Using data collected in 2019 and 2020, we estimated a median of 31 (SD = 3.96, 95% credible intervals = 24-39) cougars in Yosemite across the two years, with higher densities associated with productive, vegetated areas. We found detection probability by scent detection teams was higher for females than males and positively correlated with survey effort, proximity to trails, and distance farther from roads and streams. Our study illustrates the utility of noninvasive survey methods that yield individual identities in rugged and remote environments, where capture and handling of cryptic, low-density animals is logistically challenging and cost prohibitive. Integrated modeling approaches, as used here, allow ecologists to leverage empirical data using a robust quantitative framework that can effectively address conservation objectives. Through this work, we demonstrate the importance of large, contiguous, and heterogeneous ecosystems to the ecology of wide-ranging species that occur in dynamic landscapes.

AB  - Teaching ecological concepts and field methods for introductory biology courses can be challenging, especially when class sizes are large and activities or topics depend on environmental conditions that can change dramatically from semester to semester. We provide a laboratory module that can be used throughout the year, where students can explore plant-insect interactions on campus trees in urban environments using nondestructive measures. Students are provided a transparent grid, a measuring tape, and a random selection protocol to estimate gloomy scale (Melanaspis tenebricosa) insect density on preselected Acer rubrum tree trunks. Students are also given a pace-to-plant protocol to evaluate how impervious surfaces around trees in urban environments may be associated with scale insect abundance. This module highlights ecological concepts, such as population dynamics, species interactions, competition, and food webs, among others. Through this module, students also learn skills in ecological field sampling techniques, particularly how to randomly sample, how to estimate insect abundance, and how to use observation skills to inform scientific inquiry.

AB  - Modelling sexual dimorphism has important implications for understanding the evolution of size relationships among and within organisms. We present a composite model for the regulation and evolution of sex-specific inter-population shell size in a family of herbivorous marine molluscs, the Strombidae. In particular, this model postulates that gene flow acts as a size regulator that limits inter-population divergence by not allowing the mean size of each sex to deviate significantly between disparate populations. The mean shell size of individuals within populations is affected by the ecological setting in which the animal is growing. The model considers niche divergence as inconsequential in the regulation of sexual dimorphism, whereas environmental regulation for the mean size of a population is considered a significant driving factor. Sexual competition, where males may dislodge other males during copulation, is also considered a non-significant driver of male body size because of the open mating system. In such a system, smaller males can simply mate before larger males have matured. Selection for earlier mating in males so as to maximise lifetime fecundity favours male maturation at small body sizes. Conversely, greater fecundity at larger body size in females argues for larger females. The postulated composite model presented here fills a knowledge gap by graphically illustrating the factors affecting inter-and intra-specific variation. These differences include the modelling of mean inter-population shell size, as well as the regulation of intra-population sex size ratios. The components of this new model can be applied to a wider range of sexually dimorphic organisms to explain the evolutionary factors involved in regulating the observed sexual dimorphism.

AB  - The evolution of cooperation requires more benefits of group living than solitary lifestyle. However, to some degree, our understanding about the benefits is hindered by abstract debates over theoretical and experimental evidences of individual selection or group selection because it is difficult to examine the actual benefits at the group level. Moreover, group density is a crucial ecological factor which deeply affects group reproduction and survival, few studies have been performed in social insects. Here, we study the effects of worker density on group direct benefits in the termite species Reticulitermes chinensis. The termite R. chinensis is an ideal model which lives with a high worker density in wood. We used the quantity of eggs and the total biomass (biomass of all group members) accumulation as two components of group benefits. We investigated the group benefits in the context of worker density according to eleven worker densities, and we measured the group benefits and the resource consumption with the same group members in two types of artificial nest areas. Moreover, we counted the stomodeal trophallaxis occurrences from any workers to queens under three worker densities to explore the degree of cooperation according to worker density. We found that both the number of eggs and the total biomass accumulation significantly increased with increasing worker density in groups. Furthermore, the consumption of resources was similar between groups with the same number of individuals gathered in small or large nest areas, but the production of eggs and the biomass accumulation were higher in groups of small nest areas than in large nest areas. Additionally, we found the stomodeal trophallaxis behavior significantly increased in higher worker density groups. Our results suggest that the group benefits influenced by the high worker density may at least partially explain the group living of eusocial insects in ecology.

AB  - Organisms move across landscapes mediating nutrient, energy, and biomass exchanges. Meta-ecosystem ecology offers a framework to study how these flows affect ecosystem functions in space and time. How-ever, meta-ecosystem models often represent consumer movement as diffusion along gradients of resources. Crucially, this assumes that consumer movement connects the same trophic compartments among patches of the same ecosystem. Yet, empirical evidence shows that organisms move across different ecosystems and connect diverse trophic compartments in diffusive and non-diffusive ways. Here, we derive a two-patch meta-ecosystem model that accounts for both types of organismal movement, and we investigate their influences on local and meta-ecosystem functions. We apply a novel approach, modelling consumer movement through a dispersers' pool that captures the fraction of moving organisms and allows us to partition local and regional dynamics. We show that non-diffusive consumer movement increases landscape heterogeneity while diffusive consumer movement enhances source-sink dynamics. Local ecosystem differences driven by consumer movement type are less prevalent at meta-ecosystem extents. Thus, movement type is essential for predicting local ecosystem dynamics. Our results support recent calls to consider explicitly the role of consumers in shaping and maintaining ecosystem functions across spatial extents.

AB  - Grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella, is the largest freshwater aquaculture fish species worldwide. However, its environmental impacts are increasingly controversial. In this paper, we considered the production of a 1500 g commercial grass carp as an example, analyzed through a life cycle assessment. The results showed that the indicators of global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, eutrophication potential, freshwater eco-toxicity potential (FAETP), land competition (LC), and fossil energy consumption of producing 1 kg of grass carp were equivalent to 5.7267 kg of CO2, 0.0648 kg of 1,4-DCB0, 0.0010 kg of P, 0.0276 kg of SO2, 8.2951 m(2), 0.3491 kg of oil, respectively, and were mainly from feed processing and water pollution. Compared with pig, beef, and sheep production, grass carp production has lower environmental impacts, but in terms of GWP, FAETP, and LC were significantly higher than chicken production, especially water pollution and discharge, which is an important consideration. This study clarifies the direction of grass carp production and key focus areas include producing low carbon and nitrogen emission feed, application of ecological engineering aquaculture system, intelligent mechanization technology and equipment.

AB  - The negative relationship between body size and population density in mammals is often interpreted as resulting from energetic constraints. In a global change scenario, however, this relationship might be expected to change, given the size-dependent nature of anthropogenic pressures and vulnerability to extinction. Here we test whether the size-density relationship (SDR) in mammals has changed over the last 50 years. We show that the relationship has shifted down and became shallower, corresponding to a decline in population density of 31-73%, for the largest and smallest mammals, respectively. However, the SDRs became steeper in some groups (e.g. carnivores) and shallower in others (e.g. herbivores). The Anthropocene reorganisation of biotic systems is apparent in macroecological relationships, reinforcing the notion that biodiversity pattens are contingent upon conditions at the time of investigation. We call for an increased attention to the role of global change on macroecological inferences.

AB  - Although most mammals live in terrestrial environments, it is difficult to see them in the wild. However, there is a wide variety of techniques for their detection. Currently, camera trapping is the most widely used non-invasive detection technique for terrestrial mammals. Thus, we used this methodology to determine the optimal variables to carry out assessments of mammals by camera trapping in the wild. Therefore, we placed 20 camera traps in Os Montes do Invernadeiro Natural Park (Ourense, Galicia) between 2016 and 2020, resulting in 8044 records, including photographs and videos. We found significant differences in the frequency of records across categories of season, period, lunar cycle, location, habitat and sex. Atmospheric temperature, location, and period were the most influential variables in correlating detection events for different species. A generalized linear model (GLM) analysis revealed a higher number of records in deciduous and pine forests, during summer and autumn, and on nights of waxing and waning moon that holds for both predators, such as Iberian wolf, red fox, pine marten and European wildcat, and prey, such as red deer, wild boar, European roe deer and Iberian hare. Predators were observed more frequently at crossroads, whereas prey tended to avoid these areas. However, it can be stated that there are optimal climatic, such as the temperature, environmental, such as the habitat, and seasonal conditions to carry out camera trapping studies on mammal species. Altogether, understanding the optimal conditions for camera trapping of different mammal species could ultimately reduce the sampling effort.

AB  - The coexistence of ecologically similar species is facilitated by differential use of resources along habitat, diet, and/or temporal niche axes. We used feces of non-native rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), hare (Lepus europaeus), goat (Capra hircus), and the native plains viscacha (Lagostomus maximus) to compare the utilization of spatial and trophic resources in an arid ecosystem of Argentina. We expected herbivores to present differential responses in the use of at least one of the niche axes (habitat and/or trophic) associated with seasonal changes in resource availability and according to the origin of the species (native, non-native). We evaluated habitat use and selection through Chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests and Bonferroni confidence intervals, and factors shaping habitat selection (particular components of the habitat type) using generalized linear mixed-effects models. We analyzed the seasonal compositions of diets, breadth of trophic niches, and dietary overlaps. The assemblage of herbivores did not segregate markedly in spatial resource use, showing that hares and goats were more generalist than rabbits and plains viscacha in the utilization of different habitat types. Native and non-native herbivores overlapped markedly in the trophic niche dimension but segregated to some degree in the use of space during wet and dry seasons. The four herbivores shared a similar diet composition. Among dietary items, grasses contributed high percentages during the wet season. Under conditions of resource limitation (dry season), the native plains viscacha differed in feeding strategy from the non-native herbivores. These results deepen our understanding of likely underlying mechanisms that allow coexistence of native and non-native herbivores in an arid ecosystem.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of natural products derived from two mangrove soil bacteria, GP521A and GP3R5, in anthracnose management in oil tea. Based on 16s rDNA sequencing, GP521A and GP3R5 were identified as Bacillus velezensis and Pseudoalteromonas caenipelagi, respectively. Both bacteria showed strong antagonistic effects towards multiple fungal pathogens on dual cultural plates. The ethyl acetate extracts of fermentation cultures of GP521A (FEGP5) and GP3R5 (FEGP3) significantly inhibited mycelial growth of both Colletotrichum camelliae MC171, C. fructicola CF-1 and Pyricularia oryzae P131 at 100 and 200 mu g/mL, respectively. Furthermore, FEGP5 and FEGP3 significantly inhibited conidiation, conidial germination and appressorial formation in C. camelliae MC171 at 50 mu g/mL, with stronger inhibitory effects observed in the latter. On detached oil tea leaves, 100 mu g/mL of FEGP5 and FEGP3 resulted in similar to 98.0% and 97.5% reduction in diseased areas, respectively, when applied before MC171 inoculation, whereas the reduction was approximately 55.0% and 77.6%, respectively, in the curative treatments. In fresh fruits, both extracts also significantly inhibited disease development, either in preventative or curative treatments. Moreover, FEGP5 and FEGP3 demonstrated significantly lower aquatic toxicity than prochloraz at the same concentrations towards a commonly used bioindicator, Artemia salina. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential of marine microbes derived natural products in development of environmentally compatible biopesticides to control anthracnose in oil tea.

AB  - Plants and insects are two of the more diverse and abundant organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. The fossil record of plant-insect interactions offers crucial insights into the coevolutionary dynamics between these groups, shedding light on the intricate relationships that have shaped terrestrial ecosystems. The study of fossil interactions is especially relevant in mid-Cretaceous ecosystems, a time of dramatic changes in the composition of floras and, consequently, in plant-insect relationships. Here, we describe the first suite of plant-insect interactions from the mid-Cretaceous of Mexico. We studied 554 plant fossils from the El Chango Lagerst & auml;tte (Cintalapa Formation, Chiapas, Mexico), including vegetative (leaves) and reproductive structures (fruits and seeds). The flora was dominated by gymnosperms (89.3%) followed by angiosperms (10.7%); other groups, such as pteridophytes and bryophytes, were absent. In total, 5.4% of the plant specimens hosted some damage. Angiosperms (all broad-leafed forms), despite being much less common than gymnosperms, expressed more evidence of damage by herbivores (35.6% of specimens damaged). In contrast, the narrow-leafed gymnosperms, the dominant group in the flora, hosted a much lower proportion of herbivory damage (1.8% of specimens damaged). The diversity of damage types (DTs) was relatively low: 14 DTs were identified, corresponding to seven FFGs, including margin feeding, hole feeding, surface feeding, piercing and sucking, oviposition, galling, and mining. Comparison with the other mid-Cretaceous plant-insect assemblages reveals a similar richness of DTs for angiosperms but a lower richness and diversity of DTs on gymnosperms from El Chango. These results indicate preferential herbivory on angiosperms (rather than on the available gymnosperms in the assemblage) by terrestrial arthropods during a period of major changes in the structure of terrestrial ecosystems. However, it is challenging to resolve whether this apparent preference is because insects particularly targeted angiosperms or if the herbivores simply targeted broad leaves in general, since most of the available gymnosperms from El Chango are scale-leafed forms.

AB  - Algorithm design and implementation for the detection of large herbivores from low-altitude (200 m-350 m) UAV remote sensing images faces two key problems: (1) the size of a single image from the UAV is too large, and the mainstream algorithm cannot adapt to it, and (2) the number of animals in the image is very small and densely distributed, which makes the model prone to missed detection. This paper proposes the following solutions: For the problem of animal size, we optimized the Faster-RCNN algorithm in terms of three aspects: selecting a HRNet feature extraction network that is more suitable for small target detection, using K-means clustering to obtain the anchor frame size that matches the experimental object, and using NMS to eliminate detection frames that have sizes inconsistent with the size range of the detection target after the algorithm generates the target detection frames. For image size, bisection segmentation was used when training the model, and when using the model to detect the whole image, we propose the use of a new overlapping segmentation detection method. The experimental results obtained for detecting yaks, Tibetan sheep (Tibetana folia), and the Tibetan wild ass in remote sensing images of low-altitude UAV from Maduo County, the source region of the Yellow River, show that the mean average precision (mAP) and average recall (AR) of the optimized Faster-RCNN algorithm are 97.2% and 98.2%, respectively, which are 9.5% and 12.1% higher than the values obtained by the original Faster-RCNN. In addition, the results obtained from applying the new overlap segmentation method to the whole UAV image detection process also show that the new overlap segmentation method can effectively solve the problems of the detection frames not fitting the target, missing detection, and creating false alarms due to bisection segmentation.

AB  - Diversification of agroecosystems through mixed cropping can facilitate multiple ecosystem services that may improve yields. Intercrops may repel pests and nourish natural enemies while trap crops lure pests away from target crops. A small-scale agricultural field experiment was conducted in 2018 and 2020 in Finland to study how intercropping of brassicaceous plants and faba bean (Vicia faba) affects yield and quality of a target crop (white cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata)), herbivory on the target crop, and effects of the insect communities linked to the observations. The study was conducted with five different plot arrangements in each year. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) or turnip (Brassica rapa var. rapa) were located at the perimeters of 6 x 6 m plots as trap crops. They were planted either alone or with yellow rocket (Barbarea sp). Faba bean was planted as an intercrop in the most complex designs. Cabbage head fresh weight was greatest in the most complex plot type, which included cabbage, broccoli, yellow rocket and faba bean and the head weight was significantly greater than in the cabbage monocrop or the plots with a broccoli-only trap crop. Turnip was included in the experiment in 2020 and efficiently attracted flea beetles and pollen beetles. In 2020, the turnip trap crop alone and the most complicated designs with broccoli or turnip combined with yellow rocket and faba bean significantly reduced P. xylostella abundance in the middle of the plot. Possibilities to use trait-based cropping systems in white cabbage production are discussed.

AB  - A study was conducted to identify whether composted manure and straw amendments (replacement of a portion of chemical fertilizer [50% of the total nitrogen application] with composted pig manure, and straw return [all straw from the previous rice crop] combined with chemical fertilizer) compared with no fertilization and chemical fertilizer only would change the dominant species of wheat-associated weeds as well as influence their growth and seed yield in a rice (Oryza sativa L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation system. The study was initiated in 2010, and the treatment effects on the species, density, plant height, shoot biomass, seed yield of dominant weeds, and wheat yields were assessed in 2017 and 2018. Fertilization significantly increased the height, density, and yield of wheat, as well as the shoot biomass of wheat-associated weeds, but decreased the weed species number. A total of 17 and 14 weed species were recorded in the experimental wheat fields in 2017 and 2018, respectively. The most dominant weed species were American sloughgrass [Beckmannia syzigachne (Steud.) Fernald] and catchweed bedstraw (Galium aparine L.), which made up more than 64% of the weed community in all treatments. When the chemical fertilizer application was amended with pig manure compost and straw return, the relative abundance of B. syzigachne significantly decreased, while the relative abundance of G. aparine significantly increased. The application of the chemical fertilizer-only treatment resulted in increases in the density, shoot biomass, and seed yield of B. syzigachne, while the composted manure and straw amendments applied together with chemical fertilizer led to significant increases in the density, shoot biomass, and seed yield of G. aparine. Consequently, further research on ways to promote greater cropping system diversity will be needed to prevent the selection of weed species that are adapted to a limited suite of crop management practices.

AB  - Ruminants are critical to global food security as they transform lignocellulosic biomass into high-quality protein products. The rumen microbes ferment feed to provide necessary energy and nutrients for the ruminant host. However, we still lack insight into the metabolic processes encoded by most rumen microbial populations. In this study, we implemented metagenomic binning approaches to recover 2,809 microbial genomes from cattle, sheep, moose, deer, and bison. By clustering genomes based on average nucleotide identity, we demonstrate approximately one-third of the metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to represent species not present in current reference databases and rumen microbial genome collections. Combining these MAGs with other rumen genomic datasets permitted a phylogenomic characterization of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from 8,160 rumen microbial genomes, including the identification of 195 lanthipeptides and 5,346 diverse gene clusters for nonribosomal peptide biosynthesis. A subset of Prevotella and Selenomonas BGCs had higher expression in steers with lower feed efficiency. Moreover, the microdiversity of BGCs was fairly constant across types of BGCs and cattle breeds. The reconstructed genomes expand the genomic representation of rumen microbial lineages, improve the annotation of multi-omics data, and link microbial populations to the production of secondary metabolites that may constitute a source of natural products for manipulating rumen fermentation. Anderson and Fernando use metagenomic binning approaches to reconstruct 2,809 microbial metagenome-assembled genomes from ruminants, and perform phylogenomic analyses on the biosynthetic gene clusters from over 8,000 total rumen microbial genomes. These genomes provide insight into the relationship between microbial populations and the production of secondary metabolites that may be important for manipulating rumen fermentation.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions (HWI) are one of the most highly studied topics from the fields of wildlife management and are reported to be increasing globally as anthropogenic lands uses expand into wild lands, especially in mountainous areas where forest habitats are in the proximity of human settlements. The upper Prahova Valley in south-central Romania provides habitat to several native charismatic wildlife species. Since 1990 this area has become a major tourist destination now characterized by a high density of major transport infrastructures and homes. To assess how the changes in land use have affected HWIs, from September 2018 to August 2019, we discussed with 370 local citizens from the cities of Sinaia, Busteni and Predeal. We developed maps of wildlife habitat fragmentation and connectivity and superimposed them over the locations with the HWI hotspots. According to the results, over 50% of the hotspots identified where located in areas exhibiting the greatest level of fragmentation, and the species frequently involved in interactions were the brown bear (Ursus arctos), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes). The maps suggest that habitat fragmentation could represent a primal cause for the regions' high frequency of animal descents into settlements, since wildlife habitats and ecological corridors are affected by the fragmentation of anthropogenic infrastructures especially in the proximity of major settlements. As a conclusion, our results highlight the need for sustainable landscape planning in order to optimize biodiversity management and diminish interactions between humans and wild animals, based on: a) mapping the areas characterized by high quality wildlife habitats and including them into a system of strict protection, b) developing or enhancing wildlife ecological corridors to favour animal movement between intact ecosystems, and c) regulating the expansion of human infrastructures in the proximity of strictly protected habitats.

AB  - Scavenging is a widespread feeding strategy involving a diversity of taxa from different trophic levels, from apex predators to obligate scavengers. Scavenger species play a crucial role in ecosystem functioning by removing carcasses, recycling nutrients and preventing disease spread. Understanding the trophic roles of scavenger species can help identify specialized species with unique roles and species that may be more vulnerable to ecological changes. To identify species with specialized roles, we studied three scavenger networks (one in north temperate Spain and two in central-south Mediterranean Spain) that comprised 25 scavenger species (65% birds and 35% mammals), consuming carcasses of four wild ungulate species. We characterized the trophic role of a species by combining four species-level network metrics (normalized degree, specialization, closeness, and betweenness centrality) into a single centrality metric, quantifying how scavenger species interact with carcass species within their ecological network. Higher centrality indicates the species feeds on a greater variety of carcasses and may contribute more to carrion consumption than species with lower centrality, which have more peripheral and specialized roles. The griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) and the azure-winged magpie (Cyanopica cyanus) had the highest centrality. In contrast, the red kite (Milvus milvus) in the northern site had the lowest centrality, and the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) was among the most peripheral species for all three networks. In general, scavengers with large home ranges and nocturnal or crepuscular activity patterns tended to have more central roles, whereas species that forage silently tended to have more peripheral roles. Changes in species' centrality between sites and the high centrality of species with large home ranges suggest that management strategies in one location can have implications that extend beyond, highlighting the need to implement coordinated transboundary protection efforts to ensure the resilience and functionality of scavenger networks and derived ecosystem services.

AB  - Simple Summary Kecai yaks are an important genetic resource in Gansu Province, China. These yaks, produced through the crossbreeding of Gannan yaks and wild yaks, exhibit excellent production performance and high fecundity. Despite these beneficial characteristics, the genetic characteristics, population structure, and other properties of Kecai yaks have not been effectively characterized to date. Accordingly, this study was developed to explore the genetic diversity and population structure of Kecai yaks through whole-genome resequencing. These analyses ultimately revealed the status of Kecai yaks as an independent group within the overall Chinese yak population. Kecai yaks are regarded as an important genetic resource in China owing to their high fecundity and flavorful meat. However, the genetic characteristics of Kecai yaks have not been effectively characterized to date, and the relationship between Kecai yaks and other yak breeds remains to be fully characterized. In this paper, the resequencing of the Kecai yak genome is performed leading to the identification of 11,491,383 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Through principal component, phylogenetic, and population genetic structure analyses based on these SNPs, Kecai yaks were confirmed to represent an independent population of yaks within China. In this study, marker and functional enrichment analysis of genes related to positive selection in Kecai yak was carried out, and the results show that such selection in Kecai yaks is associated with the adaptation to alpine environments and the deposition of muscle fat. Overall, these results offer a theoretical foundation for the future utilization of Kecai yak genetic resources.

AB  - Context Native mammals continue to suffer widespread and severe declines across northern Australia's tropical savannas. There is an increasing body of evidence that the primary driver of these declines is predation by feral cats (Felis catus) and that this is exacerbated by high-severity disturbance regimes (frequent high-intensity fires, and grazing and trampling by exotic megaherbivores) that simplify habitat, thereby increasing hunting efficiency. The large islands off the northern Australian coast - where some threats are either reduced or absent - provide a means of testing the conceptual model's predictions. Aims To compare the trajectory and distribution of native mammal populations on two large, adjacent islands with markedly different disturbance regimes. Methods In 2020 and 2021, we resurveyed 111 historical sites across the two largest of the Tiwi Islands, Bathurst Island (42 sites) and Melville Island (69 sites) that were previously surveyed between 2000 and 2002. The Melville Island sites had also been resurveyed in 2015. We used the same live trapping method used in 2000-2002, supplemented with camera trapping. Key results On Bathurst Island, feral cats are rare, and we found no significant decrease in native mammal trap success or species richness, and the threatened brush-tailed rabbit-rat (Conilurus penicillatus melibius) appears stable. Conversely, cats occurred at relatively high abundance on Melville Island, and there was a 52% decline in trap success, a 47% reduction in species richness, and a 93% decline in trap success for the brush-tailed rabbit-rat over the 20-year period. The highest decreases in native mammal abundance and richness were in areas that were frequently burnt and had higher activity of feral cats. In contrast, in the absence of cats on Bathurst Island, native mammal abundance increased in frequently burnt areas. Conclusions While Bathurst Island remains one of Australia's most important refuges for native mammals, neighbouring Melville Island is experiencing severe and ongoing mammal decline. We contend that this pattern primarily reflects the high abundance of cats on Melville Island compared to Bathurst Island.

AB  - Studies on the daily activity patterns of species can contribute to gaining an understanding of community ecology. During the warm seasons of the years 2019 to 2021, we used camera traps to monitor the activity patterns of water deer Hydropotes inermis, roe deer Capreolus pygargus, and Amur goral Naemorhedus caudatus in the Seoraksan and Jirisan National Parks, South Korea. We compared activity patterns among pairs of sympatric species in each area, as well as those of water deer and roe deer populations inhabiting the two parks. Overlaps in activity patterns were estimated based on kernel density function and overlap coefficient analyses, and activity pattern distributions were compared using Watson's two-sample test. We detected an overlap of the activity patterns of sympatric species and established that there were no significant differences in the distribution of activity patterns in the two areas. However, we detected differences between the Seoraksan and Jirisan sites with respect to the activity patterns of water deer particularly their patterns of nocturnal activity, which could be attributable to differences in community inter-specific interactions and food resources for water deer inhabiting the Seoraksan and Jirisan National Parks.

AB  - The authors examine present and past drivers of ungulate migratory behaviour, finding that current migratory ungulates are larger, more grass-dependent and live at higher latitudes on average than non-migrants, and that migration probably emerged after the rise of C-4 grasslands and increased seasonality towards the poles.
   Ungulate migrations are crucial for maintaining abundant populations and functional ecosystems. However, little is known about how or why migratory behaviour evolved in ungulates. To investigate the evolutionary origins of ungulate migration, we employed phylogenetic path analysis using a comprehensive species-level phylogeny of mammals. We found that 95 of 207 extant ungulate species are at least partially migratory, with migratory behaviour originating independently in 17 lineages. The evolution of migratory behaviour is associated with reliance on grass forage and living at higher latitudes wherein seasonal resource waves are most prevalent. Indeed, originations coincide with mid-Miocene cooling and the subsequent rise of C-4 grasslands. Also, evolving migratory behaviour supported the evolution of larger bodies, allowing ungulates to exploit new ecological space. Reconstructions of migratory behaviour further revealed that seven of ten recently extinct species were probably migratory, suggesting that contemporary migrations are important models for understanding the ecology of the past.

AB  - One mechanism proposed to explain high species diversity in tropical systems is strong negative conspecific density dependence (CDD), which reduces recruitment of juveniles in proximity to conspecific adult plants. Although evidence shows that plant-specific soil pathogens can drive negative CDD, trees also form key mutualisms with mycorrhizal fungi, which may counteract these effects. Across 43 large-scale forest plots worldwide, we tested whether ectomycorrhizal tree species exhibit weaker negative CDD than arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species. We further tested for conmycorrhizal density dependence (CMDD) to test for benefit from shared mutualists. We found that the strength of CDD varies systematically with mycorrhizal type, with ectomycorrhizal tree species exhibiting higher sapling densities with increasing adult densities than arbuscular mycorrhizal tree species. Moreover, we found evidence of positive CMDD for tree species of both mycorrhizal types. Collectively, these findings indicate that mycorrhizal interactions likely play a foundational role in global forest diversity patterns and structure.

AB  - Background Human-monkey conflict exists in different forms all over the world and is experienced more in developing countries. The conflict between human and grivet monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops) ranks among the main threats to biodiversity conservation and has become frequent and severe in different parts of Africa. A study on population size and human-grivet monkey conflict in Zegie Peninsula was carried out from August 2019 to March 2020; the study comprised both the wet and dry seasons. The line transect method was used to collect data on the population size of grivet monkeys. Questionnaires and focus group discussions were used to study the human-grivet monkey conflict and its conservation status. Results The estimated population of grivets in the study area was 5046. Population structure of grivets indicated that there were 637 adult males, 1246 adult females, 1839 juveniles, and 1324 infants. The number of grivets in different habitat was; 1925 grivets in agricultural area, 1568 in lakeshore, 988 in forest and 565 grivets in shrub. Grivet population estimate between the wet and dry seasons did not show significant differences (chi(2) = 0.941, df = 1, p > 0.05). But there was a significant difference in the population estimate of grivets among the different habitats (chi(2) = 239.135, df = 3, p < 0.05 and among their age/sex (chi(2) = 504.102, df = 3, p < 0.05. Based on the questionnaire result the most problematic crop pests in the area were grivet monkeys (96.4%), bush pigs (52.3%), porcupine (46.3%) and squirrels cover (33.2%). The result of discussions held with focus groups and questionnaires in the study area showed that grivet monkeys damage crops (98.4%), chicken depredation (49.5%), steal and snatch human food (32%), disturbing communities (11.3%) in the area. Most (62%) of the respondents noted that guava is the most vulnerable crop followed by papaya, mango, avocado to be damaged by grivet monkeys. Conclusion The total number of grivet monkey in the study area is 5046. The number of grivet monkeys varies based on their sex/age and their habitat type. There is no significant difference in their number according to season since the movement of grivets is restricted to the area (there is no migration in the area). The increasing population number leads the occurrence of human grivet monkey conflict in the area and this inversely affects grivet monkeys. There was a human-grivet monkey conflict in the Peninsula and grivets damaged crops, not only crops but also predating poultry, stealing eggs, and human food. Consequently, grivets were killed in response to the damage they caused to crops. Grivet's habitat in the Peninsula is highly disturbed because the local people cut trees for sale to support their livelihood. Awareness creation of the residents about wildlife and their habitat is necessary, and people should understand the impact of deforestation, illegal hunting, and the role of grivets in the ecosystem at large. Hence there is a need to protect the forest in order to ensure sustainable conservation of biodiversity in general and grivet monkeys in particular.

AB  - Animal gut microbiomes are critical to host physiology and fitness. The gut microbiomes of fishes-the most abundant and diverse vertebrate clade-have received little attention relative to other clades. Coral reef fishes, in particular, make up a wide range of evolutionary histories and feeding ecologies that are likely associated with gut microbiome diversity. The repeated evolution of herbivory in fishes and mammals also allows us to examine microbiome similarity in relationship to diet across the entire vertebrate tree of life. Here, we generate a large coral reef fish gut microbiome dataset (n = 499 samples, 19 species) and combine it with a diverse aggregation of public microbiome data (n = 447) to show that host diet drives significant convergence between coral reef fish and mammalian gut microbiomes. We demonstrate that this similarity is largely driven by carnivory and herbivory and that herbivorous and carnivorous hosts exhibit distinct microbial compositions across fish and mammals. We also show that fish and mammal gut microbiomes share prominent microbial taxa, including Ruminoccocus spp. and Akkermansia spp., and predicted metabolic pathways. Despite the major evolutionary and ecological differences between fishes and mammals, our results reveal that their gut microbiomes undergo similar dietary selective pressures. Thus, diet, in addition to phylosymbiosis must be considered even when comparing the gut microbiomes of distantly related hosts.

AB  - The Community-Based Conservation (CBC) approach views local people as interested parties who should actively participate in and control conservation efforts, which contrasts with the conventional 'fortress conservation' common in government-protected areas isolated from human disturbance. The transition from fortress conservation to CBC, however, has not been a smooth journey for many African countries, especially in the sub-Saharan Africa region. This is because, in some cases, local communities do not see themselves as part of the governance structure of these conservancies, which affects the long-term ecological sustainability of the conservancies. Using eight (8) conservancies in the arid and semi-arid counties of Isiolo and Samburu, Kenya, this study used exploratory research to gather data from 24 Focus Group Discussions (FDGs) and forty-eight (48) key informant interviews (KIIs) to assess the influence of communities' involvement on ecological outcomes of the conservancies. Other secondary sources also supported the primary data sources. Our findings showed that the governance model does influence community support for conservancies, and the benefits that communities receive or expect from the conservancies also have a strong influence on their support for conservation. However, it was established that community conservancies have brought positive changes to the wildlife population trends and habitat health. The study recommends the development of the National Rangelands Resources Management Policy and institutional arrangements to strengthen and safeguard the future of wildlife conservation within those conservancies and to provide clarity on the roles of different stakeholders. The study also recommends further studies on the actual impact of governance on community perception, the value of existing investments in community benefits, and the long-term implications of climate change impacts on conservancy ecosystems.

AB  - The Hebrides of Scotland constitute a unique set of island environments with a long history of human settlement and agriculture. Earthworm community surveys were undertaken in selected agricultural landscapes of Inner (Isle of Rum) and Outer (North and South Uist) Hebrides. On North Uist, earthworms were sampled from areas of Blackland (organic, anthropic, acidic agricultural soils) and on South Uist in machair (sandy, fertile, low-lying grassy pasture). Specific grassland and cultivated areas with various organic additions - including dung and seaweed - were targeted, using hand-sorting of soil for earthworms plus mustard vermifuge extraction. Work on Rum investigated earthworms in ridge and furrow (lazybed) agricultural systems, abandoned almost 200 years ago and since uncultivated, but grazed by ungulates. On the Uists, nine earthworm species were identified, representing all three ecological categories, but dominated by the epigeics, Dendrobaena octaedra and Lumbricus rubellus. Densities and biomasses across Blackland soils ranged from 10-130 ind. m- 2 and 2.3-33.7 g m- 2, respectively. Here, 5 species were present, and management had a significant effect on species richness and abundance with most earthworms present in recently restored lazybeds. In the machair soils, the corresponding measurements were 4-220 ind. m- 2 and 0.8-89.0 g m- 2. Significantly higher earthworm densities and biomasses were recovered below cattle dung pats compared with dung-free areas. Cultivated areas in machair were less diverse and had lower earthworm densities than uncultivated. On Rum, ridge and furrow abundances did not differ clearly with 24-102 and 34-112 ind. m- 2 respectively and biomasses of 7.4-26.3 and 8.8-30.8 g m- 2. Here, Aporrectodea caliginosa (49%), L. rubellus (23%) and Dendrodrilus rubidus (19%) dominated of the seven species found. Further research on earthworms in the Hebrides is warranted.

AB  - Peccaries (collared peccary-CP-and white-lipped peccary-WLP) are an essential source of protein and income for rural communities in the Amazon region. Since 1980s, researchers in the Amazon have reported recurrent local disappearances of WLP populations. Although such disappearances impact the species conservation and the food security of rural societies, no studies have drawn consistent conclusions about the causes of these population collapses. However, it has recently been proposed that the overabundance of this species before its decline would be related to infectious disease outbreaks. In the current study, we aimed to determine the circulation (occurrence and exposure) of viruses relevant to swine health in CP and WLP populations, namely classical swine fever virus (CSFV), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV), swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), and porcine circoviruses (PCV). The study was conducted in two areas of the northeastern Peruvian Amazon: the Yavar & iacute;-Mir & iacute;n River basin (2008 -2020), where WLPs experienced extreme population fluctuations, and the Pucacuro National Reserve (2012-2014), where no WLP disappearances have been reported. Since WLP is not easily found during population declines, we also sampled CP as an indicator of virus circulation in the area as they are likely to be susceptible to the same pathogens. CSFV and ADV antibodies were detected in both peccary species and both areas. Diseases caused by CSFV and ADV have the potential to act as ultimate causes of population collapse, especially in large WLP populations where overabundance could increase the rate of pathogen transmission. Our results were inconclusive in establishing whether or not these viruses drove the WLP population to collapse, but their potential role warrants deeper investigation, expanding the geographical coverage of studies on infectious diseases in peccaries.

AB  - This study evaluates the marine capture fisheries of Ratnagiri, focusing on ecosystem-based indicators, using data collected from the Mirkarwada landing centre. Trophic level-based indicators and trends in catch composition were analyzed over five-year intervals from 1999 to 2017. The assessment of total catch data based on trophic guilds revealed that under Criterion 1, 'omni - carnivores' dominated the catch (44%) while 'top predators' contributed the least (10%), with increasing trends observed for 'herbi - omnivores' and declines for 'higher carnivores' and 'top predators'; under Criterion 2, 'mid - level carnivores' accounted for the highest catch (39%) and 'omnivores' the lowest (< 1%), showing rising trends for 'herbivores and detritivores' and declining trends for 'top predators,' 'high - level carnivores,' and 'omnivores.' The Mean Trophic Index (MTI) exhibited moderate to strong declining trends over the 18-year period, ranging from 2.82 to 3.53, with a negative rate of change in nine years. The Fishing in Balance (FiB) index also declined, ranging from - 0.72 to 0.92, indicating a shift toward lower trophic-level species. Stock exploitation analysis of 33 species/groups revealed that 31% were 'abundant,' while 27% and 6% were categorized as 'declining' and 'depleted,' respectively. Declines in high-trophic-level species and reliance on lower trophic guilds highlight the need for sustainable fisheries management through ecosystem-based approaches using MTI and FiB to ensure long-term marine resource sustainability in Ratnagiri, Northwest Coast of India.

AB  - Hybridization between native and introduced species is one of the most important reasons underlying the impact on biodiversity exerted by biological invasions and also one of the hardest to be detected. The East-Asian sika deer Cervus nippon has been introduced to several European countries, where it is known to generate fertile offspring with the congeneric native red deer C. elaphus, threatening its local populations with genetic pollution. Most studies on hybrid populations have been carried out in northern and eastern Europe, whereas introductions of this deer and their effects are still poorly known in Southern countries. In this study, we updated the distribution of sika deer in Italy, where the species has been present since at least 25 years ago, but where no formal assessment has ever been conducted. We confirm the occurrence of sika deer genes in formerly pure red-deer populations in central Italy by means of genetic analyses. Further range expansion of invasive sika deer and red x sika deer hybrids is likely to lead to further hybridisations and introgression, with implications for the genetic integrity of native red deer populations.

AB  - Herbivory is a fundamental process regulating the functioning of the ecosystems both in land and marine systems. Few decades ago, herbivory was thought to play only a minor role in seagrass dominated areas, while currently its importance has risen. However, the complex interrelationships between seagrasses and their consumers are not yet fully understood. For instance, seagrasses can tune up morphological, biomechanical, nutritional, and chemical traits in order to reduce the palatability of their leaves and therefore curtail tissue losses, but the final tradeoff of such changes may depend on herbivore guilds. This work focuses on the relative importance of nutritional versus chemical traits in the feeding behavior of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a temperate generalist mesograzer, over two sympatric seagrass species (Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera noltei). To do that, a set of no-choice and multiple-choice feeding assays were conducted using freeze-dried plants agarbased diets (i.e. whole nutritional properties), polar extracts of both species (i.e. soluble sugars and phenolic natural products), purified phenolic natural products, and also three different concentrations of soluble sugars. Later, a chemical identification and quantification of the phenolic natural products present in the extracts were performed to assess their ecological role as deterrents. Results clearly indicated that the feeding behavior of this generalist herbivore, once overlooked the structural, morphological and biomechanical traits, is mainly determined by nutritional properties, while the presence of phenolic compounds has only a minimal effect on its feeding behavior. In addition, although this study showed that sugars had a positive effect over P. lividus consumption rates, we demonstrated for the first time the deterrent properties of rosmarinic acid and the sulphated flavonoids produced by Z. noltei, which were able to reduce the attractive effect of sugars in the feeding preference of this generalist herbivore.

AB  - Recovering seagrass ecosystems through restoration has become impellent to re-establish their functionality and services. Although the use of seedlings may represent an appropriate solution, little information is provided on the seedling-based restoration effectiveness with influence of biotic and abiotic interactions. Survival, morphological development and leaf total phenol content of transplanted Posidonia oceanica seedlings were evaluated under different origin, thermal regimes and herbivore pressure through a five-months field experiment in two MPAs, located on the west (cold) and east (warm) Sardinia coast to explore the effectiveness of seedling-based restoration. Seedlings originated from the two coasts responded differently to thermal regime site and herbivory pressure, as the warm-adapted ones survived less but developed more (and vice-versa) and resisted to the herbivory pressure increasing their phenol content, thus showing compensating responses. This study provided information on the P. oceanica seedling-based restoration by investigating abiotic and biotic interactions with the transplanted plants. It promotes the collection of beach-cast fruits from different coasts and their transplantation, regardless their origin, with no need of protecting seedlings from predators.

AB  - Wildlife space use is a key component to consider when determining effective conservation and management practices. Home range size and resource selection can vary temporally and spatially depending on mortality risks in the area and access to food resources. Lands used for coal mining can contain unique mortality risks and food resources for American black bears (Ursus americanus) relative to surrounding landscapes due to hunting restrictions, vegetation planted as part of the reclamation process, and other anthropogenic food resources. We examined the influence of mining sites on resource selection of female black bears in southern West Virginia, USA, during 2007 and 2008. We estimated home range size with Brownian Bridge movement models and evaluated variation in home range size with mixed-effects linear regression. We evaluated resource selection with mixed-effects Poisson point process models. On mine sites, the mean 95% home range for female black bears was 1,996 ha (SD = 2,633) in the autumn and 544 ha (SD = 238) in the spring, and on non-mine sites the mean 95% home range was 1,926 ha (SD = 1,292) in the autumn and 771 ha (SD = 480) in the spring. Our resource selection model indicated black bears used nonhunting zones associated with mine lands much greater than their availability, and that black bears in mine areas disproportionately used areas in close proximity to anthropogenic structures. Interannual variation in home range size was likely associated with mast conditions, because smaller home ranges were associated with high mast production. Our data suggest black bears may be using non-hunting zones within mine lands as refugia from hunting and are using anthropogenic food sources available at refuse sites on mine lands, which may increase regional black bear populations in areas with high mining activity.

AB  - The economic impacts of climate-induced heat stress on pig farming have not been sufficiently investigated, despite the significant threat it poses to the industry. In this study, we coupled consecutive years of county-scale meteorological data with operational-level economic data to estimate the impact of climate-induced heat stress on the productivity of the Chinese pig industry using a stochastic frontier production function model. Based on model results, we projected the impact of heat stress on pig production in 2030 and 2050 with and without technological advances. Results showed that heat stress has a significant negative impact on pig production, with southern regions being more affected. However, considering technological advances, losses will decrease by 21 % and 52 %, respectively, compared with the scenario without technological advances. Simultaneously, we calculated the costs of climate change mitigation and adaptation and found that increasing production inputs to reduce production losses from heat stress costs one-fifth of forgoing production losses. Therefore, we recommend a positive climate change response strategy.

AB  - Haleakala National Park and montane areas on east Maui, Hawaiian Archipelago, support critical nesting habitat for endangered 'ua'u Hawaiian petrel Pterodroma sandwichensis. Habitat loss, non-native predators, and damage by feral ungulates are limiting factors for ground-nesting petrels at Haleakala and throughout Hawai'i. Because nesting habitats differ among the Hawaiian Islands, habitat distribution modeling for Hawaiian petrel has been island specific. Based on 2453 known nest site locations, we provide the first landscape-scale predictive model describing relative abundance and habitat available for nesting petrels throughout upper Haleakala (1830 to 3055 m). We evaluated (principal components analyses and Pearson's correlation) 13 spatial landscape and climate predictor variables associated with nest sites and the background landscape followed by random forest modeling to predict nest site density. Six variables (elevation, slope, topographic position index at 2 scales, heat load index, presence-absence ash/cinder, and presence-absence vegetation) indicated nest sites occurred non-randomly throughout the central part of the summit and crater; greatest concentrations were predicted along the crater rim and a ridgeline extending southwest from the summit. Moderately high predicted density occurred in the northeastern and northern crater. Lower elevations to the north, west, and south flanks of Haleakala had relatively fewer predicted nest sites. Although we focused on higher elevations on Haleakala, there is no reason to suspect that conservation efforts would not be successful at lower elevations, provided nesting petrels were protected from invasive predators, grazing ungulates, and significant land alteration.

AB  - Ungulates visually and olfactorily discriminating between vegetation patches in grasslands often encounter re-striction of target visibility due to light intensity changes; however, little is known about their performance in such a context. We developed and tested an apparatus for evaluating the visual and olfactory discrimination ability of cattle under controlled target visibility, focusing on the discrimination at a short distance. The appa-ratus was designed to contain a discrimination target under a sliding cover of variable light transmission levels and behind a vent of a fixed size and aperture so as to control the visibility of the target (14-100% restrictions) while ensuring a constant level of odor. Twelve Japanese Black cows were allowed to choose between two ap-paratuses presenting a pair of targets: green forage versus empty, green forage versus dead forage, or green forage versus green-dead mixture. Cows rapidly learned to slide open the cover to reach the selected target, consistently chose the green forage against the alternative except against the green-dead mixture under 100% visual restriction, and remembered the reaching procedure for at least 16 days. The results indicate the use-fulness of the apparatus for assessing close visual and olfactory discrimination ability of cattle in detail.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of waste valorization of Salicornia straw an alternative feed for shall male sheep. Methods The experiment was carried out in the sheep and goat research station of Iran animal science research institute in the spring of 2018 and for 21 days. A total eight male sheep with fistula were selected and divided into four groups. The experimental diets included a control and three diets containing 7%, 14% and 21% salicornia. Daily feed consumption and digestibility of nutrients were checked by recording the consumed feed and collecting feces. In the final week of the experiment, rumen samples were analyzed to determine pH, ammonia nitrogen, and volatile fatty acids. Results The results showed that the consumption of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crud protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) was not affected by the experimental treatments, but the consumption of ether extract and ash was higher in diets containing Salicornia (P < 0.05). Water consumption increased linearly with increasing Salicornia straw in the diet (P < 0.05). Nutrient digestibility, except for ether extract (P < 0.05), was not affected by the experimental treatments. There was no significant difference between experimental treatments in terms of nitrogen excretion (urine and feces) and nitrogen retention. Three hours after feeding, rumen ammonia nitrogen in sheep-fed diets containing Salicornia increased non-linearly compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Increasing the levels of Salicornia straw in the diet led to a decrease in rumen propionate concentration (P < 0.05), while the concentrations of acetate, butyrate, isobutyrate, valeric, and isovaleric were not affected by the experimental diets. Conclusion Overall, the use of Salicornia straw did not negatively impact feed consumption, digestibility, or fermentation parameters, making it a recommended option for animal feeding.

AB  - Simple Summary Captivity is a common conservation method for endangered animals. However, a growing number of recent studies have shown that some animals in captivity might be in sub-health condition. The gut microbiota has been described as a complex, interactive internal system that has effects on diseases of the host with many interactions, and the occurrence of certain diseases is accompanied by changes and disorder of gut microbiota. We used16S rRNA sequencing technology and a mathematical model to find differences in gut microbiota composition and assembly processes. The results show that captivity might be unfavorable for white-lipped deer by shifting the gut microbiota composition and assembly process. White-lipped deer (Cervus albirostris) is a nationally protected wild animal species in China, as well as a unique and endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Captivity may alleviate the pressure from poaching and contribute to the repopulation and conservation of the population in the wild. The gut microbiota is described as a complex, interactive internal system that has effects on diseases of the host, with many interactions. However, the influence of captivity on the composition and assembly process of gut microbiota in white-lipped deer is unclear. This study applied high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing technology to determine differences in the gut microbiota between captive (CW) and wild (WW) white-lipped deer. We used the null model, neutral community model, and niche width to identify whether captivity affects the composition and assembly process of gut microbiota. The results show that WW has a higher number of Firmicutes and a lower number of Bacteroidetes compared with CW at the phylum level, and it has more opportunistic pathogens and specific decomposition bacteria at the genus level. Principal coordinate analysis also indicated significant differences in the composition and function of gut microbiota in CW and WW. Moreover, the results reveal that captivity shifts the ecological assembly process of gut microbiota by raising the contribution of deterministic processes. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that captivity might potentially have an unfavorable effect on white-lipped deer by continually exerting selective pressure.

AB  - It is well known that bruchids and legumes generally have ecological relationships, such as parasitism and predation; however, little is known about the effects of such relationships on the initial life cycle stages of wild legumes. This study evaluates the effect of Stator pruininus infestation on the germination and early growth of Acacia berlandieri. Germination tests were performed under controlled conditions on healthy seeds, seeds with physical scarification, chemical scarification, damage from larvae, and seeds with eggs. A one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the germination of seeds (percentage, rate, and mean germination time), as well as the early growth of the seedlings (survival, size, and biomass). The percentage of germination in all of the seed categories was greater than 85%, with significant differences (p < 0.05) between seed categories. However, there were no significant differences between seed categories in germination rate or average germination time (p > 0.05). In the early growth of the seedlings, there were significant differences (p < 0.001) between seed categories in the size of the seedling, stem, and root, and in the aboveground and belowground biomass. Based on these results, S. pruininus is not a predator of A. berlandieri, but the damage done to the cotyledons by this insect species can reduce seedling growth and accumulation of biomass in the first days of growth.

AB  - Corn is one of the key grain crops in China and the excessive use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides seriously damages the ecological environment in fields. To explore a more scientific and reasonable way to plant corn and simultaneously reduce the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the impact of corn intercropping with soybean, peanut, and millet, respectively, through five planting patterns, including three intercropping patterns (2 corn rows to 2, 3 and 4 rows of soybean/peanut or 2, 4 and 6 millet rows, respectively) and two monoculture patterns of corn and soybean, peanut or millet under normal (600 kg/ha) and reduced (375 kg/ha) levels of NPK (N:P2O5:K2O = 15:15:15) fertilization on the population abundance and community diversity of insects, leaf nutrients, and induced plant hormones jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) was studied in 2018 and 2019. The results showed that the insect community indexes of the species number (S), the diversity index (H), and the uniformity index (E) generally increased under intercropping and were significantly higher than those under corn monoculture. The prevalence of Asian corn borer (Ostrinia furnacalis) on the intercropping corn plants decreased by based on the average of seven surveys per year for each treatment 2.9 to 17 heads per 30 plants compared with that on the monoculture corn plants. The number of natural enemy insect species on corn plants under intercropping was significantly higher than that under corn monoculture. That is, intercropping may decrease the population of Asian corn borers by increasing S, H, E, and natural enemy insect species (NEI). Moreover, intercropping type and fertilizer level significantly affected corn leaf nutrient contents. Compared with the normal fertilizer level, fertilizer reduction significantly reduced the foliar contents of amino acids, soluble protein, and soluble sugar in corn plants. In addition, corn-soybean and corn-peanut intercropping significantly increased the three nutrient contents in corn leaves compared with corn monoculture. In terms of corn nutrients, intercropping could compensate for the effects of fertilizer reduction. The foliar content of JA in corn-soybean intercropping was significantly higher than in corn monoculture. Under corn-soybean and corn-peanut intercropping, SA was significantly lower than under corn monoculture. Overall, intercropping, not fertilizer reduction, can significantly increase insect community diversity while reducing the population abundances of the key insect pest species on corn plants. Intercropping reduced the SA content, increased amino acids and thus reduced the susceptibility of corn to the pest insects.

AB  - Seed dispersal has become an important component in understanding plant-animal interaction. Recently, there have been concerns about the role of ruminants, particularly browsers, in the dispersal of woody plant seeds. This study aimed to determine whether including Vachellia nilotica seeds in livestock, diets could reduce the spread of viable seeds in the rangelands and control bush encroachment. The shoots and seed pods of Vachellia nilotica were harvested and analyzed for fiber, protein, and mineral nutrients at different seed pods inclusion rates, with or without a feed additive. Six diets were selected for feeding 24 goats and quantifying seed recovery and germination after ingestion. Results indicated that including seed pods and feed additives to Vachellia nilotica shoots significantly improved the quality of the fodder. Chipping the seed pods prior to including them in the diet resulted in 13% intact seed recovery, and approximately 2% of these seeds were recovered after ingestion. These recovered seeds were mostly still viable but were still dormant as seed coats were not sufficiently damaged after ingestion. Therefore, viable seeds may still be dispersed in the rangeland, leading to further bush encroachment.

AB  - Lagoons along the Red Sea are socio-economically important but most vulnerable ecosystems. Strong evaporation, strengthened due to global warming, leads to high salinity and high temperature in surface water, which exacerbate physiological stress in mangroves. Rabigh Lagoon is characterized by unusually large spatial differences in nutrient dynamics and physicochemical parameters. We conducted a multi-approach study to demonstrate how environmental factors cause growth retardation and stress in mangroves. There were significant variations (P < 0.05) in water salinities and temperatures, nitrogen and phosphorus abundance in sediments, and antioxidants in mangroves among 8 sites across the lagoon. Salinity and water temperature rapidly increased from the northern where Red Sea seawater enters to the southern end, but dissolved oxygen declined. High salinity (44.9), high surface water temperature (28.8 degrees C) and relatively high nutrients at the southern end of the lagoon (S8) corresponded to high concentrations of antioxidants. High delta C-13 (-12.4 parts per thousand) and delta N-15 (4.9 parts per thousand) in the sediments at S8 also reveal relatively high nutrient level due to stagnant water, camel grazing, and runoff bringing in fertilizer from agriculture activities in the catchments during seasonal flooding events. Principal component analyses showed that N and P limitation at the lagoon entrance is the leading cause for mangrove stress, while high salinity, temperature, and low dissolved oxygen are the predominant factors for high antioxidants concentrations at the southern end of the lagoon.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) cost millions of euros each year in loss of life and damages. Wildlife crossing structures and fencing are commonly implemented mitigation strategies to reduce WVC and increase landscape connectivity for wildlife. Typically, crossing structures are over- or under-pass structures that allow animals to safely cross the road, while separating them from the road and traffic. An alternative strategy could be an at-grade fauna passage coupled with a Roadside Animal Detection System (RADS). At-grade fauna passages are designated locations where a gap in fencing allows animals to cross over the road, while RADS alert drivers of animals at the upcoming passage, so that they can adjust their driving behaviour accordingly and avoid collisions. In this pilot study, we investigated the use of one at-grade fauna passage by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) in southern Sweden, and compared changes in the number of WVCs before, during and after the construction of the passage. We collected a total of 326 wildlife crossings from 722 individuals over 1 year of monitoring (24 January 2020-24 January 2021). We found that crossing events tended to be dominated by the time animals spent in the roadside verge from which they approached the at-grade fauna passage, particularly for roe deer that spent a lot of time browsing in the roadside verge during dusk. We also found that animals spent longer in the passage if vehicles were present. In our 1 year of surveys, we only recorded three accidents, and when comparing the annual collision statistics before, during, and after construction of the at-grade fauna passage, we demonstrated an overall reduction in collisions by 66%. While our pilot only evaluates a single site, it does provide promising preliminary results that suggest that at-grade fauna passages can help in efforts to reduce collisions, while maintaining connectivity over medium-sized roads for large ungulates.

AB  - Abundant by-products of large swine industries, such as slaughterhouse sludge and carcasses, require adequate treatment to prevent negative effects of their direct disposal in the open environment. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficiency of composting using meal from dead pigs through physicochemical analyses and phytotoxic assays. Five treatments were tested, all including 50% sawdust: T1, with 50% slaughterhouse sludge (control); T2, with 20% slaughterhouse sludge and 30% meal from dead pigs; T3, with 10% slaughterhouse sludge and 40% meal from dead pigs; T4, with 20% organic stabilizing compost and 30% meal from dead pigs and T5, with 30% organic stabilizing compost and 20% meal from dead pigs. The phytotoxicity assays used lettuce, cucumber, celia, soybean, rice and wheat as bioindicators. Inclusion of meal from dead pigs was related to reduction in pH, C/N ratio, humidity and temperatures inside the pile, although thermophilic peaks lasted longer than 50 days and the final composts showed high content of nitrogen and phosphorous. The germination of bioindicators was reduced in all tested treatments, compared to the control. The composts from treatments that included meal from dead pigs presented acceptable nutrient content, which may indicate their use as organic fertilizers. However, after 4 months, all bioindicators in contact with such composts presented impaired germination.

AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances are key factors affecting the distribution and ranging behaviour of wild elephants. Such disturbances exaggerate threats to the survival and population decline of wild elephants, and they have negative consequences for the livelihood of local people. We aimed to identify which factors influence the spatial movement, distribution, and suitable habitats of wild Asian elephants, to examine the relationship between elephant habitat use and human -elephant conflict (HEC) incidents, and to explore whether HEC is caused by habitats preferred by elephants or by human predictors. We used presence-only data from 25 GPS-collared elephants from the southern Rakhine State, Ayeyawady, and Yangon-Bago Regions of Myanmar. Maxent modelling was applied to identify suitable habitats for wild elephants and Manly's selection ratio was calculated to find the most utilised habitats by elephants. The generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were fitted to explore the most liable factors for HEC. The study identified 11,524 km2 of suitable habitat for wild elephants in southwest Myanmar. Results indicated that elevation, distance to water sources, and mean annual precipitation contribute most to the distribution and suitability of wild elephant habitats. Disturbed and degraded forests were highly utilised by elephants. Elephants in less suitable habitats exhibited more aggressive behaviour leading to intense HEC. This suggests that human encroachment into elephant habitats has intensified HEC. We recommend that areas, where larger croplands exist at the lower altitudes near degraded forests and/or water bodies, should be prioritized to monitor and minimize HEC. Elephant habitats in forested areas should be restored and replenished, with water holes and suitable plants provided for the most severely degraded habitats.

AB  - The tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) is a California endemic subspecies that experienced an extreme bottleneck (potentially two individuals) in the mid-1800s. Through active management, including reintroductions, the subspecies has grown to approximately 6000 individuals spread across 22 recognized populations. The populations tend to be localized and separated by unoccupied intervening habitat, prompting targeted translocations to ensure gene flow. However, little is known about the genetic status or connectivity among adjacent populations in the absence of active translocations. We used 19 microsatellites and a sex marker to obtain baseline data on the genetic effective population sizes and functional genetic connectivity of four of these populations, three of which were established since the 1980s and one of which was established similar to 100 years ago. A Bayesian assignment approach suggested the presence of 5 discrete genetic clusters, which corresponded to the four primary populations and two subpopulations within the oldest of them. Effective population sizes ranged from 15 (95% CI 10-22) to 51 (95% CI 32-88). We detected little or no evidence of gene flow among most populations. Exceptions were a signature of unidirectional gene flow to one population founded by emigrants of the other 30 years earlier, and bidirectional gene flow between subpopulations within the oldest population. We propose that social cohesion more than landscape characteristics explained population structure, which developed over many generations corresponding to population expansion. Whether or which populations can grow and reach sufficient effective population sizes on their own or require translocations to maintain genetic diversity and population growth is unclear. In the future, we recommend pairing genetic with demographic monitoring of these and other reintroduced elk populations, including targeted monitoring following translocations to evaluate their effects and necessity.

AB  - Lipids and fatty acids are key dietary components for the nutrition of organisms at all trophic levels. They are required to build cellular structures such as cell membranes, serve as energy storage, and take part in signal transduction cascades. For decades, ecological research investigated how dietary fatty acid availability contributes to the fitness of individuals and their populations. The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is of particular interest because its dietary availability determines the fitness of many aquatic consumers. Because of the small body size of zooplankton, only bulk tissue fatty acid analysis was previously performed, and thus the tissue-specific importance of EPA for zooplankton remained elusive. We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) to reveal the tissue-specific distribution of functional phospholipids in the herbivorous zooplankton Daphnia magna. We demonstrate several lipid species for heart, egg, gut, gonad, somatic, and neurological tissues of D. magna, including the compound eye as well as the optical and cerebral ganglion. The compound eye revealed a large diversity in lipid species containing EPA, which were also found in other neurological tissues and eggs. Such knowledge of tissue-specific fatty acid requirements is essential to investigate how selective allocation of dietary fatty acids within this key grazer affects processes on a functional and molecular level from the individual to food web scales. This methodological advancement will facilitate investigations on how invertebrate physiology and behaviour adjust to changing environmental conditions and potentially affect food web structures, including the trophic transfer of dietary fatty acids.

AB  - Animal space use, activity patterns, and habitat selection-and heterogeneity in these patterns-have important implications for where and when infectious diseases are transmitted. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are habitat generalists, with a high degree of heterogeneity in their movement ecology based on sex, age, season, and region. These heterogeneities have important implications for the transmission and management of chronic wasting disease (CWD), which is a deadly prion disease transmitted both directly and indirectly through the environment. As such, favored deer habitats may promote direct interactions between conspecifics or indirect spatial overlap and subsequent environmental transmission. However, little is known about how individual animal space use translates to actual spatial overlap between individuals, leaving uncertainty in how habitat shapes the risk of direct or environmental CWD transmission. In this study, we evaluated seasonal activity patterns, home ranges, and habitat selection for 596 white-tailed deer in southwest Wisconsin, USA, from 2017-2022. We also estimated seasonal encounter distributions-regions where a pair of deer were most likely to encounter each other-for all pairs of deer putatively in different social groups (between-group) in our study, and quantified seasonal variation in the habitat composition of these areas. We found that deer selection for crops, pasture, or grasslands was generally low, relative to forest, but was highest in the post-fawning (summer) and non-breeding (winter) seasons. We observed similar patterns for the habitat composition of encounter distributions, suggesting that crops, pasture, and grasslands may be attractive resources that facilitate between-group transmission. Site fidelity between years was generally high; combined with small female home ranges in the fawning season, this implies that females likely re-use the same small, high-quality fawning habitats from year to year. We found that attraction toward between-group individuals was low during the post-fawning season but high during the breeding (fall) and non-breeding seasons. These results suggest that space use and habitat selection could shape the risk of environmental transmission in the fawning and post-fawning seasons, social selection could favor direct transmission risk in the breeding season, and combined social and habitat selection may shape risk of both direct and environmental transmission during the non-breeding season. We provide a detailed picture of the physiological and social drivers of deer movement through the year, with implications for CWD transmission and management.
   ResumenEl uso de h & aacute;bitat, patrones de actividad, y selecci & oacute;n de h & aacute;bitat-y diferencias en estos patrones-tienen consecuencias importantes para saber d & oacute;nde y cu & aacute;ndo ocurre la transmisi & oacute;n de enfermedades infecciosas. Ciervos de cola blanca (Odocoileus virginianus) son generalistas de h & aacute;bitat y el sexo, edad, temporada, y regi & oacute;n. Estas heterogeneidades causan un alto grado de heterogeneidad en su movimiento y tienen consecuencias importantes para la transmisi & oacute;n y gesti & oacute;n de la enfermedad pri & oacute;nica mortal, caquexia cr & oacute;nica (CC). CC se transmite directa e indirectamente en el ambiente. Por lo tanto, h & aacute;bitats preferidos por los ciervos pueden promueven interacciones directas entre individuos conespec & iacute;ficos o una superposici & oacute;n espacial indirecta y la posterior transmisi & oacute;n ambiental. Sin embargo, poco se sabe sobre c & oacute;mo el uso de h & aacute;bitat de los animales se traduce a la superposici & oacute;n espacial real entre & iacute;nvidos, lo que deja incertidumbre c & oacute;mo el h & aacute;bitat determina el riesgo de transmisi & oacute;n directa o ambiental de la CC. En este estudio, analizamos patrones de actividad estacional, & aacute;reas de distribuci & oacute;n, y selecci & oacute;n de h & aacute;bitat de 596 ciervos de cola blanca en el suroeste de Wisconsin, EE. UU desde 2017-2022. Tambi & eacute;n estimamos las distribuciones de encuentros estacionales-regiones d & oacute;nde es m & aacute;s probable que se encuentren un par de ciervos- para todos los pares de ciervos supuestamente en diferentes grupos sociales ("entre grupos") en nuestro estudio, y cuantificamos la variaci & oacute;n estacional en la composici & oacute;n del h & aacute;bitat de estas & aacute;reas. En general, la selecci & oacute;n de cultivos, pastos o praderas por parte de los ciervos fue baja en comparaci & oacute;n con la de los bosques, pero fue mayor en las estaciones de post-desove (verano) y no reproductiva (invierno). La fidelidad al lugar entre a & ntilde;os fue generalmente alta; combinada con las peque & ntilde;as & aacute;reas de campeo de las hembras en la temporada de desove, esto implica que las hembras probablemente reutilizan los mismos h & aacute;bitats de desove peque & ntilde;os y de alta calidad de un a & ntilde;o a otro. Descubrimos que la atracci & oacute;n hacia los individuos entre grupos era baja durante la temporada posterior al desove, pero alta durante las temporadas de cr & iacute;a (oto & ntilde;o) y de no cr & iacute;a. Estos resultados sugieren que el uso del espacio y la selecci & oacute;n del h & aacute;bitat podr & iacute;an moldear el riesgo de transmisi & oacute;n ambiental en las temporadas de desove y despu & eacute;s de desove, la selecci & oacute;n social podr & iacute;a favorecer el riesgo de transmisi & oacute;n directa en la temporada reproductora, y la selecci & oacute;n social y del h & aacute;bitat combinada podr & iacute;a moldear el riesgo de transmisi & oacute;n tanto directa como ambiental durante la temporada no reproductora. Proporcionamos una imagen detallada de los factores fisiol & oacute;gicos y sociales que impulsan los movimientos de los ciervos a lo largo del a & ntilde;o, con implicaciones para la transmisi & oacute;n y gesti & oacute;n de la caquexia cr & oacute;nica.

AB  - The genetic contribution with respect to autosomal genes has been widely used to evaluate the genetic diversity of a target population. Here, we developed a method to calculate the genetic contribution with respect to genes on sex chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA through pedigree analysis. To demonstrate the performance, we applied the methods for calculating genetic contributions to example pedigree data. To verify the results of genetic contribution calculations, we performed gene-dropping simulations mimicking flows of genes on autosomes, X and Y chromosomes, and mitochondrial DNA, and then compared the results from the simulation with the corresponding genetic contributions. To investigate the effect of pedigree error, we compared the results of genetic contribution calculations using pedigree data with and without errors. The results of gene-dropping simulation showed good agreement with the results of the genetic contribution calculation. The effect of pedigree errors on the calculation of genetic contribution depended on the error rate. Since the patterns of the genetic contributions of such genes might be different from those on autosomes, the novel approach could provide new information on the genetic composition of populations. The results are expected to contribute to the development of methods for sustainable breeding and population management.

AB  - Nutrition is fundamental to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) management given its relationship to habitat carrying capacity and population productivity. Ecological Sites (ESs) are a United States federal landscape management unit of specific land potential due to unique soils, topography, climate, parent material, and perhaps deer forage nutritional value. We present results of a study that extends the use of ESs to inform white-tailed deer management by evaluating indicator plant chemistry in two spring forb species, Indian cucumber root (Medeola virginiana) and Canada mayflower (Maianthemum canadense), across the northcentral Appalachians. We sampled spring forbs and underlying soils across two ESs: Dry, upland, oak-maple-hemlock hardwood forest (OMH) and Deep soil, high slope, northern hardwood forests (NHF). Plant elemental content, soil pH, and site aspect, slope and elevation were measured. Our results show that forb chemistry differs between species and within a species geographically. Indian cucumber root, as compared to Canada mayflower, has significantly higher Mg, Na, Cu, Fe, and Zn, and lower Mn. Canada mayflower in the NHF ES, versus OMH ES, was found to have significantly higher K, Mn, and B. Indian cucumber root in the NHF ES, versus the OMH ES, was found to have significantly higher Mg, Al, Fe, and Ca:P ratio but lower K. Linear discriminant analysis shows that plant tissue Mn was the best discriminator between species, and between ESs, Canada mayflower plant tissue Mn and Indian cucumber plant tissue P, K, Ca, Mg and Mn were best discriminators. Given that nutrition determines habitat carrying capacity, differences in forage nutrition between ESs may have different potentials to support deer. Forage nutrition is an important aspect of deer habitat conditions and carrying capacity, thus ESs are likely to support deer populations with different growth potential, which means that even if the same plant species occur in different ESs their nutritional value to deer may differ.

AB  - The administration of genetic breeding programs to eradicate transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in goat and sheep is crucial for animal breeding, health and welfare, together with food safety and security. Goat production and indigenous goat breeds (Cyprus Native hair Goat, Damascus) are important for the Cyprus's agricultural diversity Therefore, the allele frequencies of Caprine Prnp gene variants should be well understood for goat breeding programs in Northern Cyprus. This current study was designed to determine the putative allele frequencies and genotype distributions of Caprine Prnp gene variations in Northern Cyprus Damascus, Cyprus Native Hair and hybrid goats. Four different locations in the Northern Cyprus were selected for targeted gene sequencing. Blood samples were collected from 50 Northern Cyprus goats. Genomic DNA was extracted from goats' whole blood. As a result, ten different Caprine Prnp polymorphisms were detected including P42= (CCG>CCA), G127S (GGC>AGC), S138= (AGT>AGC), N146S (AAT>GAT), R154H (CGT>CAT), Gln172Arg (CAG>CGG), G172H (CAG>CAT), G172R (CAG>CGT), V179V (GTG>GTT), V187 (CAG>CAT). The three most common genetic markers were P42= 16%), R154H (12%), N146S (8%), respectively. Two different polymorphism, P42= and R154H, were detected in Cyprus native hair goat whereas P4 2=, G127S and N146S were observed in the Damascus breed and P42=, G127S, R154H and N146S in Hybrid goats. The predisposition genotype, 146NN homozygosity, was found at the same ratio as the Northern Cyprus Native Hair Goat. There were no statistically significant differences between the breeds. The use of Cyprus Cyprus native hair goat in animal husbandry has a critical importance in terms of species genetic diversity We believe that this breed will play a key role in the reduction of scrapie cases, based on its resistance genotype H154 ratio. Larger studies are needed to gain a complete understanding with regards to the impacts of the 146D, 146S, and 154H alleles in Damascus, Cyprus Native Hair Goat and Damascus-Saanen hybrids.

AB  - Significant financial losses caused by human-wildlife conflict (HWC) hinder long-term conservation efforts in developing countries. HWC is a widespread and persistent challenge to conservation that adversely affects both humans and wildlife. In the current study, we assessed the nature and magnitude of HWC in Lakki Marwat, Pakistan, by interviewing 185 randomly selected participants through semi-structured questionnaires. Six animal species were identified by the locals as responsible for HWC due to livestock depredation and crop raiding: grey wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), jungle cat (Felis chaus), and wild boar (Sus scrofa). Respondents reported 639 livestock losses to carnivores in the past two years (2021-2022), translating into an annual economic loss of $9,598. The grey wolf and golden jackal were responsible for 83% of the total financial loss due to livestock depredation. Location, prey type, prey age, and herding practices significantly impacted livestock depredation. Wild boar, golden jackal, and red fox caused an annual monetary loss of $4,107 through crop damage. According to local perceptions, wild boar was the most dangerous species in the study area, followed by the golden jackal and jungle cat. The majority (90%) of the respondents possessed a negative attitude towards wild boar, golden jackal, and jungle cat. Maintaining smaller herds, education, public awareness, financial incentives, and coordination between the local community and wildlife officials may reduce HWC in the study area.Clinical trial number: Not applicable.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Silene uniflora Roth (S. maritima With., S. vulgaris Garcke subsp. maritima (With.) & Aacute;. & D. L & ouml;ve), Sea Campion, that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation.<br /> Silene uniflora is a mat-like perennial herb that in Britain and Ireland is primarily distributed in coastal habitats, notably on sea cliffs and shingle banks but also at the drift line and rarely on sand; it also has populations on mountains and heavy metal mine waste tips. All of these substrates tend to be oligotrophic, loose-textured and freely draining, and often with adverse ion concentrations. It is found in suitable habitats around much of the Atlantic and Baltic coasts of Europe.<br /> Its breeding system is gynodioecious and gynomonoecious (some individuals bearing female flowers only, some bearing hermaphrodite flowers only and others with both types of flower). The proportions of the three types of individual vary considerably between populations, but hermaphrodite flowers tend to predominate. The showy, white, nectar-producing flowers are produced continuously over the entire summer and are pollinated mainly by long-tongued Hymenoptera and night-flying moths but autogamous selfing is also frequent.<br /> Silene uniflora and its close relative S. vulgaris were the subject of a classic, decadal study involving genetical and transplant experiments that was seminal in the development of 'experimental taxonomy'. More recently, attention has focused on the rapid evolution of Zn-tolerant populations of S. uniflora growing on mine spoil and contaminated river gravels. It has also become a model organism for the study of sexually transmitted, castrating fungal diseases in plants (notably of the genus Microbotryum).

AB  - Purpose: Clean and efficient alternatives for sustainable treatment of pig farming wastes are a priority in suburban areas in Forest Reserves of High Andean ecosystems. Among these technologies are Bokashi Fermentation and composting with added microorganisms (bioaugmentation) or nutrients (biostimulation) as biological activators. Method: In a Colombian rural area located at 3160 m.a.s.l., focused on small-scale swine production, Bokashi fermentation with active dry yeast and in-vessel composting were evaluated using two microbial inoculants and a sterile metabolic stimulant. In addition, these treatments were compared with a non-inoculated composting process used in the study area (control). Results: The biological additives improved the composting process performance and end-product quality by shortening the degradation cycle (19.9 - 45.9%), higher germination index (> 0.8%), increasing nutrient content (N, P, S, Fe and Cu) and showing suppressive activity against Fusarium oxysporum compared to control. Nevertheless, Bokashi was the only treatment that decreased Enterobacteriaceae concentration below 1E+03 CFU g(-1). Conclusion: Bokashi technology complies with Colombia's environmental regulations for eco-friendly fertilizer production, which allows the sustainable management by-products from swine activities in critical ecological areas such as Forestry Protection Reserves in High Andean ecosystems.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) affects cervids. This research note described a U.S. national survey of ongoing management and communication efforts by state wildlife agencies in response to CWD. Questionnaires were distributed to all 50 states in 2020 (response rate = 76%, n = 38). States with CWD were predicted to differ from states with no known cases of this disease (independent variable). The dependent variables were all related to CWD: current and proposed surveillance, current practices, public involvement, survey research, and other communication forms. Across all 47 variables, the average percent difference between CWD and non-CWD states was 27%, all but seven comparisons were double-digit differences, and the overall average for the effect sizes was .30. Although the findings implied that CWD states were more engaged with the disease, non-CWD states need to recognize that the disease shows no signs of slowing down and will likely spread to most states.

AB  - In California's Central Valley, deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis), and house mice (Mus musculus) coexist and share common resources. Analyzing stomach contents from 285 individuals collected from Kesterson Reservoir from 1989-1993 revealed generally low to very low overlap in individual food items. Grouping individual food items into categories showed higher dietary overlap of food groups, indicating considerable similarity in their overall diets despite individual preferences. Over the 5-year sampling period, 73 dietary items were found in stomachs; deer mice consumed 69, harvest mice 41, and house mice 39 of those items. Forbs, forb seeds, and invertebrates were the most significant components of the diets for all three. I observed annual and fine-scale variations in diets. This study suggests that insights into small mammal diets from Kesterson can provide information on food habits in other disturbed habitats, contributing to broader ecological understanding of Cricetidae and Muridae natural history. These findings may serve as a representative model for small mammal diets in other areas beyond the Central Valley.

AB  - This study is aimed at adding different types of mature compost and sulfur powder, as additives into food waste composting to investigate the effect on nitrogen loss and compost maturity. The composting experiment used the in-vessel composting method and was conducted continuously for 15 days. High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the bacterial community during composting. Results showed that the secondary fermentation mature compost mixed with sulfur powder group had the most reduction of ammonia emission (56%) and the primary fermentation mature compost amendments were the most effective for nitrous oxide emission reduction (37%). The temperature, pH, and nitrogen forms of transformation of the pile significantly affect the nitrogen loss during composting. Firmicutes helped to promote the rapid warming of the pile, and Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria played an important role in decomposition of organic matter. Thermobifida and Ureibacillus had a main contribution to the rapid degradation of organic matter in the process of composting. The relative abundance of nitrogen-fixing bacteria was higher, and the relative abundance of predominantly ammonifying and denitrifying bacteria was lower than the control group, with the addition of different additives.

AB  - We investigated early survival, growth, and carbon isotope discrimination of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) seedlings from different provenances using common gardens across an elevational gradient in order to examine the potential for adaptation to extreme environments and constraints to artificial regeneration. Twenty-one provenances from a range of elevations across Arizona and New Mexico were planted in three common gardens: a high-elevation meadow in aspen-mixed conifer forest, a mid-elevation ponderosa pine forest, and a low-elevation pinyon juniper woodland. Two years after planting in 2018, survival was highest at the mid-elevation site (54%), low at the high-elevation site (1.5%), and 0% at the low-elevation site. At the hot and dry low-elevation site, provenances from low-elevations survived longer than provenances from mid- and high-elevations, which suggests greater drought tolerance of low-elevation provenances. Mortality agents changed from abiotic (drought) to biotic (herbivory) with an increase in elevation across sites. High mortality of seedlings planted at high-elevation sites from biotic agents, such as rodents, may challenge efforts to establish ponderosa pine in assisted migration projects. Seedlings had significantly higher growth rate and carbon isotope discrimination ( increment C-13) at the mid-elevation site than the high-elevation site. Provenances differed significantly in diameter, and increment C-13, but not in height growth rate for the first year after planting. Provenance variation in increment C-13 suggests genetic variation in water use efficiency that may be useful for future evaluation of southwestern ponderosa pine seed sources for reforestation.

AB  - AimMany species have suffered anthropogenic range contraction and no longer occupy all available suitable environmental conditions. This is particularly problematic for the construction of habitat suitability models (HSMs), which assume that a species' contemporary range reflects its full species-environment relationship. HSMs therefore risk underestimating suitable environment areas, and misinforming conservation decisions. Incorporating historic (centuries-old) records partly reduces this bias, but even these records are also subject to human disturbance. We incorporated fossil records of the critically endangered saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica, L., 1776), alongside historic and current records, into current and future habitat suitability models. Saiga has experienced drastic range contraction and may have a truncated species-environment relationship. The results allowed us to test whether its current habitat provides optimal environmental conditions, or whether saiga should be considered a refugee species.LocationNorthern Hemisphere.TaxonSaiga tatarica (Bovidae, Artiodactyla).MethodsWe collated historic and fossil saiga occurrence records from published literature, museum archives and global databases. Modern occurrence records were obtained from the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List assessment. Four bioclimatic variables were downloaded from . HSMs were generated through Maxent, using the maxnet package in R. Three HSMs were developed: present only, present historic and present fossil. Each of these models was projected onto current and two future (2070) climate change scenarios.ResultsSaiga fossil records increased the predicted suitable environment area by 783% and 1416% for current and future climate projections respectively. Our results suggest the saiga is not a refugee species but occupies only a portion of its potential environmental niche. The saiga's contemporary range is predicted environmentally suitable throughout all models and projections, and therefore in situ conservation management is recommended.Main ConclusionsThis study highlights the importance of incorporating fossil records into HSMs to better understand species-environment relationships and develop more robust conservation strategies for appropriate endangered species.

AB  - Weevils represent one of the most prolific radiations of beetles and the most diverse group of herbivores on land. The phylogeny of weevils (Curculionoidea) has received extensive attention, and a largely satisfactory framework for their interfamilial relationships has been established. However, a recent phylogenomic study of Curculionoidea based on anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) data yielded an abnormal placement for the family Belidae (strongly supported as sister to Nemonychidae + Anthribidae). Here we reanalyse the genome-scale AHE data for Curculionoidea using various models of molecular evolution and data filtering methods to mitigate anticipated systematic errors and reduce compositional heterogeneity. When analysed with the infinite mixture model CAT-GTR or using appropriately filtered datasets, Belidae are always recovered as sister to the clade (Attelabidae, (Caridae, (Brentidae, Curculionidae))), which is congruent with studies based on morphology and other sources of molecular data. Although the relationships of the 'higher Curculionidae' remain challenging to resolve, we provide a consistent and robust backbone phylogeny of weevils. Our extensive analyses emphasize the significance of data curation and modelling across-site compositional heterogeneity in phylogenomic studies.

AB  - Mammals in arid zones have to trade off thermal stress, predation pressure, and time spent foraging in a complex thermal landscape. We quantified the relationship between the environmental heat load and activity of a mammal community in the hot, arid Kalahari Desert. We deployed miniature black globe thermometers within the existing Snapshot Safari camera trap grid on Tswalu Kalahari Reserve, South Africa. Using the camera traps to record species' activity throughout the 24-h cycle, we quantified changes in the activity patterns of mammal species in relation to heat loads in their local environment. We compared the heat load during which species were active between two sites with differing predator guilds, one where lion (Panthera leo) biomass dominated the carnivore guild and the other where lions were absent. In the presence of lion, prey species were generally active under significantly higher heat loads, especially during the hot and dry spring. We suggest that increased foraging under high heat loads highlights the need to meet nutritional requirements while avoiding nocturnal activity when predatory pressures are high. Such a trade-off may become increasingly costly under the hotter and drier conditions predicted to become more prevalent as a result of climate change within the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa.

AB  - Interpretation of past vegetation using pollen analysis depends on our understanding about the relationship between the modern vegetation and surface pollen assemblages. In the present study, we sampled the modern pollen-rain in a mixed environment of cultivated land and dry and wet tropical forests in central India. We established to which extent modern vegetation types are reflected in the pollen-rain and explained biases in the modern pollen spectra. Our study revealed that the modern pollen assemblages do not fully represent the extant regional vegetation, as many of the forest components, especially trees and shrubs, are either under-represented or remained palynologically silent in the pollen records. Low pollen productivity of most of the tropical deciduous taxa, owing to entomophily, as well as low preservation potential of some tree pollen are primarily responsible for this irregularity in their representation in the pollen spectra. Moreover, Shorea robusta and Tectona grandis pollen, despite being high pollen producers, are not encountered in any sample, which could be further attributed to their poor preservation in surface soil samples, as well as to their low (pollen) dispersal efficiency. Cerealia, Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae, Brassicaceae, Cannabis sativa, Artemisia spp. and Alternanthera spp. indicate agricultural practices and other human activities around the respective study areas. Moreover, the consistent presence of Asteroideae pollen indicates pastoral activities, whereas Sporormiella spp., Sordaria spp., Podosora spp., Delitschia spp., and Cercophora spp. indicate local grazing and herbivory.

AB  - With the rapid development of livestock and poultry breeding industries, pollution problems caused by the discharge of animal feces have become increasingly severe. Nevertheless, there are limited investigations about nutrients and pollutants in animal feces from different scale of farms, especially in Northwest China. Here we investigated nutrients content, 19 antibiotics, 7 heavy metals, 329 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and 35 mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in six main livestock and poultry feces collected from 5 coastal regions of Ningxia. Pig and chicken feces exhibited higher levels of nutrients content, but antibiotics, heavy metals, ARGs and MGEs were also more abundant than those in cattle and sheep feces. Chlortetracycline hydrochloride and doxycycline hyclate were the most commonly used antibiotic, which detected with the highest rate and concentrations, especially in broiler, layer and pig feces. Strong positive correlations were found among different ARGs or between ARGs and MGEs, indicated the risk of horizontal gene transfer of ARGs. Residual antibiotic and heavy metals significantly affect the abundance of ARGs. Feeding mode and the scales of the animal farms served little effect on the distribution of the pollutants (including residual antibiotics, heavy metals, MGEs and ARGs), which were significantly different among animal types. Use of antibiotics and heavy metals should be strictly regulated, especially in chicken and pig farms, in order to control contaminants and reduce potential risks to the environment.

AB  - Pre-dispersal seed mortality caused by premature fruit drop is a potentially important source of plant mortality, but one which has rarely been studied in the context of tropical forest plants. Of particular interest is premature fruit drop triggered by enemies, which-if density dependent-could contribute to species coexistence in tropical forest plant communities. We used a long-term (31 year) dataset on seed and fruit fall obtained through weekly collections from a network of seed traps in a lowland tropical forest (Barro Colorado Island, Panama) to estimate the proportion of seeds prematurely abscised for 201 woody plant species. To determine whether enemy attack might contribute to premature fruit drop, we tested whether plant species abscise more of their fruit prematurely if they (a) have attributes hypothesised to be associated with high levels of enemy attack and (b) are known to be attacked by one enemy group (insect seed predators). We also tested (c) whether mean rates of premature fruit drop for plant species are phylogenetically conserved. Overall rates of premature fruit drop were high in the plant community. Across all species, 39% of seeds were abscised before completing their development. Rates of premature seed abscission varied considerably among species and could not be explained by phylogeny. Premature seed abscission rates were higher in species which are known to host pre-dispersal insect seed predators and species with attributes that were hypothesised to make them more susceptible to attack by pre-dispersal enemies, namely species which (a) have larger seeds, (b) have a greater average height, (c) have temporally predictable fruiting patterns and (d) are more abundant at the study site. Synthesis. Premature fruit drop is likely to be a major source of seed mortality for many plant species on Barro Colorado Island. It is plausible that pre-dispersal seed enemies, such as insect seed predators, contribute to community-level patterns of premature fruit drop and have the potential to mediate species coexistence through stabilising negative density dependence. Our study suggests that the role of pre-dispersal enemies in structuring tropical plant communities should be considered alongside the more commonly studied post-dispersal seed and seedling enemies.

AB  - Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a plasticizer derived from phthalate ester, is used as an additive in industrial products such as plastics, paints, and medical devices. However, DEHP is known as an endocrine-disrupting chemical, causing cancers and adverse effects on human health. This study evaluated DEHP biodegradation efficiency via food waste composting during 35 days of incubation. At high DEHP concentrations (2167 mg kg -1) in food waste compost mixture, the DEHP biodegradation efficiency was 99% after 35 days. The highest degradation efficiency was recorded at the thermophilic phase (day 3 -day 11) with the biodegradation rate reached 187 mg kg -1 day -1. DEHP was metabolized to dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP) and would be oxidized to benzyl alcohol (BA) and mineralized into CO2 and water via various metabolisms. Finally, the compost's quality with residual DEHP was evaluated using Brassica chinensis L. seeds via 96 h of germination tests. The compost (at day 35) with a trace amount of DEHP as the end product showed no sig-nificant effect on the germination rate of Brassica chinensis L. seeds (88%) compared to that without DEHP (94%), indicating that the compost can be reused as fertilizer in agricultural applications. These results provide an improved understanding of the DEHP biodegradation via food waste composting without bioaugmentation and hence facilitating its green remediation and conversion into value-added products. Nevertheless, further studies are needed on DEHP biodegradation in large-scale food waste composting or industrial applications.

AB  - Caribbean coral reefs are in rapid decline and artificial reefs are increasingly often deployed to restore lost three-dimensional structure. The majority of artificial reefs and other marine infrastructure is built from concrete, with Ordinary Portland Cement (CEM I) as the most important ingredient. However, the production of CEM I results in substantial CO2 emissions. In addition, there are indications that the material is colonized by different benthic assemblages compared to natural reefs. To make artificial reefs more sustainable and ecologically optimal, research into alternative materials is required. For this study, CEM I was compared with five alternative substrates: a mixture of CEM III cement with recycled CEM I fines (CEM III), Calcium Sulfoaluminate cement (CSA), geopolymer-sediment tiles (GS), lime-sediment tiles (LS), and Xiriton (E0). Settlement of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum on the different materials was tested under marine laboratory conditions. Competent D. antillarum larvae were added to beakers with a tile made from one of the substrates and monitored for settlement after two days. Half of the tiles of each material were covered with a four-week old biofilm, the other half had no biofilm. Results show that substrate type and the presence of a biofilm affected settlement rates significantly. After 48h, highest settlement rates were found on CEM III with biofilm (30% settlement), CSA with biofilm (26% settlement) and E0 with biofilm (20% settlement). Without biofilm, the same substrates yielded only 4 to 10% settlement. CEM I, GS, and LS had overall low settlement rates (<5%) irrespective of biofilm. Post-settlement morphology was not affected by substrate type or biofilm, with juveniles having a mean test diameter of 593 +/- 12 <mu>m and a mean spine length of 487 +/- 27 mu m. This study provides alternative choices for regular concrete that enhance the larval settlement of the key herbivore D. antillarum. We recommend studying these alternative materials in the field to obtain a better understanding of the effects of substrate on the ecological community development over larger time- and spatial scales.

AB  - To understand wildlife population dynamics, it is crucial to determine the factors influencing annual variations in recruitment rates. Over a 12-year period (1995-2007), we conducted herd count surveys in Akan-Mashu National Park, eastern Hokkaido, Japan, to investigate the recruitment rate of the sika deer (Cervus nippon) population. The observed trend revealed a decline in fawn-female ratio (number of fawns per 100 females) from January to April each year. Furthermore, there was significant annual variation in recruitment rates (fawn-female ratio in April). We analyzed the effects of relative density of sika deer, snow water equivalent (SWE), wind speed (WIND), and survey date on the number of females with or without a fawn using generalized linear mixed models. The selected model, including SWE, WIND, and survey date, highlighted SWE and WIND as strong determinants of recruitment rate. Conversely, the relative density index had no influence on recruitment rate. We hypothesize that the reduced availability of food resources and winter weather severity, due to snow cover and wind chill, led to fawn malnutrition and increased winter mortality.

AB  - Minerals are essential for ruminants affecting significantly the production of grazing livestock. Iron level in forages, soil, and blood plasma of the small ruminants (goat and sheep) was investigated in three districts of Punjab. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine the concentration of iron in collected samples. The results revealed that the mean Fe concentrations in soil of districts Sargodha, Mianwali, and Bhakhar were significantly varied and ranged from 21.85 to 23.78, 28.45 to 31.2, and 18.079 to 24.33 mg/kg, respectively. The Fe level in soil of Mianwali significantly varied and was higher than Sargodha and Bhakkar. The mean Fe concentration in forages which were used for feeding purpose were significantly varied and found between 10.95-14.49, 23.63-25.65, and 6.616-9.45 mg/kg for Sargodha, Mianwali, and Bhakhar, respectively. The mean Fe concentrations in blood plasma of goat which consumed the contaminated forages were 8.5026-11.763 mg/L in district Sargodha, 19.77-20.19 mg/L in Mianwali, and 5.508-5.858mg/L in Bhakkar. In blood plasma of sheep, the residual levels of Fe in districts Sargodha, Mianwali, and Bhakhar were ranged from 9.987 to 12.455, 15.8 to 19.785, and 3.425 to 6.383 mg/L, respectively. This study provides the data of metals effected by different sites and also their mobility from low to higher trophic level which enables us to study the iron toxicity in different trophic levels, and we recommend different safe limits and treatment in case of low and high metal profile.

TI  - Soil nematodes as a monitoring tool of bioenergy crop production management: The case of Miscanthus giganteus cultivation on different soil types

AB  - The cultivation of bioenergy crops helps produce energy sources for industrial and domestic needs with a zero carbon footprint, which is very attractive in the context of efforts to prevent global climate change. However, this creates certain difficulties in terms of competition for agricultural land with crops used to satisfy human needs and produce food. One potential solution is the use of unproductive abandoned land disturbed by open-pit mining and marginal land contaminated with toxic substances for growing bioenergy crops. The subject of the study was to investigate the influence of soil type on nematode communities and related indicators in the cultivation of bioenergy crops for biofuel production in different geographical areas. A solution to the issue of the role of nematode communities in the hierarchical organisation of bioenergy crop management, which includes tactical and strategic levels, is proposed. A total of 44 nematode genera representing different soil types were found in the studied ecosystems. The lowest abundance of communities was found in Chernozem and Glayic Podzols. The highest abundance was found on Arenosols, Haplic Podzols, and Stagnic Fluvisols. The herbivores were represented by 21 genera. The proportion of herbivorous species usually did not exceed 60% of the total number of nematodes. The representatives of the genus Paratylenchus were found in all the studied soils. The results of multidimensional scaling showed that four dimensions could be identified. Dimension 1 proved to be the most sensitive to changes in the trophic structure of the communities, which is largely due to changes in the role of herbivores in the community. Dimension 2 allowed us to differentiate Arenosols from all other soil types. This difference is explained by functional changes in the structure of the nematode community. The Arenosols community is distinguished by an increase in the enrichment index, which is a consequence of an increase in the proportion of semi-endoparasites. Dimension 3 made it possible to differentiate a group of soils, including Haplich Fluvioglacial, Stagnant Fluvioglacial and Haplic Fluvisols, Stagnic Fluvisols, and Haplic Podzols from Glayic Podzols. Glayic Podzols are characterised by an increased total number of the community, mainly due to parasitic nematodes, as evidenced by the increased level of the plant parasitism index. Dimension 4 was able to capture the specific characteristics of the black soil nematode communities. This soil type is characterised by a higher density of nematode communities, which is explained by a higher proportion of bacteriophages and ectoparasites. Growing bioenergy crops has two different aspects: tactical and strategic. The tactical aspect involves the production of biological energy sources. This aspect includes traditional methods of crop management, including elements of plant disease and pest control, to achieve maximum yield. Thus, the object of tactical management is the plant. In contrast, the strategic aspect is concerned with soil reclamation to restore its functions, thereby paving the way for the possibility of using such soils for food production. The object of strategic management is soil. The tactical aspect involves obtaining direct economic benefits from the extraction of energy raw materials. The strategic aspect involves the restoration of disturbed lands and the creation of preconditions for the restoration of their ecosystem services and their inclusion in food production.
   Nematode communities can provide information for monitoring processes at both the tactical and strategic levels. The risks of parasitic nematodes and plant diseases should be assessed at the tactical level of management. At the strategic level of management, nematode communities should be used to monitor trophic network assessment and the level of stress in the soil system.

AB  - Sleep deprivation (SD) disrupts circadian rhythms; however, its effects on SD and the mechanisms involved require further investigation. Previous studies on SD were mainly conducted on rodents, such as mice, with few studies on its effects on the liver of large diurnal animals, such as sheep. In this study, we used a Tibetan sheep model for the first time to investigate the effects of SD on the liver by exposing Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) to 7 days of SD (6 h/day) and performed transcriptome sequencing analysis on liver samples taken at 4 h intervals over 24 h. The results revealed that SD significantly altered the circadian expression of genes and their expression patterns in the liver of Tibetan sheep. Enrichment analysis of the circadian rhythm-altered genes revealed changes in the pathways related to lipid metabolism in the liver. Further evidence from serum markers and gene expression analyses using qualitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Oil Red O and apoptosis staining indicated that SD leads to abnormal lipid metabolism in the liver, potentially causing liver damage. Therefore, our results suggest that SD disrupts the circadian rhythms of metabolism-related genes in the Tibetan sheep liver, thereby affecting metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - Not only are the plants of the golden camellia group examples of high-quality camellia germplasm, but they are also a plant group with rich medicinal and nutritional value, and these plants are used as food, cosmetics and traditional medicine in China. There are approximately 50 species in this group around the world, and more than 30 species of golden camellia plants have been listed in China. The leaves and flowers of these species have similar shapes, and as such, they are often confused as the same species. Our study used simplified genome sequencing technology to construct a phylogenetic tree of plants in the Chinese golden camellia group, and we also described the evolutionary relationships. At the same time, the secondary metabolic indexes of the total phenols, total flavonoids, total anthocyanins and ellagic acid in the leaves were determined, and principal component clustering analysis was also performed. The results showed that the phylogenetic relationship and genetic distance among the plant species of Chinese golden camellia group plants were fully revealed. The cluster analysis of chemical secondary metabolism and genetic phylogenetic trees showed some of the same trends, thereby indicating that secondary metabolism golden camellia can be used as biomarkers for golden camellia. The research results provide phylogenetic information for the genotype and performance diversity of the golden camellia that is regionally distributed in China, as well as provide a theoretical basis for the research and development of potential bioactive substances.

AB  - Detecting microevolutionary responses to natural selection by observing temporal changes in individual breeding values is challenging. The collection of suitable datasets can take many years and disentangling the contributions of the environment and genetics to phenotypic change is not trivial. Furthermore, pedigree-based methods of obtaining individual breeding values have known biases. Here, we apply a genomic prediction approach to estimate breeding values of adult weight in a 35-year dataset of Soay sheep (Ovis aries). Comparisons are made with a traditional pedigree-based approach. During the study period, adult body weight decreased, but the underlying genetic component of body weight increased, at a rate that is unlikely to be attributable to genetic drift. Thus cryptic microevolution of greater adult body weight has probably occurred. Genomic and pedigree-based approaches gave largely consistent results. Thus, using genomic prediction to study microevolution in wild populations can remove the requirement for pedigree data, potentially opening up new study systems for similar research.

AB  - High dietary intake of Cu has previously been linked to the selection of Cu resistance and co-selection of antibiotic re-sistance in specific gut bacteria. Based on a novel HT-qPCR metal resistance gene chip as combined with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and phenotypic resistance typing of Escherichia coli isolates, we here report the impacts of two contrasting Cu-based feed additives on the swine gut bacterial metal resistome and community assembly. DNA was extracted from fecal samples (n = 80) collected at day 26 and 116 of the experiment from 200 pigs allotted to five dietary treatments: negative control (NC) diet with 20 & mu;g CuSO4 g-1 and four diets added 125 or 250 & mu;g CuSO4 g-1 feed or 125 or 250 & mu;g Cu2O g-1 feed to the NC diet. Dietary Cu supplementation reduced the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, but it had negligible impacts on bacterial community composition relative to the gut microbiome matu-ration effect (time). The relative importance of different bacterial community assembly processes was not markedly affected by the dietary Cu treatments, and differences in swine gut metal resistome composition could be explained primarily by differences in bacterial community composition rather than by dietary Cu treatments.

AB  - The aim of this study was to a) evaluate the concentration of Se and Hg and their relationship in the tissues of 4 species of wild mammals, including Se:Hg molar ratios, and b) evaluate the effect of the analysed elements and their mutual proportions expressed as Se:Hg molar ratio, on the antioxidant system in the tissues of the tested animals. The study was performed on 31 animals belonging to four species: wild boar, red fox, roe deer, brown hare. Determination of Hg in liver, kidney and muscle of animals was performed using an AMA 254 mercury analyser. Total Se concentrations were determined using the spectrofluorometric method. In omnivores demonstrated higher Se concentrations in all analysed organs compared to the herbivores. The highest concentration of Hg was found in the kidneys of the tested animals, and the lowest in the muscles. High and moderate correlation between Se and Hg was observed in the liver of omnivorous, while in herbivores this correlation was weak. In all analysed samples, the Se:Hg molar ratios were above 1 (min: liver 5.9, max: kidney 110). Generally, the highest Se:Hg ratio values were found in kidney and the lowest in liver of tested animals. No significant correlation was found between GPx, GST and SOD activity and Se or Hg concentration in analysed organs. But it was observed that Se:Hg molar was negatively correlated with CAT activity in the most samples. The obtained results may suggest that omnivorous animals demonstrate greater Hg sequestration in the liver than herbivores, which has been proposed as one of the mechanisms of Se antagonistic action towards Hg. The ratio between Se and Hg, rather than the concentration of these elements in organs, affected the antioxidant status in the animal organism, specifically the CAT activity.

AB  - Public perception of endangered species is crucial for successful management of community-based conservation and sustainability of national parks. By the method of choice experiment, our study evaluated conservation preferences and willingness to donate money for flagship and non-flagship species using a choice experiment with 409 residents living near the Lanstang river source of Sanjiangyuan National Park, China. We found that flagship species such as the Snow leopard (Pristine plateau) and White-lipped deer (Przewalskium albirostris) generated more conservation funds than non-flagship species. However, not all flagship species were accepted. Respondents disliked Tibetan brown bears (Ursus arctos pruinosus) due to direct human-wildlife conflicts such as bodily injury and property damage. Heterogeneity of preference was influenced by household income, religious beliefs, ethnicity, culture, and conservation awareness. Results can be used to establish a local community-participative framework by combining conservation motivations that alleviate human-wildlife conflict.

AB  - Understanding the vertical distribution of elasmobranch species and associated ecological dynamics can be a crucial component of developing effective conservation strategies, particularly in light of their global population decline. Previous studies have primarily focused on horizontal extent and movement patterns of elasmobranchs, with limited knowledge about their vertical distribution. This knowledge gap stems from limited access to technological advancements and reliance on surface data from fisheries operations. Today, advancements in observing platforms such as electronic tracking, remotely operated vehicles and submersibles, and reductions in costs for drop cameras and BRUVs, allow for direct observation of animals at great depths, facilitating improved understanding of their ecological and trophic niches. This study reports new global depth records for three elasmobranch species observed in the Saudi Arabian Red Sea (Carcharhinus altimus, Rhinobatos punctifer, Iago omanensis), also presenting ethological evidence on Iago omanensis feeding behavior. Our findings have significant implications for conservation strategies and the development of targeted conservation measures. The provisioning of data on new depth ranges allows places like NEOM to better manage and protect deep sea habitats, due to the presence of species occurring at those depths.

AB  - This paper describes an analysis of data from long-term monitoring (28 years) of 137Cs activity concentrations in muscle tissue from moose (Alces alces) harvested in east-central Sweden. Two data sets on activity concentrations in moose muscle samples from the adjacent municipalities of Heby (n = 3652; y 1986-2012) and Ga<spacing diaeresis>vle (n = 11,511; y 1986-2008) were used. Geometric means of 137Cs activity concentrations in moose have declined from 700 Bq kg-1 in Heby and 1300 Bq kg-1 in Ga<spacing diaeresis>vle during 1986-1989 to around 300 Bq kg-1 in Heby (2009-2012) and 700 Bq kg-1 in Ga<spacing diaeresis>vle (2005-2008). Based on annual geometric mean values of 137Cs in the muscle samples, the effective ecological half-life of 137Cs was calculated to be 16 years in both Heby and Ga<spacing diaeresis>vle. The average 137Cs activity concentrations in moose calves were 14 % higher in Heby and 18 % higher in Ga<spacing diaeresis>vle compared to adults. No sex-specific difference in activity concentration was found. Mean aggregated transfer factors (Tag) from soil to moose muscle tissue were calculated at 0.016 m2 kg-1 (range 0.010-0.036) in the Heby area and 0.023 m2 kg-1 (range 0.013-0.035) in the Ga<spacing diaeresis>vle area. Using GIS software, mean deposition within a 1.7 km radius around each killing spot for moose harvested in Heby was calculated, resulting in individual Tag values. On an individual level, this resulted in a minimum Tag of 0.001 m2 kg-1 and a maximum Tag of 0.104 m2 kg-1, distinctly reflecting the high variation of 137Cs concentrations in moose. The proportion of samples exceeding the national intervention limit of 1500 Bq kg-1 was 5 % in Heby and 25 % in Ga<spacing diaeresis>vle during the study period.

AB  - Ungulate browsing has a major impact on the composition and structure of forests. Repeatedly conducted, large-scale regeneration inventories can monitor the extent of browsing pressure and its impacts on forest regeneration development. Based on the respective results, the necessity and extent of wildlife management activities such as hunting, fencing, etc., can be identified at a landscape scale. However, such inventories have rarely been integrated into wildlife management decision making. In this article, we evaluate a regeneration inventory method which was carried out in the Bavarian Forest National Park between 2007 and 2018. We predict the browsing impact by calculating browsing probabilities using a logistic mixed effect model. To provide wildlife managers with feedback on their activities, we developed a test which can assess significant changes in browsing probability between different inventory periods. To find the minimum observable browsing probability change, we simulated ungulate browsing based on the data of a potential browsing indicator species (Sorbus aucuparia) in the National Park. Sorbus aucuparia is evenly distributed, commonly found, selectively browsed and meets the ecosystem development objectives in our study area. We were able to verify a browsing probability change down to +/- 5 percentage points with a sample size of about 1,000 observations per inventory run. In view of the size of the National Park and the annual fluctuations in browsing pressure, this estimation accuracy seems sufficient. In seeking the maximal cost-efficiency, we were able to reduce this sample size in a sensitivity analysis by about two thirds without severe loss of information for wildlife management. Based on our findings, the presented inventory method combined with our evaluation tool has the potential to be a robust and efficient instrument to assess the impact of herbivores that are in the National Park and other regions.

AB  - Rodents comprise around half of all mammalian species, showcasing their remarkable adaptability to thrive in almost all terrestrial habitats. Their evolutionary success is exemplified by a wide range of morphological features reflecting various feeding and locomotory adaptations. This study examines the functional variation in cranial and mandibular traits as well as locomotion indices in rodent communities within the high-altitude Afroalpine environment of the Ethiopian Highlands. The findings reveal two distinct patterns in cranial and mandibular traits. One pattern is associated with dietary differences, distinguishing the primarily herbivorous species Otomys helleri, Arvicanthis abyssinicus and Lophuromys melanonyx, which are characterised by relatively long molar rows, massive mandibles, and likely enhanced bite force, from the generally omnivorous genus Stenocephalemys and the more faunivorous Lophuromys flavopunctatus. The second pattern indicates that species in the Afroalpine ecosystem have adapted to life in distinct habitats across different elevational zones. Species from the highest elevational zones within the genera Stenocephalemys and Lophuromys exhibit convergent morphological adaptations for life in open habitats, characterised by their larger size, narrower interorbital constriction, and larger orbits. Regarding locomotion, our study emphasises the unique morphology of Otomys, which is characterised by equally long forelimbs and hindlimbs. This corresponds to its predominant fast quadrupedal running. In contrast, Stenocephalemys species are likely to rely more on saltatory locomotion. Among them, the forest-dwelling S. albipes likely demonstrates the most advanced form of this locomotory style. The study highlights significant functional diversification in rodent assemblages from the Ethiopian Highlands, primarily driven by foraging and locomotor ecologies. This morphological variation has likely contributed to shaping the rich rodent communities integral to the Eastern Afromontane Biodiversity Hotspot, globally recognized for its significance in mammal endemism.

AB  - Three million sheep raised on 10 000 active farms operating in traditional and innovative farming systems in Sardinia, Italy, account for 13% of sheep milk production in the European Union (EU). Almost all of the milk delivered is processed to sheep cheese and is destined for world trade. The Sardinian dairy sheep sector also emits approximately 1600 kt CO(2)eq/year, approximately 60% of regional livestock greenhouse gas (GHG), prompting the need for regional mitigation plans. The SheepToShip LIFE project (EU-LIFE Climate Change Action 2014-2020) is a regional case study to test emission mitigation strategies. Based on the SheepToShip LIFE findings, this paper presents a systems perspective against the backdrop of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, with the aim of underlining system interlinkages between environmental, societal, and economic objectives. The project included (i) a life cycle thinking approach featuring environmental and socioeconomic traits of 18 sheep farms, (ii) on-farm implementation and demonstration of eco-innovative mitigation techniques indicating the most viable actions to reduce impact, (iii) focus groups discussing beliefs and reactions of the main stakeholders, and (iv) group model building producing a causal loop diagram from a systems thinking approach and exploring insights for regional policy-making that aligns with the SDGs. Causal links connect public interventions and stakeholder interaction (SDG 17) to boost farm eco-innovations (SDGs 9 and 8) and education and farmer training (SDG 4), and they foster efficient production (SDG 12) and high-quality food provisioning (SDG 2).

AB  - In variable environments, habitats that are rich in resources often carry a higher risk of predation. As a result, natural selection should favour individuals that balance allocation of time to foraging versus avoiding predation through an optimal decision-making process that maximizes fitness. The behavioural trade-off between resource acquisition and risk avoidance is expected to be particularly acute during gestation and lactation, when the energetic demands of reproduction peak. Here, we investigated how reproductive female roe deer adjust their foraging activity and habitat use during the birth period to manage this trade-off compared with non-reproductive juveniles, and how parturition date constrains individual tactics of risk-resource management. Activity of reproductive females more than doubled immediately following parturition, when energy demand is highest. Furthermore, compared with non-reproductive juveniles, they increased their exposure to risk by using open habitat more during daytime and ranging closer to roads. However, these post-partum modifications in behaviour were particularly pronounced in late-parturient females who adopted a more risk-prone tactic, presumably to compensate for the growth handicap of their late-born offspring. In income breeders, individuals that give birth late may be constrained to trade risk avoidance for foraging during peak allocation to reproduction, with probable consequences for individual fitness.

AB  - Contemporary methods used to predict isotopic variation at regional scales have yet to include underlying distributions of the abundance of isotopic substrates. Additionally, traditional kriging methods fail to account for the potential influences of environmental grouping factors (i.e., random effects) that may reduce prediction error. We aim to improve upon traditional isoscape modeling techniques by accounting for variation in the abundances of isotopic substrates and evaluating the efficacy of a mixed-effects, regression kriging approach. We analyzed common moose forage from northeast Minnesota for delta C-13 and delta N-15 and estimated the isotopic landscape using regression kriging, both with and without random effects. We then compared these predictions to isoscape estimates informed by spatial variation in above-ground biomass. Finally, we kriged the regression residuals of our best-fitting models, added them to our isoscape predictions, and compared model performance using spatial hold-one-out cross validation. Isoscape predictions driven by uninformed and biomass-informed models varied by as much as 10 parts per thousand. Compared to traditional methods, incorporating biomass estimates improved RMSE values by as much as 0.12 and 1.00% for delta C-13 and delta N-15, respectively, while random effects improved r(2) values by as much as 0.15 for delta C-13 and 0.87 for delta N-15. Our findings illustrate how field-collected data, ancillary geospatial data, and novel spatial interpolation techniques can be used to more accurately estimate the isotopic landscape. Regression kriging using mixed-effects models and the refinement of model predictions using measures of abundance, provides a flexible, yet mechanistically driven approach to modeling isotopic variation across space.

AB  - Mathematical models have many uses. When input data is limited, simple models are required. This occurs in pasture agriculture when managers typically only have access to temperature and rainfall values. A simple pasture growth model was developed that requires only latitude and daily maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall. The accuracy of the model was validated using ten site-years of measured pasture growth at a site under continuous stocking where management controlled the height of grazing (HOG) and a site under rotational stocking at a West Virginia University farm (WVU). Relative forage growth, expressed as a fraction of maximum growth observed at the sites, was reasonably accurate. At the HOG site constant bias in relative growth was not different from zero. There was a year effect due to the weather station used for predicting growth at HOG being 1.8 km from the pasture. However, the error was only about 10-percent. At the WVU site constant bias for relative growth was not different from zero and year effect was eliminated when adjusted for nitrogen status of the treatments. This simple model described relative pasture growth within 10-percent of average for a given site, environment, and management using only daily weather inputs that are readily available. Using predictions of climate change impact on temperature and rainfall frequency and intensity this model can be used to predict the impact on pasture growth.

T2  - ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
LA  - English
KW  - IRON
AB  - The application of fertilizers can increase the yield of crops. Nano-fertilizer is a nano-organic fertilizer, which is an organic fertilizer with very fine particles. The effect of chemical fertilizers is better than that of general chemical fertilizers, which can effectively improve soil organic matter and is beneficial to the growth of crops. Organic fertilizers mainly refer to commercial organic fertilizers produced by high-temperature composting and fermentation of organic solid wastes such as livestock and poultry manure, crop straw, etc., eliminating toxic and harmful substances and being rich in nutrients including organic acids and peptides. Low-carbon economy refers to an economic model that uses various means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve good ecological operations under the guidance of the concept of sustainable development. With the increase in the global population and the continuous growth of the economic scale, environmental problems and consequences caused by the use of conventional energy such as fossil energy are constantly recognized by people. Under this background, the low-carbon economy emerges as the times require. This paper aims to study the application of nano-enhanced fertilizers in the development of agricultural low-carbon economy in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. In today's low-carbon economy, the combination of nano-efficiency fertilizers and agricultural production is conducive to improving the utilization rate of chemical fertilizers and reducing carbon emissions. This paper analyzes the carbon sink capacity of farmland ecosystems and the elements affecting the growth of LCA. This provides a basis for the exploration of farmland ecosystems. It expounds the relevant concepts of low-carbon economy and briefly discusses the agricultural carbon emissions in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The experimental results in this paper show that the enteric fermentation of dairy cows will produce 60 kg of methane and 15 kg of feces. Sheep enteric fermentation produces 4 kg of methane and fecal emissions of 0.13 kg. According to the data, the carbon emission of dairy cows is much greater than that of sheep.

AB  - Pig slurry fertigation can modify soil biochemical properties by promoting glomalin production and shifting microbial communities; however, its impacts under varying water regimes remain insufficiently quantified. We assessed irrigated and rainfed systems by integrating the soil quality index (SQI) with total and easily extractable glomalin (T-GRSP, EE-GRSP), determining microbial diversity via eDNA amplicon sequencing, and evaluating enzyme activities across three soil depths (0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm). Robust regression revealed that T-GRSP and EE-GRSP accounted for 75% of the SQI variability in irrigated soils and 46% in rainfed soils (p < 0.001), with the strongest correlations in the 0-10 cm layer. Irrigation increased T-GRSP concentrations by 66% (1.78 vs. 1.07 mg g(-1)) and raised its contribution to total soil carbon from 2.0% to 3.2%. The EE-GRSP levels were slightly lower in the irrigated soils (0.73 vs. 0.76 mg g(-1)) yet remained a sensitive early-warning indicator of moisture stress in rainfed plots. Microbial profiling showed a 19% increase in Shannon bacterial diversity (3.44 vs. 2.89), even more bacterial communities under irrigation, intermediate fungal diversity, higher fungal abundance, and no detectable arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in either system. Combining GRSP fractions with microbial and enzymatic markers provides a responsive framework for assessing soil health and guiding organic amendment strategies in fertigation-based agriculture under fluctuating water availability.

AB  - There are conflicting findings on the effect of phytogenic feed additives (PFA) on the productivity of small ruminants. The objective of this meta-analysis, therefore, was to evaluate the efficacy of PFA intervention in improving dry matter intake (DMI), ruminal fermentation, serum biochemical markers, and milk production in small ruminants. Studies on Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and PubMed were searched. Among the 852 articles retrieved, 14 were used for the analysis. Effect size was calculated using the random-effects model, and results were displayed as standardised mean differences (SMD) at 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results showed that methane production (P = 0.007), acetate production (P = 0.030), and acetate-to-propionate ratio (P = 0.019) were reduced by PFA with evidence of significant heterogeneity. In contrast, concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (P = 0.046) and propionate (P = 0.039) were increased by PFA intervention. Serum total proteins (P = 0.009) and serum glucose (P = 0.028) were increased, whereas serum urea was decreased (P = 0.009) by PFA intervention. Egger's test suggested no publication bias. Subgroup results showed that PFA intervention decreased methane production while increasing propionate production in sheep compared to goats. Meta-regression showed that moderators were significant predictors of the treatment effect on aspects of ruminal fermentation parameters and explained most of the heterogeneity in the effect of PFA intervention on ruminal fermentation parameters in small ruminants. These results suggest that PFA intervention enhanced ruminal fermentation and serum biochemical markers in small ruminants while reducing methane production.

AB  - Air pollutants-such as nitrogen oxides, emitted in diesel exhaust, and ozone (O-3)-disrupt interactions between plants, the insect herbivore pests that feed upon them and natural enemies of those herbivores (e.g. parasitoids). Using eight field-based rings that emit regulated quantities of diesel exhaust and O-3, we investigated how both pollutants, individually and in combination, altered the attraction and parasitism rate of a specialist parasitoid (Diaeretiella rapae) on aphid-infested and un-infested Brassica napus plants. Individual effects of O-3 decreased D. rapae abundance and emergence by 37% and 55%, respectively, compared with ambient (control) conditions. When O-3 and diesel exhaust were emitted concomitantly, D. rapae abundance and emergence increased by 79% and 181%, respectively, relative to control conditions. This attraction response occurred regardless of whether plants were infested with aphids and was associated with an increase in the concentration of aliphatic glucosinolates, especially gluconapin (3-butenyl-glucosinolate), within B. napus leaves. Plant defensive responses and their ability to attract natural aphid enemies may be beneficially impacted by pollution exposure. These results demonstrate the importance of incorporating multiple air pollutants when considering the effects of air pollution on plant-insect interactions.

AB  - Livestock can transport seeds long distances by endozoochory due to their large home range and capacity to move among different habitats. However, differences in digestive system and body size between different livestock species may result in variations in the dispersal of domestic livestock. To test such effects, we explore the effects of endozoochorous seed dispersal of Malus sieversii by three livestock: cattle, horse, and sheep in the Ili Botany Garden, northwest of China. We collected seeds of M. sieversii and fed them to cattle, horses and sheep. After feeding, we collected all the seeds from their feces every 24 h for 6 days and determined the seed recovery percent, mean retention time, and germination percent of seeds after the effects of the digestive tracts of those three livestock species. Seed recovery percent in three livestock species feces were cattle (CS) (54.05%) > horse (HS) (4.83%) > sheep (SS) (0.45%). The mean retention time of seeds in the digestive tract of cattle, horses and sheep were 53 h, 57 h, and 45 h. The seed weight and seed coat thickness decreased significantly after the treatment of the digestive tract. After 80 days cold stratification of seeds, the germination percent of CK, CS, and HS were 61%, 69%, and 18%, respectively. The results indicated cattle is an effective seed disperser of M. sieversii, with a recovery and germination percent in endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle than that of horse and sheep. Our findings may also provide a theoretical basis about regarding seed-centric grazing management decisions and keeping horse and sheep out of pastures during the fruit of M. sieversii shedding period.

AB  - Harvest estimation is a central part of adaptive management of wildlife. In the absence of complete reporting, statishods are required to extrapolate from the available data. We developed a Hierarchical Bayesian framework tailored for partial reporting where hunting areas covered by reporting hunting teams are available. The framework accounts for autocorrelation at the national, county, and hunting management precinct levels. We derived and evaluated an approximation for the probability of harvest on non-reported areas under a non-linear relationship between harvest area per team and harvest rate. We applied the framework to reports of red fox (Vulpes vulpes), wild boar (Sus scrofa), common eider (Somateria mollissima), and grey partridge (Perdix perdix) harvest in Sweden from the hunting years 1997/1998-2019/2020. The approximation was evaluated and determined to be sufficiently accurate. We showed that accounting for autocorrelation in harvest reduced uncertainty and increased predictive accuracy, particularly for game hunted in low numbers and variably between teams. The analysis also revealed that hunting rate has a sub-linear relationship with a team's area for all considered species. Further, the framework revealed substantial differences across regions in terms of parameters modeling the distribution of huntable land across teams as well as parameters modeling harvest rates. We conclude that the framework is useful to detect shifts in hunting rates and/or practices.

AB  - The Arctic Ocean experiences significant seasonal to interannual environmental changes, including in temperature, light, sea ice, and surface nutrient concentrations, that influence the dynamics of marine plankton populations. Here, we use a hindcast simulation (1948-2009) of size-structured Arctic Ocean plankton communities, ocean circulation, and biogeochemical cycles in order to better understand how seasonal to interannual changes in the environment influence phytoplankton physiology, plankton community structure, trophic dynamics, and fish production in the Arctic Ocean. The growth of model phytoplankton was primarily limited in winter, spring, and fall by light, but in summer, the growth of smaller and larger phytoplankton was mostly limited by temperature and nutrient availability, respectively. The dominant trophic pathway in summer was from phytoplankton to herbivorous zooplankton such that the average trophic position of model zooplankton was lower in the summer growing season compared to the rest of the year. On interannual timescales, changes in plankton community composition were strongly tied to interannual changes in bottom-up forcing by the environment. In the summer, in years with less ice and warmer temperatures, the biomass of phytoplankton and zooplankton was higher, the size-abundance relationship slopes were more negative (indicative of a phytoplankton community enriched in smaller phytoplankton), zooplankton had higher mean trophic position (indicative of greater carnivory), and potential fishery production was greater, fueled by increased mesozooplankton biomass and flux of organic matter to the benthos. The summertime shift toward greater carnivory in warmer and low-ice years was due primarily to changes in phenology, with phytoplankton and microzooplankton blooms occurring approximately 1 month earlier in these conditions and carnivorous zooplankton increasing in abundance during summer. The model provides a spatially and temporally complete overview of simulated changes in plankton communities in the Arctic Ocean occurring on seasonal to interannual timescales, and it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying these changes as well as their broader biogeochemical and ecosystem significance.

AB  - In actual production environments, antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) are abundant in pig manure, which can form transmission chains through animals, the environment, and humans, thereby threatening human health. Therefore, based on metagenomic analysis methods, ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were annotated in pig manure samples from 6 pig farms in 3 regions of Shanxi Province, and the potential hosts of ARGs were analyzed. The results showed that a total of 14 ARG types were detected, including 182 ARG subtypes, among which tetracycline, phenol, aminoglycoside, and macrolide resistance genes were the main ones. ARG profiles, MGE composition, and microbial communities were significantly different in different regions as well as between different pig farms. In addition, Anaerobutyricum, Butyrivibrio, and Turicibacter were significantly associated with multiple ARGs, and bacteria such as Prevotella, Bacteroides, and the family Oscillospiraceae carried multiple ARGs, suggesting that these bacteria are potential ARG hosts in pig manure. Procrustes analysis showed that bacterial communities and MGEs were significantly correlated with ARG profiles. Variation partitioning analysis results indicated that the combined effect of MGEs and bacterial communities accounted for 64.08% of resistance variation and played an important role in ARG profiles. These findings contribute to our understanding of the dissemination and persistence of ARGs in actual production settings, and offer some guidance for the prevention and control of ARGs contamination.

AB  - The ocean sunfishes Mola spp. (Family Molidae) are charismatic marine megafauna that are difficult for nature-based tourism operators to target due to their sporadic occurrence. However, the giant sunfish M. alexandrini is seasonally important for the SCUBA tourism industry in Bali, Indonesia, where these molids seek cleaner-fish interactions on the reefs of the local Nusa Penida Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Lombok Strait. Little is known of their movements, including their apparent seasonal affinity to the Nusa Penida MPA. We tagged 8 fish with Fastloc GPS tags; however, intermittent surface visits and crepuscular diving habits, combined with early tag dislodgment and tag transmission failures, yielded a challenging data set to analyze. We overcame this difficulty with a geolocation model (HMMoce) that was parameterized to leverage the complex topography of the study region, be robust to data sparsity, and accommodate switching between distinct resident and migrant behaviour states. The results revealed small-scale movements whereby the fish exhibited particular affinity to bathymetrically complex, intense upwelling areas around Nusa Penida, the east coast of Bali, and an inter-basin trough to the north. Dive patterns suggested that the molids were foraging in these oceanographically dynamic areas. Our findings suggest that the Lombok Strait is at least of seasonal importance to this species, and the local SCUBA tourism industry likely relies on individual fish that re-visit the reefs of the Nusa Penida MPA multiple times during the sunfish season.

AB  - Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma ovis, tick-borne pathogens with zoonotic potential, have been detected in small ruminants in Europe and North America in the past. These intracellular bacteria cause tick borne fever and ovine anaplasmosis, respectively. The most common clinical signs of infection are fever, lethargy and anaemia. To date, little is known about the distribution of these pathogens in sheep and goats from Germany. Therefore, 3178 serum samples of small ruminants from 71 farms distributed in five German federal states (Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria) were examined for IgG antibodies to Anaplasma species by a cELISA based on the MSP5 antigen. In 70 flocks, antibodies to Anaplasma spp. were detected in both sheep and goats. Furthermore, a risk factor analysis was carried out by means of a questionnaire answered by the farmers. Older animals and females were more likely to have antibodies to Anaplasma spp. Moreover, sheep had a higher probability of becoming seropositive than goats. Using flocks for landscape conservation and the presence of cats and dogs on the farm increased the risk of having more than 20% seropositive animals within the flock significantly. Since antibodies to Anaplasma spp. have been detected in almost all flocks (70/71), it can be assumed that Anaplasma spp. might be underdiagnosed in small ruminants from Germany.
   Knowledge about the distribution of Anaplasma spp. in small ruminants from Germany is limited. Therefore, serum samples were examined from 71 small ruminant flocks (2731 sheep, 447 goats) located in the five German federal states: Schleswig-Holstein (SH), Lower Saxony (LS), North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Baden-Wuerttemberg (BW) and Bavaria (BAV). Antibodies to Anaplasma spp. were determined by a cELISA based on the MSP5 antigen. A risk factor analysis at animal and flock level was also performed. Antibodies to Anaplasma spp. were detected in 70/71 flocks without significant difference in the intra-flock prevalence (IFP) between the federal states. The mean antibody levels from sheep were significantly lower in northern Germany (LS, SH) compared to west (NRW) and south Germany (BW, BAV). Sheep had a 2.5-fold higher risk of being seropositive than goats. Females and older animals (> 2 years) were more likely to have antibodies to Anaplasma spp. in one third and one quarter of cases, respectively. Flocks used for landscape conservation had a five times higher risk of acquiring an IFP greater than 20%. Cats and dogs on the farms increased the probability for small ruminant flocks to have an IFP of above 20% 10-fold and 166-fold, respectively. Further studies are necessary to assess the impact of Anaplasma species on the health of small ruminants in Germany.

AB  - Pollen records and macrobotanical remains indicate maize was grown minimally during the Middle Woodland (200 BCE - CE 500) in eastern North America. However, previous isotopic studies have found limited evidence of its consumption by people in archaeobotanical assemblages. Hypothetically, if deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) were feeding on maize (Zea mays L.) in gardens prior to its adoption as a human dietary staple, this may indicate a niche construction process which would later lead to shifts in hunting strategies. This construction of garden spaces or niches has implications for decreased mobility and greater investment in garden crops. To evaluate this hypothesis in the Ohio River Valley, we measured stable nitrogen (delta 15N) and carbon (delta 13C) isotope compositions of bulk collagen in deer bones (N = 25) from archaeological sites spanning the Middle Woodland (200 BCE - CE 400/500) to Late Precontact (CE 1400-1630). Our hypothesis was not confirmed: little (one deer of 19) evidence for maize consumption occurred in the analyzed deer remains. Five deer of 19 did indicate the possibility of feeding in deeply wooded areas, reflecting canopy effect. Dog (Canis lupus familiaris L.) bone samples (N = 2) were also analyzed for these isotopes and one indicates some consumption of maize.

AB  - In terrestrial ecosystems, the activities of semi-fossorial animals such as Cape porcupines have important landscape effects that may manifest in the dry season when the availability of above-ground forage becomes limiting. We investigated the effects of foraging activities of Cape porcupines on savanna landscapes. We measured the size (surface area and depth) of foraging holes of porcupines located at the base of trees in the dry season in two mesic savanna sites at Roodeplaat Farm and Bisley Valley Nature Reserve in South Africa. We also recorded plant and animal activities inside the foraging holes for 3 months. The depth of foraging holes beneath small trees (Vachellia nilotica) was greater than depths beneath old trees (V. robusta and D. rotundifolia). This resulted in the subsequent death of most (>50%) small impacted trees in the dry season at Bisley. The surface area of foraging holes for older trees was greater than that for small trees and even greater for old holes. This study showed that porcupines kill trees or expose them to secondary attacks. The physical impacts of semi-fossorial herbivores in savannas can be significant, with contributions to direct and indirect landscape transformation and restoration.

AB  - Vegetation management on solar farms can be accomplished through targeted grazing with sheep. To the au-thors' knowledge, no research has been conducted to date on sheep grazing behavior on solar farms, yet such research is crucial to inform grazing management practices for contract grazers on solar farms. The objectives of this study were to investigate both the effects of solar panels on sheep grazing behavior and the grazing man-agement strategy (intensive rotational grazing (1-day rotations (1d))) or rotational grazing (4-day rotations (4d))) best suited for vegetation management on a solar farm. Data were collected on Gold Tree Solar Farm in San Luis Obispo, CA, USA. Sheep with predominantly Dorper genetics (over 99%; n = 80) were stratified by body weight (BW) and age in a crossover design across treatment grazing locations, solar farm (S) or native rangeland (NR), and grazing managements, intensive rotational (1d) or rotational (4d). Grazing location treatments (S or NR) were randomly assigned a grazing management, 4d (paddock size = 0.405 ha, 4 days/paddock), or 1d (paddock size = 0.101 ha, 1 day/paddock, 4 paddocks), resulting in a 2 x 2 factorial design. All sheep were equipped with a HOBO Pendant G data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) in a medial -dorsal position on their necks using vet wrap (Dura-Tech), to record 'grazing' behavior, defined as standing or walking slowly with the head down. The sensitivity, accuracy, and precision were > 90% for 'grazing' behavior with 2-minute intervals. 'Grazing' behavior exhibited a treatment x management (< 0.01) interaction. Both solar (S-4d and S-1d) groups spent more time (< 0.01) 'grazing' than both NR (NR-4d and NR-1d) groups. The presence of solar panels may have provided sheep relief from heat, wind, and rain, which could increase grazing activity. During the study, forage was senescent and low-quality in terms of nutritive value. Both forage di-gestibility and protein content were higher in the S than in the NR paddocks. Sheep spent less time 'grazing' under intensive rotational management (1d) when compared with rotational management (4d) (< 0.001). The use of sheep for vegetation management on solar farms has great potential. Sheep are effective grazers, easily able to maneuver between solar panels and can graze on steep slopes utilizing the panels to provide shade and protection from climatic conditions. In conclusion, utilizing a mix of intensive rotational and rotational grazing according to forage conditions - rotational 4d grazing management types being most effective for grazing behavior with senescent forage conditions - may be the most effective grazing management strategy on solar farms.

AB  - The multifaceted effects of climate change on physical and biogeochemical processes are rapidly altering marine ecosystems but often are considered in isolation, leaving our understanding of interactions between these drivers of ecosystem change relatively poor. This is particularly true for shallow coastal ecosystems, which are fuelled by a combination of distinct pelagic and benthic energy pathways that may respond to climate change in fundamentally distinct ways. The fish production supported by these systems is likely to be impacted by climate change differently to those of offshore and shelf ecosystems, which have relatively simpler food webs and mostly lack benthic primary production sources. We developed a novel, multispecies size spectrum model for shallow coastal reefs, specifically designed to simulate potential interactive outcomes of changing benthic and pelagic energy inputs and temperatures and calculate the relative importance of these variables for the fish community. Our model, calibrated using field data from an extensive temperate reef monitoring program, predicts that changes in resource levels will have much stronger impacts on fish biomass and yields than changes driven by physiological responses to temperature. Under increased plankton abundance, species in all fish trophic groups were predicted to increase in biomass, average size, and yields. By contrast, changes in benthic resources produced variable responses across fish trophic groups. Increased benthic resources led to increasing benthivorous and piscivorous fish biomasses, yields, and mean body sizes, but biomass decreases among herbivore and planktivore species. When resource changes were combined with warming seas, physiological responses generally decreased species' biomass and yields. Our results suggest that understanding changes in benthic production and its implications for coastal fisheries should be a priority research area. Our modified size spectrum model provides a framework for further study of benthic and pelagic energy pathways that can be easily adapted to other ecosystems.
   The multifaceted effects of climate change on physical and biogeochemical processes are rapidly altering marine ecosystems. This size-based modelling study shows that the source, size and abundance of primary and secondary producers are critical to understanding impacts of global heating on coastal fish communities.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate horizontal subsurface flow (HSSF) treatment wetlands (TW) for the treatment of swine effluents mixed with domestic wastewater, as well as to compare the efficiency of systems with monocultures and polycultures. Three species of plants were used in both monoculture and polyculture experimental systems: a) Heliconia latispatha, b) Typha latifolia, c) Cyperus alternifolius, d) Heliconia latispatha + Typha latifolia, e) Heliconia latispatha + Cyperus alternifolius and f) control (without plant). Each cell operated with a hydraulic loading rate of 5.4 cm/d. The measured variables included environmental parameters (temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, evapotranspiration, pH and dissolved oxygen -DO-), vegetative growth (plant height, width and leaf length, stem thickness, leaf number and biomass production) and pollutant measurements (chemical oxygen demand -COD-, total coliforms -TC-, total suspended solids -TSS-, volatile suspended solids -VSS-, total nitrogen -TN- and total phosphorus -TP-). The results indicated that there were significant differences (p <= 0.001) between the systems. In general, those systems with vegetation removed more TP (from 44.3% to 63.4%) and TN (from 68.1% to 74.9%) than the system without vegetation (32.9% for TP and 55.6% for TN). In addition, the experimental configuration as mono or polyculture was a determinant factor in the efficiency of the systems; the polyculture system with H. latispatha + T. latifolia was the most efficient in the removal pollutants such as COD (68.9 +/- 10.6%), TSS (55.6 +/- 0.5%), VSS (57.8 +/- 0.6%), TC (69.5 +/- 6.1%) and TN (74.9 +/- 1.4). With regard to the evaluated species, H. latispatha showed the highest relative growth in both monoculture and polyculture systems with this high nutrient-concentration wastewater. These results demonstrate the HSSF TWs planted with monocultures and polycultures of plants in tropical climates represent an option to reduce the pollutant load of wastewater resulting from the mixing of domestic wastewater and pig farming wastewater.

AB  - This paper aimed to study the effect of copper sulfate fertilization (90 kg/hm2) on molybdenum (Mo) poisoning of the Przewalski's gazelle (P. przewalskii) in the Qinghai Lake basin. Soil, pasture, and the Przewalski's gazelle's blood and hair samples were collected from the animal rescue center in this study. The biochemical parameters of the Przewalski's gazelle's blood and the mineral contents of the fodder and soil were ascertained. The findings demonstrated that the impacted pastures' soil and forage had considerably greater Mo levels (p < 0.01) than those of the healthy pastures. Compared to the control group, the experimental gazelles had significantly lower Mo content in the blood and hair, while the impacted gazelles had significantly higher copper and sulfur contents in the blood and hair (p < 0.01). The levels of blood Hb, PCV, MCV, and MCH of the Przewalski's gazelle in the fertilized group had been extensively greater than those in the control group (p < 0.01). The tiers of blood AST, LDH, CPK, and ALP of the Przewalski's gazelle in the fertilized group had been extensively greater than those in the control group. The contents of TP, ALB, and GLB in the fertilized group had been substantially decreased than those in the control group. In comparison to the control group, the fertilized group exhibited considerably higher activity of serum GSH-Px, SOD, T-AOC, and CAT and a significantly lower MDA concentration. The results showed that the appropriate application of copper sulfate could significantly increase the copper content in forage, regulate the molybdenumcopper ratio in soil, and thus effectively improve the molybdenum toxicity symptoms of Przewalski's gazelle, improve the antioxidant ability of the gazelle, and alleviate the molybdenum toxicity condition.

AB  - In the absence of verification, historical aspects of wildlife management or conservation sometimes have become established in the literature and persisted therein for decades; in other situations, serendipitous discoveries have corrected information that earlier had been treated as factual. In some cases, efforts to vet historical accounts have been ongoing for many years; such is the case involving William Franklin Frakes, an American rancher, naturalist, adventurer, and author, who captured and translocated bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in California, USA, near the turn of the twentieth century. In this review, we provide information that substantiates the majority of Frakes's activities, including newfound evidence that he attempted to capture bighorn sheep in heretofore undisclosed locations. We relied on his articles that appeared in turn-of-the-century sporting magazines, his extensive correspondence with respected individuals and organizations active in wildlife conservation at that time, information published in the scientific and popular literature, interviews with local historians or authorities, and our personal knowledge of the geographic areas traversed by Frakes. We provide strong evidence that he captured bighorn sheep in the Avawatz Mountains and substantial support for the notion that he released at least some of those animals, and possibly hybrids between them and domestic sheep, near the west end of the Bullion Mountains, a location that heretofore has escaped critical scrutiny. We further discuss the implications of his activities in the context of the potential for disease transmission, the subsequent dynamics of bighorn sheep inhabiting the Bullion Mountains and surrounding ranges, metapopulation function, and the possibility that the genetic structure of bighorn sheep occupying that range was altered by Frakes's actions. All of these have implications for understanding the historical influence of anthropogenic activities on bighorn sheep >100 years ago. We also include an appendix comprising information discovered during our research, but that we have been unable to substantiate or that otherwise is of interest.

AB  - The medium and large mammals of the high Ecuadorian Amazon region have not been studied despite facing serious threats. In this context, this study attempts to document the richness and abundance of these species from the Ethnoecological Community Protected Forest Pablo L & oacute;pez de Ogl & aacute;n Alto (BPCEPLOA) located in Pastaza province. From February to July 2020, 20 photo-trapping stations were installed, 500 m apart, in 10 km2 2 of lowland evergreen forest. With an effort of 3347 trap nights, 1110 independent events were obtained from 29 mammal species of eight orders and fifteen families (21 medium-sized and eight large-sized species). From the total number of independent events obtained, 60.88 % were omnivorous mammals, 25.87 % were herbivorous, 10.61 % were carnivorous and 2.52 % were insectivorous. The species with the highest Relative Abundance Index (RAI) were Dasyprocta fuliginosa (RAI=9.98), Mazama americana (RAI=4.93) and Dasypus novemcinctus (RAI= 3.85). The threatened species recorded were Phantera onca, , Tapirus terrestris, , Myrmecophaga tridactyla, , Priodontes maximus, , Atelocynus microtis and Speothos venaticus. . Our study demonstrates that BPCEPLOA has a high diversity of mammals despite its short extension. With this information, it will be possible to promote the creation of an ecological corridor in the Ogl & aacute;n river basin for the protection of the local fauna, with the consensus of the indigenous communities in the BPCEPLOA's area of influence.

AB  - The African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana) is an ecosystem engineer essential in determining the structure and vegetation abundance in mesic dry protected areas such as the Mana Pools National Park (MNP) in Zimbabwe. Understanding the interactions between elephants and vegetation structure is essential for effective conservation and management of savannah ecosystems. Conservation efforts often aim to balance elephant populations with the carrying capacity of their habitats to ensure the sustainability of both flora and fauna within protected areas. Therefore understanding how African savannah elephants influence vegetation structure, abundance and damage is critical for adaptive ecosystem management and wildlife conservation in mesic savannah ecosystems. This study assessed: (i) vegetation structure, (ii) abundance and (iii) evidence of elephant-induced vegetation damage near a distance gradient to water points in MNP. A generalised linear model (GLM) was used to investigate the relationship between vegetation aspects that is structure, abundance and evidence of damage with distance from water sources. In the mesic protected MNP where African savannah elephants predominate, the modelled vegetation shape, abundance and damage exhibit spatial differences on a distant gradient towards water sources (chi(2), p < 0.05). There is need for implementation of comparably, less costly, homogenous conservation measures for African savannah elephants across the artificial water pans in the MNP.

AB  - Although deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) are among the most studied small mammals, their species diversity and phylogenetic relationships remain unclear. The lack of taxonomic clarity is mainly due to a conservative morphology and because some taxa are rare, have restricted distributions, or are poorly sampled. One taxon, P. mexicanus, includes southern Mexican subspecies that have not had their systematic placement tested with genetic data. We analyzed the phylogenetic relationships and genetic structure of P. mexicanus populations using sequences of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. We inferred that P. mexicanus is paraphyletic, with P. m. teapensis, P. m. tehuantepecus, and P. m. totontepecus more closely related to P. gymnotis than to P. m. mexicanus. This highly divergent clade ranges from northeastern Oaxaca to northern Chiapas, including southern Veracruz, and southern Tabasco. In light of this group???s mitochondrial distinctiveness, cohesive geographic range, and previously reported molecular, biochemical, and morphological differences, we recommend it be treated as P. totontepecus. Our findings demonstrate the need for an improved understanding of the diversity and evolutionary history of these common and abundant members of North American small mammal communities.

AB  - Many zoos conduct husbandry training with positive reinforcement to improve the care and welfare of wild animals. However, few studies have quantitatively examined whether stress occurs during invasive procedures. Brushing is known to encourage Malayan tapirs Tapirus indicus to lie down, helping with veterinary care, including preventive care. This study aimed to assess stress in Malayan tapirs during veterinary procedures using heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. In Experiment 1, the HRV index was tested by puncturing the tapirs without brushing and behavioural stress indicators were examined. Experiment 2 involved HRV measurement during husbandry training, including blood collection and brushing, to compare HRV changes before and after puncture. Experiment 3 examined the impact of brushing by comparing HRV across different postures, including during nighttime rest. The results showed that in Experiment 1, heart rate (HR) increased during and after puncture, matching the behavioural stress index, suggesting HRV analysis may be a useful stress evaluation tool. In Experiment 2, HR, HF, and LF/HF varied widely among individuals and days, with no clear negative impact of of puncture. Experiment 3 showed significant differences in HRV parameters (HR, HF, and LF/HF) across postures, suggesting that brushing may have a rewarding effect on the tapirs. This study allowed us to conduct the first HRV analysis of Malayan tapirs. In addition, the potential of reducing the stressful effects of invasive procedures by brushing was suggested.

AB  - Sea urchins are marine species originating from the Indo-Pacific and Red Sea regions, having a natural immune system, acting as biocorrosives in coral ecosystems, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and bioactive components, and generally feeding on rock bottoms and coral reefs as herbivores. Studies are being carried out on Sea urchins as they have the potential to gain economic importance by evaluating their use as biological agents. This study focused on the effects and adjuvant potential of the spine toxin of Diadema setosum, a sea urchin species, on mammalian macrophage cells. Our results suggest that the extracts from this species have adjuvant potential to be utilized in vaccine formulations.

AB  - Earlier studies have indicated that consumption of beavers Castor ssp. by wolves Canis lupus varies seasonally and is influenced by rainfall affecting water levels. Therefore, to determine whether these carnivores prey more often on beavers in drier seasons and years, we assessed the diet of wolves in Wigry National Park (NE Poland) by analysing 303 scats collected from 2017 to 2019. The most important prey of wolves in this region was the wild boar Sus scrofa (25.2% of consumed biomass), Eurasian beaver Castor fiber (24.4%) and roe deer Capreolus capreolus (24.2%). Predator niche breadth was broader in spring-summer (B = 2.24) than in autumn-winter (B = 1.32), mainly due to higher consumption of beavers (37.3% in spring-summer and 10.7% in autumn-winter). Wolves consumed more beavers (40.9%) and had the broadest niche breadth (B = 1.99) in 2019, when the annual rainfall was lowest. Our study provides further evidence that wolves prey on beavers more often in ice-free seasons and drier years.

AB  - Herbivorous reef fishes provide a vital function in reef ecosystems by removing algae and making space available to coral recruits. The high abundance of herbivores in the reefs of the Lakshadweep islands has potentially aided in reef recovery and helped avoid a phase shift to an algal-dominated system, despite most areas having suffered massive coral losses. Mixed-species grouping in herbivores could potentially benefit both the participant species and the reef ecosystem by improving foraging efficiency. We examined the grouping propensity and species richness for three types of herbivore groups after a mass-bleaching event in 2010 and a mass recruitment event in 2015. The species richness and number of parrotfish groups, as well as the grouping propensity of common species, declined starkly across years, indicating that these groups may have formed in response to the mass-bleaching event, slowly diminishing as the reefs recovered. Conversely, large surgeonfish, which varied in richness and propensity across islands and aspect, are probably influenced by local processes. Small surgeonfish only increased in species richness and number in 2015, which may have been in response to the recruitment event. Thus, herbivorous fishes may respond differently to local ecosystem perturbations and play different roles in reef recovery. This article is part of the theme issue 'Mixed-species groups and aggregations: shaping ecological and behavioural patterns and processes'.

AB  - We evaluated the feeding behaviour and prey preferences of three dominant copepods, Calanus propinquus (Brady, 1883), Calanoides acutus (Giesbrecht, 1902), and Rhincalanus gigas (Brady, 1883), at different latitudes along 110 degrees E in the Southern Ocean. An integrative approach combining mouthpart morphology, gut contents, and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (delta 13C and delta 15N) provided information on the functional adaptions for feeding, the in situ dietary preferences, and the trophic positions and feeding strategies of these copepods. Diatoms were the copepods' major food source, accounting for more than 16 species out of the 23 taxa identified in their gut contents. Itoh's edge index for the mandibles also indicated that the copepods are herbivores, but seta length/basis length (LS/LB) and basis width/basis length (WB/LB) of the maxillipedal endopod suggested carnivory. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) demonstrated a slight difference in dietary preference among copepods of the same order, but copepods of all three species collected near the edge of the ice had similar diets, indicating that their feeding behaviour is influenced by food availability. Our results provide a better understanding of the ecological roles of copepods in the Southern Ocean's food web and their responses to changes in the polar ecosystem.

AB  - Vehicle collisions with deer (Odocoileus spp.) cause billions of dollars in damages and injure thousands of drivers every year in the United States, and few mitigation methods have proven effective. However, recent research suggests that vehicle lighting might influence white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; hereafter, deer) responses to oncoming vehicles. Most new vehicles are manufactured with light emitting diode (LED) headlights which differ in total radiance and wavelength of light emitted compared to the previous industry standard of tungsten-halogen (halogen) headlights. Also, frontal vehicle illumination through rear-facing lighting has shown promise in enhancing deer responses to vehicles, but its effectiveness has not been tested under various headlight conditions (headlight type or intensity). As such, it remains unclear how these aspects of vehicle lighting affect deer responses to an approaching vehicle. We used 23 captive, wild-type deer to investigate how variations in vehicle lighting affect deer responses to an approaching vehicle at night, when most collisions occur. We released deer into a 95 m long, 3 m wide chute and approached them from the opposite end with an electric golf cart outfitted with two versions of stock 2017-2020 Ford Fusion headlights (LED and halogen) and a 51 cm rear-facing lightbar to test how vehicle lighting affected deer avoidance behaviors in an imminent, head-on collision scenario. Each deer received eight lighting treatments consisting of unique combinations of headlight type (LED vs. halogen), light intensity (low vs. high beam), and rear-facing lighting (lightbar off vs. on). We measured deer alert and flight behavior using infrared videography. We found that the halogen, high beam, lightbar off treatment had the greatest probability of evoking an alert response. Furthermore, when the lightbar was off, high beams appeared to increase alert probability for halogen headlights. Also, we found evidence that high beam, halogen headlights tend to increase alert probability over high beam, LED headlights, when the lighbar was off. We found no effect of our lighting treatments on deer alert distance, flight probability, or flight initiation distance. Across all behavioral responses, the random effect deer ID explained 0.86-9.19 x more variation than our lighting treatments, reflecting large differences in responses among deer. Overall, we found that vehicle lighting can impact deer behavior during an imminent, head-on collision scenario, although lighting was ineffective at increasing favorable flight behaviors. Future research should investigate how vehicle lighting treatments affect free-ranging, wild deer in a variety of real-world scenarios and at longer approach distances.

AB  - Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m(2)) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m(2)) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised.

AB  - Biodeterioration is known to cause irreversible damage to open-air cultural heritages. China has numerous openair cultural heritages constructed of stone and brick, but very little information is available about the factors involved in their biodeterioration. In this study, different kinds of open-air cultural heritages (steles, towers, temples, Tang-ling carvings, and stone bridges) from 14 different locations in temperate climate zone of China were collected and investigated. Microbiological characteristics of these cultural heritages revealed that both cyanobacteria and lichens were the mainly dominant groups on these open-air stone and brick cultural heritages with visible deterioration. Cyanobacteria were closely associated with the severely deteriorated Tang-ling carvings wile lichens were most commonly found on temples and bridges. The main cyanobacteria were Oscillatoria, Pleurocapsa, and Lyngbya, and the dominant lichens were Xanthoria Th. Fr., Lepraria. Ach. and Camellia on the surface of cultural heritage. In addition, the extent of deterioration associated with cyanobacteria exhibited an increasing trend with higher annual mean sunshine intensity, calcite content, and cultural heritage age though not statistically significant. Redundancy analysis indicated that sunshine intensity and the age of the archeological structures were the key factors that significantly affected the biodeterioration of cultural heritages. This study provides more understanding of the microbial community associated with deterioration of open-air cultural heritages situated at the temperate climate zone of China.

AB  - When coral and macroalgae are alternative attractors, the trajectory of the benthic community following a major disturbance is shaped in part by whether herbivores keep macroalgae suppressed, leaving reef surfaces in a state suitable for coral colonization. Because macroalgae tend to colonize much faster than coral, an important issue is how close ambient herbivory is to the level where control of macroalgae is lost, that is, the precariousness of the coral-invasible state relative to the switch-point to macroalgae. In Moorea, French Polynesia, reefs dominated by the macroalga Turbinaria ornata remained so for multiple population turnovers, whereas reefs where Turbinaria was removed by a simulated pulse disturbance remained free of macroalgae throughout the 5-yr study. A field experiment revealed that macroalgae was unable to proliferate on disturbed reefs until ambient herbivory was reduced by more than 50%. Low precariousness of the coral-invasible state facilitated a gradual transition to a coral community because it allowed sufficient time for coral to repopulate. Accumulation of coral on disturbed reefs was 3.5 times greater than on undisturbed, Turbinaria-dominated reefs. Long-term persistence of the coral-invasible state was facilitated by high abundances of grazing herbivores that prevent the establishment of macroalgae, whereas persistence of the Turbinaria-dominated state reflected the scarcity of browsing herbivores that consume mature macroalgae. By revealing processes that foster bistability of coral and macroalgae states, our work helps explain the rich dynamical behavior exhibited by coral reef communities in Moorea and elsewhere.

AB  - The present study aims to use behavioral responses of the freshwater planarian Girardia tigrina to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on the aquatic ecosystem of the watershed Araguaia-Tocantins (Tocantins, Brazil). Behavioral responses are integrative and cumulative tools that reflect changes in energy allocation in organisms. Thus, feeding rate and locomotion velocity (pLMV) were determined to assess the effects induced by the laboratory exposure of adult planarians to water samples collected in the region of Tocantins-Araguaia, identifying the sampling points affected by contaminants. Furthermore, physicochemical and microbiological parameters, as well as the presence of inorganic compounds (dissolved aluminum, total barium, total chloride, dissolved iron, total fluoride, total manganese, nitrates, nitric nitrogen, total sulfate, total zinc) and surfactants, were determined on each specific sampling point. The behavioral biomarkers (feeding rate and pLMV) of the freshwater planarians were significantly decreased when organisms were exposed to water samples from four municipalities (Formoso do Araguaia, Lagoa da Confusao, Gurupi and Porto Nacional), sites of the Tocantins-Araguaia hydrographic region-TAHR. Both behavioral biomarkers decreased up to similar to 37-39% compared to organisms in ASTM medium only. Our results showed that these behavioral biomarkers can be used for fast screening monitoring of environmental samples of freshwater ecosystems, since a decrease in feeding rate and locomotor activity was observed in sites impacted by anthropogenic activities. However, the absence of effects observed in some sampling points does not represent the absence of contamination, since several other classes of contaminants were not determined. In these negative results, the absence of deleterious effects on behavioral biomarkers might only be indicative that the potential presence of contaminants on such sites does not significantly affect the performance of planarians. This fast screening approach seems to be useful to determine contaminated sites in freshwater ecosystems for biomonitoring purposes. This knowledge will help to develop biomonitoring programs and to decide appropriate sampling sites and analysis.

AB  - Modern African ungulates navigate seasonal variation in resource availability through diet-switching (primarily mixed-feeders) and/or migrating (primarily grass grazers). These ecological generalisations are well-documented today, but the extent to which they apply to the non-analog ecosystems of the Pleistocene are unclear. Drawing from serially-sampled stable isotope measurements from 18 Kenyan large herbivore species from the Last Glacial Period (LGP), we evaluate how diet, diet-switching, and migration compare to observations from present-day settings. We find a higher grazing signal in most LGP species and a greater magnitude of diet-switching than in the present. Additionally, we find that the relationships between grass intake, migration, diet-switching, and body size during the LGP were unlike those observed today. This establishes a revised paleoecology of LGP herbivore communities and highlights that LGP herbivores were behaviourally non-analog. Our results imply that ecological observations from present-day settings offer an incomplete perspective of herbivore-environment interactions.

AB  - According to current modern concepts, cellulose complexes produced by various microorganisms are polyfermentative systems composed of enzymes that differ in molecular structure and the way they act on cellulose. Microbiological processing is one of the most economical, promising and ecologically safe ways of processing cellulose raw materials. In the study, 27 spore-forming microorganism isolates were isolated from goat stomach juice, goat stomach, rabbit stomach juice, chicken stomach, bark beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and termites (Coptotermes formosanus). Morphological characteristics of bacterial isolates were studied and identified using matrix laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) method and genetic method. Based on the primary screening, the cellulolytic activity of the isolated bacteria was evaluated by reducing the mass of #10 100% cotton thread from 0.05 g to 0.035 g after 96 hours. Freshly obtained goat gastric juice was used as a control. The cellulolytic activity of the bacterial strains was determined by the application of Congo red to the agar medium. 1-Bacillus isolated from the termite (Coptotermes formosanus) when cellulolytic activity was carried out according to the modified method of Mendels and Weber. sp. and isolated from goat gastric juice 4- B. subtilis sp. the highest activity of 0.233 and 0.193 TslS/cm3 was determined in the strains. Also 1-Bacillus. sp. and 2-Bacillus. sp. bacterial strains produce up to 0.34 mg/ml of protein and the highest activity was isolated from goat gastric juice 3-B. subtilis sp. strain and was 0.38 mg/ml.

AB  - Alpine revegetated dunes have been barely researched in terms of morphological change and migration within its regional aeolian environments. To reveal the sand-fixing and land-reforming mechanisms of artificial vegetation, we observed the morphology and migration of four dunes with four revegetated types (Hippophae rhamnoides Linn., Salix cheilophila Schneid., Populus simonii Carr., and Artemisia desertorum Spreng.) using unpiloted aerial vehicle images and GPS (global positioning system) mapping in 2009 and 2018. Spatial analysis of GIS (geographic information system) revealed that the revegetated dunes exhibited a steady progression from barchan dune shapes to dome or ribbons shapes mainly through knap planation, wing amplification, and slope symmetrization. Generally, conditions of northern aspects, smaller slope degree, and larger altitude of unvegetated dunes would suffer more serious wind erosion. The southward movement of dune wings with a migration speed of 2.0-5.0 m/a and the alternating motion of sand ridges in eastwestern directions led greater stability in revegetated dunes. The moving distances of revegetated dunes remarkably changed in patterns of quadratic or linear function with depositional depth. Compared with unvegetated dunes, the near-surface wind velocity of revegetated dunes decreased by 20%-30%, which led to heavy accumulation in low-flat dunes and erosion in high-steep dunes, but all vegetation species produced obvious sand-fixing benefits (100%-450% and 3%-140% in the lower and higher dune scales of revegetated dunes, respectively) with decreasing sand transport rates and increasing coverages. In practice, the four vegetation species effectively anchored mobile dunes by adapting to regional aeolian environment. However, future revegetation efforts should consider optimizing dune morphology by utilizing H. rhamnoides as a pioneer plant, S. cheilophila and P. microphylla in windward and northward dune positions, and A. desertorum in a sand accumulative southward position. Also, we should adjust afforestation structure and replant some shrub or herbs in the higher revegetated dunes to prevent fixed dune activation and southward expansion.

AB  - In many places on earth, livestock and feed production are decoupled, as feed is grown in one region and fed to livestock in another. This disrupts nutrient cycles by depleting resources in feed producing regions and accumulating resources in livestock areas, which leads to environmental degradation. One solution is to recouple livestock and feed production at a more local level, which enhances nutrient circularity. Recoupling livestock and feed production creates a natural ceiling for livestock numbers based on the feed producing capacity of a region. In this study we assess the consequences of recoupling livestock and feed production (i.e., by avoiding the import and export of animal feed) on ammonia and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with and without feed-food competition. To this end, we used FOODSOM, an agro-ecological food system optimisation model representing the Dutch food system in this study. The Netherlands is one example of a region with high livestock densities and resource accumulation. We found that recoupling decreased livestock numbers (beef cattle: -100 %; dairy cattle: -29 %; broiler chickens: -57 %; laying hens: -67 %; pigs: -62 %; sheep -100 %) and animal-sourced food exports (-59 %) while still meeting the current human diet in the Netherlands. Consequently, ammonia emissions and GHG emissions decreased, and the nitrogen use efficiency increased from 31 % to 38 % at the food systems level. Recoupling alone was almost sufficient to meet national emission targets. Fully meeting these targets required further small changes in livestock numbers. Avoiding feed-food competition decreased livestock productivity and GHG emissions but did not improve nitrogen use efficiency. Total meat production could not meet domestic consumption levels while avoiding feed-food competition, and resulted in additional beef cattle. We show that recoupling livestock and feed production is a promising next step to enhance circularity while decreasing agricultures environmental impact.

Therefore, we herein explore the influence of soil quality and water availability on the germination performance through a garden experiment that mimics natural site conditions. One hundred seeds were extracted from fifty ripe strobili collected randomly from the ramets of a single female plant. Ten seeds per pot were sown in ten pots, which were equally split by receiving different watering treatments (watered versus control) and soil types (S0-shallow and stony; S1-like S0 but slightly deeper; S2-like S0 but even deeper and rich in woodland humus; S3-clay-layered alluvial; S4-anthropogenic). No significant interaction effect was detected between the two manipulated factors. Watering only had a marginal effect on the germination rate, but the latter was significantly higher in S2 when compared to the other soil types. These outcomes suggest that soil quality is more important than moisture for the germination success. Its rate is expected to be higher under the open canopy of woodlands compared to open rupicolous habitats, since seeds can benefit from higher humus availability and reduced evapotranspiration.

AB  - Symbiotic interactions between oxpeckers (Buphagus spp.) and African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) are influenced by both host characteristics and ectoparasite load. This study investigates how individual traits, such as body size, age and tick load, impact oxpecker foraging decisions. To investigate what impacts whether or not oxpeckers choose to forage on a buffalo, we used candidate generalised linear models. Our results show that oxpeckers preferentially select larger buffalo with higher-than-expected tick loads, particularly in the perianal region. These findings highlight the role of host size and parasite abundance in shaping oxpecker foraging behaviour within the savannah ecosystem.

AB  - The Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) is an ecologically and economically important marine fish species in the Northern Hemisphere. In the North Atlantic, the current spatial management units comprise four large offshore stocks and eight additional inshore stocks. However, the underlying biological basis for stock separation is uncertain. This may risk misrepresenting key population characteristics and reference points for sustainable management. To identify population structuring and boundaries for Greenland halibut, we here apply a spatial statistical approach using an extensive collection of scientific bottom trawl-surveys. Our analysis demonstrates two overall clusters separating the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic. Our findings are broadly consistent with recent studies on population structuring based on available tagging data and population genetics. However, it is still challenging to establish whether the results of clustering accurately reflect the true population boundaries, especially at a finer spatial scale. Therefore, we call for a broader synthesis of knowledge on population structuring of Greenland halibut utilizing all available sources of information to facilitate the designation of ecologically relevant management units and boundaries.

AB  - During aerial surveys, we opportunistically located clusters of polar bear (Ursus maritimus Phipps, 1774) earth dens on and near the Seal and Caribou Rivers in Northern Manitoba in 2011, 2022, and 2023. Polar bear denning has not been documented in the published literature there before, but there is local knowledge of denning in this area. These dens are of two different types (shallow dens and pits), with similar characteristics to those in theWestern Hudson Bay polar bear subpopulation's main denning area, 120km farther south. It is not possible to determine whether these findings represent a northward extension of denning by this subpopulation but changes in den distribution, particularly in such previously overlooked areas, need to be monitored and understood to effectively conserve polar bears in a warming climate.

AB  - Wild boar Sus scrofa populations have increased dramatically in recent decades throughout Europe. While hunting is widely used in management activities; it rarely has an important role in regulating and reducing wild boar populations. Therefore, increasing the efficiency of hunting is a compelling issue. In this study, we used a three-year dataset (2016-2018) on a wild boar population living in Campania (southern Italy) as a case study to explore how the hunting effort made in collective drive hunts affected the hunting rate, estimated as the number of individuals culled per day. We fitted a Linear Mixed Model, in which we included the number of wild boars culled per drive hunt as the dependent variable, and the number of beaters, shooters and dogs and the month during which hunting occurred as the predictors. A mean of 1.81 wild boars were culled per drive hunt. The number of culled animals per hunt increased with the increasing number of hunting dogs and with the progression of the hunting season (i.e., from October to December), whereas the number of beaters and shooters had no effect. Overall, we observed a low hunting rate. We suggest that adjusting the hunting calendar and reorganising wild boar collective hunts, e.g., through an appropriate management of the number and training of hunting dogs, are essential to increase the hunting rate. Our results can be useful for wildlife managers to enhance hunting contribution in counteracting the negative impact of wild boar.

AB  - Effective management of rare species requires an understanding of spatial variation in abundance, which is challenging to estimate. We tested the efficacy of high-resolution imagery to detect burrows of the Texas kangaroo rat (TKR; Dipodomys elator) as a means of estimating abundance across its geographic range. Specifically, we estimated burrow counts using an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) to collect data from very high-resolution Red-Green-Blue (RGB) imagery and estimate digital elevation (2.5-mm pixel resolution) over active and inactive burrows located on mesquite mounds and anthropogenic features (roadsides, fences, etc.). In 2018, we identified 26 burrow locations on a private ranch in Wichita County, Texas, USA, and characterized burrows based on topography and vegetation density. We found that TKR burrows can only be identified with data of <5 cm pixel resolution, thus eliminating the possibility of using high-resolution imagery data currently available for Texas. Alternatively, we propose that the use of National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery at 0.5- and 0.6-m pixel resolution, in combination with resampled digital elevation data, can provide an effective means for identifying potential TKR burrow locations at the county level. We present 3 different approaches at the county and local scale that combine topographic and vegetation fractional cover information using a weighted overlay approach. The modeling approaches have strong predictive capabilities and can be integrated with UAS data for visual confirmation of active and inactive burrows. We concluded that very high-resolution imagery and topographic information at pixel resolutions <5 cm collected by airborne systems can effectively help locate active TKR burrows. However, to remain cost effective, upscaling to the county level will require reducing the sampling area to the most suitable habitat. Modeling approaches, such as those proposed in this study, can help effectively locate these sampling areas.

AB  - The highland is the habitat of the camelids; the vicu na is the smallest wild camelid with a fine fiber. The Reserva Nacional Pampa Galeras - Barbara D'Achille (RNPG) in Peru has been home to vicunas since ancient times, where the vicunas coexist with domestic animals. The objective of this research was to analyze the effect that the presence of sheep population generates on the temporal stability of the vicuna population in the RNPG under the system dynamics approach. The methodology consisted of using a socio-ecological model that considers the main relationships of the ecosystem and four scenarios were proposed, the first considers variations in the variables associated with the sheep (food consumption by the sheep and time spent in the reserve) and three scenarios considering changes in precipitation (permanent rainfall of different intensity, rainfall with periodic maximum and minimum pulses and random rainfall) using Stella software. The main results indicate that the population of sheep does not directly influence of the vicuna population because the behavior of vicunas in all scenarios tends to self-regulate over time (10 years). The sheep population shows temporal permanence in the RNPG; and their presence is inversely associated with the rainy season, which suggests that the rural families access the reserve to marginally use the pastures during the dry season.

AB  - Heterogeneity in the intrinsic quality and nutritional condition of individuals affects reproductive success and consequently fitness. Black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) are long-lived, migratory, specialist herbivores. Long migratory pathways and short summer breeding seasons constrain the time and energy available for reproduction, thus magnifying life-history trade-offs. These constraints, combined with long lifespans and trade-offs between current and future reproductive value, provide a model system to examine the role of individual heterogeneity in driving life-history strategies and individual heterogeneity in fitness. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to examine reproductive trade-offs, modeling the relationships between within-year measures of reproductive energy allocation and among-year demographic rates of individual females breeding on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, using capture-recapture and reproductive data from 1988 to 2014. We generally found that annual survival tended to be buffered against variation in reproductive investment, while breeding probability varied considerably over the range of clutch size-laying date combinations. We provide evidence for relationships between breeding probability and clutch size, breeding probability and nest initiation date, and an interaction between clutch size and initiation date. Average lifetime clutch size also had a weak positive relationship with apparent survival probability. Our results support the use of demographic buffering strategies for black brant. These results also indirectly suggest associations among environmental conditions during growth, fitness, and energy allocation, highlighting the effects of early growth conditions on individual heterogeneity, and subsequently, lifetime reproductive investment.

AB  - The evidential value of an mtDNA match between biological remains and their potential donor is determined by the random match probability of the haplotype. This probability is based on the haplotype's population frequency estimate. Consequently, implementing a population study representative of the population relevant to a forensic case is vital to correctly evaluating the evidence. The emerging number of poaching cases and the limited availability of such data emphasizes the need for an improved fallow deer mtDNA population databank for forensic purposes, including targeting the entire mitochondrial control region. By sequencing a 945-base-pair-long segment of the mitochondrial control region in 138 animals from five populations in Hungary, we found four different haplotypes, including one which had not yet been described. Our results, supplemented with data already available from previous research, do not support the possibility of determining the population of origin, although some patterns of geographical separation can be distinguished. Estimates of molecular diversity indicate similarly low mtDNA diversity (Hd = 0.565 and pi = 0.002) compared to data from other countries. The calculated random match probability of 0.547 shows a high probability of coincidence and, therefore, a limited capacity for exclusion. Our results indicate that despite the overall low genetic diversity of mtDNA within the Hungarian fallow deer samples, a pattern of differentiation among the regions is present, which can have relevance from a forensic point of view.

AB  - Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) support an economically important fishery on the eastern coast of Canada. Like other species that are not well sampled by trawl surveys, halibut in this area are monitored using longline surveys. These surveys present challenges that can make obtaining indices of abundance difficult. Issues include gear saturation, which can result in a non-linear relationship between catch per unit effort and local abundance. The current approach to obtain a relative index consists of fitting a multinomial exponential model to a subset of hooks from each survey station. While this approach accounts for hook competition, it does not account for the presence of spatial patterns. We therefore extend the multinomial exponential model to include spatial random fields for both Atlantic halibut and non-target species, set-specific soak time, and data from the hooks. Furthermore, we propose a method for aggregating the resulting spatially varying indices to obtain an annual index for the entirety of the modelled area. This novel approach identifies Atlantic halibut hotspots in multiple years, while simultaneously providing relative abundance indices for 2017 through 2020. These outcomes demonstrate the widespread applicability of our methods for improving the scientific advice upon which fisheries management decisions are based.

AB  - Malayan tapir is the only extant Asian species in the family Tapiridae, which is endangered and threatened by the risk of inbreeding from population structure. To elucidate the demographic and evolutionary history of the tapirs in Southeast Asia (SEA), this study analyzed whole-genome data from 10 individuals for historical effective population size (Ne) inference using sequentially Markovian coalescent (i.e., PSMC, MSMC, MSMC2), folded site frequency spectrum (i.e., Stairway Plot 2), and their hybrid SMC++. The results revealed that tapir Ne ranged from 6000 to 12,000 in the last glacial period but decreased to <2000 in recent times. Genomic analysis and population split time analysis (PSMC and SMC++) supported a population divergence (Fst > 0.25) between the Sumatran and mainland SEA tapirs 10-6 kya. Subsidence of Sundaland and rainforest reduction were the major drivers for Ne decline. The timing of the population split corresponded well with the inundation of the Straits of Malacca to present-day levels by rapidly rising sea levels ~11 kya. The results of this study, as well as contemporary geographical isolation, support the subspecies status of the Sumatran population. This will have implications for the ex-situ conservation practices that may have produced hybrids of the isolated populations.

AB  - For centuries, indigenous sheep have been bred in extensive low-input systems in Midwestern Brazil. The hypothesis of this study was the assumption that phenotypic evaluation of indigenous livestock may drive the establishment of breed standards and official breed recognition, and, therefore, promote more local business opportunities. On the basis of more integrative and participatory theoretical background to applying any decision based on phenotype, we designed this research to determine the most typical and unusual phenotypes of Pantaneiro sheep. Pantaneiro ewes (281 ewes from five conservation units in five counties) were evaluated, bearing in mind both conservation and development. Descriptive statistics were used to classify ewes into typical, intermediate, and unusual phenotypes. Chi-squared tests for association were performed to test if morphological variation in the different sampling sites occurred randomly (p > 0.05) or not (p < 0.05). Some results suggest some sort of diversifying selection pressure, i.e., distinct preferences among keepers. We observed considerable morphologic variation among ewes, but it was straightforward to determine the predominant phenotypes. The study evokes integrative agrobiodiversity by putting phenotypical characterization of indigenous livestock into perspective. Discussions coming from this study may support innovative governance and participative decision-making, allied with strategies that value the socioeconomic, biocultural, and adaptive aspects of indigenous livestock in tropical regions and developing countries. This is a challenge for government, rare-breed keepers, value-chain actors, and civil society.

AB  - Although the European Roe Deer (Capreolus capreolus) is one of the most common and widespread ungulate species in Europe and inhabiting a variety of habitats, few studies have addressed its population structure at a large spatial scale using nuclear genetic data. The aims of our study were to: (i) investigate genetic diversity, level of admixture, and genetic structure across European Roe Deer populations; (ii) identify barriers to gene flow; and (iii) reveal factors that have impacted the observed pattern of population genetic structure. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we analyzed 920 European Roe Deer samples from 16 study sites from northern, southern, central, and eastern Europe. The highest genetic diversity was found in central and eastern sites, and lowest in the northern and southern sites. There were 2 main groups of genetically related populations in the study area-one inhabiting mainly Fennoscandia, and the second in the continental part of Europe. This second population was further divided into 3 to 5 spatially distributed genetic clusters. European Roe Deer belonging to the Siberian mitochondrial DNA clade, inhabiting large parts of eastern Europe, were not identified as a separate population in the analysis of microsatellite loci. No isolation by distance (IBD) was detected between roe deer from the fennoscandian and the continental study sites, but the Baltic Sea was inferred to be the main barrier to gene flow. Only weak IBD was revealed within the continental population. Three lower-level genetic barriers were detected in the western, southern, and eastern parts of the study area. The main factors inferred as shaping the observed genetic diversity and population structure of European Roe Deer were postglacial recolonization, admixture of different populations of the species originating from several Last Glacial Maximum refugial areas, and isolation of several study sites.
   According to our study the overall genetic diversity of European Roe Deer was relatively high. The greatest diversity was found in populations inhabiting central and eastern Europe, as a result of admixture of different postglacial migration waves from several Last Glacial Maximum refugia. Higher genetic diversity of roe deer in eastern Europe could be a result of introgression of Siberian Roe Deer genes as indicated by mitochondrial DNA analyses. This hybridization was an effect of both the natural range overlap of these species in the past and/or the translocations of the Siberian Roe Deer into the eastern part of the continent.

AB  - Aim: The soil water availability seriously limits the growth and development of tea plants, and soil microorganisms are an important medium to regulate soil nutrient cycling. In this study, the effects of water supply mode on soil nitrogen nutrition and soil microbes in tea gardens were investigated.
   Methodology: This experiment set up consisted two water supply modes (consecutive drought and dry-wet alternation) by using the soil microcosm incubation experiment, and four treatments were set: 20% water holding capacity for 21day (D21); 20% water holding capacity for 1-7 days and 60% water holding capacity for 82-1 days (D7W14); 20% water holding capacity for 1-14 day and 60% water holding capacity for 15-21 days (D14W7); 20% water holding capacity for 1-7 days, 60% water holding capacity for 8-14 days, 20% water holding capacity for 15-21 days (D7W7D7). Destructive sampling was carried out to determine soil NH4+-N, NO3--N, soil enzyme activities. 16S rRNA sequencing technique was used to determine the change in soil microbial diversity.
   Results: The results showed that the consecutive drought reduced the content of soil NH4+-N to 13.97 mg kg(-1), and the net nitrogen mineralization was negative (-2.75 mg kg(-1)) after 21 days of incubation. Dry-wet alternation promoted the increase in of soil net nitrogen mineralization quantity and net nitrification quantity, which rose to 3.48-26.41 mg kg(-1) and 8.07-23.11 mg kg(-1), respectively. Different water supply modes had no significant impact on the structure of dominant soil microbial community, and the effect mainly focused on relative abundance, especially dry-wet alternation mode. Compared with the continuous drought treatment, the relative abundance of Nitrospirae, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Patescibacteria, Latescibacteria, Rokubacteria, Acidobacteria were significantly different in different dry-wet alternation treatments, while the relative abundance of Nitrospirae, Acidobacteria, Latescibacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Patescibacteria and Chloroflexi also increased or decreased significantly among different dry-wet alternation treatments. Among the physical and chemical factors of tea garden soil, NO3- had the most significant effect on the structure of microbial community.
   Interpretation: Different water supply can significantly affect the transformation of soil nitrogen and the change in soil bacterial community in tea garden, which provided a theoretical basis for tea garden to cope with adverse weather changes and maintain the stability of tea garden soil ecosystem.

AB  - Aims and Methods: Brucellosis is worldwide one of the most prevalent zoonotic diseases with serious public health hazard affecting domestic livestock and causing economic losses. Objective of this study is to estimate the true prevalence of brucellosis in livestock, specifically cattle, sheep, goats and camels, using a novel Bayesian latent class model, adjusting for the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the applied tests, where the second test was restricted only to first test-positive samples.Results: Brucellosis seems more prevalent in goats and sheep, while the posterior medians and 95% probability intervals (95% PI) for the average true prevalence for sheep, goats, cattle and camels are 18% (4%-43%), 19% (7%-37%), 16% (5%-34%) and 18% (1%-48%) respectively.Conclusions: The study results indicate that brucellosis is highly endemic in Iran and crucial steps are needed to control and raise awareness about the high public health concern of the disease.

AB  - Organic fertilization is highly valuable in improving soil quality and functions, especially in nutrient-poor mine soils. Soil microbes are the major drivers of soil biogeochemical cycling and functions. The study aimed to explore the roles of different organic fertilization in regulating soil microbial community structure and functions in mine desert soils. In this study, a 90-day pot experiment was conducted under four typical fertilization managements: no fertilization (MK), biochar fertilizer (MS), peat (MC), and sheep manure (MY) with three application gradients (3%, 5%, and 7%). Our findings indicated that the application of organic fertilization significantly enhanced soil available nutrients, but did not affect microbial community diversity. In addition, organic fertilization significantly increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria and decreased the relative abundance of Actinobacteriota, Chloroflexi, and Firmicutes, indicating that the addition of organic fertilizer has altered the mine desert soil microbial community structure. Among all three organic fertilizations, peat works best in enhancing soil available nutrient and improving microbial community structure. The functional prediction suggests that organic fertilization altered the functional group structure of bacteria present in mine desert soils. Redundancy analysis showed that alkali-hydrolyzed N and available P were the crucial factors in determining microbial community structure. Overall, our findings indicate that the applications of organic fertilization can improve soil quality and microbial functions in nutrient-poor mine soils while maintaining the positive impacts of organic fertilization on soil microbial community structure.

AB  - Savanna systems are characterised by a community of large mammal herbivores with up to 30 species; coexistence is based on resource partitioning. In this paper we analyse the features of the landscape and plant structure which lead herbivores to use particular locations, a key to resource partitioning. The processes involved, top-down versus bottom-up, are well known for large species and small ones but not for medium-sized ones. We use two resident, medium-sized species, topi (Damaliscus lunatus jimela) and kongoni, (Alcelaphus buselaphus cokei) in the central woodlands of the Serengeti; selection of habitat by the residents is important for predator-prey interactions and for interactions among the grazers. Using Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Regression we develop highly predictive models which show that resource availability is the critical determinant of habitat selection in the dry season; and reduction in predation risk appears to be important in the wet season. These results show for the first time that habitat selection by the medium-sized herbivores is driven by different strategies in the two seasons. This contributes to understanding the processes involved in the dynamics of this globally important savanna system, a necessary foundation for management.

AB  - Straight-tusked elephants (genus: Palaeoloxodon) including their island dwarf forms are extinct enigmatic members of the Pleistocene megafauna and the most common Pleistocene elephants after the mammoths. Their taxonomic placement has been revised several times. Using palaeogenomic evidence, previous studies suggested that the European P. antiquus has a hybrid origin, but no molecular data have been retrieved from their Asian counterparts, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the global phylogeography and population dynamics of Palaeoloxodon. Here, we captured a high-quality complete mitogenome from a Pleistocene Elephantidae molar (CADG841) from Northern China, which was previously morphologically assigned to the genus Elephas (Asian elephant), and partial mitochondrial sequences (838 bp) of another Palaeoloxodon sp. specimen (CADG1074) from Northeastern China. We found that both Chinese specimens cluster with a 244 000-year-old P. antiquus (specimen name: WE) from Western Europe, suggesting that this clade may represent a population with a large spatial span across Eurasia. Based on the fossil record and the molecular dating of both the divergences of different Palaeoloxodon mitochondrial clades and previously determined hybridization events, we propose that this Eurasian-wide WE clade provides evidence for an earlier migration and/or another hybridization event that happened in the evolutionary history of straight-tusked elephants.

AB  - As an emerging contaminant, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have attracted growing attention, owing to their widespread dissemination and potential risk in the farming environment. However, ARG pollution from family livestock farms in the Yellow River basin, one of the main irrigation water sources in the North China Plain, remains unclear. Herein, we targeted 21 typical family farms to assess the occurrence patterns of ARGs in livestock waste and its influence on ARGs in receiving environment by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Results showed that common ARGs were highly prevalent in family livestock waste, and tet-ARGs and sul-ARGs were the most abundant in these family farms. Most ARG levels in fresh feces of different animals varied, as the trend of chicken farms (broilers > laying hens) > swine farms (piglets > fattening pigs > boars and sows) > cattle farms (dairy cattle > beef cattle). The effect of natural composting on removing ARGs for chicken manure was better than that for cattle manure, while lagoon storage was not effective in removing ARGs from family livestock wastewater. More troublesomely, considerable amounts of ARGs were discharged with manure application, further leading to the ARG increase in farmland soil (up to 58-119 times), which would exert adverse impacts on human health and ecological safety.

AB  - It has been suggested that the importance of network architecture to species diversity and stability should be based on preference networks (comprised of niche differentiations), rather than observational networks, because species abundance may significantly affect interaction frequencies. Considering that resource abundance is usually greater for herbivores than parasites, we hypothesize that the abundance effect is stronger for parasitic than herbivory interactions. To test this hypothesis, we collected 80 quantitative observational networks including 34 herbivorous and 46 parasitic networks from the published literature, and derived preference networks by removing the effects of species abundance. We then determined the network nestedness using both weighted NODF and spectral radius. We also determined species degree distribution, interaction evenness, weighted connectance and robustness for both observational and preference networks. The observational networks (including both herbivory and parasitic networks) were more nested judged by weighted NODF than spectral radius. Preference networks were less nested for parasitic than herbivory networks in terms of both weighted NODF and spectral radius, possibly because removing the abundance effect increased interaction evenness. These trends indicate that the abundance effect on network nestedness is stronger for parasitic than herbivory networks. Weighted connectance and robustness were greater in most preference networks than observational networks, indicating that preference networks may have high network stability and community persistence compared with observational ones. The data indicate that future network analyses should not only address the structural difference between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions, but also between herbivory and parasitic interactions.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries ensure food security and employment in Angolan coastal communities. These dynamic, widespread fisheries remain mostly unregulated, with limited data available despite their likely significant impact on marine megafauna. We used an interview-based survey to investigate local fisher interactions with elasmobranchs (sharks and rays) and gather information on utilization, trade and perceptions. All fishers (n = 83) landed elasmobranchs. Most fishers considered sharks as bycatch (74.7%, n = 62), while 100% targeted rays (Order Myliobatiformes), and 62.8% (n = 52) targeted guitarfishes (Order Rhinopristiformes). Over 80% of fishers reported declining catches and sizes of elasmobranchs over the last 30 years, raising concerns about the sustainability of these fisheries. Utilization and trade routes varied depending on elasmobranch products, with exports to China (fins) and local market sales (meat). Specifically, 8.4% (n = 5) of fishers confirmed meat and fin exports to China (4.8%, n = 3). The protection of sharks was considered by 32.5% (n = 30) of respondents, while 21.7% (n = 18) believed only certain shark species should be protected. Most respondents reported that rays (80.5%, n = 67) and guitarfishes (61%, n = 51) should not be protected. Regarding the ban on fishing, none considered it for ray species, with only 6.1% (n = 5) supporting this idea for guitarfishes. We highlight the lack of elasmobranch-specific conservation measures and the need for a multi-pronged approach to inform policy. Considering the scale of these fisheries, management actions need to be urgently developed and implemented to ensure the sustainability of elasmobranch fisheries while securing the livelihoods of coastal communities.

AB  - Several ungulate populations have become overabundant worldwide, resulting in ecological and social effects. Wildlife managers must establish effective population control programs to mitigate these negative influences. Hunting is a significant mortality factor for ungulates, which exhibit sensitive behavioral responses toward hunting activities. Wildlife managers need a comprehensive understanding of the ungulate responses to different hunting pressures across seasons. We developed a conceptual method to evaluate multiple behavioral responses to human hunting pressures and applied this to sika deer (Cervus nippon) in Hokkaido, Japan, during August and November in 2015. We measured flight behavior, spatial avoidance, and temporal activity shift during non-hunting and hunting seasons in 4 regions with different hunting pressures. Although we did not observe a clear difference in flight initiation distance among study areas or seasons, sika deer showed significant spatial avoidance during the hunting season in areas with high hunting pressure. Furthermore, sika deer were more active at night in areas with higher hunting pressures, regardless of the season. Collectively, these results suggest that sika deer responded to hunting pressure by changing diel activity to nocturnal throughout the year and avoiding risky areas (i.e., around hunting roads) during hunting season, rather than by increasing flight distance when they encounter humans. Our method can be used for a more efficient population control program for wildlife managers, as it considers the spatiotemporal variations of flexible ungulate behaviors in response to hunting pressures.

AB  - Habitat management is an important approach suppressing pest via conservation biological control in agricul-tural systems. Intercropping flowering plants is a well-practiced habitat management measure, supporting predators with shelter, nectar, alternative prey and pollen. However, few studies systematically revealed pred-ator's conservation performance, transfer process and biocontrol ability by intercropping flowering plants in apple orchards. Here, an experimental model of intercropping flowering plants in apple orchard was planned for two consecutive years to response above questions. Four flowering plants conserve a different number and proportions of six main predator species (three ladybeetles (Propylaea japonica, Harmonia axyridis and Hippo-damia variegata), one lacewing (Chrysoperla sinica), one hoverfly (Episyrphus balteatus) and one spider (Mis-umenops tricuspidatus)). By rubidium (Rb) marking technique, transfer rate of predators C. sinica from flowering plant Cnidium monnieri to apple trees were 79.5 % and 84.1 % in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Transfer rate of predators H. axyridis from flowering plant C. monnieri to apple trees were 74.2 % and 80.1 % in 2020 and 2021, respectively. By predator exclusion trials, the Biocontrol Services Index (BSI) was calculated in sampling date, in which the number of aphids on the caged and uncaged branch has significant difference in the four flowering plants and untreated control plots in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that, intercropping flowering plants in insecticide-free apple orchard contributed to increase the number of predators and biological control of aphid Aphis spiraecola. These findings support that intercropping flowering plants as a promising management option could be implemented in apple orchards.

AB  - Understanding population demographics of Macrochelys temminckii (Alligator Snapping Turtle) requires long-term studies. Most previous studies do not provide demographic population data. We conducted a mark-recapture study of M. temminckii inhabiting Buffalo Bayou in Harris County, TX, from October 2016 through August 2021. We captured 110 unique individuals during 465 trap nights and recorded 45 recaptures. We generated 8 biological metrics. Capture per unit effort varied from 0.267 to 0.547 turtles per trap-night, the population estimate was 173 turtles (95% CI: 138-250), the sex ratio was 1.00 M:1.28 F, and density and biomass estimates were 4.43 turtles/river km and 89.9 kg/ km, respectively. Given that anthropogenic risks to this urban population may increase, continued monitoring and research is warranted.

AB  - The development of ecotourism involving wild animals in Russia is overlooked despite the fact that the country's territory is significant not only in terms of area but also in terms of the diversity of its flora and fauna. A significant part of Russia's territory has a low population density, especially beyond the Ural ridge. It retains its natural primeval nature, which can contribute to the development of ecotourism. Initial attempts have been made to develop this, mainly in the European part (Tatarstan, Murmansk Region, the Baltic Sea, Baikal, Altai), but the commercial use of wild animals within ecotourism programs, including the ones in Siberia and the Far East, has not been discussed. This work focuses on the basics of launching ecotourism in the industrial region of Siberia (Kuzbass, Russia) as part of the Alces alces conservation program.

AB  - When feeding on a plant, herbivorous insects alter the quality of the plant as a food source. This affects other organisms interacting with the same plant. These so-called 'plant-mediated interactions' can be altered by parasitoids that attack the herbivores. So far, this research area has mainly focussed on interactions at the leaf level, and very little is known about plant-mediated interactions via seeds. It is still poorly understood if seeds that survive insect damage have fewer resources to allocate to plant growth and defence against leaf herbivores, and whether parasitoids that kill seed-feeding insects mitigate such negative effects. Using seeds of wild lima bean plants Phaseolus lunatus, we studied the effect of the intensity of infestation by seed beetles Zabrotes subfasciatus and their parasitoids Stenocorse bruchivora on the following parameters under lab conditions: seed mass and germination, plant growth and defensive compounds (cyanogenic glycosides and flavonoids) and performance of a leaf herbivore species Spodoptera latifascia. In addition, we performed a field experiment using seeds with or without insect damage to investigate the consequences on plant performance and fitness in the wild. Seed beetle infestation had an overall negative impact on seed germination. Lab experiments revealed that damaged seeds produced plants with slower growth and reduced concentration of defensive compounds, which increased the performance of the leaf herbivores. Effects of seed-feeding on seed germination and plant growth were attenuated by parasitism, resulting in a net increase of the number of viable offspring. In the field, we observed that seed damage impaired germination, delayed flowering time and increased leaf herbivory. Our results show that plant-mediated interactions between insect herbivores are not limited to leaf herbivores, but extend to seed herbivores. In our study system, parasitoids had no apparent effect on these interactions, despite their strong beneficial effects on germination and plant performance. These findings confirm the long-lasting consequences of indirect plant-mediated interactions in a community-wide ecological context. Furthermore, they contribute to a better understanding of the important but understudied effects of parasitoids on plant fitness.

AB  - Lower plant resistance to herbivores following domestication has been suggested as the main cause for higher feeding damage in crops than in wild progenitors. While herbivore compensatory feeding has also been proposed as a possible mechanism for raised damage in crops with low nutritional quality, predictions regarding the effects of plant domestication on nutritional quality for herbivores remain unclear. In particular, data on primary metabolites, even major macronutrients, measured in the organs consumed by herbivores, are scarce. In this study, we used a collection of 10 accessions of wild ancestors and 10 accessions of modern progenies of Triticum turgidum to examine whether feeding damage and selectivity by nymphs of Locusta migratoria primarily depended on five leaf traits related to structural resistance or nutrient profiles. Our results unexpectedly showed that locusts favored wild ancestors over domesticated accessions and that leaf toughness and nitrogen and soluble protein contents increased with the domestication process. Furthermore, the quantitative relationship between soluble protein and digestible carbohydrates was found to poorly meet the specific requirements of the herbivore, in all wheat accessions, both wild and modern. The increase in leaf structural resistance to herbivores in domesticated tetraploid wheat accessions suggested that resource allocation trade-offs between growth and herbivory resistance may have been disrupted by domestication in the vegetative organs of this species. Since domestication did not result in a loss of nutritional quality in the leaves of the tetraploid wheat, our results rather provides evidence for a role of the content of plants in nonnutritive nitrogenous secondary compounds, possibly deterrent or toxic, at least for grasshopper herbivores.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion-based disease that poses an imminent threat to New York State (NYS), but many NYS hunters do not perceive it as a salient issue or follow recommended practices to prevent its spread to NYS. This study sought to identify the social-psychological factors underlying the efficacy of social media interventions to increase risk perceptions of CWD in NYS. We conducted an online survey experiment with 2760 NYS hunters and found that perceived similarity of an information source on social media and hunters' biospheric values and descriptive norms increased risk perceptions of the threat of CWD to deer and deer hunting in NYS. We also found that biospheric values and knowledge increased risk perceptions of behaviors contributing to the spread of CWD to NYS. We encourage regulators to collaborate with opinion leaders in the hunting community to disseminate CWD prevention messages on social media to maximize message efficacy.

AB  - Sensors, such as accelerometers, in tracking devices allow for detailed bio-logging to understand animal behaviour, even in remote places where direct observation is difficult. To study breeding in birds remotely, one needs to understand how to recognise a breeding event from tracking data, and ideally validate this by direct observation. We tagged 49 adult female pink-footed geese (Anser brachyrhynchus) with transmitter neckbands in Finland in spring of 2018 and 2019, and in Svalbard in summer 2018, and validated inferences from tracking by field observations of nesting sites and family status in 2018-2020 (54 spring-summer tracks). We estimated nesting locations by taking the median coordinates of GPS-fixes at which the goose was motionless (overall dynamic body acceleration, ODBA < 1) on days with a daily median ODBA < 1, which approached the real nesting locations closely (within 1.6-3.7 m, n = 6). The start of nesting was defined as the first day on which the goose spent > 75% of time within 50 m of the nest, because nest site attendances steeply increased within one day to above this threshold. Nesting duration (number of consecutive days with > 75% nest site attendance) ranged between 3 and 44 days (n = 28), but was 30-34 days in confirmed successful nests (n = 9). The prolonged nesting of 39-44 days (n = 3) suggested incubation on unhatchable egg(s). Nest losses before hatching time occurred mostly in day 3-10 and 23-29 of nesting, periods with an increased frequency of nest site recesses. As alternative method, allowing for non-simultaneous GPS and accelerometer data, we show that nesting days were classified with 98.6% success by two general characteristics of breeding: low body motion (daily median ODBA) and low geographic mobility (daily SD of latitude). Median coordinates on nesting days approached real nest sites closely (within 0.8-3.6 m, n = 6). When considering only geographic mobility (allowing for GPS data only) nesting locations were similarly accurate, but some short nesting attempts were undetected and non-breeding tracks misclassified. We show that nesting attempts, as short as 3 days, and nesting success can be detected remotely with good precision using GPS-tracking and accelerometry. Our method may be generalised to other (precocial) bird species with similar incubation behaviour.

AB  - The aim of the paper is to evaluate the significance of linear strips of woody vegetation (biocorridors) in the agricultural landscape for the populations of mammals. Data on their occurrence were obtained using camera traps that were installed in 14 biocorridors in selected locations in South Moravia (Czech Republic). Data collection took place from October 2020 to June 2022. A total of 40 camera traps were used, which captured over 49,000 images of 16 species. The largest percentage was represented by roe deer (57%), followed by European hare (14%) and fallow deer (11%). Of the 16 species mentioned, 10 were found mainly at night. With the onset of winter (December-February), the nocturnal occurrence of the species in the biocorridors gradually decreased and increased in the morning hours. The phase of the day, the season, the character of the vegetation, the size and shading of the biocorridor had a significant influence on the spatiotemporal occurrence of mammals. Biocorridors proved to be an important landscape element especially in terms of the occurrence of smaller predators and common habitat generalists such as roe deer and hare. Both species used biocorridors very intensively, so can significantly support the survival of their populations in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - The reforestation and stable ecological restoration of tailings dumps resulting from surface mining activities in the Calimani Mountains represent an ongoing environmental challenge. To assess the suitability of different tree species for restoration efforts, photosynthetic traits were monitored in four broadleaf pioneer species-green alder (Alnus alnobetula (Ehrh.) K. Koch), aspen (Populus tremula L.), silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.), and goat willow (Salix caprea L.)-that naturally colonized the tailings dumps. Green alder and birch had the highest photosynthetic rate, followed by aspen and goat willow. Water use efficiency parameters (WUE and iWUE) were the highest for green alder and the lowest for birch, with intermediary values for aspen and goat willow. Green alder also exhibited the highest carboxylation efficiency, followed by birch. During the growing season, net assimilation and carboxylation efficiency exhibited a maximum in late July and a minimum in late June. The key limitation parameters of the photosynthetic process derived from the FvCB model (V-cmax and J(max)) were the highest for green alder and exhibited a maximum in late July, regardless of the species. Based on photosynthetic traits, the green alder-a woody N-2-fixing shrub-is the most well-adapted and photosynthetically efficient species that naturally colonized the tailings dumps in the Calimani Mountains.

AB  - Understanding regional dietary differences in wildlife has traditionally focused on regional-scale comparisons. However, integrating individual- and intra-individual-scale analyses offers a more nuanced approach. In this study, we conducted a multiscale dietary analysis using stable isotope analysis to investigate spatial dietary patterns in brown bears (Ursus arctos) across mainland Hokkaido, Japan, with a particular focus on the Shibecha region in eastern Hokkaido, where significant livestock depredation has recently occurred. We measured isotope ratios in bone collagen from bears harvested in mainland Hokkaido, compared regional-scale diets through a mixing model, and assessed individual-scale isotopic variations using geostatistical models. Additionally, we conducted a retrospective isotope analysis of a single bear (OSO18) responsible for large-scale livestock damage in the Shibecha region, using samples of its humerus and body hair. Our results revealed that brown bears in the Shibecha region rely more heavily on sika deer (Cervus nippon) than do bears elsewhere in mainland Hokkaido. A subsequent individual-scale analysis indicated that elevated delta 15N values in the bears harvested from the Shibecha region were not strongly correlated with local deer density. Intra-individual analysis of OSO18 showed reliance on sika deer year-round, supplemented seasonally by anthropogenic dietary components such as dairy cattle and dent corn. Although the data were insufficient to provide a direct link between a highly carnivorous diet and the large-scale livestock predation by OSO18, it is possible that the increase in carnivorous bears in the Shibecha region represented a dietary shift caused by anthropogenic factors, such as mismanagement of sika deer carcasses left after harvest. Thus, investigations into how carnivory among brown bears may be affecting human-bear conflicts and what factors cause the high dependence of brown bears on sika deer are needed. This study demonstrates the utility of multiscale isotope analysis in elucidating regional dietary patterns and informing solutions to issues related to local wildlife management strategies.

AB  - The combination of typhoon-induced storm surges and astronomical tides can result in extreme seawater levels and disastrous effects on coastal socioeconomic systems. The construction of an appropriate wind field has consistently been a challenge in storm tide forecasting and disaster warning. In this study, we optimized a nonlinear regression formula based on the C15 model to determine the maximum wind radius. The simulation based on the improvement showed good accuracy for storm tides during super typhoon Mangkhut (WP262018), Saola (WP092023), and severe typhoon Hato (WP152017). The correlation coefficients were in the 0.94-0.98 range, and the peak bias was less than 5cm. The trough errors were significantly reduced compared to other wind fields. Owing to the importance and lack of the maximum wind radius (Rmax ), we attempted to predict Rmax using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for forecasting storm tides during strong typhoons. Constrained LSTM showed good performance in hours 6-48, and effectively enhanced the forecasting capability of storm tides during strong typhoons. The workflows and methods used herein have broad applications in improving the forecasting accuracy of strong typhoon-induced storm tides.

AB  - Heatwaves are now pervasive stressors to marine ecosystems, and it is urgent to consider mitigation tools that support ecosystem resilience and persistence in the immediate future. We modeled a system of kelp, herbivorous urchin, and predatory fish to compare how potential management actions (kelp seeding, urchin removal, and fishery closures) could reduce the likelihood of a heatwave shifting a kelp forest into a degraded urchin barren state. We found that those interventions were most effective when begun alongside or before the start of a heatwave. Closing the predatory fish fishery was more effective when done earlier and for longer, while urchin removal and kelp seeding were more effective when begun alongside and continued throughout the heatwave. Kelp seeding was notably less effective than other interventions. Our results suggest the need for improved heatwave forecasting and nimble management protocols to enact mitigation actions quickly if a heatwave is forecasted or occurs.

AB  - Generalist insectivorous birds can provide ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes by consuming arthropod pests, or they can provide disservices when they consume beneficial arthropods. To examine bird impacts on arthropod communities, including pest control services, we need to know which arthropods birds commonly consume. Faecal metabarcoding is an emerging technique that can be used to identify prey from faecal samples, often to the species level. We used faecal metabarcoding to study diets of birds inhabiting the ecotone between soybean fields and adjacent grasslands in a largely agricultural landscape in Illinois, USA, during the summer of 2017. Whereas previous studies have used faecal metabarcoding to compare bird diets among species or among capture sites, we analysed samples from multiple species within a community at replicate sites. We collected and sequenced DNA from 132 faecal samples from 25 bird species captured at six sites. We found that birds consumed an extremely large and varied diet that differed among both species and sites, suggesting that birds were consuming prey opportunistically as available at each site. Of the nine most commonly detected prey species, three are known pests of soybeans. Bird diets also contained significantly more species of herbivorous prey than natural enemies. Finally, we discovered that American Goldfinches Spinus tristis, a highly granivorous species, may consume arthropods more frequently than expected and thus may provide ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Our study demonstrates that birds within this system consume a large variety of prey, suggesting that they may be able to respond quickly to pest outbreaks and contribute to agricultural resiliency.

AB  - Here we assessed the subsurface ultraphytoplanktonic (< 10 mu m) community along a North-South round-trip Mediterranean transect as part of a MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE cruise campaign in April-May 2019. Temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations in subsurface waters (2-5 m depth) were also measured along the transect. The subsurface ultraphytoplankton community structure was resolved with a spatial resolution of few kilometers and temporal resolution of 30-min intervals using automated pulse shape recording flow cytometry. The subsurface waters were clustered into seven areas based on temperature and salinity characteristics. Synechococcus were by far the most abundant group in all prospected zones, and nanoeukaryotes were the main biomass component, representing up to 51 % of ultraphytoplanktonic carbon biomass. Apparent net primary productivity (NPP) followed a decreasing gradient along the transect from north to south and was mostly sustained by Synechococcus in all zones. These findings are likely to have implications in terms of the trophic transfer of contaminants in planktonic food webs, as they highlight the potential role of nanoplankton in contaminants bioaccumulation processes and the potential role of Synechococcus in a likely transfer via grazing activities.

AB  - Indirect ecological interactions such as competition for resources between fisheries and marine predators have often been proposed but can be difficult to demonstrate empirically. The Kerguelen Plateau in the Southern Indian Ocean supports fisheries for both Patagonian toothfish and mackerel icefish and is also an important foraging ground for several avian and mammalian predators, including the southern elephant seal. We quantified the spatio-temporal use of the plateau by southern elephant seals and found that males and females spent 30% of their time on the plateau within the commonly used fishing grounds, indicating the possibility of competition for resources there. We then contrasted the seals' use of two habitat types, the benthos (where interactions with the long-line fisheries are most likely) and the epi-pelagic zone. The likelihood of feeding on the benthos declined as ocean depth increased and was also less likely at night. Males were also more likely to feed on the benthos than females. The sub-adult male seals consumed an estimated 6,814 - 14,848 tons of high energy content prey (including toothfish) and females 7,085 - 18,037 tons from the plateau during the post-molt winter months. For males this represented 79.6 - 173.4% of the mean annual catch by the Kerguelen fishery compared to 82.8 - 210.7% for adult females. When considering the seals consumption of fish from the benthos within the fishing grounds these estimates decreased to 3.6 - 15.1% of the fishery's total annual catch for females and 7.8 - 19.1% for males. While this further indicates the possibility of indirect ecological interactions (with the fishery taking more fish than the seals), the lack of detailed diet information for the seals precludes us from establishing the degree or nature of the possible interactions because the importance of toothfish and icefish in the diet of the seals is unknown. However, the unique life history and highly polygynous nature of this species, and the lack of evidence of a measurable effect on either the seal's population growth rates or the catch per unit of the fishery, suggest that any indirect ecological interactions are not of sufficient magnitude to affect either the seal population or the fishery.

AB  - Drought is an important stressor that affects plant growth, survival and physiology and, through plant responses, alters plant-herbivore interactions and herbivore population dynamics. Short-term drought can occur at different times during a growing season, affecting herbivore populations and plants at various stages of development and growth. As phenology influences drought response, drought timing could strongly structure plant-herbivore interactions. We grew common milkweed plants with or without its dominant aphid herbivore, allowing both plants and herbivore populations to develop over time as in a typical growing season. To determine how drought timing affects plants and aphid populations, we applied short-term (1 week) drought at different times. Plants and aphids were sensitive to drought timing, with a few weeks difference shifting the effects of drought from minimal to causing massive declines in plant growth, plant survival and herbivore population density. Aphid herbivory added to or overrode drought consequences in plants, with different plant fitness components responding distinctly to herbivory. Drought timing also affected whether plant and herbivore responses were parallel or divergent, suggesting that shifts in the seasonal timing of drought have the potential to disrupt plant-herbivore interactions and affect the larger ecological community. Our results show drought timing has important and disparate consequences for herbivores and their host plants and indicates the necessity of considering phenology and timing in assessing drought response.

AB  - Herbivory and nutrient availability are fundamental drivers of benthic community succession in shallow marine systems, including coral reefs. Despite the importance of early community succession for coral recruitment and recovery, studies characterizing the impact of top-down and bottom-up drivers on micro- and macrobenthic communities at scales relevant to coral recruitment are lacking. Here, a combination of tank and field experiments were used to assess the effects of herbivore exclusion and nutrient enrichment on micro- to macrobenthic community succession and subsequent coral recruitment success. Herbivore exclusion had the strongest effect on micro- and macrobenthic community succession, including a community shift toward copiotrophic and potentially opportunistic/pathogenic microorganisms, an increased cover of turf and macroalgae, and decreased cover of crustose coralline algae. Yet, when corals settled prior to the development of a macrobenthic community, rates of post-settlement survival increased when herbivores were excluded, benefiting from the predation refugia provided by cages during their vulnerable early post-settlement stage. Interestingly, survival on open tiles was negatively correlated with the relative abundance of the bacterial order Rhodobacterales, an opportunistic microbial group previously associated with stressed and diseased corals. Development of micro- and macrobenthic communities in the absence of herbivory, however, led to reduced coral settlement. In turn, there were no differences in post-settlement survival between open and caged treatments for corals settled on tiles with established benthic communities. As a result, open tiles experienced marginally higher recruitment rates, driven primarily by the higher initial number of settlers on open tiles compared to caged tiles. Overall, we reveal that the primary interaction driving coral recruitment is the positive effect of herbivory in creating crustose coralline algae (CCA)-dominated habitats, free of fleshy algae and associated opportunistic microbes, to enhance coral settlement. The negative direct and indirect impact of fish predation on newly settled corals was outweighed by the positive effect of herbivory on the initial rate of coral settlement. In turn, the addition of nutrients further altered benthic community succession in the absence of herbivory, reducing coral post-settlement survival. However, the overall impact of nutrients on coral recruitment dynamics was minor relative to herbivory.

AB  - Drought may impact plant-soil biotic interactions in ways that modify aboveground herbivore performance, but the outcomes of such biotic interactions under future climate are not yet clear. We performed a growth chamber experiment to assess how long-term, drought-driven changes in belowground communities influence plant growth and herbivore performance using a plant-soil feedback experimental framework. We focussed on two common pasture legumes-lucerne, Medicago sativa L., and white clover, Trifolium repens L. (both Fabaceae)-and foliar herbivores-cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (H & uuml;bner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), and two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae). Soil was collected from a field facility where rainfall had been manipulated for 6 years, focussing on treatments representing ambient rainfall and prolonged drought (50% reduction relative to ambient), to consider the effects of biological legacies mediated by the prolonged drought. All soils were sterilized and re-inoculated to establish the respective home (i.e. where a given plant is cultivated in its own soil) and away (i.e. where a given plant is cultivated in another species' soil) treatments in addition to a sterile control. We found that the relative growth rate (RGR) and relative consumption of larvae were significantly lower on lucerne grown in soil with ambient rainfall legacies conditioned by white clover. Conversely, the RGR of insect larvae was lower on white clover grown in soil with prolonged drought legacies conditioned by lucerne. Two-spotted spider mite populations and area damage (mm2) were significantly reduced on white clover grown in lucerne-conditioned soil in drought legacies. The higher number of nodules found on white clover in lucerne-conditioned soil suggests that root-rhizobia associations may have reduced foliar herbivore performance. Our study provides evidence that foliar herbivores are affected by plant-soil biotic interactions and that prolonged drought may influence aboveground-belowground linkages with potential broader ecosystem impacts.

AB  - Interactions among species are essential in shaping ecological communities, although it is not always clear under what conditions they can persist when the number of species involved is higher than two. Here we describe a three-species assemblage involving the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa, the pen shell Pinna nobilis and the herbivore sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, and we explore the mechanisms allowing its persistence through field observations and manipulative experiments. The abundance of pen shells was higher in seagrass beds than in bare sand, suggesting a recruitment facilitation. The presence of sea urchins, almost exclusively attached or around pen shells, indicated habitat facilitation for sea urchins, which overgrazed the meadow around the pen shells forming seagrass-free halos. Our results suggest that this system persists thanks to: (i) the behavioral reluctance of sea urchins to move far from pen shells, making their impact on seagrass strictly local, (ii) the sparse distribution of pen shells and (iii) the plant's resistance mechanisms to herbivory. Unpacking these mechanisms allows a better understanding of how ecological communities are assembled.

AB  - Almost all Indochinese ungulates are classified as globally threatened but efforts to assess and monitor population status have been hampered by their rarity, cryptic nature, and uncertainty in accurate identification from sightings. An improved approach is urgently needed to gather information about threatened ungulate species in order to effectively conserve them as a lack of reliable monitoring methods means that basic information such as population sizes, distribution and habitat associations is currently unknown. Here, we used a combination of camera trapping and genetic detection of the endangered Eld's deer, Rucervus eldii, to investigate the utility of these methods to infer intensity of site use within a protected Cambodian dry forest. We asked: 1) Are Eld's deer present in our study area?; 2) How is site use influenced by local habitat?; and 3) Do camera traps or genetic detection perform better in terms of detection and monitoring? Camera traps were deployed and faecal samples collected from Chhaeb Wildlife Sanctuary in northern Cambodia during the 2017 dry season. Faecal samples were identified as Eld's deer using newly developed species-specific mitochondrial DNA primers. Camera traps recorded 20 Eld's deer observations across 3,905 trap-nights and 44 out of 71 collected faecal samples, identified by fieldworkers as likely to belong to Eld's deer, were positively identified to be so. Camera trap surveys and genetic detection demonstrated that Eld's deer were present in Chhaeb Wildlife Sanctuary, although the number of detections relative to sampling effort was low in both methods (detected at 29% and 1% of sample sites, respectively). Occupancy models showed that water level and tree diameter both had positive relationships, whilst human and domestic or feral pig activity had a negative relationship, with the relative intensity of Eld's deer site use. Overall, our data suggest that both of our methods can prove effective for monitoring Eld's deer but that repeated sampling is necessary to account for their low detectability in this area. We suggest that faecal samples are collected during future camera trap monitoring visits to maximise efficiency, increase detectability, and provide the most information to support conservation.

AB  - The poultry industry is a major source of odor pollution and has received significant attention because of its impact on air quality and human health. Acid scrubbing has been widely used in livestock houses to remove ammonia (NH3), but this method has not been optimized for other odorous compounds, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In this study, on-farm acid scrubbing equipment was operated in an experimental closed broiler house to determine the removal efficiency of gaseous pollution. The equipment was applied to the broiler exhaust system. The pH value and the gas residence time (gRT) were evaluated using central composite design and response surface methodology to establish a quadratic regression NH3 removal model and to reduce emissions of VOCs and greenhouse gases under field conditions. The results showed that at gRT of 1.7 s and pH of 4.0 were the optimal process parameters. Under optimal treatment conditions, the NH3 removal efficiency reached a maximum of 83.4%. Oxygenated VOC (OVOC) removal efficiency affected the removal of other components, such as hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and sulfides by dissolving into the organic aqueous solution. The results indicate that OVOCs might be the key factors influencing the removal of total VOCs. The removal efficiencies of acetaldehyde, dimethyl disulfide, methyl mercaptan, methyl sulfide, acetone, ethane, propane, and CO2 under the optimal process were 90.6%, 69.5%, 81.7%, 100%, 97.5%, 84.3%, 70.6%, and 54.7%, respectively. The methane removal efficiency was undetermined because of the undetectable inlet concentration. This method can provide a basis for the application of acid scrubber equipment and technical support for collaborative treatment of gaseous pollutants in livestock houses.

AB  - Knowledge of fine-scale seasonal and diel activity patterns of animals provides insights into habitat utilization dynamics and informs conservation action planning against potential human impacts. Such information is particularly important for riverine cetaceans, such as the Yangtze finless porpoise, which is threatened by habitat loss and disturbances by a variety of human activities. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) techniques were used to survey the seasonal and diel activities of the Yangtze finless porpoise in two natural habitat patches of the Anqing Yangtze Finless Porpoise Natural Reserve, and in one highly disturbed area adjacent to the reserve. In the two natural habitat patches, significantly higher detection rates of porpoises were observed during autumn and winter. The detection rates during autumn and winter were significantly higher at night than during daytime, whereas during spring and summer the diel difference in porpoise detection rates was not statistically significant. In the highly disturbed habitat, the porpoise detection rates were significantly lower than those in the two natural habitats. Although seasonal differences in porpoise detection rates were not statistically significant, diel detection rates were significantly different in autumn and winter. Information on seasonal patterns of porpoise activities suggested strengthening monitoring and law enforcement during autumn and winter, during the period in which diel activity patterns implied a potential conservation gap during nighttime. Extremely low levels of porpoise activities in port areas implied an ecological impact of coastal engineering on megafauna viability through the alteration of habitat functionality. To provide information on animal occurrences and activities and to minimize the bias of 'false-absence' from visual surveys, the census survey design should consider both visual and PAM techniques. In seasons when occurrences of river cetaceans and habitat use are increasing, heightened conservation monitoring and law enforcement efforts are required, particularly during nighttime.

AB  - Simple Summary The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging multi-host pathogen whose main reservoir is suids, and the leading cause of acute viral hepatitis in humans. This study evaluates the main long-term drivers of the exposure to HEV are in the wild boar population from Donana National Park (southwestern Spain) during a 13-year period (2005-2018). For this purpose, we assay sera from 700 wild boar in which anti-HEV antibodies are widely distributed (46.7 +/- 3.8%, 327 out of 700 sampled). The observed marked interannual fluctuations could be explained by the variations in the population control of the wild boar during the study period and its impact on abundance rates. Several factors operating in the medium and long-term (individual, environmental, populational and stochastic) and their interplay explained the exposure to HEV in wild boar. The preferential use of certain areas by wild boar together with its abundance and the meteorological conditions may be behind the level of exposure. Wild boar population control remains a challenge at the international level, and an increase of shared pathogen-related conflicts associated with this species is expected, as exemplified by HEV. The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen whose main reservoir is suids. Most of the ecological and epidemiological aspects of its sylvatic cycle remain unknown. Thus, in this work, we study the drivers of HEV exposure in the wild boar population of Donana National Park (DNP, southwest Spain) operating in the medium and long-term (2005-2018). Anti-HEV antibodies are widely distributed throughout the wild boar (46.7 +/- 3.8%, 327 out of 700 sampled), showing a statistically significant age-increasing pattern. The temporal pattern displayed important interannual fluctuations. This could be mediated by marked variations in the population control of the wild boar, and subsequent changes in abundance rates, and its interplay with climatic conditions; as wet years together with a low abundance of wild boar led to the lowest seroprevalence. The fact that seroprevalence is high during conditions of high abundance, and not affected by rainfall level, is probably due to the increased interactions among the animals, and possibly, the subsequent higher environmental contamination with HEV particles. The proximity to the marshland (the main water body of the study area) is associated with a higher risk of testing positive, which is probably mediated by the preferential use of this area during the dry season and the favourable environmental conditions for the survival of HEV particles. A deeper understanding of the epidemiology of HEV in host communities deserves future research concerning other susceptible species. Most importantly, wild boar population control remains a challenge at the international level, and an increase of shared pathogen-related conflicts associated with this species is expected, as exemplified by HEV. Therefore, surveillance of wild boar diseases, including integrated population monitoring and sustainable population control programmes, will be essential to control the associated risks.

AB  - Arboreal ants are ecologically important in tropical forests, but there are few studies using DNA markers to examine their population and colony structure. Colonies of the arboreal turtle ant Cephalotes goniodontus create trail networks through the canopy of the tropical forest, in dense vegetation where it is difficult to determine how long a nest is used and how neighboring colonies partition space. We monitored 53 nest sites for up to six years and, using seven microsatellite markers, genotyped samples of workers collected at or near 41 nests over 1-4 years. We calculated average relatedness within samples collected at a given location, and between samples collected at the same location in successive years, and performed pedigree analysis to predict the number of queens that produced each sample of workers. Fifteen samples were highly related (r >= 0.6) from single colonies, of which 11 were monogynous and the remaining four had two queens; 19 were of intermediate relatedness (0.1 <= r < 0.6) with 1-6 queens, and 7 were groups of unrelated workers (r < 0.1) from at least 4 queens. Colonies persisted at the same nest site for 2-6 years. The smallest distance we found separating nests of different colonies was 16.2 m. It appears that different colonies may share foraging trails. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using a cost-efficient genotyping method to provide information on colony structure and life history of ant species.

AB  - Knowledge of the quantity of twig dry mass (available fodder) of saplings is crucial for understanding tree recruitment under wild ungulate browsing pressure in forest ecosystems. Therefore, this study aimed to develop allometric equations for estimating twig dry mass using sapling structural data and to model the twig dry mass of saplings of various species in various size classes while quantitatively describing the variations among tree species. Sapling biomass samples were taken for six widely spread tree species in two national parks in Poland. After drying the biomass samples in the oven for 72 h at 65 degrees C, the data were analyzed, and models were generated using the ordinary least squares and generalized additive methods. The results confirmed our hypothesis that different tree species differ in their allometric properties. The twig dry masses of Acer pseudoplatanus and Carpinus betulus were best estimated by basal diameter, whereas those of Picea abies, Abies alba, and Fagus sylvatica were best estimated by sapling height. In contrast, the model quality for Fagus sylvatica and Sorbus aucuparia was enhanced by combining the sapling height with the mean largest crown length (MLCL). For all species, the twig dry mass distribution was linear along sapling height classes and exponentially increased with shoot diameter classes, with coniferous species exhibiting the highest correlation. On the other hand, the proportion of twig dry mass to total sapling dry mass followed the order S. aucuparia > A. alba > P. abies > F. sylvatica > C. betulus > A. pseudoplatanus. The developed allometric equations contribute significantly to the already available collection of published biomass equations. Moreover, they extremely useful in estimating the browsing potential of tree saplings falling within size ranges conducive to herbivore browsing.

AB  - In coastal British Columbia, Canada, marine megafauna such as humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus velifera) have been subject to a history of exploitation and near extirpation. While their populations have been in recovery, significant threats are posed to these vulnerable species by proposed natural resource ventures in this region, in addition to the compounding effects of anthropogenic climate change. Genetic tools play a vital role in informing conservation efforts, but the associated collection of tissue biopsy samples can be challenging for the investigators and disruptive to the ongoing behaviour of the targeted whales. Here, we evaluate a minimally intrusive approach based on collecting exhaled breath condensate, or respiratory 'blow' samples, from baleen whales using an unoccupied aerial system (UAS), within Gitga'at First Nation territory for conservation genetics. Minimal behavioural responses to the sampling technique were observed, with no response detected 87% of the time (of 112 UAS deployments). DNA from whale blow (n = 88 samples) was extracted, and DNA profiles consisting of 10 nuclear microsatellite loci, sex identification and mitochondrial (mt) DNA haplotypes were constructed. An average of 7.5 microsatellite loci per individual were successfully genotyped. The success rates for mtDNA and sex assignment were 80% and 89% respectively. Thus, this minimally intrusive sampling method can be used to describe genetic diversity and generate genetic profiles for individual identification. The results of this research demonstrate the potential of UAS-collected whale blow for conservation genetics from a remote location.

AB  - During drought, plants allocate resources to aboveground biomass production and belowground carbohydrate reserves, often at the expense of production of defence traits. Additionally, drought has been shown to alter floral resources, with potential implications for plant-pollinator interactions. Although soil symbionts, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, can alleviate drought stress in plants, certain levels of drought may negatively impact this relationship, with potential cascading effects. Because of their importance to plant and animal community diversity, we examined effects of drought on biomass production, physical defence properties, nectar production, and associated AM fungal abundance of five common prairie forb species in a greenhouse study. Reduced soil moisture decreased vegetative biomass production. Production of trichomes and latex decreased under drought, relative to well-watered conditions. Ruellia humilis flowers produced less nectar under drought, relative to well-watered conditions. Intra-radical AM fungal colonization was not significantly affected by drought, although extra-radical AM fungal biomass associated with S. azurea decreased following drought. Overall, grassland forb productivity, defence, and nectar production were negatively impacted by moderate drought, with possible negative implications for biotic interactions. Reduced flower and nectar production may lead to fewer pollinator visitors, which may contribute to seed limitation in forb species. Reduced physical defences increase the likelihood of herbivory, further decreasing the ability to store energy for essential functions, such as reproduction. Together, these results suggest drought can potentially impact biotic interactions between plants and herbivores, pollinators, and soil symbionts, and highlights the need for direct assessments of these relationships under climate change scenarios.

AB  - The importance of plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) for above-ground and below-ground multitrophic interactions is well recognized. However, most studies only condition soil for a short time before testing the feedback response. Here we investigate the influence of time of conditioning on soil microbiome composition, plant growth and metabolomics, and plant-insect interactions. We used soil collected from large outdoor mesocosms with monocultures of six species and investigated the temporal changes in the soil over a full year. Every 2 months, we assessed the legacy effects of the soils on plant growth of one of the species (Jacobaea vulgaris) in a climate-controlled chamber. Each time we used tissue culture plants that were genetically identical. We also measured leaf herbivore performance and leaf metabolomes, as well as the abiotic and biotic soil properties. We show that the monoculture soils harboured different microbiomes, but that these varied over time. Growth of the test plants also varied over time and plants grew consistently less well in their own soil. The soil legacy effects on the leaf metabolome were less consistent and varied strongly over time. Networking analysis showed that soil bacteria had stronger effects on the leaf metabolome than fungi early on. However, after 12 months of conditioning, only soil fungal community composition explained the metabolomic profiles of the leaves. Insect herbivory was not affected by soil conditioning, but decreased with increasing time of conditioning. Synthesis. Our results show that the biomass response of the test plants to soil conditioning remained consistent throughout the year, even though both the soil microbiome and leaf metabolomic responses to conditioned soil varied greatly over time. These soil-induced changes in the metabolome of plants over time can be an important driver of above-ground multitrophic interactions in nature. Our study demonstrates that the duration of conditioning has a strong impact on plant and soil properties, which highlights that temporal variation is an important aspect to consider in future studies investigating plant-soil interactions.

AB  - Symbionts can provide hosts with effective protection from natural enemies, but it can sometimes come at a cost. It is unclear to what extent the density of symbionts modulates the cost and benefits of conferred protection. Here, we use a meta-analysis of 103 effect sizes from a broad taxonomic range of protective symbioses to show that the degree of both protection and cost afforded to hosts is a positive function of symbiont density. We found that the effects of symbiont density on protection and cost are robust across ecological contexts. Density-function relationships did not vary with host type, symbiont localization, or transmission mode, nor did they vary with the method of density manipulation. Taken together, our results suggest that symbiont density can be a key variable determining the costs and benefits of a protective interaction.

AB  - A national map of pasture productivity, in terms of mass of dry matter yield per unit area and time, enables evaluation of regional and local land-use suitability. Difficulty in measuring this quantity at scale directed this research, which utilises four years of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and collected pasture yield measurements to develop a model of pasture productivity. The model uses a Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), with spatio-temporal segmentation and averaging, to estimate mean annual pasture productivity across all of New Zealand's grasslands with a standard error of prediction of 2.2 t/ha/y. Regional aggregates of pasture yield demonstrate expected spatial variations. The pasture productivity map may be used to classify grasslands objectively into stratified levels of production on a national scale. Due to its ability to highlight areas of land use intensification suitability, the national map of pasture productivity is of value to landowners, land users, and environmental scientists.

AB  - Pleistocene fluvial sequences have been recognised in some regions of Me ' xico as an important source of infor-mation on past environmental change using a wide range of proxies. However, this has not been attempted in Mexico's southernmost state of Chiapas until the current paper, where the main aim is to describe and date five new Late Pleistocene fossil rich sequences and to interpret their paleoenvironmental record and changes that they indicate. This interpretation is based on the sedimentology, pollen record and stable isotopes from verte-brate fossils together with the radiocarbon dating of the fluvial sediments. At Los Mangos and El Baji ' on fossil sites the fluvial sediment record reported here includes a conspicuous layer with aerodynamic Fe magnetic microspherules associated with the Younger Dryas (YD) meteorite impact which adds to the type of paleo-environments in which such meteorite impacts have been recognised. The sediment dating indicates that the fossiliferous sites are Late Pleistocene in age, and they add new locations and information for Me ' xico for this climatic phase.

AB  - During the Late Pleistocene, stadial and interstadial fluctuations affected vegetation, fauna, and human groups that were forced to cope with these pronounced spatial-temporal climatic and environmental changes. These changes were especially abrupt during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3. Here, we reconstruct the climatic trends in northern Iberia considering the stable isotopic composition of ungulate skeletal tissue found in archaeological deposits dated between 80 and 15 kacalBP. The carbon and oxygen isotopic composition preserved in the carbonate fraction of tooth enamel provides a reliable and high-resolution proxy of the food and water consumed by these animals, which is indirectly related to the local vegetation, environment, and climate, allowing us to estimate palaeotemperatures and rainfall intensity. This study presents new isotope data from 44 bovine, equid, and cervid teeth from five archaeological sites in the Vasco-Cantabrian region (El Castillo, Axlor, Labeko Koba, Aitzbitarte III interior, and El Otero) and one in northeastern Iberia (Canyars), where human evidence is attested from the Mousterian to the Magdalenian. The carbon isotope values reflect animals feeding on diverse C3 plants in open environments and point to differentiated ecological niches for equids and bovines, especially during the Aurignacian in the Vasco-Cantabrian region. Temperature estimations based on oxygen isotopic compositions and rainfall obtained from carbon isotopic compositions indicate colder and more arid conditions than nowadays for the human occupations from the Late Mousterian to the Aurignacian. The contemporary northeastern Iberian site shows slightly lower temperatures related to an arid period when animals mainly grazed in open landscapes. In the Vasco-Cantabrian region, during MIS 2, the Gravettian data reflect a landscape opening, whereas the Magdalenian points to warmer (but still arid) conditions.

AB  - Most food web models fail to account for the full complexity of interactions within a community, particularly where microbes are involved. Carcasses are microbe-rich resources and may represent a common nexus for the macrobiome and microbiome, effectively uniting autotrophs, consumers, predators and microbiota. We evaluated the role of carcasses as multitrophic resources and explored dietary partitioning for a sexually dimorphic obligate scavenger known for its hierarchical social system. This study was set in a well-studied community of camelids Vicugna, Lama guanicoe, pumas Puma concolor and Andean condors Vultur gryphus in the Andes. We hypothesized that condors, by feeding on trophically distinct dietary substrates within any given carcass, would have highly variable trophic position (TP) values. Furthermore, we expected that the microbial consumers within the carcass would inflate TP values in both, the carrion and the condors. Thus, we expected that the trophic heterogeneity within a carcass could facilitate sex-based dietary partitioning in condors. We used a multifaceted approach to assess the foraging of Andean condors, using regurgitated pellet and bulk isotopic analyses, and also quantified the TP of the entire community of graminoids, camelids, camelid carrion, pumas, and female and male condors employing compound-specific stable isotopes analysis of amino acids. Our analysis of condor pellets and bulk isotopes revealed non-trivial plant consumption, close to 10% of condor diet. Isotope analysis of amino acids revealed that condors had highly variable TPs (2.9 +/- 0.3) compared to pumas (3.0 +/- 0.0) and camelids (2.0 +/- 0.1), likely representing 'trophic omnivory', wherein the condors consume plants (TP = 1.0 +/- 0.1) and microbe-colonized carrion (2.3 +/- 0.1). Female condors exhibited a TP (2.8 +/- 0.2) lower than strict carnivory, suggesting that they consume more plant biomass in a carcass, while males (TP = 3.1 +/- 0.3) are likely consuming more of the microbe-rich animal tissue. Our study highlights that carcasses represent a trophically heterogeneous resource and that vertebrate scavengers can feed across trophic groups within the carcass, from autotrophs to secondary consumers, and from both the macrobiome and microbiome. Thus, integration of microbes in macroecological contexts can help to resolve trophic identity, and better characterize the importance of microbes in detritivorous and omnivorous species.

AB  - Domesticated animals are artificially selected to exhibit desirable traits, however not all traits of domesticated animals are the result of deliberate selection. Loss of olfactory capacity in the domesticated pig (Sus scrofa domesticus) is one example. We used whole transcriptome analysis (RNA-Seq) to compare patterns of gene expression in the olfactory mucosa of the pig and two subspecies of wild boar (Sus scrofa), and investigate candidate genes that could be responsible for the loss of olfactory capacity. We identified hundreds of genes with reductions in transcript abundance in pig relative to wild boar as well as differences between the two subspecies of wild boar. These differences were detected mainly in genes involved in the formation and motility of villi, cilia and microtubules, functions associated with olfaction. In addition, differences were found in the abundances of transcripts of genes related to immune defenses, with the highest levels in continental wild boar subspecies. Overall, the loss of olfactory capacity in pigs appears to have been accompanied by reductions in the expression of candidate genes for olfaction. These changes could have resulted from unintentional selection for reduced olfactory capacity, relaxed selection for maintaining olfactory capacity, pleiotropic effects of genes under selection, or other non-selective processes. Our findings could be a cornerstone for future researches on wild boars, pigs, feral populations, and their evolutionary trajectories, aimed to provide tools to better calibrate species management as well as guidelines for breeders.

AB  - Animals are strongly connected to the environments they live in and may become adapted to local environments. Examining genetic-environment associations of key indicator species, like seabirds, provides greater insights into the forces that drive evolution in marine systems. Here we examined a RADseq dataset of 19,213 SNPs for 99 rhinoceros auklets (Cerorhinca monocerata) from five western Pacific and 10 eastern Pacific breeding colonies. We used partial redundancy analyses to identify candidate adaptive loci and to quantify the effects of environmental variation on population genetic structure. We identified 262 candidate adaptive loci, which accounted for 3.0% of the observed genetic variation among western Pacific and eastern Pacific breeding colonies. Genetic variation was more strongly associated with pH and maximum current velocity, than maximum sea surface temperature. Genetic-environment associations explain genetic differences between western and eastern Pacific populations; however, genetic variation within the western and eastern Pacific Ocean populations appears to follow a pattern of isolation-by-distance. This study represents a first to quantify the relationship between environmental and genetic variation for this widely distributed marine species and provides greater insights into the evolutionary forces that act on marine species.

AB  - Arbi is one of the main local goat breeds in Tunisia, representing an important economic resource in arid and hot areas where cattle and sheep cannot thrive successfully. In the current work, we have characterized the mitochondrial diversity of 26 Arbi goats by partially sequencing the mitochondrial D-loop region. These sequences plus 10 retrieved from GenBank were analyzed with the DnaSP v.5.10.1, evidencing the existence of 12 different haplotypes. Nucleotide and haplotype diversities were 0.02 and 0.96. Moreover, median-joining network analysis showed that all D-loop sequences from Arbi goats correspond to haplogroup A and that in general they do not cluster with sequences from other goat breeds. The high diversity that has been observed in North African goats is compatible with the maritime diffusion of the Neolithic package 10,000-7000 YBP. Moreover, there are evidences that local Tunisian breeds have been extensively crossed with highly productive transboundary breeds in order to improve meat and milk yields. These uncontrolled crossing practices may lead to the loss of alleles that play key roles in the adaptation of Tunisian local breeds to a harsh environment.

AB  - Herbivorous insects need to cope with changing host plant biochemistry caused by abiotic and biotic impacts, to meet their dietary requirements. Larvae of the multivoltine European grapevine moth Lobesia botrana, one of the main insect pests in viticulture, feed on both flowers and berries. The nutritional value and defence compounds of these organs are changing with plant phenology and are affected by climate change which may accordingly alter plant-insect interactions. Here, we assessed the impacts of future elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the host plant quality of different grapevine organs and the larval performance and the transcriptome of L. botrana. Using the Geisenheim VineyardFACE facility, where 'Riesling' and 'Cabernet Sauvignon' were cultivated in the field under ambient or elevated (ca. + 20%) atmospheric CO2 concentrations, we found that nutrient (amino acids and sugars) and defence compound (phenolic compounds) concentrations of inflorescences and ripening berries differed strongly due to plant phenology and less due to cultivar and CO2 concentration. Assessing global gene expression after feeding on the respective organs, we found that larval transcriptomic plasticity largely mirrored the plant biochemical plasticity. Larval relative growth rate differed between treatments in a plant phenology-dependent manner. Grape berries contained higher amino acid concentrations and altered phenolics profiles after larval feeding. In the near future, the grapevine-L. botrana interaction will probably change less because of elevated CO2 concentrations than it does currently during one season. Changes associated with plant phenology, however, may be relevant for contemporary pest management.

AB  - Indirect wildlife population surveying largely depends upon counts of artifacts of behavior (e.g., nests or dung). Likelihood to encounter these artifacts is derived from both artifact production and decay, and variability in production behavior is considered to contribute minimally to inaccuracy in wildlife estimation. Here, we demonstrate how ignoring behavioral variability leads to significant population misestimation, using an example of an endangered ape, the bonobo (Pan paniscus). Until now, a single estimate of nest construction rate has been used to extrapolate bonobo densities, assumed to be broadly representative of bonobo sign production behavior. We estimated nest construction rates across seasons and social groups at the Kokolopori Bonobo Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and find nest construction rates in bonobos to be highly variable across populations as well as seasonal within populations. Failure to account for this variability led to degradation in the accuracy of bonobo population density estimates, accounting for a likely overestimation of bonobo numbers by 34%, and at worst as high as 80%. With this example, we demonstrate that failure to account for inter- and intrapopulation behavioral variation compromises the ability to estimate both relative and absolute wildlife abundances. We argue that variation in sign production is but one of the several potential ways that behavioral variability can affect conservation monitoring, should be measured across contexts whenever possible, and must be considered in population estimation confidence intervals. With increasing attention to behavioral variability as a potential tool for conservation, conservationists must also account for the impact that behavioral variability can have upon wildlife population estimation. Our results underline the importance of observational research to wildlife monitoring schemes as a critical component of conservation management. We discuss the avenues through which behavioral variability is likely to impact wildlife monitoring accuracy and precision and propose potential approaches for accounting for behavioral variability in wildlife monitoring.

AB  - Citizen or community science has the potential to inform wildlife management by including the general public in research and generating datasets on human perceptions of wildlife population dynamics and human-wildlife interactions. These contributions are especially valuable in areas with limited formal capacity for wildlife monitoring. However, people's perceptions are not always reliable and hinge on the accurate classification of species. In the absence of artificial intelligence-supported automatic identification tools or wildlife experts, effectively incorporating people's reports of wildlife sightings into conservation management plans depends on the abilities of people to accurately identify animals (i.e. species literacy). These skills likely vary across human populations in accordance with a range of demographic, geographic and species-specific factors. We carried out 680 semi-structured interviews with rural citizens, randomly selected along transects in 25 villages across northern Tanzania. We showed photographs of 17 mammal species to participants and assessed species identification ability. Using a generalized linear mixed model within a Bayesian framework that accommodated the hierarchical data structure and non-independence of the data, we tested specific hypotheses regarding the correlations of species identification accuracy with human demographic (ethnicity, education, age, wealth, gender), geographic (Human Footprint Index [HFI], distance to protected areas, district) and species-specific (conservation status, activity patterns, body mass, diet) variables. Most respondents accurately identified key wildlife species commonly involved in human-wildlife interactions. Gender strongly influenced species identification accuracy, with men three times more likely to correctly identify species as compared to women. Formal education was negatively correlated with species identification accuracy. Respondents identified large species more accurately than smaller ones, whereas other species traits were not markedly correlated with identification accuracy. Distance to the nearest protected area, district and the HFI score in the area surrounding the household of the respondent were not markedly associated with species identification accuracy. Our results show that rural residents in northern Tanzania can reliably identify key wildlife species implicated in consequential human-wildlife interactions, though identification accuracy was affected by a combination of demographic and species-specific factors that must be appropriately contextualized. This finding validates studies of local perceptions of wildlife populations and community reports of human-wildlife interactions. Finally, we discuss how local perspectives on wildlife can be applied to improve human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - The environmental and economic inputs of three different fish farming methods, (semi-natural, concrete, and galvanised ponds) were investigated in a region with a hot and dry climate and a severe water shortage. The data were collected in 2020 through direct interviews with fish farmers, as well as regional weather information. The inputs and outputs of each system, both environmental and purchased, as well as the water quality parameters and fish growth rates, were also recorded. Emergy analysis was applied to assess the economic, and environmental aspects of these systems and to compare their performance and sustainability. According to the emergy efficiency indicators (Tr and SpE), concrete ponds had a higher efficiency for fish farming than the other two systems. Semi-natural fish farming was sustainable, as shown by the emergy yield ratio, which measures the system's reliance on environmental inputs. Semi-natural ponds had an economic advantage (O/I, BN, O/IEmV and BNEmV) over concrete and galvanised fish farming, because they used environmental inputs more effectively for fish rearing. Environmental efficiency can be improved by taking suitable management actions, such as increasing the size of fingerlings, while economic efficiency can be enhanced by enlarging the scale of fish farms. At the same time, using economic inputs more efficiently in concrete and galvanised ponds can boost both their sustainability and economic efficiency.

AB  - In the context of extreme climate change, experts in fruit production face a significant challenge in developing new strategies aimed at increasing the productivity of fruit tree crops. In order to investigate the changes in various horticultural indices (production, tree growth, and development) as well as the quality of plum fruits, sheep's wool mulch, a cornstarch-based soil conditioner, and a combination of the two were applied in a Stanley plum orchard. In parallel, an experimental control variation was used. The results showed that the methods used had a substantial impact on fruit yield, size, and weight, with the best results obtained when mulching with sheep's wool and soil conditioner. Plum fruits from mulching with sheep wool + soil conditioner exhibited the greatest total phenol concentration (1.30 +/- 0.09 mg GAE/g dw), followed by the reference sample at 1.16 +/- 0.09 mg GAE/g dw. The antioxidant capacity assessed using the three different methods provided favorable results for the experimental variant, sheep wool + soil conditioner. The results indicate that using the three experimental versions increased the fruit yield with 27% (sheep's wool mulch) and with, 37% (sheep wool + soil conditioner) on average compared to that of the control group, while also improving the fruit quality. The fruit weight increased with 17.26% (cornstarch-based soil conditioner) and with 48.90% (sheep wool + soil conditioner) compared to that of the control, and the fruit size increased with 5% in two experiments (sheep's wool mulch and a cornstarch-based soil conditioner) with 19% (sheep wool + soil conditioner), compared to the control group.

AB  - Disturbances determine the structure of savannas by influencing growth at all stages of a tree's life. Since the seedling stage is such a significant part of a tree's life cycle, greater knowledge of this stage informs woody management and encroachment prevention. In this study, we tested the effect of a suite of seedling func-tional traits on seedling survival after experimentally-induced disturbance. Twelve mimosoid legume tree species, an important group in African savannas, with different provenances, were grown from seed under experimental conditions. Seedlings were clipped at 1 cm above ground at age 30 days, to simulate distur-bance, and their survival recorded. A number of above-and below-ground traits quantifying height, biomass, bud bank and architecture were measured prior to clipping in order to assess what traits could be responsible for post-clipping survival. We also quantified root contraction by calculating the change in height of the low-est bud between the ages of 6 and 60 days. Fire regime and browser biomass of the native range of each spe-cies were calculated to test whether these factors predicted seedling survival. Seedling survival was primarily predicted by the whether the plant possessed a bud below 1 cm above ground level, i.e. below the height of clipping. For the first time we report that, in several Vachellia species, root contraction occurred, bringing basal buds closer to the ground, and in some cases below the ground, thus increasing seedling sur-vival after clipping. No environmental variables were significant predictors of survival. Our results suggest that, at this young age, buds close to the soil surface are the most important trait predicting seedling survival, while other traits that are important for saplings and adults do not significantly influence the survival of seedlings. At the seedling stage, herbivory and fire are possibly inflicting the same degree of selection pres-sures and thus little trait differentiation is evident across the environmental gradient.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The goal of this paper is to refine the relative and absolute chronology of Epigravettian culture (26.5-15.0 ka) in eastern Central Europe (ECE) and clarify its relation to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and subsequent climatic changes. Epigravettian sites were sorted into three chronological clusters: initial LGM (ILGM) (26.5-24.0 ka), local LGM (LLGM) (24.0-20.0 ka), and post-LGM (PLGM) (20.0-14.7 ka). We obtained new radiocarbon dates from previously dated and undated sites, then analysed the lithic tool typology and faunal data to seek correlations between age and archaeological features.
   The lithic typology study did not find differences between ILGM and LLGM sites, but the tool type variance between LLGM and PLGM was significant, applicable for relative chronology. ILGM and LLGM lithic assemblages were characterized by domestic tool dominance and the frequent use of flake tools. PLGM assemblages were correlated with armature dominance and blade/let tools. Among the armatures, backed point variants characterized the PLGM sites compared to the ILGM and LLGM. The sole ILGM lithic armature was the retouched blade/let point. The LLGM also possessed this type and often included backed blade/lets.
   ILGM faunal data, although few, implied the hunting of mammoth and reindeer. The LLGM data represented recurring hunting of reindeer and horse, and PLGM data indicated the hunting of horse, reindeer, and mammoth.
   Our results suggested that the territory of Poland was deserted by humans in the LLGM. Moravia and Lower Austria was inhabited until the first half of the LLGM, while the Carpathian Basin was all along the ILGM. The preference for the Carpathian Basin could have been the milder climate, the abundance of fauna, and permanent access to tree vegetation. After the LGM the glacial flora and fauna gradually disappeared, leading to a reduced human presence in southern ECE. Thus, the disappearance of the Epigravettian culture and Pleistocene hunter-gatherer occupations are linked to the amelioration of climate that resulted in the disappearance of the Pleistocene environment.

AB  - Selection along environmental gradients may play a vital role in driving adaptive evolution. Nevertheless, genomic variation and genetic adaptation along environmental clines remains largely unknown in plants in alpine ecosystems. To close this knowledge gap, we assayed transcriptomic profiles of late flower bud and early leaf bud of Rhododendron sanguineum var. haemaleum from four different elevational belts between 3,000 m and 3,800 m in the Gaoligong Mountains. By comparing differences in gene expression of these samples, a gene co-expression network (WGCNA) was constructed to identify candidate genes related to elevation. We found that the overall gene expression patterns are organ-specific for the flower and leaf. Differentially expressed unigenes were identified in these organs. In flowers, these were mainly related to terpenoid metabolism (RsHMGR, RsTPS), while in leaves mainly related to anthocyanin biosynthesis (RsCHS, RsF3'5'H). Terpenoids are the main components of flower scent (fragrance) likely attracting insects for pollination. In response to fewer pollinators at higher elevation zone, it seems relatively less scent is produced in flower organs to reduce energy consumption. Secondary metabolites in leaves such as anthocyanins determine the plants' alternative adaptive strategy to extreme environments, such as selective pressures of insect herbivory from environmental changes and substrate competition in biosynthesis pathways at high elevations. Our findings indicated that the gene expression profiles generated from flower and leaf organs showed parallel expression shifts but with different functionality, suggesting the existence of flexibility in response strategies of plants exposed to heterogeneous environments across elevational gradients. The genes identified here are likely to be involved in the adaptation of the plants to these varying mountainous environments. This study thus contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of adaptation in response to environmental change.

AB  - DNA metabarcoding analysis for gut contents has been shown to compensate the disadvantage of traditionally morphological identification and offer higher resolution of prey items in an efficient way. Holland's carp (Spinibarbus hollandi) is a freshwater fish native to southern and eastern Taiwan. In the past two decades, this species has been introduced as a sport fish into the river basins of northern and western Taiwan. The large body size and active predation make it a potential threat for native fishes, but which native species are preyed by Holland's carp remains unknown. In this study, the diet from the gut contents of Holland's carp from the Zhonggang River, an invaded basin, was examined using DNA metabarcoding from 51 individuals and by morphological examinations on 140 samples. Detritus of plants were found in 83.6% samples (117 individuals). Twenty fish species of seven families were identified by DNA metabarcoding, including species of all water layers. Taiwan torrent carp (Acrossocheilus paradoxus) and Rhinogobius spp. are the most common prey items. Based on the results of this study, Holland's carp is considered an opportunistic omnivore because of its diverse diet items, which is an important trait for successful invasive fish species. The population decline of Opsariichthys pachycephalus may not result from the invasion of Holland's carps. Nonetheless, the time lag between successful invasion and the samplings of this study may be a concern because the population size of O. pachycephalus may have declined and become difficult to prey. The Holland's carps consumed the least species in winter; nonetheless, the occurrence frequencies of preys among seasons were not significantly different probably because of limited temperature fluctuation. The smallest Holland's carps consumed the least prey species compared to other size categories, similar to the relationship of prey species number to size of invasive largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides).

AB  - Soil bacteria play pivotal roles in agroecosystem functioning. However, the immense diversity of soil bacterial communities masks the effects of some species, such as bacterial biomarkers, on soil nutrient cycling and crop growth. We analyzed biological and chemical soil parameters of five fertilization treatments (CK, LN, CN, HN, LNM: 0, 150, 200, 250 kg N hm(-2), 150 kg N hm(-2) + 15,000 kg hm(-2) sheep manure). The random forest models were used to select bacterial biomarkers and assess the contributions of bacterial biomarkers and overall bacteria to wheat yield. Moreover, we used a partial least squares path modelling to explore the relationship between fertilization, bacterial biomarkers, carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling functions, soil nutrients, and wheat yield. The results showed that bacterial biomarkers are better predictors of wheat yield than overall bacteria, explaining 52.54% and 16.00% of the variation in yield, respectively. Bacterial biomarkers affected wheat production by increasing soil organic carbon, and available nitrogen content. The LNM treatment significantly improved the relative abundance of beneficial biomarkers, such as Sphingomonadales, Xanthomonadaceae, Lysobacter, and Streptomyces, compared to the LN treatment. In addition, the LNM treatment promoted chitinlysis, cellulolysis, xylanolysis, aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, and aerobic ammonia oxidation, relative to the other inorganic N treatments (LN, CN, and HN). Our results emphasize the role of bacterial biomarkers in wheat yield formation, providing new insights into maintaining agricultural productivity by taking advantage of soil bacterial biomarkers.

AB  - The perennial halophytic shrubs Atriplex nummularia and Rhagodia preissii are native to Australia and can be planted on saline land to produce sheep and cattle feed during the autumn. However, an impediment to the adoption of the species on saline land has been the challenges in achieving successful establishment by direct seeding due to a lack of knowledge of the optimal conditions for germination. Therefore, the optimal germination requirements in relation to temperature, salinity level and seed size was assessed for each species to ascertain the optimal conditions for successful establishment by direct seeding on saline land. Seeds of both species showed optimal germination temperature at 10 degrees C. Atriplex nummularia seeds were more tolerant to temperatures above or below 10 degrees C than R. preissii. The germination percentage of A. nummularia was unchanged at 0-200 mM NaCl2. The germination percentage of Rhagodia preissii declined when the NaCl2 content exceeded 50 mM. There was no correlation between seed size, germination and emergence for any of the species. Based on the study, we suggest that sowing operations are performed during the cold winter months in subtropical areas or autumn and spring in temperate areas, to improve the successful establishment of these shrubs by direct seeding.

AB  - Understanding the threats faced by a bird species requires a knowledge of their movements throughout the annual cycle and, for migratory species, the degree of connectivity between breeding and wintering sites. We studied the philopatry of Snowy Owls (Bubo scandiacus) tagged in central North America to their wintering sites on the Canadian prairies. The tracking of 16 owls over a period spanning six winters revealed consistent and predictable north-south migration trajectories, in contrast to populations farther to the west and east. Individuals were strongly philopatric to the central prairie region, but at a finer spatial scale, winter home ranges did not always overlap between successive years. Both sexes showed periods of nomadic searching for prey over a similar spatial scale, but males tended to settle closer to previous home ranges on average (88 km) than females (149 km). We hypothesize that the socially dominant females are better able to monopolize the spatially unpredictable hotspots of small mammal prey whereas males rely more on familiarity with a previous home range when settling. The population of Snowy Owls in central North America thus shows greater connectivity to wintering sites than do Snowy Owls documented elsewhere, probably related to the relatively high abundance and predictability of small mammal prey on the prairies. Maintaining prairie habitat on a large spatial scale that supports small rodents will be crucial to maintaining populations of Snowy Owls in the central part of the continent.

AB  - African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) can have detrimental impacts on trees; studies exploring elephant impact within small, fenced reserves, have lacked focus in determining elephant high-use areas, the direct effect of fence line and tree recovery. The aim of this study is to assess whether elephants cause significant impact on trees in the small-fenced Karongwe Private Game Reserve (KPGR) and to determine the levels of tree recovery. Trees >= 5 m in height were surveyed (n = 634 trees). Elephant location data were used to identify high- and low-use areas. Five species accounted for 80% of the records; these were used for further analysis. Trees in high-use areas were significantly less likely to show signs of debarking and push over. Tall trees were significantly more likely to be impacted by elephants, being associated with heightened risks of debarking and branches being broken but lower risks of being pushed over. Trees close to the fence line were not more impacted than trees near the centre of the reserve. The level of use, distance to the fence and tree height were not significant predictors of tree recovery indicators. Future mitigation efforts should focus on trees with high levels of impact and low levels of recovery.

AB  - Benthic communities of the hydrothermally active submarine Piip Volcano (55 degrees 445 N, 167 degrees 263 E, 368-495 m, the southwestern Bering Sea) were explored during the 75th and 82nd cruises of the RV Akademik M.A. Lavrentyev using the ROV Comanche 18. The Piip Volcano is the northernmost hydrothermal region in the Pacific. Macrofauna composition and community structure were investigated based on qualitative and relative abundance samples along with still images and video records. In total, 130 species of macro- and megafauna were found, of which similar to 25% are new to science. Of the fauna, 9 species (7%) are obligate or potentially obligate to environments with access to reduced chemicals. These species are the bivalve Calyptogena pacifica (Vesicomyidae: Pliocardiinae), the gastropods Parvaplustrum wareni (Parvaplustridae) and Provanna sp. (Provannidae), the amphipod Onesimoides sp. (Tryphosidae), the leptostracan Nebalia piipensis (Nebaliidae), the isopod Eurycope andreyi (Munnopsidae), and the polychaetes Neosabellides uschakovi (Ampharetidae), Ophryotrocha beringiana (Dorvilleidae) and Harmothoe globosa (Polynoidae).
   The total species richness of the Northern and Southern summits was almost identical (90 species and 85 spp respectively), but the number of species on sites without bacterial mats on the Northern Summit (81 spp) was almost 1.5 times higher than on the Southern Summit (57 spp). At the same time the species richness was almost twice higher in habitats with bacterial mats and/or clam beds on the Southern Summit (58 spp) compared to the Northern one (32 spp). The main faunal difference was the absence of Calyptogena pacifica on the Northern Summit. The factors that may explain differences of the faunal communities of the Northern and Southern summits are discussed.
   The distinctive features of macro- and megafaunal communities of the Piip Volcano were the significant number of taxa, obligate for reducing habitats, of different taxonomic levels including family and subfamily levels and plentiful abundances of sedentary organisms, including the sea anemone Corallimorphus cf. pilatus, the demosponge Vulcanella koltuni, calcareous sponges and benthopelagic Trachimedusa, all of them presumably utilizing the rich food resources of reducing habitats.

AB  - Reduced genetic diversity through inbreeding can negatively affect pathogen resistance. This relationship becomes more complicated in social species, such as social insects, since the chance of disease transmission increases with the frequency of interactions among individuals. However, social insects may benefit from social immunity, whereby individual physiological defenses may be bolstered by collective-level immune responses, such as grooming or sharing of antimicrobial substance through trophallaxis. We set out to determine whether differences in genetic diversity between colonies of the subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes, accounts for colony survival against pathogens. We sampled colonies throughout the United States (Texas, North Carolina, Maryland, and Massachusetts) and determined the level of inbreeding of each colony. To assess whether genetically diverse colonies were better able to survive exposure to diverse pathogens, we challenged groups of termite workers with two strains of a pathogenic fungus, one local strain present in the soil surrounding sampled colonies and another naive strain, collected outside the range of this species. We found natural variation in the level of inbreeding between colonies, but this variation did not explain differences in susceptibility to either pathogen. Although the naive strain was found to be more hazardous than the local strain, colony resistance was correlated between two strains, meaning that colonies had either relatively high or low susceptibility to both strains regardless of their inbreeding coefficient. Overall, our findings may reflect differential virulence between the strains, immune priming of the colonies via prior exposure to the local strain, or a coevolved resistance toward this strain. They also suggest that colony survival may rely more upon additional factors, such as different behavioral response thresholds or the influence of a specific genetic background, rather than the overall genetic diversity of the colony.

AB  - The ubiquitous presence of microplastics (MP) in aquatic ecosystems can affect organisms and communities in multiple ways. While MP research on aquatic organisms has primarily focused on marine ecosystems and laboratory experiments, the community-level effects of MP in freshwaters, especially in lakes, are poorly understood. To examine the impact of MP on freshwater lake ecosystems, we conducted the first in situ community-level mesocosm experiment testing the effects of MP on a model food web with zooplankton as main herbivores, odonate larvae as predators, and chironomid larvae as detritivores for seven weeks. The mesocosms were exposed to a mixture of the most abundant MP polymers found in freshwaters, added at two different concentrations in a single pulse to the water surface, water column and sediment. Water column MP concentrations declined sharply during the first two weeks of the experiment. Contrary to expectations, MP ingestion by zooplankton was low and limited mainly to large-bodied Daphnia, causing a decrease in biomass. Biomass of the other zooplankton taxa did not decrease. Presence of MP in the faecal pellets of odonate larvae that fed on zooplankton was indicative of atrophic transfer of MP. The results demonstrated that MP ingestion varies predictably with MP size, as well as body size and feeding preference of the organism, which can be used to predict the rates of transfer and further effects of MP on freshwater food webs. For chironomids, MP had only a low, short-term impact on emergence patterns while their wing morphology was significantly changed. Overall, the impact of MP exposure on the experimental food web and cross-ecosystem biomass transfer was lower than expected, but the experiment provided the first in situ observation of MP transfer to terrestrial ecosystems by emerging chironomids.

AB  - Marine oil spills have become a significant threat to ocean environments and ecosystems. The development of effective marine oil spill identification technology is crucial for emergency authorities to enhance response strategies. In this letter, a marine oil spill detection method based on the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) features, random forest classifier, and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was proposed. First, row vector convolution and mean filtering were adopted to extract and smooth the co-frequency interferences. Then, binarization processing and median filtering were used to eliminate speckles. After that, gray correction and contrast enhancement model were performed to enhance the overall oil slick features. Next, HOG features and random forest classifier were utilized to extract effective oil spill regions. Finally, the PSO algorithm was introduced to iteratively optimize the adaptive dual-threshold for segmenting the real oil slicks. This approach enables accurate and efficient detection of oil spills, offering a scientific foundation for responding to offshore oil spill incidents.

AB  - Simple Summary Although studies have started to show that the effects of cover crops can translate into the cash cropping season, there is little information on the cascading effects of cover crops on the subsequent cash crop defenses, especially against polyphagous herbivores. To bridge this information gap, we conducted a field and laboratory study to investigate the cascading effects of different cover crop species on the subsequent cash crop defense against the polyphagous herbivore fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) across three fields in the Lower Rio Grande Valley in south Texas. Our field and laboratory results revealed that cover crop treatments differentially affected S. frugiperda growth and development. We also show that cover crops had a positive cascading effect on the growth and development of S. frugiperda on the subsequent cash crop. Collectively, our results add an additional line of evidence on how cover crops can affect pest dynamics outside the cash crop season. Recent studies have started to show that the benefits of cover crops can cascade to the cash crop growing seasons. However, the impact of cover crops on the subsequent cash crop defense against herbivores is not well understood. To test this, we conducted a field and laboratory study to assess the possible cascading effects of cover crops such as Vigna unguiculata, Sorghum drummondii, Raphanus sativus, and Crotalaria juncea on the subsequent cash crop (Sorghum bicolor) defense against the notorious polyphagous herbivore fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) across three farms in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Our field and laboratory studies showed that the cash crop planted in the cover crop treatment differentially affected S. frugiperda. More specifically, we found that cover crops have positive effects on the growth and development of S. frugiperda on the subsequent cash crop, including both larval and pupal parameters. However, our experiments on physical and chemical defenses in cash crops failed to show any significant differences between cover and control. Collectively, our results add an additional line of evidence on the effects of cover crops on pest dynamics outside the cash crop season, a key consideration for the selection and management of cover crops and cash crops, whose underlying mechanisms need to be examined further.

AB  - Trophic interaction modifications occur in food webs when the direct or indirect interaction between two species is affected by a third species. These behavioral modification effects are often referred to as associational effects. Changes in focal resource availability and consumption by a generalist herbivore can affect a range of outcomes from resource exclusion to multiple resources coexisting with the focal plant species. Here, we investigate the indirect interaction between a focal and alternative resource mediated by a generalist consumer. Using theoretical approaches we analyse the conceptual link between associational effects (both resistance and susceptibility) and the theory of apparent competition and resource switching. We find that changes in focal resource traits have the potential to affect the long-term outcome of indirect interactions. Inclusion of density-dependence expands generalist life-histories and broadens the range where, through associational effects, the availability of alternative resources positively influence a focal resource. We conclude that different forms of associational effects could, in the long-term, lead to a range of indirect interaction dynamics, including apparent competition and apparent mutualism. Our work aims to connects the theoretical body of work on indirect interactions to the concepts of associational effects. The indirect interactions between multiple resources need more thorough investigation to appreciate the range of associational effects that could result from the dynamical interaction between a generalist consumers and its focal and alternative resources.

AB  - Determining the relative influence of biotic and abiotic processes in structuring communities at local to large spatial scales is best understood using a biogeographic comparative-experimental approach. Using this approach, previous work suggests that intertidal community dynamics (top-down and bottom-up effects) vary unimodally along an upwelling-based productivity gradient, termed the Intermittent Upwelling Hypothesis (IUH). Evidence consistent with the IUH comes from the sessile invertebrate/predator (SIP) subweb in certain rocky intertidal communities, but whether this pattern extends to macrophyte/herbivore (MH) subwebs is unknown. Here we ask: Are MH subwebs also structured as predicted by the IUH? What is the relative importance of herbivory and predation in structuring these communities? Under what conditions do ecological subsidies like nutrients or propagule production drive community dynamics? And are omnivorous interactions important? We hypothesize that MH subwebs are driven by a new construct, the Grazing-Weakening Hypothesis (GWH), which states that MH interactions weaken monotonically with increasing nutrients, with strong (weak) herbivory and low (high) macrophyte productivity at low (high) nutrients. We explored local-to-large spatial scale dynamics of both subwebs using a biogeographic comparative-experimental factorial field experiment testing joint and separate effects of herbivores and predators between two continents. Experiments at 10 sites ranging from persistent upwelling to persistent downwelling regimes ran for 26-29 months in Oregon and California, and New Zealand (NZ) South Island. For the MH subweb, results were consistent with the GWH: herbivory declined and macrophytes increased with increasing nutrients. As expected, results for the SIP subweb were consistent with the IUH: predator effect size was unimodally related to upwelling. Overall, herbivory explained more variation in community structure than did predation, especially in NZ. Omnivory was weak, sessile invertebrates outcompeted macrophytes, and ocean-driven subsidies provided the basic template driving ecosystem dynamics. We propose a unified meta-ecosystem dynamics model combining MH and SIP results: with increased upwelling, sessile invertebrates and underlying dynamics vary unimodally (as in the IUH), while herbivory decreases and macrophytes generally increase. While this model was based on research in temperate ecosystems varying in upwelling regime, its wider applicability remains to be tested.

AB  - Japan receives nitrogenous air pollutants via long-range transport from China. However, emissions of nitrogenous air pollutants in China have stabilized or decreased in recent years. This study examined both the long-term trends in atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition from the 1990s to the 2010s and the response of stream water nitrate (NO3- ) leaching from forested areas in western Japan. A long-term (1992-2018) temporal analysis of atmospheric N deposition in Fukuoka (western Japan) was conducted. Atmospheric bulk N deposition was collected at forested sites in a suburban forest (Swest) and a rural forest (Rwest) in western Japan during 2009-2018. Stream water samples were also collected from four locations at sites Swest and Rwest during the same period. Results showed that atmospheric N deposition in Fukuoka started to decrease from the mid-2000s at an annual rate of -2.5% yr- 1. The decrease in atmospheric N deposition was attributable mainly to decreased atmospheric ammonium (NH4+) deposition, which caused greater contribution of NO3- deposition to atmospheric N deposition. Concentrations of NO3- in the stream water samples from three of the four locations decreased significantly at an annual rate of -3.7 to -0.7% yr- 1. However, stream water NO3- concentrations increased in one watershed where understory vegetation has been deteriorating owing to the increased deer population. This might weaken the recovery of N leaching from forested areas.

AB  - Hunting for bushmeat represents a complex social-ecological system ill-suited to top-down management. Community participatory management is an alternative approach with increasing support for both ethical and pragmatic reasons. Key to a community approach is long-term monitoring: this can both catalyse local ownership of and cohesion around management and is necessary to assess the effects of interventions and make changes as needed through adaptive management. Yet community-driven methods to monitor hunting remain underdeveloped: they often fail to account for sampling bias and do not incorporate space in a thorough way, and data are not communally analysed to simulate effects of potential management decisions. We created a novel community bushmeat monitoring programme to address these gaps across 20 villages in north-eastern Gabon. Paraecologists conducted standardised monitoring of bushmeat, and hundreds of hunters conducted GPS self-follows mapping village hunting catchments. We integrated these data to estimate the proportion of bushmeat sampled and make robust extrapolations of total offtake across space and time, estimating an annual offtake of similar to 30,000 animals of >56 species across all villages. Here, we present our approach and data-and apply them through a case study of six sympatric duiker species-to inform new directions for social-ecological bushmeat research and management.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal encephalopathy affecting North American cervids. Certain alleles in a host's prion protein gene are responsible for reduced susceptibility to CWD. We assessed for the first time variability in the prion protein gene of elk (Cervus canadensis) present in Pennsylvania, United States of America, a reintroduced population for which CWD cases have never been reported. We sequenced the prion protein gene (PRNP) of 565 elk samples collected over 7 years (2014-2020) and found two polymorphic sites (codon 21 and codon 132). The allele associated with reduced susceptibility to CWD is present in the population, and there was no evidence of deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in any of our sampling years (p-values between 0.14 and 1), consistent with the lack of selective pressure on the PRNP. The less susceptible genotypes were found in a frequency similar to the ones reported for elk populations in the states of Wyoming and South Dakota before CWD was detected. We calculated the proportion of less susceptible genotypes in each hunt zone in Pennsylvania as a proxy for their vulnerability to the establishment of CWD, and interpolated these results to obtain a surface representing expected proportion of the less susceptible genotypes across the area. Based on this analysis, hunt zones located in the southern part of our study area have a low proportion of less susceptible genotypes, which is discouraging for elk persistence in Pennsylvania given that these hunt zones are adjacent to the deer Disease Management Area 3, where CWD has been present since 2014.

AB  - In order to minimize human-wildlife conflicts, long-term and data-based management plans need to be developed. We aimed at assessing wild boar (Sus scrofa, Linnaeus, 1758) density within selected areas of Warsaw, the capital city of Poland. Wild boar abundance was estimated based on snow tracking conducted within 19 well-defined sectors, varying in habitat structure and location within the city. Moreover, in two forest reserves, wild boar population density was assessed with the use of camera traps and a random encounter model. The wild boar density index (n tracks/100 m/24 h) in Warsaw varied from 0 to 3.58 depending on the sector (0 to 4.0 ind./100 ha). In turn, it was 1.8 ind./100 ha for all the forested areas, which did not seem high compared to the other wild boar populations in Poland. The REM-derived estimates were higher than the snow-tracking-based estimates. Wild boars were mostly present in forests, especially those with oak stands, while the species was absent from central districts and mostly urbanized areas. We argue that the snow tracking method reflected the general distribution of wild boars across the city and in different habitats.

AB  - As the global climate changes, elevated atmospheric temperature and nitrogen (N) deposition co-occur in natural ecosystems, which affects rhizosphere soil nutrient by altering allocation of roots and its availability to soil microorganism. Elevated temperature in combination with N deposition is expected to affect soil available N and its relation to microbial properties, but this issue has not been extensively examined. Here, we investigated soil available N and its relation to microbial properties in rhizosphere of Camellia sinensis L. seedlings exposed to elevated temperature using a passive warming device in combination with N-added soil. Elevated temperature did not significantly affect soil pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), the ratio of carbon and nitrogen (C:N ratio), total phosphorus (TP), available N ((N in ammonium (NH4+-N) and N in nitrate (NO3--N)) (NH4+-N + NO3--N)/TN, alpha-glucosidase (alpha G), beta-glucosidase (beta G), cellobiohydrolase (CBH), N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), and phenol oxidase (PPO) activities, while significantly stimulated root total length of tea seedlings (3.9%), root dry biomass (10.2%), soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) (7.4%), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) (8.6%), and acid phosphatase (ACP) (8.8%). While N addition significantly (p < 0.05) stimulated root dry biomass of tea seedlings (14.1%), root total length (6.2%), root average diameter (6.7%), soil TN, available N, (NH4+-N + NO3--N)/TN, and MBN under elevated temperature. Soil aG, beta G, CBH, and ACP activity increase significantly (p < 0.05) under elevated temperature + N relative to elevated temperature alone. Generally, N addition led to increased available nitrogen and microbial properties in rhizosphere soil of tea seedlings exposed to elevated temperature by stimulating root properties, soil nitrogen, microbial biomass N, and enzyme activity. Redundancy analysis and Pearson correlation analysis suggested that N addition lead to higher correlation between soil available N and microbial properties exposed to elevated temperature. Our results indicated nitrogen addition exerts a stronger effect than elevated temperature on soil fertility and microbiological cycle in the rhizosphere of Camellia sinensis L. seedlings. The conclusion helps us understand the response mechanism of soil rhizosphere microenvironment to N deposition under global warming scenarios.

AB  - Cervids significantly challenge the establishment of planted silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) as browsing impacts tree growth, morphology, and stem structure, impacting wood quality and increasing probability of mortality. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cervid damage on silver birch by simulating browsing of different timing, duration, and intensity in a randomized block experiment established in southern Sweden. The treatments represented winter and summer browsing for timing, repeated applications for duration, and varying levels of biomass removal for intensity. After three growing seasons, survival rates were high (89.6-95.6%) with no significant differences among treatments. Mean annual height growth and ground-level diameter growth were 69.01 cm yr-(1) and 9.94 mm yr-(1), respectively. The effects of the simulated browsing treatments on growth outcomes were small and not statistically significant, however, the effect on quality was significant. Silver birch is likely to withstand light to moderate browsing due to compensatory growth. Higher browsing intensity increases the risk of lower-quality stems, potentially reducing the commercial timber quality of future merchantable trees. These results highlight the necessity of targeted management strategies to reduce quality losses in birch regeneration efforts under browsing pressure.

AB  - Tropical forests experience high levels of anthropogenic pressure from human activities for the collection of forest products, hunting, and movement of domestic animals that affect circadian temporal activity patterns of mammals. Areas with different protection statuses might show differences in mammal circadian activity because of variation in human use intensity. In this study, we assess if human activity could be a predictor shaping the mammal circadian activity patterns in the Eastern Ghats, a neglected tropical forest landscape in India that experiences high human activity. We present results from camera trap surveys of mammal circadian temporal activity patterns in Papikonda National Park (PNP) and its buffer in the Northern Eastern Ghats hill region. We observed a high overlap between human and mammal activity patterns, particularly with herbivorous species. Mammals displayed high crepuscular activity, particularly herbivores; carnivores, however, were also active during the day. This study provides the first insights on circadian temporal activity patterns of mammals in a protected area and its buffer in India's poorly known Eastern Ghats. We discuss these findings in the context of hunting pressure by humans, protection status, and its implications for mammal behavior in the Eastern Ghats and tropical forests across India. Abstract in Telugu is available with online material.

AB  - Kisspeptin is a major regulator of gonadotropin secretion in pigs. Previously, CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of KISS1 was used to develop a mosaic parental line of pigs to generate offspring that would not need castration due to loss of kisspeptin. The current goal was to characterize growth and reproductive development of F1 pigs from this parental line. Body weights, gonadotropin concentrations and gonadal development were measured from birth through development (boars to 220 days of age, n = 42; gilts to 160 days of age, n = 36). Testosterone, skatole, and androstenone were also measured in boars. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture for quantification of serum hormones, gonadal tissues were collected for gross morphology and histology, and a fat biopsy was collected (boars) for skatole and androstenone analysis. Body weight did not differ with genotype. There were no differences between KISS1(+/+) and heterozygote KISS1(+/-) animals for most parameters measured. Gonadotropin concentrations were reduced in KISS1(-/-) boars and gilts compared with KISS1(+/+) and KISS1(+/-) animals (P < 0.05). Concentrations of testosterone in serum and both androstenone and skatole in adipose were less in KISS1(-/-) boars than in KISS1(+/+) and KISS1(+/-) boars (P < 0.05). Hypogonadism was present in all KISS1(-/-) gilts and boars. These data indicate that knocking out KISS1 causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism but does not negatively affect growth in pigs. Only one KISS1 allele is needed for normal gonadotropin secretion and gonadal development, and accumulation of compounds in adipose leading to boar taint.

AB  - Striking networks of livestock tracks are commonplace in hilly rangelands throughout the world. Formed largely through biogenic processes, they transform micro-topography, soil properties, vegetation distribution, and forage behaviors of livestock, and have significant implications to hydrological and biogeochemical processes and livestock forage efficiency. The conventional conceptual model suggests that the network of livestock tracks is consisted of parallel and conjunctive tracks, with parallel tracks nearly parallel to the contour and connected by shorter, inclined conjunctive tracks. This conventional model of network of livestock tracks captures the most salient characteristics for some of the networks but not the full range of structural variations and possible mechanisms. We quantified goat track networks, which disconform to the conventional model, using a multi-parallel structure and proposed a generalized conceptual model of livestock track network. Livestock track networks consist of multiple groups of parallel tracks and the key properties of networks, scale and geometric complexity, are functions of animal body size as well as landscape heterogeneity. Network scale increases and geometric complexity decreases with body size, and geometric complexity increases with landscape heterogeneity. The generalized conceptual model can serve as a unifying framework for studies of various livestock track networks and potential mechanisms. It can also facilitate effective characterization of livestock track networks, monitoring of their structural changes, and assessment of policy implications to ecosystem services in hilly rangelands throughout the world.

AB  - Pest management based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-specific mutations is an effective and environmentally safer strategy to suppress the pest population. However, the potential of this approach is yet to be tested on many important agricultural pests such as Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a fit candidate for area-wide pest management. Therefore, in the present study, 2 spermatogenesis-related genes viz. Testis-specific zinc finger protein (topi) and Testis-specific serine protein kinase 1 (Tssk1) of B. dorsalis were edited to impart male sterility and its impact on further progeny. In this regard, topi and Tssk1 mutant populations deposited significantly fewer eggs per day (6.12 +/- 0.36 and 3.60 +/- 0.24, respectively) as compared to the control (11.16 +/- 0.58 eggs per day). About the hatching rate, the above trend was observed, topi (44.51) and Tssk1 (30.04) as compared to the control (73.96). Furthermore, the total number of viable offspring for topi and Tssk1 populations decreased as a result of the cumulative progeny production ten days after the post-mating phase. It suggests that topi and Tssk1 from B. dorsalis could be potential targets for imparting male sterility in B. dorsalis.

AB  - Behavioural syndromes theory predicts animals will exhibit sets of correlated risk-taking behaviours, with individuals displaying a constant willingness to take risks across different situations. Because this phenomenon has mostly been investigated under artificial experimental conditions, we aimed to establish whether wild animals spontaneously exhibit correlated risk-taking behaviours. We merged a large data set of spatial positions from 43 wild boar, Sus scrofa, with the spatial distribution of risks, modelling their risk-induced resource selection. Elaborating these data by means of a resource selection analysis (step selection functions) and focusing only on periods when individuals were active represents an innovative approach to the study of spontaneous risk-taking behaviour exhibited across different situations. We sampled wild boar from two populations in southern Europe living in extremely different environmental conditions (mountainous versus Mediterranean area). We used model coefficients and parameters as quantitative measures of four different risk-taking behaviours (human avoidance, site fidelity, selection for covered habitat and mobility), for both the population and the individual level. A risk-taking syndrome was detected within both populations, with wild boar clustering in two groups sharing homogeneous sets of risk-taking behaviours. Contrary to the theoretical expectation which predicted individual use of consistent strategies, we observed a compensation among pairs of risk-taking behaviours, with individuals that could be considered risk avoiders on account of strong site fidelity and human avoidance being risk prone in terms of a low selection for covered habitats and a high mobility. Our results suggest that wild animals may adaptively exhibit strategies trading off different risk-taking behaviours. The similarities of risk-taking strategies in the two monitored populations suggested that the observed syndrome was not shaped by biotic or abiotic factors, but rather unintentionally caused by humans.(c) 2022 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB  - Zonation patterns and the structure of intertidal communities are controlled by tidal conditions. Algal diversity, abundance and succession were experimentally tested under different degrees of wave exposure, shore level, and season of clearing at the intertidal zone, Phuket, Thailand. Dead coral patches colonized by algae (20 cm x 20 cm) were cleared at upper, middle, and lower shore levels on sheltered and semi-exposed shores during both the dry and rainy seasons. Of 17 algal species, including eight Rhodophyta, eight Chlorophyta, and one Phaeophyceae that were recruited on the cleared plots, three species were dominant: Ulva paradoxa, Padina in the Vaughaniella stage, and Polysiphonia sphaerocarpa. Algal diversity on the semi-exposed shore was higher than on the sheltered shore. In the successional process, U. paradoxa extensively recruited and persisted longer on plots cleared at the middle shore level on the semi-exposed shores than at the other. It showed a greater abundance in the plots cleared in the rainy season than those cleared in the dry season. Ulva paradoxa persisted for around 5 to 6 months after clearing and was then replaced by the two later species, Padina in the Vaughaniella stage and P. sphaerocarpa. Ulva paradoxa settled more easily and persisted longer at the cleared plots than other algal species because of its opportunistic characteristics and a special physiological adaptation to long periods of emersion. From this study, degree of wave exposure, shore level, and season of clearing likely play important roles in algal recruitment, abundance, and succession patterns.

AB  - Prior research on baiting and feeding of wildlife found changes in habitat and the concentration of wildlife on a local scale (e.g., hundreds of meters). Since changes in habitat and host density affect ticks, feeding wildlife may lead to changes in tick and tick-borne disease ecology. We quantified the effect of feeding deer on ticks and tick-borne diseases at 79 pairs of sites with and without deer feeders during May-August of 2019 and 2020. We captured 0.4 fewer adult (p<0.05) and 1.2 fewer nymphal ticks (p=0.01) at feeder sites. This effect intensified over time with one fewer tick trapped at old feeders (>= 5 years) compared to new feeders (<5 years, p<0.05). Greater daily wildlife visitation rates (p<0.001) may have allowed questing ticks to encounter hosts more readily. Most collected ticks were Amblyomma americanum (92.8%), a vector of Ehrlichia and Rickettsia pathogens, though prevalence of these pathogens did not differ (p>0.13) at a local scale. Supplemental deer feeding appears to influence ticks, possibly due to decreased tick habitat and increased wildlife use around feeders. Our findings indicate feeding does not lead to increased prevalence of Ehrlichia or Rickettsia bacteria within A. americanum locally.

AB  - Predator removal comprises one management strategy to increase the reproductive success of a prey species of concern, particularly within human-altered landscapes. The efficacy of such an approach, however, depends partly on the extent to which predation risk is additive or compensatory, which remains unknown for many systems. We experimentally reduced the local abundance of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), a primary nest predator of three sagebrush-obligate songbirds-Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri), Sagebrush Sparrow (Artemisiospiza nevadensis), and Sage Thrasher (Oreoscoptus montanus)-during May to August 2019 in western Wyoming, USA, to assess whether nest predation risk was additive or compensatory, and whether nest predator removal could comprise a potentially effective management tool. Deer mouse removal did not affect the daily nest survival of songbirds between experimental and control plots, despite a reduction of 68%-85% in deer mouse abundance within treatment areas. Therefore, nest predation in this system likely operated in a compensatory way, in which deer mice that escaped removal, new immigrants, or other species of nest predator maintained similar levels of nest predation risk regardless of the prevalence of a primary predator. We caution that predator removal may not be an effective management tool in systems that lack barriers to predator immigration or have several alternative species of predators, even when a single species typically is responsible for the majority of predation events.

AB  - The Enemy Release Hypothesis (ERH) suggests that the absence of natural enemies (herbivores, parasites, and diseases) in non-native environments allow exotic plants to allocate more resources towards growth and reproduction, resulting in increased invasiveness. This study uses the submerged macrophyte Lagarosiphon major (Ridl.) Moss ex Wager (Hydrocharitaceae), native to Southern Africa, as a case study of this hypothesis. This species is invasive in many parts of the world, including Ireland, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Here, we investigate the applicability of the ERH in explaining the invasiveness of L. major in New Zealand. This was achieved by comparing L. major biomass and cover, and plant species richness between L. major's native range in South Africa and its invaded range in New Zealand, where specialist natural enemies were presumed to be lacking. The findings revealed significantly higher L. major biomass (similar to 100 % increase), cover (similar to 28 % increase) and shoot production (similar to 91 % increase) in the invaded range compared to the native range. Additionally, overall species richness and abundance was negatively correlated with L. major abundance in the invaded range. Plants in the native range were associated with more natural enemies and experienced higher levels of damage relative to the invaded sites. Overall, these observations align with the ERH, but should be interpreted with caution as other influential factors such as competition were not measured. Nevertheless, this suggests that L. major could benefit from the integration of biological control measures with the existing methods of control. Two natural enemies, Polypedilum tuburcinatum Andersen (Diptera: Chironomidae) and Hydrellia lagarosiphon Deeming (Diptera: Ephydridae) have already been identified as promising candidates, for biological control of L. major in New Zealand and other regions invaded by this weed.

AB  - The oilseed crop winter camelina (Camelina sativa) is attracting increasing interest for biofuel production. This study assessed the climate impacts of growing camelina as an intermediate crop in northern Europe (Sweden) for the production of vegetable oil and biofuel. Climate impacts were analyzed using life cycle assessment (LCA), while impacts on biodiversity and eutrophication were discussed. Three functional units were considered: 1 ha of land use, 1 kg of oil, and 1 MJ biofuel (hydrogenated vegetable oil, HVO). The results showed that dry matter yield over the whole crop rotation was higher in the camelina crop rotation, despite the lower yield of peas due to relay cropping with camelina. In the whole camelina crop rotation, fat production more than doubled, protein and fiber production marginally increased, and the production of carbohydrates decreased. Higher climate impacts related to field operations and fertilizer use in the camelina crop rotation, with associated N2O emissions, were compensated for by increased soil carbon accumulation due to the increased return of organic matter from the additional crop in the rotation. The total climate impact was around 0.5 kg CO2 eq/kg camelina oil when macronutrient allocation was used. The global warming potential was 15 g CO2 eq/MJ HVO, or 27 g CO2 eq/MJ HVO when soil organic carbon effects were not included, representing an 84% and 71% reduction, respectively, compared with fossil fuels.

AB  - BackgroundThe geographical divergence of Chinese pigs led to various phenotypes through adaptive evolution. In particular, pigs from relatively low altitudes exhibit a positive correlation between body length and latitude. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. Identifying candidate genes associated with this body length variation is crucial for further understanding the genetic basis of adaptive traits in these Chinese pig breeds.ResultsWe assembled a high-quality genome of the Neijiang pig as benchmark and analyse 297 Chinese domestic pigs and six Chinese wild boars distributed across different latitudes. Our study provides a comprehensive assessment of genetic diversity and population structure, revealing distinct genetic backgrounds of Chinese indigenous pigs from different regions. Most importantly, we observed a strong correlation between latitude and body length, and screened out the AFF4 gene through four calculation methods. Meanwhile, gene introgression and haplotype divergence of AFF4 among low-altitude pig breeds also proved that AFF4 may be one of the driver genes affecting the adaptive evolution of pig body length. Overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed in our study and confirmed the significantly impact of AFF4 on the osteogenic differentiation process.ConclusionsThese results enrich the pig genome pool, offer a comprehensive understanding of genetic architecture for Chinese pig breeds, and shed light on the correlation between latitude and body length of adaptive evolution of Chinese pigs.

AB  - Context. Safe and effective capture methods are crucial for improving our understanding and management of many wildlife species. The adaptation of established capture methods to novel situations requires critical evaluation because differences in environmental conditions and species' susceptibility to trauma and capture myopathy can produce unexpected outcomes. Helicopter net-gunning has been a valuable tool for capturing wild deer in New Zealand and the Americas, but there are no practical records of its use in Australia and only one report of it being used to capture three fallow deer (Dama dama) elsewhere.
   Aims. The present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a helicopter-based net-gun capture technique for wild fallow deer by quantifying the efficacy of the technique and the frequency of injuries and deaths.
   Methods. We captured fallow deer over two 3-day operations at a 135 km(2) site in eastern Australia. We collected data on operational efficiency and variables expected to affect animal health and welfare, such as injuries and the duration of stressful procedures. We used GPS tracking collars with an accelerometer and a mortality-sensing function to monitor post-release survival and activity of fallow deer.
   Key results. In total, 127 deer were targeted for capture, with nets fired at 64 deer (50%) and 27 deer captured (21%). Mortality within 30 days of capture was zero. Mean chase time was 2 min 46 s and mean total time from start of chase until release was 11 min 19 s. No animals were severely injured or euthanased, but hyperthermia was observed in 33% of captured animals.
   Conclusions. Helicopter net-gunning was an effective and safe method for capturing wild fallow deer when compared with alternative methods.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict is a major cause of losses resulting from the establishment of protected areas, most of which are borne by the communities within these areas. It is therefore important to establish a compensation system for such losses. This study measures the total costs of human-wildlife conflict by surveying communities within and surrounding China's Giant Panda National Park. The results show that the primary visible costs from human-wildlife conflict, which include crop loss, livestock depredation, property damage, and human fatalities and injury, were 2185.6 Yuan ($316.9) per household. Approximately 64.9% of households were affected by this conflict in 2020. For each affected household, the average visible costs per capita was 952.6 Yuan ($138.1) or 7.2% of per capita net income. When converting well-being losses caused by human-wildlife conflict into economic costs, we consider visible costs and hidden costs (e.g., transaction, opportunity, and health costs). This study shows that human-wildlife conflict reduced per capita net income by 15.3% and significantly affected household well-being. The average cost of the well-being loss caused by human-wildlife conflict was 38.5 % of per capita net income.
