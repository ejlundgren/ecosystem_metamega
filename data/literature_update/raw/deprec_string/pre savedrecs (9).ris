AB  - The Upper Guinea Forest (UGF; West Africa), a global biodiversity hotspot, has lost more than 90% of its original area since 1900, threatening endemic species such as the endangered pygmy hippopotamus (Choeropsis liberiensis). However, little is known about the proximate causes of this deforestation. We classified Sentinel-2 data using the random forest algorithm to differentiate between three main human processes (shifting agriculture, intensive agriculture or urban expansion) driving deforestation between 2000 and 2019 across the pygmy hippopotamus distribution area. Out of c. 89 600 km(2) in the year 2000, 15 900 km2 (17%) of forest were lost, primarily to shifting agriculture (14 900 km2). C & ocirc;te d'Ivoire and Liberia accounted for 14 900 km(2 )(94%) of the net area of forest lost, c. 15 times greater than deforestation in Sierra Leone and Guinea combined (953 km(2)). Forest loss inside protected areas is pervasive, and it is essential to prioritize conservation efforts in areas where deforestation is still low (e.g., Ta & iuml;, Sapo and Gola Rainforest national parks). We suggest that the preservation of the UGF will face challenges associated with people's demand for food and income. Continued landscape-scale planning and action to reduce deforestation are urgently needed to limit the impact of shifting agriculture on pygmy hippopotamus habitat.

AB  - Adaptation to environmental heterogeneity is a key driver of between-population genomic differentiation, yet we know very little about how genomic divergence is affected by adaptation to multiple ecological factors. Using an experimental evolution approach, we whole-genome re-sequenced 'fast-cycling' Brassica rapa plants which had evolved during eight generations of selection from different combinations of soil type, aphid herbivore presence or absence, and either bee- or hand pollination. Our results show that bumblebee pollination was the strongest driver of genomic divergence and that the degree of genomic divergence was strongly associated with the number of SNP markers identified in genomic selection scans. Furthermore, we found that the number of SNPs under selection was affected by herbivory in a soil-dependent way. More specifically, aphid herbivory was associated with an increased number of selected SNPs for bee-pollinated plants that evolved in tuff soil but was associated with a decreased number of selected SNPs for bee-pollinated plants that evolved in the more resource-limiting limestone soil. We also found that a higher number of selected SNPs was associated with higher rates of phenotypic evolution for 27 phenotypic traits including morphology and scent. Finally, we found that variation in pleiotropy between treatments was related to both the degree of genomic divergence and the number of SNPs under selection. Our results demonstrate that different soil types promote unique adaptive genomic architectures in response to biotic interactions, thus increasing genomic divergence between plant populations.

T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY

KW  - FRUIT
AB  - Rates of seed dispersal have rarely been considered important. Here, we demonstrate through field observations and experiments that rapid dispersal is essential for the unusually short-lived seeds of Aquilaria sinensis (agarwood; Thymelaeaceae), which desiccate and die within hours of exposure by fruit dehiscence in the hot, dry forest canopy in tropical southwest China. We show that three species of Vespa hornets remove most seeds within minutes of exposure. The hornets consume only the fleshy elaiosomes and deposit most seeds in damp shade, where they can germinate, a mean of 166 m from the parent tree. Electrophysiological assays and field experiments demonstrate that the hornets are attracted by highly volatile short-carbon-chain (C5-C9) compounds, including aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, and acids, emitted from the dehiscent fruit capsule. These attractive fruit volatiles share 14 of 17 major electrophysiologically active compounds with those emitted from herbivore-damaged leaves, which attract predators, including hornets. Rapid seed dispersal thus appears to have been achieved in this species by the re-purposing of a rapid indirect defense mechanism. We predict that rapid seed dispersal by various mechanisms will be more widespread than currently documented and suggest that volatile attractants are more effective in facilitating this than visual signals, which are blocked by vegetation.

AB  - Effective, practical options for managing disease in wildlife populations are limited, especially after diseases become established. Removal strategies (e.g., hunting or culling) are used to control wildlife diseases across a wide range of systems, despite conflicting evidence of their effectiveness. This is especially true for chronic wasting disease (CWD), an untreatable, fatal prion disease threatening cervid populations across multiple countries, for which recreational harvest has been suggested as an important disease control strategy. Using observational data to evaluate whether harvest effectively limits CWD prevalence has been difficult because statistical relationships between harvest and disease prevalence can arise from a causal effect of harvest (i.e., harvest's impacts on prevalence via changes in transmission or demographic structure) or from a number of alternative mechanisms. For instance, correlations between harvest and disease prevalence can also be driven by disease's impacts on population size and harvest (i.e., reverse causality) or from confounding variables (e.g., habitat or geographic location) that impact both harvest rates and disease prevalence. We analyzed two decades of surveillance data (2000-2021) from 10 mule deer herds in Wyoming, using statistical approaches informed by causal inference theory, to test for the effects of harvest on CWD prevalence. Herds with consistently high harvest pressure across 20 years had significantly lower prevalence. Our models predicted that harvesting 40% of adult males per year across 20 years would maintain prevalence below 5% on average, whereas if only 20% of males were harvested in each year, prevalence would increase to >30% by year 20. Moreover, shifting the relative harvest pressure within a herd over a shorter period (3 years) reduced subsequent prevalence, albeit to a smaller degree. Although high harvest is unlikely to completely eradicate CWD, our analysis suggests that maintaining hunting pressure on adult males is an important tactic for slowing CWD epidemics within mule deer herds. Our study also provides guidance for future analyses of longitudinal surveillance data, including the importance of demographic data and appropriate time lags.

AB  - The effects of anthropogenic sources of light on the circadian biology of marine animals are largely unexplored at the molecular and cellular level. Given that light is a major driver of circadian rhythms at the behavioral, physiological, cellular, and even molecular levels, it is important to consider the effects that anthropogenic light, especially at night, has on aquatic species. With the expanding data generated from circadian clock research, it is surprising that these techniques have not been applied more frequently to better understand how artificial light affects animal circadian rhythms. Circadian research has been limited to behavioral and physiological observations in wild marine animals rather than a cellular and molecular understanding due to the logistical constraints. While there are some benefits to using artificial light at night (ALAN), there have also been many studies reporting physiological and behavioral consequences in response to exposure to ALAN. Here, the benefits and consequences of using ALAN in the marine environment are reviewed. Furthermore, perspectives on research limitations and future research directions are discussed. Taken together, this is an important area in which more information is required to translate our understanding of circadian biology into better practices to promote the health and welfare of marine animals.

AB  - Background and Aims: Extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) are secretory glands of an aqueous solution composed mainly of sugars, amino acids and lipids, frequently used as food resource by ants, which tend to protect their host plants against herbivorous insects. Although the Amazon forest is recognized worldwide for its high plant diversity, few studies have been carried out in the region that characterize the different morphotypes of EFNs. In this context, our main aim was to perform a brief morphological description of EFNs in the Brazilian Amazonian rainforest. Methods: We established a plot of 6250 m2 in ten forest fragments situated in the state of Acre, Brazilian Amazon. In these plots, we performed intensive field surveys to locate EFN-bearing plant species. Subsequently, we used scanning electron microscopy images to morphologically characterize the EFNs. The morphological descriptions included information about the life form of EFN-bearing plant species, morphotypes of EFNs and their location in different plant structures. Key results: We morphologically characterized 67 EFN-bearing plant species, distributed in 28 genera and 19 families. The botanical families with the highest taxonomic representativeness were Fabaceae, Bignoniaceae and Malpighiaceae. Lianas were the life form with the largest number of EFN-bearing plant species, while elevated EFNs were the most frequent morphotype. Conclusions: The high frequency of elevated EFNs evidences the importance of the ant defense system against herbivory in these Brazilian Amazonian forests, since it has been documented in others works that this morphotype secretes a larger nectar volume, which is an advantage in relation to the attraction potential. Finally, our results indicate the existence of a high diversity of EFN-bearing plant species in this region of the Brazilian Amazon, and an important morphological diversity of associated extrafloral nectaries.

AB  - Climate change has worsened water salinization and acidification, creating challenges for animal health and productivity. This study assessed the resilience of indigenous sheep and goats that drink naturally saline water from Lake Basaka, focusing on their physiological and biochemical responses as stress indicators under pastoral system conditions. A cross-sectional study was conducted with a random systematic sample of 260 healthy local adult sheep and goats from 50 households for this study. The current finding revealed that physicochemical analysis of Lake Basaka water showed high salinity, with electrical conductivity at 3,992.53 mu S/cm and sodium levels at 1,180.69 mg/L, significantly higher than those in freshwater (641.53 mu S/cm and 35.28 mg/L, respectively; p < 0.05). The physiological data indicated that goats and sheep drinking saline water had higher rectal temperatures (39.3 degrees C vs. 39.1 degrees C; p < 0.05) and pulse rates (85.1 vs. 83.2 beats/min; p < 0.05) compared to animals drinking freshwater. Hematologic results revealed elevated hemoglobin levels (13.74 g/dL vs. 9.48 g/dL; p < 0.05) and red blood cell counts (11.51 x 10(6)/mu L vs. 9.28 x 10(6)/mu L; p < 0.05) in animals consuming saline water. Biochemical profiles showed decreased glucose (60.07 mg/dL vs. 71.33 mg/dL; p < 0.05) and cholesterol levels (54.13 mg/dL vs. 64.93 mg/dL; p < 0.05), along with increased urea (75.18 mg/dL vs. 68.96 mg/dL; p < 0.05) and creatinine (3.48 mg/dL vs. 2.68 mg/dL; p < 0.05). Although physiological and blood parameters were higher in the saline water group, most values remained within normal ranges, indicating the animals' adaptive capacity. However, prolonged exposure to saline water may impact their long-term productivity and health. The study recommends further research on seasonal changes, interspecies resilience, and sustainable water management strategies to enhance livestock resilience and productivity in dryland regions.

AB  - Simple Summary Monitoring vital rates allows managers to estimate trends in growth rates of ungulate populations, but connecting the influence of nutrition on ungulate demography is challenging. Internal and external factors are likely to influence neonate survival and recruitment. We found that nitrogen available to adult female pronghorn during early lactation had the greatest influence on fawn summer survival (recruitment). Pronghorn management, where fecal sampling is utilized, should be conducted at the subpopulation level and have baseline fecal nitrogen measures taken. Subpopulations with low recruitment can be positively influenced by increasing nitrogen, or protein, available to them during the early lactation period.Abstract Monitoring vital rates allows managers to estimate trends in growth rates of ungulate populations. However, connecting the influence of nutrition on ungulate demography is challenging. Noninvasive sampling offers a low-cost, low-effort alternative for measuring nutritional indices, allowing for an increased understanding of the mechanistic relationships between environmental factors, nutrition, and specific population vital rates. We examined the temporal influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) fawn recruitment. We collected fresh fecal samples from adult female pronghorn in five subpopulations spanning three sampling periods associated with critical maternal life-history stages (late gestation, early lactation, breeding season) for 2 years to investigate both intra- and interannual influences. Intrinsic factors were fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs), nutritional indices (fecal nitrogen (FN) and 2,6-diaminopimelic acid (DAPA)), and dietary composition (protein intake of forbs, graminoids, legumes, other, shrubs), while the extrinsic factor was vegetative greenness (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)). We found variations in DAPA, protein intake of forbs, variation in forb protein intake, and protein intake of legumes during late gestation positively influenced fawn recruitment. Fecal nitrogen during early lactation showed the strongest positive influence on the recruitment of any measured parameter. Finally, breeding season NDVI and the variation in DAPA values positively influenced the subsequent year's fawn recruitment. Our longitudinal study enabled us to investigate which parameter was most important to specific periods of fawn development and recruitment. We combined the results across five subpopulations, but interpretation and subsequent management decisions should be made at the subpopulation level such that pronghorn subpopulations with low recruitment can be positively influenced by increasing nitrogen on the landscape available to adult females during the early lactation period. As the use of noninvasive monitoring methods continues to expand, we believe our methodologies and results can be broadly applied to other ungulate monitoring programs.

AB  - BackgroundMovement links the distribution of habitats with the social environment of animals using those habitats. Despite the links between movement, habitat selection, and socioecology, their integration remains a challenge due to lack of shared vocabulary across fields, methodological gaps, and the implicit (rather than explicit) historical development of theory in the fields of social and spatial ecology. Given these challenges can be addressed, opportunity for further study will provide insight about the links between social, spatial, and movement ecology. Here, our objective was to disentangle the roles of habitat selection and social association as drivers of movement in caribou (Rangifer tarandus).MethodsTo accomplish our objective, we modelled the relationship between collective movement and selection of foraging habitats using socially informed integrated step selection function (iSSF). Using iSSF, we modelled the effect of social processes, i.e., nearest neighbour distance and social preference, and movement behaviour on patterns of habitat selection.ResultsBy unifying social network analysis with iSSF, we identified movement-dependent social association, where individuals took shorter steps in lichen habitat and foraged in close proximity to more familiar individuals.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that social preference is context-dependent based on habitat selection and foraging behaviour. We therefore surmise that habitat selection and social association are drivers of collective movement, such that movement is the glue between habitat selection and social association. Here, we put these concepts into practice to demonstrate that movement is the glue connecting individual habitat selection to the social environment.

AB  - Potato crop management can have substantial impacts on soil health, particularly through practices such as intensive tillage and short crop rotations. This study investigated the impacts of different management practices on soil microbial communities, including rotation length, non-grain rotation crops, green manures, compost amendments, and a soil fumigant using two potato varieties, 'Caribou Russet' and 'Russet Burbank'. Bacterial and fungal communities were characterized from soil samples using amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) of the 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer rDNA regions, respectively. Initially, no significant differences were detected between microbial communities; however, after 4 years, significant differences were found. Overall, fungi demonstrated greater sensitivity to management practices than bacteria, with fumigation and compost amendment having the largest impacts on microbial communities. Fumigation resulted in a decrease in the abundance of certain fungal groups, particularly saprotrophs or unidentified fungi. Alternatively, the two largest groups of fungi more abundant in fumigated soils were saprotrophs or plant pathogens. Compost amendment led to substantial increases in fungal diversity, with over 3.5 times more differentially abundant fungal ASVs identified compared with soils without compost. Within these more abundant fungal ASVs in compost-amended soils, plant pathogens made up only 4%, whereas in soils without compost, plant pathogens made up 25% of the most abundant ASVs. In general, compost appeared to positively impact soil microbial communities, and fumigation appeared to negatively impact them. The results of this study could aid farmers in crop management decisions that improve soil health, reduce disease, and increase yields.Copyright (c) 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Bananas and plantains are major commodity/food crops that represent an important habitat for earthworms, although so far, no review is available on earthworm communities associated with banana/plantain crops worldwide. The Vale do Ribeira region is among the largest banana producing areas in Brazil, but little is known of the earthworms living there. Hence, the present study assessed earthworm populations and species in three banana plantations and adjacent Atlantic forest fragments along the Ribeira de Iguape River using standard (hand sorting) methodologies. Furthermore, we review earthworm populations reported in banana/plantain plantations worldwide. Only two species (Pontoscolex corethrurus, Amynthas gracilis) belonging to two families (Rhinodrilidae, Megascolecidae) were found in the Ribeira River valley, occurring concurrently. Abundance was low (< 13 indiv. m(-2)) compared with other banana plantations worldwide, that frequently surpassed 100 indiv. m(-2). More than 70 studies reported earthworms from >200 banana plantations in 28 countries, and mean species richness was 2.7 per site, ranging from 1 to 10 species. Exotics predominated in most sites and P. corethrurus was the most prevalent species encountered. Overall, more than 104 species from 10 families were reported, with around 61 native and 43 exotic widespread species, mainly of the Megascolecidae, Lumbricidae and Acanthodrilidae families. Richness was highest in India (27 spp.) and the Canary Islands (25 spp.), but native species dominated only in a few countries and sites, while exotics were prevalent especially in island countries and Brazil. Lower-input practices appear to be important for earthworm communities and banana plantations can have large earthworm populations in some cases, which may be contributing to soil processes and plant production, topics that deserve further attention. However, many important banana-producing countries have not yet been evaluated, so further work is warranted, both in terms of applied ecology and biodiversity.

AB  - We examined the evolution of wild pig (Sus scrofa) elimination efforts in Missouri, USA, to identify governance and management strategies that may be applicable in other contexts. In 2023, we interviewed 37 individuals from 15 agencies and organizations in Missouri to describe Missouri's path towards wild pig elimination, including the coalitions, policies, and collaborative structures foundational to control efforts, and identify the key management strategies and methods central to progress. Study methods also encompassed observation and document analysis, and data indicated that the adoption of a broad partnership and implementation of a unified Incident Command System enhanced wild pig control efforts by facilitating collaborative decision-making and coordination across multiple organizations. Furthermore, several management practices emerged as instrumental in advancing elimination efforts. Management actions included systematic baiting, the employment of full-time trapping professionals and University Extension outreach specialists, the establishment of a centralized hotline for reporting wild pig sightings and damage, integration of drone and helicopter operations, and the development of a program to provide private landowners free access to damage mitigation tools. Our study highlights the practices contributing to Missouri's pursuit of wild pig elimination and suggests their potential transferability to other situations where wild pig population control is a management priority.

AB  - Several cover crops (CCs) exert allelopathic effects that suppress weed growth. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of aqueous extracts containing different concentrations [0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10% (w/v)] of Brassicaceae CCs (Sinapis alba, Raphanus sativus, Camellina sativa) and of the CCs Fagopyrum esculentum and Guizotia abyssinica on germination and early growth of Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. The allelopathic effects were species and concentration-dependent. C. sativa, for example, caused the greatest potential to inhibit germination, shoot, radicle length and fresh seedling weight, whereas S. alba and R. sativus inhibited germination and early growth of A. artemisiifolia only at concentrations >= 7.5%. In contrast, no inhibition was observed when aqueous extracts of F. escultneum and G. abyssinica were added at any of tested concentration. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detected 15 phenolic compounds in Brassicaceae CCs with the highest content (mu g/g) of vanillin (48.8), chlorogenic acid (1057), vanilic acid (79), caffeic acid (102.5) and syringic acid (27.3) in C. sativa. Our results suggest that C. sativa is the most allelopathic CCs and that the fruits of C. sativa are the plant organs richest in allelochemicals.

AB  - It is widely accepted that predators disproportionately prey on individuals that are old, weak, diseased or injured. By selectively removing individuals with diseases, predators may play an important role in regulating the overall health of prey populations. However, that idea is seldom tested empirically. Here we assess the extent that wolves (Canis lupus) select adult moose (Alces alces) in Isle Royale National Park on the basis of age-class and osteoarthritis, a chronic, non-communicable disease. We also assess how temporal variation in kill rates (on moose by wolves) were associated with the subsequent incidence of osteoarthritis in the moose population over a 33-year period (1975-2007). Wolves showed strong selection for senescent moose and tended to avoid prime-aged adults. However, the presence of severe osteoarthritis, but not mild or moderate osteoarthritis, appeared to increase the vulnerability of prime-aged moose to predation. There was weak evidence to suggest that senescent moose with osteoarthritis maybe more vulnerable to wolves, compared to senescent moose without the disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis declined following years with higher kill rates-which is plausibly due to the selective removal of individuals with osteoarthritis. Together those results suggest that selective predation plays an important role in regulating the health of prey populations. Additionally, because osteoarthritis is influenced by genetic factors, these results highlight how wolf predation may act as a selective force against genes associated with developing severe osteoarthritis as a prime-aged adult. Our findings highlight one benefits of allowing predators to naturally regulate prey populations. The evidence we present for predation's influence on the health of prey populations is also relevant for policy-related arguments about refraining from intensively hunting wolf populations.

AB  - Coastal human populations have increased interactions between humans and wildlife, often documented through social media. During an avian influenza outbreak, the stranding of marine birds and mammals in Peru and Chile provided an opportunity to assess human-sea lion interactions reported online, a particularly concerning situation due to the risk of zoonotic transmission to humans. The objectives of this study were (a) to classify human-sea lion interactions, (b) to identify latitudinal distribution patterns of stranded sea lions, and (c) to identify associations between strandings and sea surface temperature, human population density, and the distance between strandings and sea lion colonies. We analyzed videos and photos posted on X, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok between November 2022 and February 2024. A total of 311 stranded sea lions were reported in 225 posts from Peru (69% and 71%) and Chile (31% and 29%). The most common interaction was human approach (74% of all interactions). Strandings were more abundant in Lima (12 degrees S, Peru), which is densely populated and visited by tourists. In Chile, strandings were mainly distributed in Antofagasta (23 degrees S). This study is the first assessment of human harassment of stranded pinnipeds in Latin America. It highlights that Chile has a legal framework to reduce the harassment of marine megafauna, and Peru is developing its own regulations. Understanding these interactions and their geographical distribution is essential to support government agencies in targeting enforcement, monitoring, and educational efforts.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the true seroprevalence of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in dairy cattle from Pakistan at the animal and herd-level. We tested 1380 dairy cattle from 451 herds and 92 water buffalo. The sera were tested by ELISA and the results were analyzed using Bayesian inference. The median posterior estimate of the herd level true BLV prevalence was 1.4%, with a 95% credible interval (CI) 0.7-3.1, whereas the median posterior estimate of the within-farm true seroprevalence was 3.8% with a 95% CI 2.8-4.8. All 92 sera collected from water buffalo were negative. Several risk factors potentially associated with seropositivity to BLV infections in Pakistan were analyzed using logistic regression model based on calculation of an odds ratio (OR). The study showed an association between seropositivity and medium herd (>= 50) size (OR = 23.57, 95% CI: 3.01-103.48). Common housing of indigenous cattle with exotic-breed cattle (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 06-2.35) or housing indigenous or their crossbred cattle with exotic-breed cattle (OR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.14-3.01) had no effect on the BLV seroprevalence. Similarly, common housing of cattle and water buffalo was not risk factor for increased BLV seropositivity (OR = 27.10, 95% CI: 0.63-119.34).

AB  - Human fatalities and injury from wildlife attacks often result in a negative attitude toward conservation. This research was undertaken to investigate the patterns and conflict-causing factors of human killing and injury by large mammals, especially by Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), common leopard (Panthera pardus), and Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) in the Bardia-Banke Complex of western Nepal. We collected human death and injury records caused by wildlife in the Bardia-Banke Complex between 2019 and 2023, based on relief applications submitted by the victim's family. Additionally, camera trap monitoring was conducted following incidents of human-tiger and human-leopard conflicts. A total of 76 incidents involving human casualties and injuries were considered for analysis. Incidents of livestock depredation, crop raiding, and property damage were excluded from the analysis. Most of the attacks on humans were caused by tigers (75%), followed by elephants (16%) and leopards (9%). Almost all incidents occurred in daytime (97%). The highest number of conflicts were recorded in 2021, with 20 incidents. Most of the cases (84%) occurred within 1 km of forest edge. Khata corridor and the western side of the Bardia National Park, i.e., Karnali River corridor, were identified as high-conflict areas. The primary causes of the conflict manifested in cattle grazing (28%), grass cutting (28%), firewood collection (11%), fishing (8%), vegetable collection (5%), sand collection (4%), during rescuing friends (3%), grazing captive elephants (3%), highway rides (3%), sleeping in Chaupadi Goth (3%), walking nearby forest areas (3%), playing nearby forest areas (1%), while feeding pig (1%), and working in agricultural lands (1%). To promote human-wildlife coexistence, community-based patrols (33%), habitat restoration (26%), electric fencing (26%), and insurance (7%) were identified as the preferred strategies. Therefore, we recommend that stakeholders and concerned bodies increase awareness among local community about the use of forest resources, wildlife behavior, and human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies.
   This research investigates the patterns and conflict-causing factors related to human fatalities and injuries caused by large mammals in the Bardia-Banke Complex of western Nepal.image

AB  - We performed an analysis of data on direct observations of wolves and their traces carried out by forest service employees, hunters, naturalists and local residents in areas supervised by eight Regional Directorates of State Forests (RDSFs) and in two National Parks located in Western Poland. The study area covered a major part of Western Poland, with the exception of RDSFs in Toru & nacute; and & Lstrok;& oacute;d & zacute;. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and location of direct observations of wolves and their traces. Additionally, all reports on the prey of this predator were analysed. A mobile application was used to collect the following information: the date and time of observations, the location of observations with geographical coordinates, the number of wolves encountered during the direct observations of these animals and their tracks, wolf breeding sites, wolf prey, and vocalizations. A short description of the observations and photographic docu-mentation were included in the analysis as well. In total, 5664 records on the occurrence of wolves were collected in 2019-2022. The most abundant information about these animals was collected in the autumn-winter months, whereas a significantly lower number of data was recorded in the summer period. Single wolves were observed most frequently, followed by wolf pairs. The average number of individuals in a family group was 3.22, with 3.34, 2.98, 3.25, and 3.32 observed in the respective study years. Wolf packs composed of at least three individuals accounted for only 20.8% of the direct observations. Wolves and their traces were found in each Regional Directorate of State Forests and the two National Parks. The greatest number of records was reported from RDSFs in Szczecinek, Gda & nacute;sk, and Katowice, while the lowest number was found in RDSF in Zielona G & oacute;ra. The distribution of wolves coincided with the presence of large forest complexes. These animals and their tracks were observed more frequently in counties with large forest cover and less often in counties with high population density. The study indicated that not all habitats typical for this species were occupied during the recolonization process. The reports have also shown that red deer (58%) and roe deer (23%) were the most common wolf prey, whereas livestock (6%), fallow deer (6%), and wild boars (5%) were attacked by wolves less frequently. The analysis of the data has indicated that wolves still occupy areas with the largest forest cover but are only occasionally encountered in less favourable environments. The majority of the records reported the presence of single wolves that may have been non-res-ident individuals or members of wolf packs searching for prey animals alone, especially in spring and summer.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVC) strongly impact road safety. While technical aspects of collision risk and the effects of roads on animal populations are well studied, knowledge about wildlife behaviour prior to and during contact with oncoming vehicles as a crucial aspect of collision risk is still lacking. We analysed 28,400 hours of video data (thermal network cameras at 14 road sections in south-west Germany) with 2,841 animal-vehicle encounters (1,960 roe deer, Capreolus capreolus, 696 red fox, Vulpes vulpes and 185 wild boar, Sus scrofa) and classified animal behaviour before and during contact with a vehicle. We fitted two sets of models to the data. In the first step, we modelled the intensity of the behavioural reaction exhibited by the animals as a function of behavioural and environmental predictors using ordinal Bayesian mixed-effect regression models. In a second step, we modelled the probability of a positive vs. a negative behavioural response in terms of WVC risk using binomial mixed-effect regression models. Both the intensity of behavioural reactions as well as the degree of risk during the interaction with oncoming vehicles differed among the species and as a function of road section layout. Our results showed that animal attentiveness, the behaviour a priori, access to cover, vehicle type and biological seasonality were important predictors of an animal's response to oncoming vehicles. More specifically, roe deer reacted to oncoming vehicles mostly with short movements away from the road, foxes often reacted unpredictably and wild boar behaviour appeared to be least affected by oncoming vehicles. Thus, we suggest that collision risk for common European mammals is shaped by the interplay of vehicle type, the road layout as well as the species-specific behavioural repertoire including the attentiveness of the animal and the behavioural state prior to an approaching vehicle. In addition, wildlife warning reflectors, a frequently used technique in WVC mitigation, did not alter behavioural reactions and thus failed to reduce WVC risk.

AB  - Fecal waste is a significant source of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pollution and provides valuable insights into the AMR development in animal and human populations within the "One health" framework. Various genetic elements, including antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), biocide and metal resistance genes (BMGs), mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and virulence factor genes (VFGs), are crucial AMR risk determinants (ARDs). However, few studies focused on compositional characteristics of ARDs in different feces. Here, we analyzed 753 public metagenomes from human, pig, chicken, and cattle feces, revealing significant differences in ARD richness and abundance across fecal types, notably lowest in cattle samples. Tetracycline, multi-metal, and-biocide resistance genes were dominant resistome. A few core genes contributed to 25.6%-91.1% of gene abundance, and their correlations were stronger in cattle samples. Procrustes analysis showed that microbial composition had higher correlations with ARGs (M2 = 0.579) and BMGs (M2 = 0.519). Gammaproteobacteria was identified as major ARD-hosts especially in human and pig feces, and they mainly carried multi-resistance genes. MGEs exhibited direct positive effects on ARGs and BMGs, indirectly impacting VFGs. Utilizing random forest methods, we identified 42 indicator genes for tracking AMR pollution originating from fecal sources in the environments. This study offers new insights into understanding and controlling the AMR pollution of fecal waste from human and food animals.

AB  - Inoculation with microorganisms is an effective strategy for improving traditional composting processes. This study explored the effects of inoculation with lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms (LDM) on the degradation of organic matter (OM), methane (CH4) emissions, and the microbial community (bacteria and methanogens) during composting. The results showed that LDM accelerated the degradation of OM (including the lignocellulose fraction) and increased the CH4 releases in the later thermophilic and cooling stages during composting. At the ending of composting, LDM increased the CH4 emissions by 38.6% compared with the control. Moreover, LDM significantly increased the abundances of members of the bacterial and methanogenic community during the later thermophilic period (P < 0.05). In addition, LDM promoted the growth and activity of major bacterial genera (e.g., Ureibacillus) with the ability to degrade macromolecular OM, as well as affecting key methanogens (e.g., Methanocorpusculum) in the composting system. Network analysis and variance partitioning analysis indicated that OM and temperature were the main factors that affected the bacterial and methanogen community structures. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that the higher CH4 emissions under LDM were related to the growth of methanogens, which was facilitated by the anaerobic environment produced by large amounts of CO2. Thus, aerobic conditions should be improved during the end of the thermophilic and cooling composting period when inoculating with lignocellulose-degrading microorganisms in order to reduce CH4 emissions.

AB  - In this study, several composting strategies such as the use of semipermeable geotextile covers and biochar as an additive were investigated to improve olive mill wastewater (OMW) biodegradability and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during industrial-scale composting. In addition, the final characteristics of the compost obtained and its marketable value were also assessed. For this purpose, four different co-composting mixtures were prepared with OMW as the main ingredient, and two types of manure (cattle and goat manure) and bulking agents (almond pruning and vineyard pruning waste) as N and C sources. The results showed that exothermic behavior and biodegradability were more influenced by the co-composting strategy. The use of biochar as an additive showed a reduction in N losses (-14%) via GHG emissions and a significant improvement in cation exchange capacity (+35%) or the content of humic substances (+10%) in the final product. Lastly, the use of a geotextile cover was shown to be the worst cost-effective strategy, as it did not improve compost quality and showed no effect on GHG emissions.

AB  - Simple Summary Stable isotope analysis is a technique increasingly used for studying many aspects of wildlife behaviour, such as diet, migrations, and trophic relationships. However, scarce information is available on how isotopes are assimilated into the body under conditions such as nutritional stress situations or intrasexual competition for mates. In this study, we evaluated how intrasexual competition between male red deer from free-ranging populations in Andalusia (Spain) is reflected in the ratio of stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen (& delta;C-13 and & delta;N-15) in faeces. Our results showed that in populations with high intrasexual competition & delta;N-15 values in faeces were significantly lower than in low intrasexual competition populations. No differences were found for & delta;C-13. This study provides a basis for interpreting & delta;N-15 values related to different protein usage under various nutritional stress situations in male red deer and novel applications of the use of nitrogen isotopes. Isotopic analysis of carbon and nitrogen in faeces is a reliable methodology for studying ecology in wildlife. Here, we tested this technique to detect variations in carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios (& delta;C-13 and & delta;N-15) in two different intrasexual competition scenarios of male Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) using faeces of individuals collected during hunting actions in South-eastern Spain. The carbon isotopic ratio (& delta;C-13) was not found to be significant, likely due to similar diet composition in all individuals. However, the nitrogen isotopic ratio (& delta;N-15) was found to be lower in populations where sexual competition between males during the rut was higher compared to low-competition populations. Therefore, this study suggests a different use of proteins by an individual male red deer depending on the sexually competitive context in which he lives. Although further research is needed, these results show the potential of isotopic analysis as a tool for studying individual and populational variations in the level of intrasexual competition, with implications in evolutionary ecology and population management.

AB  - There is little research on the distribution and evolution of tannin cells, specialized in the sequestration of phenolic compounds, in the leaves of P. oceanica, depending on the developmental stage and environmental conditions. This work aims to evaluate the density of tannin cells along the vertical axis of leaves (basal, middle and apical regions) at four sites corresponding to an anthropogenic gradient estimated from the ecological status of P. oceanica meadows: Moderate (El Djamila), Good (Bou Ismail) and very good (Kouali and Ain Tagourait). Leaf thickness and width were measured in each region to express the density of tannin cells per mm(2). Data analysis shows that the density of tannin cells decreases with increasing leaf age and that the highest densities are recorded in the apical regions, especially when the leaf apex is entire. The density of leaf tannin cells is significantly correlated (R = -0.977, p = 0.022) with the Ecological Quality Ratio (EQR) corresponding to the ecological status of P. oceanica meadows and reflecting the impact of environmental pressures. This sensitivity to environmental conditions opens interesting prospects for using tannin cell density as a descriptor (environmental biomarker) in coastal monitoring programs based on P. oceanica meadows.

AB  - The high economic costs of human-wildlife conflicts (HWC) hinder long-term conservation successes, especially in developing countries. We investigated HWC by interviewing 498 respondents from 42 villages in Nowshera district, Pakistan. According to respondents, six species-the common leopard (Panthera pardus), grey wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), and wild boar (Sus scrofa)-were involved in livestock predation and crop-raiding. Livestock predation (N = 670) translated into a total annual economic loss of USD 48,490 across the 42 villages, with the highest economic loss of USD 57.1/household/year attributed to the golden jackal. Crop damage by wild boar and porcupine incurred a total annual economic loss of USD 18,000. Results further showed that livestock predation was highly affected by location, prey type, prey age, and herding practices, while cereals and vegetables were preferred crops for wild boar and Indian porcupine. The grey wolf was declared as the most dangerous carnivore, followed by the golden jackal and common leopard. Negative attitude about golden jackal and wild boar prevails among 90% of the respondents of the study area. We strongly assume that the abundance of apex predators can control the economic impacts of meso-carnivores and wild boar on the community's livelihood. Keeping relatively smaller herds may reduce carnivore attacks and educating the populous and compensation can minimise negative perceptions of HWC. To reduce HWC in the study area, there should be an incessant and timely coordination between wildlife officials and the local community.

AB  - Simple Summary Mastitis is a prevalent issue worldwide among lactating animals. It continues to be a serious problem since it has an economic impact on farmers due to direct and indirect losses. The multifactorial nature of this disease, coupled with the limitations of classical culture-based methods to identify uncultivable bacteria under normal laboratory conditions, exacerbates the situation. In the current study, milk samples from the well-known buffalo breed (Nili Ravi) were tested to explore bacterial communities associated with different udder health statuses using the 16S rRNA gene-based metagenomics technique. The bacterial communities in buffaloes with different udder health statuses, such as healthy, clinical mastitis, and subclinical mastitis, exhibited varied abundance at different taxonomic levels. Additionally, the study concluded that bacterial diversity in milk samples decreases in animals suffering from clinical mastitis compared to those with a healthy or subclinical mastitis status. These findings will contribute to our understanding of bacterial diversity's role in mastitis development. The Nili Ravi, a buffalo breed from Pakistan, significantly contributes to the dairy industry. Mastitis is one of the major challenges affecting milk production in this breed. The objective of the current study was to identify the bacterial communities and diversity in healthy and mastitic milk of this breed. Milk samples (n = 14) were collected from Nili Ravi buffaloes with different udder health statuses, i.e., healthy (5), subclinical mastitis (4), and clinical mastitis (5). The DNAs were extracted, subjected to partial amplification of 16S rDNA (V3 and V4 regions), and sequenced using the Illumina platform. The results revealed variations in the bacterial communities in the milk of animals with different udder health statuses. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in the healthy group, while clinical and subclinical mastitis milk had a higher abundance of Firmicutes. Dominant bacterial genera in the healthy group were Streptococcus (11.60%), Herbaspirillum (7.65%), and Staphylococcus (4.70%), whereas the clinical mastitis group was dominated by Streptococcus (33.96%), Staphylococcus (7.87%), and Corynebacterium (2.68%), and the subclinical mastitis group was dominated by Bacillus (15.70%), Corynebacterium (6.70%), and Staphylococcus (6.58%). Assignment of operational taxonomic units at the species level resulted in most species being assigned to uncultured or unknown bacteria or remaining unassigned. Alpha diversity indices indicated lower microbial diversity in the clinical mastitis group, while beta diversity indices showed a scattered pattern of sample clustering in PCA plots among different groups. It is concluded that bacterial diversity in the milk of Nili Ravi buffaloes suffering from clinical mastitis is lower compared to healthy and subclinical mastitis cases. It is concluded that the variations in the microbiota of healthy and mastitic milk may be further investigated and exploited as signature microbes associated with the udder health status of Nili Ravi buffalo.

AB  - Trophic cascades are important determinants of food web dynamics and functioning, yet mechanisms accounting for variation in trophic cascade strength remain elusive. Here, we used food chain models and a mesocosm experiment (phytoplankton-zooplankton-shrimp) to disentangle the relative importance of two energetic processes driving trophic cascades: primary productivity and energy transfer efficiency. Food chain models predicted that the strength of trophic cascades was increased as the energy transfer efficiency between herbivore and predator (predator efficiency) increased, while its relationship with primary productivity was relatively weak. These model predictions were confirmed by a mesocosm experiment, which showed that the strength of trophic cascade increased with predator efficiency but remained unaffected by nutrient supply rate or primary productivity. Combined, our results indicate that the efficiency of energy transfer along the food chain, rather than the total amount of energy fixed by primary producers, determines the strength of trophic cascades. Our study provides an integrative perspective to reconcile energetic and population dynamics in food webs, which has implications for both ecological research and ecosystem management.

AB  - The demand for natural insulation materials is increasing with special attention to the use of such materials for exploiting renewable energy. Natural insulation materials tremendously influence the sustainability development and energy efficiency enhancement in the buildings. Natural fibers from animal's origin absorb great amount of moisture on exposed to the environment which significantly affects the performance and thermal insulation properties. The thermal degradation of such material strongly influences the accidental burning characteristics, an important selection criteria for building materials. In the present study, three different kind of natural insulation materials namely sheep wool, goat wool and horse mane have been characterized in terms of moisture absorption, thermal degradation and morphology using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry techniques, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. In addition, antibacterial behavioral study has been also carried out for untreated raw wool and treated wool (copper nitrate). These properties are vital for a holistic evaluation of the insulation material. Moisture absorption results indicate that the sheep wool and goat wool absorb less moisture content as compared to horse mane. Unlike this horse mane shows great stability than goat wool and sheep wool in the temperature range not exceeding 470 degrees C. TGA data indicate 50% mass loss (T-50%) at 306 degrees C, 322 degrees C and 318 degrees C for sheep wool, goat wool and horse mane, respectively. In addition the tests show that the content of fire retardant elements like nitrogen and sulphur is more in horse mane as compared to sheep wool and goat wool. The treated wool samples showed excellent antibacterial properties as compared to untreated wool samples.

AB  - Key message The high mortality and low recruitment of the myrmecophytic Acacia drepanolobium are not consistent with the demographic rates of monodominant species. The positive conspecific density dependence observed from the spatial analysis is consistent with the defensive benefits conferred by symbiotic ants to trees when they grow close to each other. Patches of savanna dominated by Acacia drepanolobium occur throughout East Africa on nutrient-rich vertisols, also known as black cotton soils. We assessed the survival and recruitment for all freestanding trees with diameter at knee height (dkh) >= 10 mm in one of such mono-dominated patches (47 ha) at the Mpala Research Centre, Kenya, with the aim of identifying demographic traits that might explain the dominance of this species. Over a mean 6-year interval, mortality and recruitment rates in the habitat were 4.55%/year and 1.42%/year respectively, resulting in a net loss of 17.8% of the initial individuals. Of the 30 species recorded from the first census, 11 decreased in abundance, nine increased, and the remainder 10 did not change in abundance. The monodominant A. drepanolobium had a high mortality (4.69%/year), a low recruitment (1.31%/year), and a 19% population decline. There was no evidence of conspecific negative density dependence for this species. Rather, we found a statistically significant positive correlation between the number of conspecific neighbors and individual-level probability of survival, consistent with the "shared defense" benefits that symbiotic ant colonies occupying multiple trees can confer to these latter in a small neighborhood. Thus, mortality of A. drepanolobium was higher in areas where it occurred in lower densities, which resulted in an increase in the spatial aggregation of conspecifics. Mortality increased with dkh size classes and was mostly caused by elephants and stem-boring beetles. The demographic rates during the study period in theory are inconsistent with those of monodominant species. The protection against herbivory conferred by mutualistic ants associated with this species remains the most probable explanation of its dominance in this habitat.

AB  - Mediterranean mesophotic hard bottoms are mostly characterized by coralligenous banks. Although investigations on this habitat have increased in the last years, knowledge about its structure and spatial variability is still very limited as most studies are focused on the description of assemblages of peculiar and small locations such as biodiversity hotspots. This study aimed at i) describing coralligenous megafauna on the western Sardinian continental shelf between 80 and 120 m of depth, ii) assessing the distribution of the dominant taxa, and iii) estimating patterns of spatial variability at different scales. The coralligenous banks were studied along five sectors of the western Sardinian continental shelf by means of Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and images were analyzed to identify the main taxa or morphological groups and their abundance. Results highlighted several common patterns among sectors, with assemblages dominated by the gorgonians Eunicella cavolini and Callogorgia verticillata. On the other hand, some taxa (e.g. Callogorgia verticillata, Paramuricea hirsuta, Antipathella subpinnata, Corallium rubrum Paramuricea clavata, Poecillastra compressa and Aplidium spp.) mainly contribute to segregate the coralligenous assemblages within the considered sectors of this study. A high small-scale variability was also observed. The presence of extensive and well diversified mesophotic animal forests stresses the importance to improve the conservation of the western Sardinian continental shelf.

AB  - Long-term evolution of human-environment interaction in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has been discussed intensively in recent years. The identification of human-related pollen types may help explore the coupled process of climate change, ecological response and anthropogenic activities on the QTP. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities on surface pollen assemblages and identify pollen indicators associated with grazing and cultivation in typical agro-pastoral ecotone of the eastern QTP. Totally 84 surface samples were analyzed from five vegetational communities in the eastern QTP, which are identifiable based on surface pollen assemblages. Principal component analysis of 29 pollen types and two supplementary variables of human influences were used to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on surface pollen assemblages in eastern QTP. Severe grazing led to increase of Rosaceae, Ranunculaceae, Fabaceae, Taraxacum-Type, Aster-type and Saussurea-Type in pollen assemblages. Highland agricultural cultivation can be identified by the content and morphological characteristic of Brassicaceae and Cerealia Poaceae pollen. The aerial dispersed distances of Brassicaceae and Cerealia Poaceae pollen are very short, and domesticated herbivores are important factors, which disperse the Cerealia Poaceae pollen into pastures in agro-pastoral ecotone of the QTP. Modern pollen indicators of cultivation and grazing activity will provide precise references for fossil pollen study of prehistoric human activities in the QTP.

AB  - Fisheries bycatch is the main threat to sea turtle populations in marine habitats in the Mediterranean Sea. Bycatch in set nets accounts for 30,000 catches yearly, which combined with mortality rates of up to 82.6 %, makes it the deadliest fishing gear in the region. The Adriatic Sea is one of the most important foraging and developmental habitats for loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean. Bycatch in the Adriatic small-scale set net fishery is estimated at over 8900 individuals per year placing its mitigation among international conservation priorities. Use of light emitting diodes (LED lights) of different wavelengths as bycatch deterrents was proposed as an effective conservation tool, reducing bycatch levels by up to 93 %. In the present study we: (i) quantified the effects of net illumination on loggerhead sea turtle bycatch rates and (ii) demonstrate the importance of regional validation of conservation tools effectiveness prior to their widespread adoption. We assessed the effects of green LED lights on sea turtle bycatch rates in 390 net pairs with total length of 1278 km monitored nets. We found no significant change in sea turtle bycatch rates as a result of net illumination. A significant decrease of 35 % of primary target catch was observed in illuminated trammel nets. Possible explanations include fluctuating turbidity and an adapted LED light attachment method. Observed sea turtle bycatch rates in unilluminated nets were up to 84 times lower than in comparable gears in Northern Adriatic Sea. Understanding the drivers behind the differing bycatch rates would be necessary before conservation decisions are made. Our study showed that the net illumination is not necessarily a silver bullet for bycatch mitigation in set nets globally, and that regional testing is a key requirement before its introduction in fisheries as a conservation tool.

AB  - Australia was isolated for approximately 40 million years from the presence of eutherian predation until the introduction of the dingo (Canis familiaris; 4000 years ago), foxes (Vulpes vulpes; 1871) and feral cats (Felis catus; post-1788). The arrival of these invasive species coincides with the decline and extinction of many native mammals, specifically within the critical weight range (35-5500 g). These extinctions are likely a result of competition and predation, where locomotor performance and the associated behaviours contribute largely to overall fitness. We used the population responses of native fauna in the presence of introduced predators to establish a research framework. Introduction/extinction timelines, predator diets, and prey occurrence were used to identify invasive/native relationships where predation may define the population outcome. We then examined the locomotor performance of these species using current data (maximum speeds). Consumption of prey items does not seem to be associated with the probability of the predator encountering the prey. Dingoes had the most variable mammalian prey of all invasive predators, likely due to higher maximal speeds. Feral cats favour Dasyuridae and smaller species, preying upon these prey groups more than dingoes and foxes. The role of locomotor performance in invasive ecology is not well understood; we identified relationships for further exploration.

AB  - This study investigated the deposition of the anthelmintic drug albendazole through sheep urine and how it affects soil nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in grazed grasslands. Three one-year-old Tibetan rams were dosed with fast-acting albendazole capsules at 11 mg per kg body weight to measure the concentration of albendazole and its metabolites in each sheep's urine. Three rams were used as a control group. Albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide and albendazole sulfone were all excreted with urine, but albendazole sulfoxide was the main metabolite. The effect of albendazole or its metabolites' excretion in urine on soil nitrogen transformations and nitrous oxide emissions were investigated at an alpine grassland site. Greater nitrification activity was observed in soils where urine from albendazole-dosed rams had been applied. The mean total N2O emissions over the six-week measurement period for albendazole-dosed sheep urine, control urine and no urine were 0.94 +/- 0.34, 0.18 +/- 0.11 and 0.02 +/- 0.05 g N2O-N m(-2), respectively. These results suggest that N2O pollution from animal urine patches can be potentially exacerbated through anthelmintic drug administration to grazed animals.

AB  - Cenchrus setigerus Vahl. is a heat- and salinity-tolerant forage grass of immense value in ecological restoration of degraded lands. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) associated with the rhizosphere of grasses play a significant role by aiding development of the plant or by controlling phytopathogens. Biochemical and physiological characterization of PGPR isolated from the rhizosphere of C. setigerus was carried out, and the rhizobacteria were identified as belonging to the genera Azospirillum and Pseudomonas. A predominantly N-acetylglucosamine-binding protein (Cenchrus root agglutinin: CRA) that agglutinated buffalo erythrocytes was isolated from the roots of C. setigerus, by ammonium sulphate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. Immunoblot analyses of CRA indicated that it shared no similarity with other monocot and dicot lectins tested. Hemagglutination assays of CRA with buffalo erythrocytes were competitively inhibited in the presence of either Azospirillum Tarrand or Pseudomonas Migula, indicating that CRA specifically binds to surface antigens of these rhizobacteria. Further, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) were isolated from the rhizobacteria and used in a double diffusion assay to show that CRA reacted specifically with the LPS from Azospirillum and Pseudomonas. Our data illustrate the mechanism by which colonization of rhizobacteria around roots of C. setigerus is mediated through the interaction of bacterial LPS and CRA. The data also highlight the potential of C. setigerus and its associated PGPRs in restoration of degraded ecosystems.

AB  - The study aimed to determine whether artificial shade influences grazing behavior and body weight of pregnant female red deer. Two groups of pregnant does were grazed in enclosures with shade (WS, n = 23), or non-shaded enclosures (NS, n = 23) of similar size and botanical composition. The animals' location and behavior, as well as ambient and black globe temperatures were recorded. Females were weighed at the beginning and the end of the experiment. In the WS group, the percentage of animals using the shade during the day was significantly related to ambient and black globe temperatures. There were no differences between groups in grazing activity ( P > 0.05). More animals were seen drinking, and more thermoregulatory behaviors (wallowing in mud; placing forelegs in troughs) were recorded in the NS group during the day (11.1 +/- 1 vs. 6.7 +/- 1 and 10 +/- 1.4 vs. 3.3 +/- 1.4 respectively, P < 0.05). Daily weight gain was higher in the WS group (215 +/- 24.1 vs. 127.1 +/- 23.6, g +/- SE, P < 0.05). Artificial shade during the last 2.5 months of gestation did not affect grazing activity, but reduced the expression of thermoregulatory behaviors and improved average weight gain. It is suggested that shade is important for animal welfare in grazing red deer. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - We report a 26-year detailed record of changes in abundance and demography of the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) in old-growth coniferous forest in southern British Columbia, Canada, from 1995 to 2020. We evaluated three separate hypotheses that may help to explain population changes: (H-1) large cone crops of coniferous trees will correspond to peak Peromyscus density; (H-2) spring reorganization of individuals within populations will lead to early breeding season declines; and (H-3) competition between P. maniculatus and the sympatric red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) and hence densities of the former will be lower when the latter are higher. Populations of deer mice showed five periods of high numbers with intervals of 3 to 8 years between fluctuations. Mean density ranges were low, growing from 2-3/ha in spring to 8-13/ha in autumn. The mean abundance of P. maniculatus in high years was directly related to number of successful pregnancies, total number of juvenile recruits, and a high index of early juvenile productivity. Irregular population fluctuations were related to pulsed food supplies in the form of coniferous seeds, thereby supporting H-1. Numbers declined in 16 of 26 summers, reflecting poor overall survival and low reproduction (only 69% of adult females lactating and 51% having only one litter; virtually no juveniles matured and bred). Thus, H-2 was partly supported for a reorganization event that led to breeding season declines, and the immediate cause was very poor survival of juvenile mice. The annual peak numbers of C. gapperi ranged from 1.5 to 16.9 times higher than numbers for P. maniculatus and hence provided only weak support for H-3. Field experiments are needed to test these hypotheses as mechanisms driving deer mouse populations.

AB  - Simple Summary Transportation is an inevitable part of the raising process of goats. During transportation, animals are subjected to 'transport stress' due to limited space, bumpy roads, lack of feed and drinking water, and other stimuli. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of how transport stress affects goats, we conducted our experimental studies. Sixteen healthy goats were selected, and these goats were transported at a speed ranging from 35 to 45 km/h for 20 h. We measured changes in the physiological indexes, blood physiological indexes, biochemical indexes, rumen fermentation indexes, and rumen microbial structure composition of goats before and after transportation. Our experimental findings revealed that continuous transportation for a duration of 20 h can induce a severe stress response in goats, leading to compromised immune function, diminished antioxidant capacity, escalated inflammatory response, and altered rumen fermentation indices. However, they did not reveal any significant impact on the structure and composition of the rumen microbiota.Abstract The objective of this experiment was to delve into the impacts of transportation on goats. Sixteen healthy goats were selected as experimental animals; these goats were transported at a speed ranging from 35 to 45 km/h for 20 h. The changes in the physiological indexes, blood physiological indexes, biochemical indexes, rumen fermentation indexes, and rumen microbial structure composition of goats before and after transportation were measured. The results showed that after transportation, the contents of IgM, IgA, IgG, and Thyroxine decreased very significantly, while the contents of propionic acid, Hemoglobin and Epinephrine significantly increased, and the contents of VFA, acetic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, LPS, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, Major Acute Phase Protein, protein carbonyl, and cortisol increased very significantly. There was no significant difference in alpha-diversity and beta-diversity, and the relative abundance of rumen microorganisms was not significantly different at either phylum or genus levels. The experimental findings revealed that continuous transportation for a duration of 20 h can induce a severe stress response in goats, leading to compromised immune function, diminished antioxidant capacity, escalated inflammatory response, and altered rumen fermentation indices. However, the experiment did not reveal any significant impact on the structure and composition of the rumen microbiota.

AB  - Obligate symbionts often exhibit some degree of co-speciation with their hosts. One prominent example is the symbiosis between termites and their wood-feeding hindgut protists. This symbiosis is mutually obligate, vertically inherited by anal feeding, and it predates the emergence of termites from their cockroach ancestors. Termites and their symbiotic protists might therefore be expected to have congruent phylogenies, but symbiont loss, transfer, and independent diversification can impact the coevolutionary history to varying degrees. Here, we have characterized the symbiotic protist communities of eight Neoisoptera species from three families in order to gauge the phylogenetic congruence between each lineage of protists and their hosts. Using microscopy and 18S rRNA gene sequencing of individually isolated protist cells, we identified protists belonging to the Parabasalia genera Pseudotrichonympha, Holomastigotoides, Cononympha, and Cthulhu. Pseudotrichonympha were present in all of the investigated termites, with a strong pattern of codiversification with hosts, consistent with previous studies. The phylogeny of Holomastigotoides indicates several instances of diversification that occurred independently of the hosts' diversification, along with lineage-specific symbiont loss. Cononympha occurs only in Heterotermitidae and Psammotermes. Surprisingly, the small flagellate Cthulhu is widespread and exhibits cophylogeny with its hosts. This study demonstrates that different symbiont lineages can show different coevolutionary patterns, even within the same host.

AB  - The adaptive abilities of grazing livestock species are not well understood, despite the potential link between behaviour driven decision making and the overall productive efficiency of the animal through foraging strategy. This study aimed to assess and compare these adaptive behaviours, relating to i) object permanence, ii) numerical competence, and iii) categorisation capabilities of domesticated species that possess distinctly different digestive physiologies and backgrounds. Seven animals from each species, including sheep (Ovis aries) (avg. 5 years of age, 60 kg initial weight), goats (Capra hircus) (avg. 3 years, 45 kg initial weight), and alpacas (Lama pacos (Linnaeus, 1758)) (avg. 3 years, 70 kg initial weight), were presented with a total of nine choice tasks, grouped relative to the three abilities being tested (object permanence, numerical competence, and categorisation). Specifically, the stage of object permanence for each subject was tested based on their ability to solve simple visible displacement, to overcome perseveration error, and double invisible displacement tasks. Subjects were also presented with a two-choice task of different open-centre and filled shapes to assess the capacity for simple discrimination and open-ended categorisation. Lastly, numerical competence was compared across five trials consisting of different ratios and volumes of food reward. A basic awareness of object permanence was found in all subjects. Overall, the goats demonstrated the greatest capacity for object permanence across the three species, particularly when presented with more complex three-cup A-not-B tasks. This increase in complexity had no significant effect on goat performance as a group (p = 0.13), whereas alpaca (p = 0.0005) and sheep performance significantly declined (p = 0.04). We also found no evidence to demonstrate contrasting cognitive capabilities between these species in relation to spontaneous numerical cognition (p > 0.05), or in the use of perceptual cues in open-ended categorisation (p = 0.246). This study is the first instance of multiple direct comparisons of cognitive capability across domesticated livestock species. Furthermore, this work is the first account of object permanence, numerical competence and categorisation in alpacas, as well as object permanence in sheep and numerical competence in sheep and goats. This information could prove useful to predict the outcome of interaction between these species in a grazing context and for inferences relating to behaviour driven decision making, such as foraging strategy, and the overall productive efficiency of the animal. Here, we conclude that the three species tested possess comparable capacity for physical cognition in the tasks discussed.

AB  - European bison (Bison bonasus) were successfully reintroduced in many free or semi-free areas across Europe during the last decades. Due to the increased numbers, the conflicts between human activities and bison are more frequent. Therefore the knowledge about spatial activity and habitat preference in new regions is the need for management decision making. We studied daily and seasonal habitat use of the semi-free European bison herd in the Czech Republic from 2014 to 2019. The lead cows of the herd were collared with the GPS devices with a 30-minutes GPS fixes interval. The bison herd strongly preferred the managed open areas and supplementary feeding stations during the seasons (Jacob's index from 0.49 to 0.99). On the contrary, they avoided the forest type and unmanaged open habitats (Jacob ' s index from -0.23 to -0.69). The managed meadows and feeding places they used almost exclusively during the night while the forest during the day-light.

AB  - Tree-crop intercropping is of great significance in food security, land protection, and sustainable agriculture. However, the mechanisms of allelopathy between plant species during intercropping are still limited. This study focuses on the allelopathic effects in the intercropping between Camellia oleifera and Arachis hypogaea L. in southern China. We use different parts of the C. oleifera extract to evaluate their impact on peanut seed germination. The results showed that it has inhibitory effects on peanut germination and growth, with the fruit shell having the strongest inhibitory effect. Three main allelopathic substances affecting A. hypogaea germination and growth were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, namely, 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, hexanal, and benzaldehyde. Transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses revealed their effects on glutathione metabolism pathways and specific gene expression. In summary, this study reveals the allelopathic interaction mechanism between C. oleifera and A. hypogaea, which helps to better understand the role of allelopathy in intercropping practices between trees and crops.

AB  - Animal manure is considered a valuable organic fertilizer due to its important nutrient content enhancing soil fertility and plant growth in agriculture. Besides its beneficial role as fertilizer, animal manure represents a significant source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), playing a significant role in atmospheric chemistry. Understanding the composition of VOCs Understanding VOCs from animal manure is crucial for assessing their environmental impact, as they can cause air pollution, odors, and harm to human health and ecosystems. Laboratory studies enhance field measurements by providing a precise inventory of manure emissions, addressing gaps in existing literature. Both approaches complement each other in advancing our understanding of manure emissions. In this context, we conducted an experimental study involving various animal manures (cow, horse, sheep, and goat) taken from a farm in Grignon (near Paris, France). We employed atmospheric simulation chambers within a controlled laboratory environment. The analysis of VOCs involved the combination of Proton Transfer Reaction -Quadrupole ion guide -Time -of -Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-QiTOF-MS) and Thermal Desorption -Gas Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry (TD -GC -MS). Using PTR-QiTOF-MS, 368 compounds were detected and quantified within the manure samples. The complementary analysis by TD -GC -MS enhanced our identification of VOCs. Our findings revealed various chemical groups of VOCs, including oxygenated compounds (e.g., ethanol, cresol, acetaldehyde, etc.), nitrogenated compounds (ammonia, trimethylamine, etc.), sulfur compounds (methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, etc.), aromatic compounds (phenols and indoles), terpenes (isoprene, D-limonene, etc.) and halogenated compounds. Cow manure exhibited the highest VOC emission fluxes, followed by goat, sheep, and horse manures. Notably, oxygenated VOCs were dominant contributors to total VOC emission fluxes in all samples. Statistical analysis highlighted the distinct nature of cow manure emissions, characterized by oxygenated compounds and nitrogenated compounds. In addition, goat manure was isolated from the other samples with high emissions of compounds having both oxygen and nitrogen atoms in their molecular formulas (e.g., CH3NO2). The experimental dataset obtained in this study provides an inventory reference for both VOCs and their emission fluxes in animal manures. Furthermore, it highlights odorant compounds and VOCs that serve as atmospheric aerosol precursor. Future studies can explore the effectiveness of various manure treatment methods to promote sustainable agriculture practices.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to find an economical and effective amendment for improving composting performance and product quality, as well as to analyze the microbial community succession in the whole phase of composting. Therefore, the effect of reusable amendment bamboo sphere on composting performance and microbial community succession during food waste composting was investigated. The results showed that 6% bamboo sphere treatment had the highest degree of polymerization (3.7) and humification index (0.18). Compared with control, 6% bamboo sphere amendment increased total nitrogen (TN), phosphorus (TP) and potassium (TK) contents by 13.61%, 19% and 17.42%, respectively. Furthermore, bamboo sphere enhanced bacterial-fungal diversity and improved microbial community composition by enhancing the relative abundance of thermo-tolerance and lignocellulolytic bacteria and fungi. The five most abundant genera in bamboo sphere composting comprised Bacillus (0-71.47%), Chloroplast-norank (0-47.17%), Pusillimonas (0-33.24%), Acinetobacter (0-27.98%) and unclassified Sphingobacteriaceae (0-22.62%). Linear discriminant analysis effect size showed that Firmicutes, Thermoascaceae and Actinobacteriota, which have a relationship with the decomposition of soluble organic matter and lignocellulose, were significantly enriched in bamboo sphere treatment. Canonical correspondence analysis illustrated that total organic carbon (TOC), TK, and TP were the most important environmental factors on microbial community succession in the two composting systems. Together these results suggest that bamboo sphere as a reusable amendment can shorten maturity period, improve humification degree, increase the contents of nutrient and contribute to the succession of microbial community during food waste composting. These findings provide a theoretical basis for improving the efficiency of food waste composting.

AB  - Palaeoecological interpretations are based on our understanding of dietary and habitat preferences of fossil taxa. While morphology provides approximations of diets, stable isotope proxies provide insights into the realized diets of animals. We present a synthesis of the isotopic ecologies (delta C-13 from tooth enamel) of North American mammalian herbivores since approximately 7 Ma. We ask: (i) do morphological interpretations of dietary behaviour agree with stable isotope proxy data? (ii) are grazing taxa specialists, or is grazing a means to broaden the dietary niche? and (iii) how is dietary niche breadth attained in taxa at the local level? We demonstrate that while brachydont taxa are specialized as browsers, hypsodont taxa often have broader diets that included more browse consumption than previously anticipated. It has long been accepted that morphology imposes limits on the diet; this synthesis supports prior work that herbivores with 'grazing' adaptions, such as hypsodont teeth, have the ability to consume grass but are also able to eat other foods. Notably, localized dietary breadth of even generalist taxa can be narrow (approx. 30 to 60% of a taxon's overall breadth). This synthesis demonstrates that 'grazing-adapted' taxa are varied in their diets across space and time, and this flexibility may reduce competition among ancient herbivores.

AB  - Large ungulate populations are known to cause economic damage to agriculture and forestry. Bark damage is particularly detrimental to the timber production of certain species, including Picea abies (L.) Karst. (Norway spruce): after bark is wounded, rot often spreads in the trunk base, damaging the most valuable trunk section. Numerous studies have provided valuable information on various aspects of this process, but the financial consequences over a full timber production cycle remained poorly quantified and uncertain. To fill this gap, we coupled a forest dynamics model (GYMNOS) with models of damage occurrence and decay spread. We simulated the effect of ranging levels of bark-stripping damage on financial losses. The simulations were repeated for sites of ranging fertility and with different protection measures (fences or individual protections), in Southern Belgium. The net present values of these different simulations were estimated and compared to estimate the cost of the damage and the cost-effectiveness of the damage protections. Protecting plantations against bark-stripping damage with fences was found unlikely to be worthwhile. By contrast, individual protections placed on crop trees could be helpful, particularly in the most fertile stands. Loss of revenue depended greatly on the factors tested: we estimated that the average damage cost could be about 53euro/ha/year, reducing timber yield by 19%. A model was built to predict the damage cost for different values of the discount rate, site index and bark-stripping rate. This model could help develop more effective management of Norway spruce plantations and deer populations.

AB  - Mutualism is a form of symbiosis whereby both parties benefit from the relationship. An example is cleaning symbiosis, which has been observed in terrestrial and marine environments. The most recognized form of marine cleaning symbiosis is that of cleaner fishes and their clients.
   Cleaner species set up cleaning stations on the reef, and other species seek out their services. However, it is not well understood how the presence of cleaning stations influence movements of large highly mobile species. We examined the role of cleaning stations as a driver of movement and habitat use in a mobile client species.
   Here, we used a combination of passive acoustic telemetry and in-water surveys to investigate cleaning station attendance by the reef manta ray Mobula alfredi. We employed a novel approach in the form of a fine-scale acoustic receiver array set up around a known cleaning area and tagged 42 rays. Within the array, we mapped structural features, surveyed the distribution of cleaner wrasse, and observed the habitat use of the rays.
   We found manta ray space use was significantly associated with blue-streak cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus distribution and hard coral substrate. Cleaning interactions dominated their habitat use at this site, taking precedence over other life history traits such as feeding and courtship.
   This study has demonstrated that cleaning symbiosis is a driver for highly mobile, and otherwise pelagic, species to visit inshore reef environments. We suggest that targeted and long-term use of specific cleaning stations reflects manta rays having a long-term memory and cognitive map of some shallow reef environments where quality cleaning is provided. We hypothesize that animals prefer cleaning sites in proximity to productive foraging regions.

AB  - The ecological impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) are increasingly documented; however, they are usually studied through the lens of either the IAS or the affected species (IAS-threatened species). A clear understanding of how both protagonists of biological invasions are characterized is still lacking. We investigated the morphology, life history and ecology of birds involved in biological invasions. Evaluating the distribution of 450 IAS-threatened birds and 400 alien birds in a functional space, we found that both groups retained various strategies. Aliens had larger clutches and were more likely to be herbivores than IAS-threatened and worldwide birds, while IAS-threatened birds were more insular endemic from the Australia region than alien and worldwide birds. IAS-threatened species showed opposite strategies to aliens regarding traits related to diet, origin and reproduction. Further comparing traits associated with impact magnitude, we found that even if aliens were mostly herbivorous, those with high impact had more a generalist behaviour and an animal-based diet compared to aliens with low impact. By emphasizing differences relating to the distribution of bird groups in a functional space, we opened new opportunities to identify the role of birds in biological invasions.

AB  - Fire shapes ecological dynamics across many regions of Africa today and plays a critical role in the maintenance of grass dominated (savannah) ecosystems in regions which could climatically support forest vegetation, such as the Dahomey Gap in western Africa. However, the importance of fire relative to other important factors (such as herbivory and moisture availability) remains relatively poorly quantified. Here we present new macrocharcoal data (particles >160 mu m) from Lake Bosumtwi (Ghana) spanning the last c. 50 thousand years (ka). The macrocharcoal data are interpreted to provide evidence of high biomass consuming fires within the lake catchment (c. 52 km(2)). The macrocharcoal data are compared with previously published evidence of regional fires (microcharcoal), vegetation (pollen), herbivory (spores of coprophilous fungi), and moisture availability (delta N-15). The macrocharcoal data suggest three phases of increased fire severity (biomass consumption) during the last c. 50 ka: (i) 50-44 ka, (ii) 37-30 ka, and (iii) 26-10 ka. Covariance between high concentrations of macrocharcoal and grass pollen during these periods suggests that grass was likely providing most of the fuel load for the fires. After c. 10 ka macrocharcoal disappears from the sediments, suggesting high severity fires disappeared from the local landscape after this time. This decline in fire follows a decrease in herbivory within the landscape and occurs against a backdrop of increasing precipitation. We suggest that this combination of factors resulted in the loss of fire and contributed to the rise of a vegetation formation around Lake Bosumtwi during the Holocene that was unlike any seen in the last c. 500 ka.

AB  - In polygynous species, male reproductive success is often determined by their ability to dominate female harems. Harem-holders sire a disproportionate number of offspring. Male dominance tends to correlate with age, but intense competition and early male mortality limit most males from achieving high social status. To maximize reproductive success despite low rank, offspring sex ratio adjustment may have evolved, favoring the sex with higher fitness. If traits influencing dominance are heritable and confer reproductive advantages, we expect fathers with higher reproductive success to produce more sons, as they are more likely to become dominant. In contrast, subordinate males with lower success may benefit from siring more daughters. We tested this hypothesis on a colony of southern elephant seals breeding on the Kerguelen Archipelago. We used genetic markers to link the paternity of 540 pups to 58 breeding males. We found that the probability of siring a son increases from 43% to 54% with paternal relative reproductive success, supporting the offspring sex ratio adjustment hypothesis. Given that various factors influence sex ratio in a population, future studies should tease apart these ecological processes (e.g., paternal dominance, maternal condition, local density, or adult sex ratio) and investigate how they interact with each other.

AB  - Mountain goats have relatively low survival and reproductive rates relative to other northern ungulates, requiring management to avoid overharvest and population declines. While wildlife managers discourage harvest of female mountain goats, it remains legal in most jurisdictions and incorrect identification in the field often results in unintentional female harvest. Reducing female harvest is desirable to increase population resilience and optimize hunting opportunity but knowledge is lacking on how to mitigate female harvest. We analyzed harvest (1998-2019) and follow-up hunter interview (2008-2011) data collected in Alaska in order to understand harvest patterns and inform strategies for reducing female harvest. Overall, female mountain goat harvest was spatially and temporally variable with area- and year-specific proportions of female harvest ranging from 4-61%. Follow-up hunter interviews revealed that hunters who unintentionally harvested females were less experienced but did not necessarily spend less time observing animals in the field, use lower quality optics, or take longer shots. Surprisingly, of the hunters interviewed, 23% (n = 41/181) took shots longer than 300 meters with a maximum shot distance exceeding 600 meters, which may have important hunter ethics and management implications. We also determined that 42% of female mountain goats were harvested intentionally, suggesting stricter harvest regulations may be needed to reduce female harvest, where appropriate. Our results indicated educational materials may take substantial assimilation time before producing an effect. Hunter interview data collected during the initial 4 years (2008-2011) did not reveal an effect of educational materials, however, hunter harvest data analyzed over a 12 year period (2008-2019) indicated a 7% decline in female harvest, as compared with the preceding 10 year period (1998-2007). To explore the efficacy of regulatory mitigation of female mountain goat harvest, we examined 3 different management case studies utilizing various regulatory penalties for harvesting a female. In each instance, penalties resulted in reduced female harvest, suggesting that the combination of education and regulatory incentives can promote sustainable harvest, further ensuring population viability and resilience.

AB  - The soil macrofauna of three microsites in both background and contaminated areas was compared: within decaying trunks of deciduous trees (linden and aspen) in the final stages of decomposition, beneath the trunks, and outside the influence of the trunks (standard soil samples). The macrofauna composition was analyzed at two levels: supraspecific taxa and species, focusing on several taxocenes (earthworms, centipedes, arachnids, ground beetles, click beetles, and mollusks). The study was conducted in the spruce-fir forests of the southern taiga, an area affected by emissions from the Middle Ural Copper Smelter. At the level of supraspecific taxa, the composition of the macrofauna differs little between decaying trunks and standard soil samples. At the species level, the difference between microsites vary depending on taxocene: the species composition within decaying trunks either closely resembles that of standard samples (mollusks), is more distinct (click beetles), is more diverse (centipedes, arachnids, and ground beetles), or is reduced due to the loss of a specific ecological group (earthworms). The ordination of microsites by the generalized list of species for the studied taxocenes aligns with the ordination based on macrofauna composition at the supraspecific taxa level. The total density and abundance of most soil macrofauna groups are higher in the decaying trunks than in the standard samples. This difference in the background area is particularly pronounced (2-6 times) for earthworms, harvestmen, lithobiids, herbivorous Heteroptera, ground beetles, and chironomid larvae. In the contaminated area, the difference is even more striking: 70 times higher for earthworms, 30 times for mollusks, 10 times for Heteroptera, 7 times for lepidopteran larvae, 5 times for spiders, and 4 times for diplopods. The preferential habitation of soil macrofauna in decaying tree trunks within the contaminated area may be attributed to the significantly lower content of potentially toxic metals in decomposing wood compared to forest litter: the difference is 85 times for Pb, 77 times for Fe, 25 times for Cu, 2.6 times for Cd, and 1.7 times for Zn. Thus, the negative impact of pollution on soil macrofauna is less pronounced in decaying trunks compared to standard soil samples.

AB  - The impacts of warming temperatures associated with climate change on performance are poorly understood in most mammals. Thermal performance curves are a valuable means of examining the effects of temperature on performance traits, but they have rarely been used in endotherms. Here, we examined the thermal performance curve of endurance running capacity at high temperatures in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Endurance capacity was measured using an incremental speed test on a treadmill, and subcutaneous temperature in the abdominal region was measured as a proxy for body temperature (Tb). Endurance time at 20 degrees C was repeatable but varied appreciably across individuals, and was unaffected by sex or body mass. Endurance capacity was maintained across a broad range of ambient temperatures (Ta) but was reduced above 35 degrees C. Tb during running varied with Ta, and reductions in endurance were associated with Tb greater than 40 degrees C when Tawas above 35 degrees C. At the high Ta that limited endurance running capacity (but not at lower Ta), Tb tended to rise throughout running trials with increases in running speed. Metabolic and thermoregulatory measurements at rest showed that Tb, evaporative water loss and breathing frequency increased at Ta of 36 degrees C and above. Therefore, the upper threshold temperatures at which endurance capacity is impaired are similar to those inducing heat responses at rest in this species. These findings help discern the mechanisms by which deer mice are impacted by warming temperatures, and provide a general approach for examining thermal breadth of performance in small mammals.

AB  - The volatiles from damaged plants induce defense in neighboring plants. The phenomenon is called plant-plant communication, plant talk, or plant eavesdropping. Plant-plant communication has been reported to be stronger between kin plants than genetically far plants in sagebrush.
   Why do plants distinguish volatiles from kin or genetically far plants? We hypothesize that plants respond only to important conditions; the induced defense is not free of cost for the plant. To clarify the hypothesis, we conducted experiments and investigations using goldenrod of four different genotypes.
   The arthropod community on tall goldenrods were different among four genotypes. The response to volatiles was stronger from genetically close plants to the emitter than from genetically distant plants from the emitter. The volatiles from each genotype of goldenrods were different; and they were categorized accordingly. Moreover, the arthropod community on each genotype of goldenrods were different.
   Synthesis: Our results support the hypothesis: Goldenrods respond to volatiles from genetically close plants because they would have similar arthropod species. These results are important clues elucidating adaptive significance of plant-plant communication.

AB  - The changes of paddy soil habitat profoundly affect the structure and function of soil microorganisms, but how this process drives the growth and spread of manure- derived antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after entering the soil is unclear. Herein, this study explored the environmental fate and behavior of various ARGs in the paddy soil during rice growth period. Results showed that most ARG abundances in flooded soil was lower than that in non-flooded soil during rice growth (decreased by 33.4 %). And soil dry-wet alternation altered microbial community structure in paddy field (P < 0.05), showing that Actinobacteria and Firmicutes increased in proportion under non-flooded conditions, and Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria evolved into the dominant groups in flooded soil. Meanwhile, the correlation between ARGs and bacterial communities was stronger than that with mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in both flooded and non-flooded paddy soils. Furthermore, soil properties, especially oxidation reduction potential (ORP), were proved to be an essential factor in regulating the variability of ARGs in the whole rice growth stage by structural equation model, with a direct influence (& lambda; = 0.38, P < 0.05), following by similar effects of bacterial communities and MGEs (& lambda; = 0.36, P < 0.05; & lambda; = 0.29, P < 0.05). This study demonstrated that soil dry-wet alternation effectively reduced the proliferation and dissemination of most ARGs in paddy fields, providing a novel agronomic measure for pollution control of antibiotic resistance in farmland ecosystem.

AB  - Environmental regulations in China's hog industry aim to adjust industrial layout and reduce pollution. However, these regulations have had an unexpected impact, resulting in varying degrees of hog production decline across regions. This study, is exploring how environmental regulations affect lost hog production in multiple ways through increased supervision and penalties, differentiation of enforcement agents, and indiscriminate closure of farms with non-livestock production areas. Subsequently, employing the Difference-in-Difference approach, we empirically test the effects of these regulations on the hog industry using a unique panel of national county-level hog production data. Our results demonstrate an unexpected decline in hog production, primarily observed in the two key production areas. This suggests that China's hog industry has not experienced a dominant industrial layout adjustment in response to environmental regulation. These findings underscore the need for more precise regulatory standards and stronger enforcement bodies in China's future reforms, with an emphasis on central rather than local-based regulation. This approach is critical for maintaining stable production while reducing pollution.

AB  - Long-term monitoring of biodiversity in protected areas (PAs) is critical to assess threats, link conservation action to species outcomes, and facilitate improved management. Yet, rigorous longitudinal monitoring within PAs is rare. In Southeast Asia (SEA), there is a paucity of long-term wildlife monitoring within PAs, and many threatened species lack population estimates from anywhere in their range, making global assessments difficult. Here, we present new abundance estimates and population trends for 11 species between 2010 and 2020, and spatial distributions for 7 species, based on long-term line transect distance sampling surveys in Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary in Cambodia. These represent the first robust population estimates for four threatened species from anywhere in their range and are among the first long-term wildlife population trend analyses from the entire SEA region. Our study revealed that arboreal primates and green peafowl (Pavo muticus) generally had either stable or increasing population trends, whereas ungulates and semiarboreal primates generally had declining trends. These results suggest that ground-based threats, such as snares and domestic dogs, are having serious negative effects on terrestrial species. These findings have important conservation implications for PAs across SEA that face similar threats yet lack reliable monitoring data.

AB  - Neonatal iron deficiency anemia is prevalent among domestic pigs but does not occur in the offspring of wild boar. The main causes of this disorder in piglets of modern pig breeds are paucity of hepatic iron stores, high birth weight, and rapid growth. Replenishment of fetal iron stores is a direct result of iron transfer efficiency across the placenta. In this study, we attempted to investigate the molecular potential of iron transfer across the placenta as a possible cause of differences between wild boar and Polish Large White (PLW) offspring. Furthermore, by analyzing placentas from PLW gilts that had litters of different sizes, we aimed to elucidate the impact of the number of fetuses on placental ability to transport iron. Using RNA sequencing, we examined the expression of iron-related genes in the placentas from wild boar and PLW gilts. We did not reveal significant differences in the expression of major iron transporters among all analyzed placentas. However, in wild boar placentas, we found higher expression of copper-dependent ferroxidases such as ceruloplasmin, zyklopen, and hephaestin, which facilitate iron export to the fetal circulation. We also determined a close co-localization of ceruloplasmin and zyklopen with ferroportin, the only iron exporter.

AB  - Prevailing anthropocentric frameworks of animal husbandry in archaeological research are increasingly critiqued for their inability to capture the full spectrum of human-non-human systems. In west Siberia and northern Mongolia, reindeer herding communities practise an entwined multi-species lifeways with the subarctic boreal and forest ecosystems-but these practices lack secure archaeological chronologies and time depth in northeast Asia. Traces of reindeer herding and reindeer remains themselves are often under-represented in the depositional record, requiring alternative avenues for tracing the archaeology of reindeer herding. Here, we explore the potential of documenting these complex dynamics archaeologically through a proof-of-concept analysis of stable isotopic carbon and nitrogen in faunal bone collagen, which can represent a possible nexus of multi-species practices. In doing so, we seek to expand investigative potentials into both human and non-human community members, providing valuable, nuanced insights into past practices, hunter-herder interactions and domestication dynamics.This article is part of the theme issue 'Unravelling domestication: multi-disciplinary perspectives on human and non-human relationships in the past, present and future'.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a pervasive substance in our daily lives and livestock excreta, poses significant threats due to its infiltration into foods and water sources. BPA has adverse impacts on male reproductive function, particularly affecting the critical Sertoli (ST) cells that play a pivotal role in the process of spermatogonia differentiating into spermatozoa. In this study, we examined the prevalence of BPA within the pig industry and delved into the impact of BPA exposure on the motility of boar sperm, the function of pig ST cells, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms involved. This study revealed spatial disparities in the global distribution of BPA and its analogue contamination, utilizing data compiled from 130 comprehensive studies. The average concentration of BPA found in pig feed ranges from 9.7 to 47.9 mu g/kg, while in serum, it averages between 55.1 and 75.6 ng/L. The BPA concentration in feed exhibits a negative correlation with sperm viability and the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa. Exposure to BPA reduced sperm motility in boar and ST cell activity at both 6 and 24 h. The transcriptome analysis revealed that, compared to untreated control cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related genes were upregulated in ST cells exposed to BPA at 6 and 24 h. This activation of ERS in ST cells was mediated by receptor protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring protein-1 alpha (IRE1 alpha), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Additionally, BPA exposure triggered oxidative stress and a proinflammatory response mediated by the transcription factor NF-kappa B, accompanied by an increase in downstream proinflammatory cytokines. BPA exposure also led to apoptosis in ST cells and upregulated the expression levels of pro-apoptosis proteins. However, inhibiting ERS activity with 4-PBA attenuated the BPAinduced inflammatory response and apoptosis in ST cells. Our findings suggest that BPA induced apoptosis and inflammatory response in porcine ST cells through persistent activation of ERS, thereby compromising the normal function of these cells.

AB  - Isotopic analyses can be a useful tool in identifying animal exploitation patterns and herding strategies in the southern Levant. Here, carbon, oxygen, and strontium isotope analyses of domestic animal tooth enamel are used to investigate herd management at the Iron Age IIA site of Khirbet Summeily in Israel. The site was located in a prime ecological and political locale along the fringes of the emerging polity (potentially Judah), which ascended to regional significance by the Iron Age IIB. In order to understand the diets and movement of sheep, goats and cattle, we undertook intra-tooth sequential sampling and isotopic analyses of mandibular molars (n = 20). Re-sults suggest that the livestock recovered at Khirbet Summeily were raised in different locations with varied management patterns. Variation in the dietary intake of sheep and goats indicates that they were pastured in different ecological zones. While some goats were mobile across long-distances, the majority of livestock were from local and regionally managed herds. Alongside material evidence of exotic goods from nearby polities, our findings lend further support to the idea that Khirbet Summeily acted as a resource allocation outpost strate-gically located on the edge of a political entity (potentially Judah), suggesting a trend towards increased eco-nomic complexity during the Iron Age IIA.

AB  - Following a recent dramatic increase in illegal fishing by Indonesian fishing vessels in Australian waters in 2022, we conducted an extensive survey of coral reef communities covering 33,000 m2 at Mermaid Reef Marine Park in the Rowley Shoals off north-western Australia in July 2022. Species richness of sea cucumbers was 13 species (three CITES listed) and 6 species of giant clams (all CITES listed). The most abundant sea cucumber species were the low or intermediate value, asexually reproducing species Holothuria atra and H. edulis. Seventy-one percent of all sea cucumbers were found in the deep lagoon habitat despite this habitat comprising only about one-third of total survey effort. Most of the higher value species, such as CITES listed Thelenota ananas, were more abundant in the deep lagoon habitat. The exceptions to this pattern were H. whitmaei (CITES listed) and Actinopyga mauritiana (high value) and Bohadschia marmorata (intermediate value) that were most abundant on the reef flat, reef slope and shallow lagoon habitats respectively. The burrowing giant clam Tridacna crocea was abundant in all habitat types, whereas T. squamosa and Hippopus hippopus were most abundant on the western outer slope, T. gigas on the reef flat and T. derasa in the deep lagoon. The results of previous and subsequent surveys in 2003, 2018 and 2023 were compared with our 2022 survey. High value species that mainly occur in shallow water (e.g., H. whitmaei) were more abundant in 2003 while T. ananas and Stichopus herrmanni were more abundant in the deep lagoon habitat in 2022 and less abundant in the shallow habitats than they were in 2003 while there was no change in the more abundant, low to intermediate value species (e.g., H. atra, H. edulis). There were no significant differences in sea cucumber densities between 2022 and 2018 or 2023, however the comparison was confounded by the small number of 2018 and 2023 survey sites which were spread over multiple habitat types. Survey results were consistent with the expectation that illegal fishing by free-diving occurs predominantly in shallow and intertidal habitats and that sea cucumbers in those habitats are more vulnerable to fishing than those in deep water habitats. We were unable to ascertain levels of catches from Mermaid Reef or the Rowley Shoals as a whole, however there were numerous reports of vessels being intercepted with catches of many tonnes of sea cucumbers. At Mermaid Reef, to remove one tonne of sea cucumbers, from reef flat and shallow lagoon habitats would require harvesting all sea cucumbers from 38 ha (2037 individuals). This represents about 9% of the total area of reef flat and shallow lagoon at Mermaid Reef Marine Park and indicates how rapidly sea cucumber populations can be depleted through illegal fishing.

AB  - The food preferences and palatability of different plant species for snail and slug species in arable fields has been a major area of research in the past. The assumed diet of Helix pomatia (Linnaeus, 1758), however, provides an example of the limited knowledge of snail diets in nonagricultural habitats. This species has been described as a generalist herbivore, although it showed preferences for individual plant species in another study. Helix pomatia is considered a pest species, while also being listed as endangered in several Red Lists. In this study, the feeding activity of eight subpopulations of H. pomatia were recorded in a nature reserve in Cottbus, Germany, from April to October 2021 to understand food preferences and feeding behaviour. Along with the plant species on which feeding was observed, the height of feeding in the vegetation, shell width and height, number of whorls, and exposure to direct sunlight at observation sites were recorded. Results indicate that H. pomatia prefers Urtica dioica, and plant litter, which accounted for 35% and 44% of all observed feeding interactions respectively, as food resources, while generally only feeding on 27 of 143 available plant species. The importance of U. dioica as a food resource for 19 other terrestrial snail species is confirmed by 18 previous studies. In H. pomatia, analysis of the width and height of shells indicated that smaller, juvenile snails consumed plant material significantly higher up in vegetation as compared to adult snails, which fed closer to the ground. Awareness of the preference in H. pomatia for U. dioica as a food resource may be beneficial for land managers regarding the impact of this snail as an agriculture pest to crops. Urtica dioica is a very important food plant for terrestrial snails, and could play an important role in future species conservation strategies.

AB  - Background: Microbial communities in the gastrointestinal tract play a critical role in nutrient absorption, metabolism, and overall health of animals. Understanding the structure and function of tissue-specific microbial communities in Ningxiang pigs is essential for optimizing their growth, development, and nutritional efficiency. However, the diversity and functional roles of microbiota in different nutrient absorption tissues remain underexplored. Methods: We collected samples from four key nutrient absorption tissues (NFC: Cecal Content, NFI: Ileal Content, NFL: Colonic Content, NFG: Gastric Content, N = 6) of Ningxiang pigs and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to analyze microbial community composition. Bioinformatics analyses included alpha and beta diversity assessments, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) for biomarker identification, and PICRUSt2-based functional prediction. Comparative metabolic abundance analysis was conducted to explore functional differences among tissues. Results: Alpha diversity indices (ACE, Chao1, Simpson, and Shannon) revealed significant differences in microbial richness and evenness among the four tissues. At the phylum level, Firmicutes dominated the microbiota, while Bacteroidota was prominent in NFC and NFL. LEfSe analysis identified tissue-specific dominant microbial groups, such as f_Prevotellaceae in NFC, o_Lactobacillales in NFG, f_Clostridiaceae in NFI, and f_Muribaculaceae in NFL. Functional profiling using PICRUSt2 showed that the microbiota was primarily involved in organismal systems (e.g., aging, digestion), cellular processes (e.g., cell growth, transport), environmental information processing (e.g., signaling), genetic information processing (e.g., transcription, translation), and metabolic regulation (e.g., amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism). Comparative metabolic abundance analysis highlighted distinct functional profiles across tissues, with significant differences observed in pathways related to the immune system, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, transcriptional and translational regulation, and aging. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that tissue-specific microbial communities in Ningxiang pigs exhibit distinct structural and functional characteristics, which are closely associated with nutrient absorption and metabolic regulation. These results provide valuable insights into the roles of microbiota in the growth and health of Ningxiang pigs and pave the way for future studies on microbe-mediated nutritional interventions.

AB  - 1. In recent years, wildlife managers have been seeking ways to reduce the occurrence of independent, recreational human-wildlife feeding interactions, which continue to gain global popularity and may have negative effects for the humans and wildlife involved. Current popular methods, such as signage and posters, have yielded mixed results and their application is often interrupted, although the effects of these interruptions on feeding levels are currently unknown. This has led to calls to both identify a management option that can be applied successfully from a distance and to determine whether this action may assist in recovering long-term programmes from the potential effects of interruptions. MarketinCOVID-19 pandemic, other interruptions to funding) may have on ongoing management campaigns of this ilk. We recommend that media campaigns be explored as a potential tool to reduce the occurrence of the unregulated feeding of wildlife by humans in these sites, thereby promoting better human-wildlife coexistence.g and media tools have been shown to successfully change human behaviours in conservation campaigns, flagging them as a potential tool that could be applied to human-wildlife feeding management.
   2. Here, we performed a 4-year study using a wild fallow deer population in a popular urban green space as our model system. We tracked changes in human feeding behaviours across four different management stages. These included pre-management (stage 1), during traditional management (i.e. 'don't feed the deer' signage, stage 2), mid-interruption (i.e. COVID-19 pandemic, stage 3) and during the application of a structured media campaign (stage 4).
   3. We found that feeding by visitors decreased during traditional management (stage 2), but rapidly returned to premanagement levels during the interruption (stage 3) despite traditional controls still being in place. However, we discovered that feeding dropped significantly after the release of a media campaign (stage 4), despite the audience and conditions being unchanged. We also identified which imagery and educational messages resonated with viewers; information that can be applied to future campaigns in other locations.
   4. We, therefore, recommend that wildlife managers both investigate and be prepared for the negative effects that interruptions of any type (e.g. the recent COVID-19 pandemic, other interruptions to funding) may have on ongoing management campaigns of this ilk. We recommend that media campaigns be explored as a potential tool to reduce the occurrence of the unregulated feeding of wildlife by humans in these sites, thereby promoting better human-wildlife coexistence.

AB  - Pest-regulating natural enemies often require crop and non-crop habitats to persist and be effective. These habitats offer hibernation sites, alternative prey or floral resources but can also be complementary in when they provide resources. The relative contribution of these different habitats to the performance of pest-regulating insects is largely unknown, since it is difficult to study empirically. Landscape-based population-dynamical modelling can fill this research gap. In this study, we modelled the dynamics of predatory hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphinae) and their aphid prey in a collection of habitats. These hoverflies are dependent on different habitats for different reasons. While their larvae predate on aphids, adult hoverflies require floral resources. Resources are often segregated in different habitats. In addition, they are only temporarily available in any habitat type. In our model, hoverflies move between different habitats and select where to feed and where to produce off-spring based on optimal foraging considerations. The model represents habitats common in arable landscapes and their temporal availability of resources is parameterized based on field observations. The model shows that effective pest suppression will only occur in the presence of at least three different habitats, including two crops that provide prey resources at different times of the year. A woody habitat with shrubs and trees provide aphid prey very early and late in the season, whereas an early crop and a late crop cover the period in between. In addition, these habitats need to provide floral resources in the same period as aphids, for example by flower strips in the margins of crop fields or blossoming trees or shrubs in the woody habitat. Under the model assumptions, the best pest suppression is obtained when the woody habitats take up 6% to 10% of the landscape. In addition to yearly population fluctuations, also bi- or multi-yearly cycles may occur, depending on the composition of the landscape. Synthesis and applications. Our model shows when an agricultural landscape is 'complete' for natural enemies (and for effective pest control). For this, it needs to contain multiple habitats that supply floral and prey resources in different periods of the year.
   Veel natuurlijke vijanden die gewasplagen helpen bestrijden, hebben in het agrarische gebied diverse habitats nodig om te overleven en effectief te zijn. Deze habitats bieden overwinteringsplaatsen, alternatieve prooien, en bloemenvoedsel zoals pollen en nectar, maar kunnen ook complementair zijn doordat ze op verschillende momenten in het jaar voedsel bieden. De relatieve bijdrage van deze verschillende habitats aan de effectiviteit van plaagregulerende insecten is nog grotendeels onbekend, omdat het moeilijk is om dit proefondervindelijk te bepalen. Populatie-dynamische modellering op landschapsniveau kan echter meer inzicht geven. In deze studie hebben we de populatie-dynamiek gemodelleerd van luisetende zweefvliegen (Diptera: Syrphinae) en hun prooi, bladluizen, in een landschap met verschillende habitats. Deze zweefvliegen zijn om uiteenlopende redenen afhankelijk van verschillende habitats. Terwijl de larven zich voeden met bladluizen, hebben volwassen zweefvliegen bloemenvoedsel nodig. Deze voedselbronnen zijn vaak gescheiden in verschillende habitats en bovendien in elk type habitat slechts tijdelijk beschikbaar. In ons model kunnen zweefvliegen zich verplaatsen tussen de verschillende habitats en kiezen daarbij de plekken om zich te voeden en om nakomelingen te produceren op basis van optimale foerageerstrategie & euml;n. Het model omvat een verzameling van habitats dat veel voorkomt in akkerbouwgebieden, en de gemodelleerde beschikbaarheid van voedsel is gebaseerd op veldwaarnemingen. Ons model laat zien dat effectieve plaagonderdrukking alleen mogelijk is bij de aanwezigheid van ten minste drie verschillende habitats, waaronder twee gewassen die op verschillende tijdstippen in het jaar prooien bieden. Een houtig habitat met struiken en bomen biedt de zweefvliegen prooien zeer vroeg en laat in het seizoen, terwijl een vroeg gewas en een laat gewas de periode daartussen overbruggen. Bovendien moeten deze habitats bloemenvoedsel bieden in dezelfde periode dat de bladluizen actief zijn, bijvoorbeeld door bloemstroken in de akkerranden of door vroegbloeiende bomen en struiken in het houtige habitat. Volgens de modelaannames wordt de beste plaagonderdrukking verkregen wanneer de houtige habitats 6% tot 10% van het landschap beslaan. In aanvulling op de populatiefluctuaties gedurende het jaar kunnen ook twee- of meerjarige cycli optreden, afhankelijk van de samenstelling van het landschap. Synthese en toepassingen. Ons model laat zien wanneer een agrarisch landschap 'compleet' is voor de natuurlijke vijanden (en daarmee voor effectieve natuurlijk plaagbestrijding). Hiertoe moet het landschap bestaan uit meerdere habitats die verschillen in het tijdstip waarop ze geschikte bloemen en prooien aanbieden. Het biedt daarmee richtlijnen voor een meer optimale inrichting van het landschap.
   Our modelling study provides insights in the role of landscape complementation for natural pest control in arable crops by revealing where resource discontinuities can become bottlenecks. Effective natural pest control relies on a variety of different habitats that provide floral and prey resources during different times of the year, for example a woody habitat, an early crop such as winter wheat, a late crop such as potato and flowering field margins next to these crops. If any of these (or similarly functioning) habitats are absent from the landscape we can expect higher pest densities in the crops and larger fluctuations in pest densities over the years.image

AB  - In the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR), part of the Greater Kruger National Park, large tree densities decline due to the impact of browsing elephants (Loxodonta africana). Wire netting around the trunk of knobthorn (Senegalia nigrescens) and marula (Sclerocarya birrea) trees is used to protect individual trees. The success of the wire netting will depend on the species, the size of the tree, and variables that describe the tree's location in terms of its suitability for elephants. The objective of this study was therefore to quantify the impact of wire netting on tree survival, and to test whether tree, elephant and landscape variables were associated with tree survival. Data were collected from a nine-year survey of elephant impacts on tree species by Elephants Alive. Elephants Alive is a non-profit organisation whose mission is to ensure the survival of Africa's elephants through protection and research. A Cox proportional hazards model, that is, a survival analysis, was fitted for tree mortality and elephant impact over time. Wire netting significantly increased tree survival (p < 0.001), particularly for trees with a large diameter at breast height (DBH: 39-106 cm), and had a greater protective effect on large marula trees compared to knobthorn trees (p = 0.045). Landscape factors also influenced tree survival, with trees closer to the Kruger National Park (p < 0.001), at lower elevations (p = 0.001), and within 500-1500 m of water points (p = 0.074) having a higher risk of mortality. Trees further from roads (251-335 m) had higher survival (p = 0.073). These results suggest that wire netting is an effective mitigation tool for large trees in elephant-impacted landscapes, but its implementation should consider site-specific environmental factors and elephant movement patterns.

AB  - Because herbivory is a critical component of resilient reefs, there is a need to investigate the dynamics of herbivorous fish assemblages over various spatiotemporal scales. During the period of 2011-2019, 483 belt transect surveys were conducted across 26 sites around New Providence to assess the status of parrotfish populations across different reefs. Non-metric multidimensional scaling revealed two distinct parrotfish assemblages around New Providence temporally, differing between 2019 and earlier surveys, and spatially between fore and patch reef zones. Temporal analysis showed a significant decrease (59%) in parrotfish densities across reef sites and significant changes in mean density over time for three species Scarus iseri, Sparisoma aurofrenatum and Sp. atomarium. Changes in the size frequency distribution of parrotfish-particularly reductions in individuals >= 31 cm in size and the complete loss of fish >40 cm across all sites were found. Interactions between reef zone and size class were significant with the greater frequencies of larger individuals (>= 21 cm) driving patterns (positive associations) on forereefs. These patterns also appear to be partly driven by variability in the abundance and size composition of Sparisoma viride, which is one of the species primarily targeted by Bahamian fishers, as well as one of the most common parrotfish across reef zones.

AB  - Reproductive timing, location, and behavior are important characteristics that determine marine population dynamics, structure, and resilience to threats, including fishing and climate change. It is challenging to evaluate factors driving variability in these reproductive traits in wild fishes because of the difficulty observing individuals in their natural environments. In the present study, we used high-resolution depth, temperature, and acceleration time series recorded by pop-up satellite archival tags to (1) identify and characterize patterns in depth and acceleration that may be indicative of spawning events in large Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), and (2) estimate the effects of individual traits (body size and sex) and environmental factors (location and temperature) on spawning time and frequency. Unique rapid rises observed in the winter depth profiles were interpreted as spawning events. The initiation of the first presumed spawning rise was negatively correlated to water temperature experienced during the prespawning season, suggesting that currently increasing water temperature in the Gulf of St. Lawrence may induce phenological change in halibut spawning time. The number of rises of batch-spawning females was unrelated to female body size. The present study demonstrates how electronic tagging can be used for in-depth characterization of timing, location, and behaviors associated with spawning in a large flatfish species. Such information can inform spatiotemporal management and conservation measures aiming to protect species from directed fishing and by-catch during spawning.

AB  - For wildlife inhabiting snowy environments, snow properties such as onset date, depth, strength, and distribution can influence many aspects of ecology, including movement, community dynamics, energy expenditure, and forage accessibility. As a result, snow plays a considerable role in individual fitness and ultimately population dynamics, and its evaluation is, therefore, important for comprehensive understanding of ecosystem processes in regions experiencing snow. Such understanding, and particularly study of how wildlife-snow relationships may be changing, grows more urgent as winter processes become less predictable and often more extreme under global climate change. However, studying and monitoring wildlife-snow relationships continue to be challenging because characterizing snow, an inherently complex and constantly changing environmental feature, and identifying, accessing, and applying relevant snow information at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, often require a detailed understanding of physical snow science and technologies that typically lie outside the expertise of wildlife researchers and managers. We argue that thoroughly assessing the role of snow in wildlife ecology requires substantive collaboration between researchers with expertise in each of these two fields, leveraging the discipline-specific knowledge brought by both wildlife and snow professionals. To facilitate this collaboration and encourage more effective exploration of wildlife-snow questions, we provide a five-step protocol: (1) identify relevant snow property information; (2) specify spatial, temporal, and informational requirements; (3) build the necessary datasets; (4) implement quality control procedures; and (5) incorporate snow information into wildlife analyses. Additionally, we explore the types of snow information that can be used within this collaborative framework. We illustrate, in the context of two examples, field observations, remote-sensing datasets, and four example modeling tools that simulate spatiotemporal snow property distributions and, in some cases, evolutions. For each type of snow data, we highlight the collaborative opportunities for wildlife and snow professionals when designing snow data collection efforts, processing snow remote sensing products, producing tailored snow datasets, and applying the resulting snow information in wildlife analyses. We seek to provide a clear path for wildlife professionals to address wildlife-snow questions and improve ecological inference by integrating the best available snow science through collaboration with snow professionals.

AB  - The palatability of a plant refers to the degree of attraction or preference that animals show toward that particular plant. Various factors can influence palatability, including the plant's chemical composition, texture, taste, aromas, and the circumstances under which herbivorous animals consume it. The study aims to assess the plant species composition in grasslands and pastures within the Danube Delta, Romania. Both old or new references on palatability were considered. The evaluation of plant composition and degree of plant palatability was carried out in 12 grazing areas in the Danube Delta and the surrounding region. The study revealed 121 plant species identified in some pastures. Of these, 31 were "Non-Palatable", 16 were "Highly Palatable", 32 were "Mostly Palatable", 16 were "Less Palatable", and 26 were "Rarely Palatable". Animals preferred 60 plant species in their fresh condition, with 29 preferred in fresh and dry. Most animals consumed whole plants (48 species), followed by leaves (43 species), fruits (three species), and inflorescences (two species). By analysing the feeding preferences of animals, it was found that cows exhibited a preference for the broadest range of plants (75 species), followed by sheep (67 species), goats (59 species), and horses (34 species). Domestic animals like goats, sheep, cows, and horses may prefer certain plants based on nutritional content or digestibility while avoiding toxic plants. The study showed that the investigated areas have a diverse flora with a varied supply of plants, including palatable species. The palatability index is essential in assessing the quality of pastures, especially in obtaining average daily gains based on the species of animals living on the pastures. Considering the dynamic climatic conditions and poor pasture quality in the Danube Delta, more detailed and interdisciplinary studies are needed to understand the deltaic biocenoses comprehensively.

AB  - BackgroundAn abundance of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in suburban communities can lead to problems such as increased deer-vehicle collisions (DVCs), tick-borne illnesses, and forest degradation. Deer populations can be managed using traditional lethal methods; however, these methods are often impractical, ineffective, or socially unacceptable, prompting interest in management alternatives, including fertility control. Some fertility control methods (such as vasectomy, tubal ligation, and porcine zona pellucida-based vaccines) cause unsuccessfully bred females to experience multiple estrous cycles, potentially altering their movement behavior and fine-scale activity. Such changes could increase the risk of DVCs and negatively affect the physical condition of the animals. However, the effects of such treatments on animal behavior remain poorly understood, specifically in terms of breeding-related movements and energetics. This study aimed to evaluate the behavioral impacts of a large-scale vasectomy program on white-tailed deer.MethodsWe conducted a 2-year study using a treatment/control design and analyzed biologging data of white-tailed deer at two sites near New York City, USA. We used a moving-window approach to assess the effects of a large-scale vasectomy program on the seasonal changes in movement behavior (home-range size, distance traveled, diffusion, and excursivity) and fine-scale activity (time spent in low-activity states and the daily number of state transitions).ResultsThere were no biologically significant differences in movement behavior or activity trends in either sex between the treatment and control groups. Females in both groups exhibited similar trends in all movement metrics, but females at the treatment site tended to switch between activity states more often in winter. Males at the treatment site expanded their space use less than control males during peak breeding season but otherwise exhibited similar movement behavior trends. Mortality rates and causes were similar at both sites.ConclusionsThe vasectomy program, despite causing extra estrus periods in unsuccessfully bred females, is unlikely to cause appreciable behavioral changes that could exacerbate management-related issues at the time scales investigated. Fertility control methods inducing extra estrus periods could be implemented alone or alongside other strategies to reduce abundant deer populations with minimal impact on behavior.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems (SPS) are strategic in neutralizing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions in livestock production systems, particularly in the tropics. This research assessed the mitigation potential of SPS on the carbon footprint (CFP) neutralizing in one integrated livestock farm of cow-calf and pig production system in the Colombian Amazon. Annual carbon accumulation rate (ACAR) in MgCO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1), was evaluated on living above-ground biomass including trees and shrubs > 2 cm DBH and pasture, and leaf litter and below-ground biomass including coarse and fine roots, soil organic carbon 0-10 cm deep, and total ACAR adding up all components in live fences (LF), scattered trees (ST), fallows (FW), fodder bank (FB) and pastures (PT). The GHG emissions in MgCO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1) were accounted in CO2 from liming, urea, fuel, electricity, and supplementation, CH4 from enteric methane, manure, and organic fertilization and N2O from urine and manure. The C balance was obtained from the differences between ACAR of SPS on farm and the CFP per surface. Mean total ACAR expressed in MgC ha(-1)y(-1) were 9.0 +/- 4.6 in FW, 7.0 +/- 1.2 in LF, 5.5 +/- 0.8 in ST, 4.2 +/- 0.2 in FB and 2.9 +/- 0.1 in PT. Mean CFP was 3.7 MgCO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1), 5.3 MgCO(2)e Live Weight ha(-1)y(-1), and 23.6 MgCO(2)e Live Weight Gain y(-1). The CFP (area) can be neutralized with total ACAR value of 2.1 ha(-1) for LF, 1.6 ha(-1) for FW, 2.6 ha(-1) for ST, 3.5 ha(-1) for FB and 5.1 ha(-1) for PT. The Silvopastoral systems have a higher potential for neutralizing GHG emissions than pasture-based scenario when considering the ACAR in above-ground biomass.

AB  - Fjords provide unique habitats for large cold-water coral (CWC) reefs, typically growing on sills and vertical walls. Fjord reefs are among the most thriving CWC reefs in Norway. Yet, these reefs, especially the wall reefs, are notoriously understudied. Here, we mapped the biomass, total carbon (C) stocks and C turnover (as respiration) of the reef-building coral Lophelia pertusa (syn. Desmophyllum pertusum), and dominant, large CWC reefassociated suspension feeders (the sponges Geodia barretti and Mycale lingua, the CWC Madrepora oculata and the bivalve Acesta excavata) within the Hardangerfjord, Norway. Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) recorded videos from wall and sill reefs were used to estimate species-specific biomass. Coupled with high resolution terrain data (2 x 2 m), predictive maps of species biomass were produced using a random forest (RF) model. The resulting biomass data were integrated with species-specific C content and C respiration rates from literature to estimate C stocks and C turnover of wall versus sill reefs. Area-specific results from the RF models reveal that wall reefs had a higher habitat suitability for all species except L. pertusa, which was more dominant on the sills. Accordingly, the wall reefs supported an up to 11 times higher biomass, C stock, and turnover for all species, except for L. pertusa, which had two-fold higher values on the sill reef. As a result, the wall reefs showed a 1.5 to 4.8 times higher total mean C turnover by dominant suspension feeders (all studied species) compared to the sill reefs. With their high C turnover and their presumably wide distribution in Norwegian fjords and globally, benthic wall reef megafauna may have a substantial, but overlooked biomass and functional role within CWC reef systems.

AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;The usual castration of male fattening pigs is under discussion, especially in organic farming, because of the negative effects on the pig's welfare and integrity. Nevertheless, it is feared that boars show more aggressive and mounting behaviours, resulting in stress, painful injuries and lameness, and that their meat has an unpleasant odour/taste (called "boar taint "). Therefore, it was examined to which extent these concerns come true under commercial organic conditions. Additionally, influences from management and husbandry were investigated, in order to identify conditions in organic fattening systems with low risk to welfare and meat quality. Despite more agonistic and mounting behaviours in boars compared to castrates, especially if housed next to females, no increased numbers of skin lesions, lame pigs, disease treatments or deaths were observed. Less skin lesions occurred when more space was provided. A moderate rate of wounds on penises was found, but not on farms with bulky straw bedding. A small number of carcasses (1.44%) were excluded from processing because of boar taint. In conclusion, boar fattening under the examined organic conditions appears to be a feasible alternative to castration, but penile injuries should be monitored at slaughter.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   The welfare of male fattening pigs may be improved by refraining from castration, but may be compromised, in turn, by harmful social behaviour in groups of boars. In addition, boar taint may be problematic. This study aimed to evaluate these potential problems in boar fattening under commercial organic conditions. In total, 625 boars were compared with 433 barrows and 83 gilts regarding their social behaviour, lesions and lameness at 80 kg, before and after split marketing. The mixed-model analysis showed that significantly more short agonistic interactions, fights and mounting behaviours were observed in groups of boars. Agonistic interactions were reduced in spring/summer and when boars grew older. Fights and mounts were increased when boars had contact to female pigs in the neighbouring pen. No effect of split marketing, growth rate, homogeneity of groups, group size, feeding space and illumination hours could be detected. Increased interaction frequencies did not result in significantly more skin lesions, lameness, treatments or mortality. Increased space allowance reduced skin lesions. On 9.8% of the dissected boars' penises, wounds were detected; they were absent on two farms with generous litter provision. Boar taint prevalence, as detected by human nose method, was 1.44%. Under the studied organic husbandry conditions, boar fattening appears to be practicable, although penile injuries should be monitored at slaughter.</p>

AB  - Many cities demolish abandoned homes and create regreened vacant lots (RVLs), and an increasingly popular, high-intensity use of RVLs is as urban agriculture (UA) sites. UA may potentially result in higher nitrogen (N) runoff to aquatic ecosystems, but this potential has not been quantified. We examined the role that varying land reuse intensity plays in determining potential for N export via runoff or leaching, focusing on soil N availability and N removal capacity via denitrification. We contrasted three levels of land use intensity for vacant parcels: intact vacant properties, turfgrass RVLs, and regreened UA lots in Buffalo, NY. We examined soil N and C availability, denitrification potential, and isotopic evidence of denitrification. Land use intensity only affected soil properties in surficial soil horizons. Total N was 2.5x higher in UA soils (mean = 0.51%) than non-UA (mean = 0.21%). Soil nitrate was 2.6x higher in winter (mean = 12.4 mu g NO3--N g-1) than summer (mean = 4.7 mu g NO3--N g-1) and was generally higher in UA soils. Despite higher soil N availability at UA sites, there were no differences in denitrification potential between UA and non-UA sites (mean = 620 ng N g soil-1 h-1). Isotopic evidence further confirms that denitrification was not a major sink of N. As UA had high N availability compared to non-UA sites and low rates of denitrification, UA has potential for runoff-driven N export, particularly of organic N, though lower nitrate concentrations than values typical for conventional agricultural soils make nitrate leaching less of a concern by comparison.

AB  - Mining activities in Canada's pristine Arctic (e.g., driving on unpacked roads, blasts, rock grinding, diesel combustion, and garbage incineration) could add local sources of airborne fine particulate matter with a diameter of < 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) to their surrounding area. The increase in PM2.5 above the background level around a mine represents a potential disturbance to caribou. To quantify the spatial distribution of the elevated PM2.5, we investigated three different sampling schemes to measure PM2.5 concentration using a portable monitor. We found that the best sampling scheme was to use the regional background PM2.5 as the reference and analyze the anomaly of PM2.5 measured at sites around the mine complex from the background level. The regional background PM2.5 values were measured at the Daring Lake Tundra Research Station during 2018 and 2019. Our results indicated that the background PM2.5 was not a low and constant value but varied with rain events, wind direction, and the impacts of forest fire smoke. After excluding periods affected by forest fires smokes, we found the background PM2.5 was close to 0 mu g m(-3) for the first few hours after rain, and then increased logistically with the time after rain (t(ar)) to the maximum of 5 (or 10) mu g m(-3) when the wind came from the north (or south) of the NW-SE axis. The NW-SE axis in western Canada divides the tundra north with few anthropogenic PM2.5 sources from the forested south with many PM2.5 sources from forest fire smokes and human activities. Analyses of PM2.5 anomaly from the background (i.e., PM2.5 measured at a site around the mining complex-the background level at the corresponding t(ar) and wind direction) revealed that the zone of elevated PM2.5 around the mine (Z(epm)) expanded with t(ar). In the first few hours after rain, PM2.5 was close to 0 everywhere except within meters of a source (e.g., a truck exhaust) in the downwind direction. During t(ar) = 6 to 96 h, Z(epm) expanded to 6.3 km in the downwind direction when the wind came from south of the NW-SE axis. A similar result was found in the downwind direction when the wind came from north of the NW-SE axis, with Z(epm) = 4.4 km. In the upwind direction, the value of Z(epm) was much smaller, being 0.7 km (or 1.0 km) when the wind came from the north (or south) of the NW-SE axis. For the period of t(ar) between 96 and 192 hours, Z(epm) further expanded to 21.2 km when the wind from the south of the NW-SE axis. The results from this study indicated that this reference paradigm that uses the regional background PM2.5 as the reference in combination with a portable PM2.5 monitor worked well for quantifying the tempo-spatial patterns of PM2.5 at locations in remote and mostly pristine Arctic. However, their effectiveness for other regions needs further investigation.

AB  - Gut microbiota play a fundamental role in the nutrition of many vertebrate herbivores through foregut and hindgut fermentation of plant carbohydrates. Some species of marine herbivorous fishes contain moderate to high levels of short-chain fatty acids in the hindgut, indicating the importance of hindgut fermentation. Herbivorous fish hindgut microbiota are diverse and can vary with geographic location, but data on the scale of geographic variation involving a few km of separation are limited. Here, we used the 16S rRNA gene to describe community composition of the gut microbiota of the herbivorous species Kyphosus vaigiensis and K. cinerascens collected in the vicinity of Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, in 2011 and 2017. Microbiota community structure differed between posterior hindgut sections, host species, sampling years and two mid-shelf and outer reef locations approximately 20 km apart. Hindgut bacterial community composition varied remarkably between mid-shelf and outer reef locations, and among individual fish on the mid-shelf reef. In both fish species, the most abundant phyla were Pseudomonadota, Bacillota and Bacteroidota, followed by Spirochaetota, Thermodesulfobacteriota and Verrucomicrobiota. There were no clear differences between the host species in terms of the relative abundance and composition of bacterial genera in outer reef samples. In contrast, the dominant genera differed between mid-shelf samples of K. cinerascens and K. vaigiensis, being Endozoicomonas-like (Pseudomonadota) and Brevinema (Spirochaetota), respectively. Endozoicomonas are emerging as important symbionts in many marine hosts worldwide and are thought to be important in the coral sulphur cycle. Differences in microbiota composition were not associated with variation in fish condition, suggesting that the different microbial taxa perform equivalent functional roles.

AB  - Rapid development and deforestation in Peninsular Malaysia have degraded and fragmented the tropical forest, impacting the survival of many megafauna species. With reduced space to roam, Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) may extend their range into the altered landscape, leading to human-elephant conflict (HEC). HEC is defined as any interactions between wild elephants and humans that result in negative effects on both humans and elephants. Although known as a keystone species in the region, spatial studies comparing conflict and non-conflict elephants have never been done before. In this study, we used GPS satellite collar data for five conflict and seven non-conflict elephants from 2012 to 2021. We mapped their home ranges, identified hotspots, and estimated the proportion of habitat use (area and time spent) across the Managed Elephant Ranges of Peninsular Malaysia. We found that nine of the 12 elephants spent >90 % of their time in their home range and >95 % of their time in hotspots in forested areas regardless of conflict status. redefining of conflict status as spending <53 % of the time in the home range and <41 % in hotspots in forested areas. However, conflict elephants moved significantly farther on the daily average than non-conflict elephants. Our findings highlight the importance of redefining the conflict status of elephants based on threat levels and habitat use to consider the rapidly degrading habitat that signals human-elephant coexistence.

AB  - Reintroductions are a fundamental tool in wildlife management and conservation. Monitoring and reporting are crucial for establishing protocols for threatened species. Here we report the full translocation process of the very first reintroduction of the Apennine chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) ever made that took place in Majella National Park (Central Apennines, Italy) with the release of 22 females and 18 males in 1991-2006 period. We described the pre and post release methodologies, the population and distribution dynamics, and the present status and structure of the population. Through systematic monitoring, we assessed the increase in distribution range (from 7.9 km(2) in 2000 up to 23.9 km(2) in 2022 for females with kids). Considering a time span of 25 years, the population now exceeds 1300 individuals and still shows a growing trend. Quite large mixed groups (up to > 200 individuals) are frequently seen while the largest male-only group ever seen thus far numbered 71 individuals. Overall sex ratio MM:FF reached 1.1, while the birth rate decreased from 0.70 to 0.80 in early 2010 ' s to 0.35-0.55 in 2021-2022, showing a potential density dependence effect and highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring to identify potential limiting factors to habitat suitability or carrying capacity of reintroduced populations.

AB  - Monitoring methods based on Indigenous knowledge have the potential to contribute to our understanding of large watersheds. Research in large, complex, and dynamic ecosystems suggests a participatory approach to monitoring-that builds on the diverse knowledges, practices, and beliefs of local people-can yield more meaningful outcomes than a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Here we share the results of 12 community-based, participatory monitoring projects led by Indigenous governments and organizations in the Mackenzie River Basin (2015-2018). Specifically, we present and compare the indicators and monitoring methods developed by each of these community-based cases to demonstrate the specificity of place, culture, and context. A scalar analysis of these results suggests that the combination of core (common) indicators used across the basin, coupled with others that are meaningful at local level, create a methodological bricolage-a mix of tools, methods, and rules-in-use that are fit together. Our findings, along with those of sister projects in two other major watersheds (Amazon, Mekong), confront assumptions that Indigenous-led community-based monitoring efforts are too local to offer insights about large-scale systems. In summary, a networked approach to community-based monitoring that can simultaneously engage with local- and watershed-level questions of social and ecological change can address gaps in knowledge. Such an approach can create both practices and outcomes that are useful to local peoples as well as to those engaged in basin-wide governance.

AB  - Grasshoppers are one of the most predominant insects in the grasslands of the southern Pampas. In this region, Dichroplus elongatus, Dichroplus maculipennis, Dichroplus pratensis and Borellia bruneri are the most abundant species and have the greatest economic importance. This study aimed to assess the relationship between temporal changes in the density of these species and climate variables associated with temperature and rainfall over an 11-year study period., We monitored 22 sites in different areas of Laprida county from 2005 to 2016. A total of 25 grasshopper species were collected. The most abundant species were D. maculipennis and B. bruneri which reached the highest densities from 2008-2009 to 2010-2011. The rainfall accumulated from September (RAS) to the sampling date and the number of rainy days (RD) largely explained the density variation of B. bruneri. Besides RD and RAS, winter rainfall, rainfall accumulated from October to the sampling date, and thermal amplitude of October (TAO) influenced the density of D. maculipennis. Our results indicated that seasons with less rainfall and fewer RD favored these two species' abundance. We identified that the RD and TAO contributed significantly to variations in the density of D. elongatus. In contrast to the other two species, we recorded D. elongatus in seasons with high rainfall and high RD. A better understanding of the climate influence on the life cycle of these economically important insects may identify key factors in their population dynamics which in turn may improve management options.

AB  - Urban environments frequently play an important role in the initial stages of biological invasions, often serving as gateways for non-native species, which may propagate to nearby natural and agricultural ecosystems in the event of spillover. In California, citrus trees are a dominant ornamental and food plant in urban and peri-urban environments. We studied the invasion dynamics of the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), which became widespread in urban areas of southern California starting in 2008, to understand the factors driving its more recent invasion in commercial citrus groves. Using a multi-year monitoring database, we applied a suite of models to evaluate the rate at which groves accrued their first D. citri detection and the cumulative number of detections thereafter. Grove characteristics and landscape context proved to be important, with generally higher invasion rates and more cumulative detections in groves that were larger, had more edge, or had more perforated shapes, with greater urbanization intensity favoring more rapid invasion, but with inconsistent effects of distance to roads among models. Notably, distance to urban or other grove occurrences proved to be among the most important variables. During the early phase of D. citri invasion in the region, groves closer to urban occurrences were invaded more rapidly, whereas more recently, invasion rate depended primarily on proximity to grove occurrences. Yet, proximity to urban and grove occurrences contributed positively to cumulative D. citri detections, suggesting a continued influx from both sources. These results suggest that inherent features of agroecosystems and spatial coupling with urban ecosystems can be important, temporally dynamic, drivers of biological invasions. Further consideration of these issues may guide the development of strategic responses to D. citri's ongoing invasion.

AB  - Bamboo is an enigmatic forage, representing a niche food for pandas and bamboo lemurs. Bamboo might not represent a suitable forage for herbivores relying on fermentative digestion, potentially due to its low fermentability. To test this hypothesis, guinea pigs (n = 36) were used as model species and fed ad libitum with one of three forages (bamboo, lucerne, or timothy grass) in a fresh or dried state, with six individuals per group, for 3 weeks. The nutrient composition and in vitro fermentation profile of bamboo displayed low fermentation potential, i.e. high lignin and silica levels together with a gas production (Hohenheim gas test) at 12 h of only 36% of that of lucerne and grass. Although silica levels were more abundant in the leftovers of (almost) all groups, guinea pigs did not select against lignin on bamboo. Dry matter (DM) intake was highest and DM digestibility lowest on the bamboo forage. Total short-chain fatty acid levels in caecal content were highest for lucerne and lowest for grass and bamboo. Bamboo-fed guinea pigs had a lower body weight gain than the grass and lucerne group. The forage hydration state did not substantially affect digestion, but dry forage led to a numerically higher total wet gut fill. Although guinea pigs increased DM intake on the bamboo diet, the negative effects on fermentation of lignin and silica in bamboo seemed overriding. For herbivores that did not evolutionary adapt, bamboo as an exclusive food resource can be considered as inadequate.

AB  - High standards in managing the seed-supply chain, emphasizing sourcing and seed storage, are crucial to maintaining seed viability and ultimately to meeting restoration goals. The germination of 40 plant species was investigated in response to difficulties experienced by restoration practitioners in propagating them from seed in nurseries and in direct seeding. The species were from a biodiversity hotspot in inland eastern Australia and spanned a range of life-forms. The initial constraint identified was poor seed viability, which varied widely within and between species but was < 50% in at least one seedlot of 36 species. Low seed viability was indicated by poor seed storage and processing practices, manifest in excessive storage time, herbivory, fungal infection, and inadequate seed collection and processing (e.g. collection of immature seed and overcleaning). The main reason for low germination of viable species was seed dormancy. Dormancy was identified in 16 species: pre-sowing treatments in these species were effective in relieving dormancy or increasing germination percentage by two to three-fold. The most frequent pre-sowing treatment required was scarification. Stratification, de-husking and leaching also increased germination in some species. Temperature conditions for high germination were also investigated. Seasonal temperature treatments affected germination in 22 species. The results emphasize the necessity for (1) testing seed before use; (2) identifying temperature ranges to achieve maximum germination; (3) identifying species with germination constraints, and (4) using suitable pre-sowing treatments for plant propagation in nurseries and potentially in the field.

AB  - The 1983-1984 die-off of the long-spined sea urchin Diadema antillarum stands out as a catastrophic marine event because of its detrimental effects on Caribbean coral reefs. Without the grazing activities of this key herbivore, turf and macroalgae became the dominant benthic group, inhibiting coral recruitment and compromising coral reef recovery from other disturbances. In the decades that followed, recovery of D. antillarum populations was slow to non-existent. In late January 2022, a new mass mortality of D. antillarum was first observed in the U.S. Virgin Islands. We documented the spread and extent of this new die-off using an online survey. Infected individuals were closely monitored in the lab to record signs of illness, while a large population on Saba, Dutch Caribbean, was surveyed weekly before and during mortality to determine the lethality of this event. Within four months the die-off was distributed over 1,300 km from north to south and 2,500 km east to west. Whereas the 1983-1984 die-off advanced mostly with the currents, the 2022 event has appeared far more quickly in geographically distant areas. First die-off observations in each jurisdiction were often close to harbor areas, which, together with their rapid appearance, suggests that anthropogenic factors may have contributed to the spread of the causative agent. The signs of illness in sick D. antillarum were very similar to those recorded during the 1983-1984 die-off: lack of tube feet control, slow spine reaction followed by their loss, and necrosis of the epidermis were observed in both lab and wild urchins. Affected populations succumbed fast; within a month of the first signs of illness, a closely monitored population at Saba, Dutch Caribbean, had decreased from 4.05 individuals per m(2) to 0.05 individuals per m(2). Lethality can therefore be as high as 99%. The full extent of the 2022 D. antillarum die-off event is not currently known. The slower spread in the summer of 2022 might indicate that the die-off is coming to a (temporary) standstill. If this is the case, some populations will remain unaffected and potentially supply larvae to downstream areas and augment natural recovery processes. In addition, several D. antillarum rehabilitation approaches have been developed in the past decade and some are ready for large scale implementation. However, active conservation and restoration should not distract from the primary goal of identifying a cause and, if possible, implementing actions to decrease the likelihood of future D. antillarum die-off events.

AB  - Fishes are the component that performs the transport of nutrients in the pelagic of the Lake Shkodra. They constitute one of the few links of the food chains, which in food regimes is dominated by herbivorous-detrital structures and which contribute to the ecological stability. Market fishes constitute the main biomass of the lake fish community, therefore the study of the situation of their populations is important in terms of problems and management, for a sustainable fishing. Situations of fish populations have been studied through the assessment of threatened species (CR, EN, VU), based on declining of catch (IUCN, Version 3.1 of Red List of Threatened Species, 2001 Categories & Criteria). Alburnus scoranza and Chondrostoma nassus are defined in the CR category. Carassius gibelio (that compete Cyprinus carpio), Perca fluviatilis and Leucos basak predominate in catch and should continue so for a long time. In the Montenegrin part of the lake there is a large decrease in the catch of migratory species to the sea. Catching of fish should be planned in accordance with the lake productivity, licensed for catching in detail by species, as well as controlled in detail. Factors leading to negative developments, such as water regime disturbance, the presence of pollutants, damage of the shore vegetation, erosion and especially illegal fishing, should also be monitored.

AB  - The late Pleistocene was a climatically dynamic period, with abrupt shifts between cool-wet and warmdry conditions. Increased effective precipitation supported large pluvial lakes and long-lived spring ecosystems in valleys and basins throughout the western and southwestern U.S., but the source and seasonality of the increased precipitation are debated. Increases in the proportions of C4/(C4+ C3) grasses in the diets of large grazers have been ascribed both to increases in summer precipitation and lower atmospheric CO2 levels. Here we present stable carbon and oxygen isotope data from tooth enamel of late Pleistocene herbivores recovered from paleowetland deposits at Tule Spring Fossil Beds National Monument in the Las Vegas Valley of southern Nevada, as well as modern herbivores from the surrounding area. We use these data to investigate whether winter or summer precipitation was responsible for driving the relatively wet hydroclimate conditions that prevailed in the region during the late Pleistocene. We also evaluate whether late Pleistocene grass C4/(C4+ C3) was higher than today, and potential drivers of any changes.Tooth enamel 818O values for Pleistocene Equus, Bison, and Mammuthus are generally low (average 22.0 +/- 0.7%0, 2 s.e., VSMOW) compared to modern equids (27.8 +/- 1.5%0), and imply lower water 818O values (-16.1 +/- 0.8%0) than modern precipitation (-10.5%0) or in waters present in active springs and wells in the Las Vegas Valley (-12.9%0), an area dominated by winter precipitation. In contrast, tooth enamel of Camelops (a browser) generally yielded higher 818O values (23.9 +/- 1.1%0), possibly suggesting drought tolerance. Mean 813C values for the Pleistocene grazers (-6.6 +/- 0.7%0, 2 s.e., VPDB) are considerably higher than for modern equids (-9.6 +/- 0.4%0) and indicate more consumption of C4 grass (17 +/- 5%) than today (4 +/- 4%). However, calculated C4 grass consumption in the late Pleistocene is strikingly lower than the proportion of C4 grass taxa currently present in the valley (55e60%). 813C values in Camelops tooth enamel (-7.7 +/- 1.0%0) are interpreted as reflecting moderate consumption (14 +/- 8%) of Atriplex (saltbush), a C4 shrub that flourishes in regions with hot, dry summers.Lower water 818O values, lower abundance of C4 grasses, and the inferred presence of Atriplex are all consistent with general circulation models for the late Pleistocene that show enhanced delivery of winter precipitation, sourced from the north Pacific, into the interior western U.S. but do not support alternative models that infer enhanced delivery of summer precipitation, sourced from the tropics. In addition, we hypothesize that dietary competition among the diverse and abundant Pleistocene fauna may have driven the grazers analyzed here to feed preferentially on C4 grasses. Dietary partitioning, especially when combined with decreased pCO2 levels during the late Pleistocene, can explain the relatively high 813C values observed in late Pleistocene grazers in the Las Vegas Valley and elsewhere in the southwestern U.S. without requiring additional summer precipitation.

AB  - The waters around Nosy Be in northwest Madagascar are well-known for the occurrence of large planktivores, such as whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) and Omura's whales (Balaenoptera omurai). Between 2016 and 2022, sighting data on mobulid rays were opportunistically collected during tourism activities. Additional sources, including citizen science submissions, tourism operator reports, and social media records, were used to compile sightings of three mobulid ray species. A total of 255 encounters were documented, with Mobula mobular (n = 165) being the most common, followed by M. birostris (n = 60) and M. kuhlii (n = 30). Notably, the absence of confirmed M. alfredi records since 2015 suggests a potential local decline. This study highlights Nosy Be as a habitat for mobulid rays and emphasises the necessity for further species monitoring, ongoing identification of potential threats, and management initiatives aiming at reducing mortality from gillnet fishing.

AB  - Understanding spatiotemporal trends on insect-plant interaction networks is essential to unveil the ecological and evolutionary processes driving herbivore specialisation. However, community studies accounting for temporal dynamics in host-plant specialisation of herbivorous insects are surprisingly scarce. Here, we investigated how seasonality affects specialisation of a temperate forest herbivore community. A substantial body of literature suggests that young plant foliage tends to be more protected by defence mechanisms effective against generalist insect herbivores than mature leaves. We thus hypothesised that herbivore specialisation would be highest in the early season, when young leaves are available, and that the degree of dietary specialisation would decline with leaf maturation. To test this hypothesis, we sampled more than 4700 folivorous caterpillars associated with 16 tree species within a 0.2 ha deciduous forest stand in eastern North America. We further examined the dietary specialisation of exposed feeders versus shelter builders (e.g. leaf rollers, leaf tiers, webbers). Contrary to our prediction, we observed a significantly less specialised herbivore fauna in the early season than in the two subsequent summer seasons. We further found that the seasonal increase in specialisation was driven by a remarkable turnover in species composition rather than by shifts in guild structure or intraspecific changes in diet breadth of the herbivores. These findings run counter to the widespread belief that young leaves are less susceptible to generalist insect herbivores. Our study underscores the need to account for temporal dynamics when contrasting herbivore specialisation among sites with pronounced seasonality.

AB  - Simple Summary Cephenemyiosis is a myiasis developing in the nasal cavity and pharynx of roe deer; it is widely spread in the range of distribution of this ungulate in Europe. In the last decade, this myiasis is expanding its distribution along its southernmost and northernmost range margins in Europe; thus, it is of the utmost importance to unravel all the epidemiological and clinical aspects of this myiasis, as well as implementing surveillance measures including reliable and non-invasive diagnostic techniques to monitor its expansion and adaptation to different ecosystems and/or hosts and to reduce the negative impact on roe deer populations. Cephenemyia stimulator is a Palearctic species developing in the nasal cavity and pharynx of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). It is widely spread in the range of distribution of this ungulate in Europe. Since the first report of C. stimulator in Spain in 2001, a rapid geographic expansion has been observed, first in the north of the country, with high prevalence and intensities of infestation that caused some mortal cases, and, lately, also in Extremadura and Andalucia, the southernmost populations of European roe deer. These observations suggest an adaptation of this parasite to different ecosystems of the Iberian Peninsula. Almost simultaneously, C. stimulator is also expanding its range to northern Europe, with the first cases being reported in Sweden. Thus, Cephenemyia stimulator may be an example of a parasite currently displaying distributional changes along its southernmost and northernmost range margins. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to unravel all the epidemiological and clinical aspects of this myiasis, as well as implementing surveillance measures including reliable and non-invasive diagnostic techniques to monitor its expansion and adaptation to different ecosystems and/or hosts and to reduce the negative impact on roe deer populations.

AB  - Dietary studies provide key insights into threats and changes within ecosystems and subsequent impacts on focal species. Diet is particularly challenging to study within marine environments and therefore is often poorly understood. Here, we examined the diet of stranded and bycaught loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas) in North Cyprus (35.33 degrees N, 33.47 degrees E) between 2011 and 2019. A total of 129 taxa were recorded in the diet of loggerhead turtles (n = 45), which were predominantly carnivorous (on average 72.1% of dietary biomass), foraging on a large variety of invertebrates, macroalgae, seagrasses and bony fish in low frequencies. Despite this opportunistic foraging strategy, one species was particularly dominant, the sponge Chondrosia reniformis (21.5%). Consumption of this sponge decreased with increasing turtle size. A greater degree of herbivory was found in green turtles (n = 40) which predominantly consumed seagrasses and macroalgae (88.8%) with a total of 101 taxa recorded. The most dominant species was a Lessepsian invasive seagrass, Halophila stipulacea (31.1%). This is the highest percentage recorded for this species in green turtle diet in the Mediterranean thus far. With increasing turtle size, the percentage of seagrass consumed increased with a concomitant decrease in macroalgae. Seagrass was consumed year-round. Omnivory occurred in all green turtle size classes but reduced in larger turtles (> 75 cm CCL) suggesting a slow ontogenetic dietary shift. Macroplastic ingestion was more common in green (31.6% of individuals) than loggerhead turtles (5.7%). This study provides the most complete dietary list for marine turtles in the eastern Mediterranean.

AB  - The northernmost population of Camellia japonica globally is a unique ecotype within the species. Water deficit and atmospheric nitrogen deposition are two critical environmental factors that influence plant growth and primary productivity, particularly in the context of environmental change. However, the interactive effects of drought and nitrogen deposition on the physiology and growth of Naidong seedlings have not been investigated. To address this gap, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the individual and combined in-fluences of different water and nitrogen (N) levels on growth, leaf morphology and physiology, and biomass and carbohydrate allocation of three-year-old Naidong seedlings. The results demonstrated that drought reduced height, basal diameter, specific leaf area, biomass accumulation, net photosynthesis, and non-structural carbo-hydrate (NSC) pool in the root of seedlings. However, water use efficiency (WUE) increased under slight drought conditions. Moderate (6 g N m  2 year  1) nitrogen addition enhanced seedling biomass accumulation, carbon fixation capacity, and WUE. Furthermore, a significant interaction between water and nitrogen deposition on Fv/ Fm, soluble sugars concentration in the stem, and starch concentration in the root of Naidong seedlings was discovered. Drought and nitrogen deposition exhibited antagonistic effects on seedling biomass accumulation and photosynthetic capacity. The adverse impact of drought on growth and physiological responses could be partially compensated by increased nitrogen availability. This study highlights the need to include more vari-ables when assessing a species' vulnerability to shifts in environmental conditions in the context of global change studies. Furthermore, our findings provide supportive data for the survival of C. japonica under future climate scenarios.

AB  - Within Britain the Karst landscape is predominantly upland and is characterised by high nature value grasslands which are home to many plant species of conservation interest. One such species is Carex ornithopoda (Bird's Foot sedge) which is found in a limited number of populations in these upland Karst regions. Several of these populations are clustered together with a handful of distant populations. The species is at the western edge of its range in Britain. By comparison Estonia is close to the centre of the range. Sampling of six to twenty individuals of C. ornithopoda from eight British populations and five Estonian populations was undertaken. Individuals were genotyped using nuclear microsatellites over six loci. British and Estonian populations had similar levels of mean genetic variation and also had similar deficits of observed heterozygotes. However British populations had higher levels of unique multi locus genotypes within populations alongside reduced genetic evenness. Isolation by distance is occurring in Britain to some degree, although long distance dispersal is also noted. There is some differentiation of proximal populations in Britain which is absent in Estonia. It is suggested that the similarity and evenness of Estonian populations is due to high levels of gene flow facilitated by intermediate populations. Local gene flow may occur over short distances by pollen or ant transport of seeds. Genetic drift has partly led to some genetic dissimilarity between populations in Britain. Extensive sheep grazing may also limit pollen or seed production and hence restrict gene flow. Dispersal via water is likely to be responsible for long distance dispersal, though other, animal mediated, long dispersal mechanisms is also possible.

AB  - QuestionAlthough leaf biomechanical properties have been identified as critical traits for plant-herbivore interactions, their responses to grazing pressure have been poorly investigated. Intensification of rangeland management, associated with fertilization and an increase in grazing pressure, has been shown to favour fast-growing species that can compensate for biomass losses due to grazing. According to the postulated trade-off between resource acquisition and defence, it is often expected that acquisitive traits should be associated with low leaf mechanical resistance. Here we investigated the responses of two leaf biomechanical traits, and their underlying traits, to management intensification.LocationWe used a long-term experiment in a rangeland located in the Mediterranean region of Southern France, in which three treatments corresponding to different fertilizer inputs and sheep grazing pressures were established.MethodsWe sampled 24 abundant graminoid and forb species. The responses of work to shear and force to tear to the treatments were tested together with those of growth-related leaf traits (leaf mass per area, dry matter content). To better understand the observed patterns, we tested whether the difference between species' leaf biomechanics could be explained by morpho-anatomical characteristics such as leaf thickness and density.ResultsConsistent with the acquisition-defence trade-off hypothesis, we found that graminoids from fertilized and intensely grazed areas had lower leaf resistance than those in ungrazed areas. However, no difference in leaf biomechanics was found in forbs despite a significant decrease in leaf mass per area and leaf dry matter content with management intensification. Consistent with this, we found no significant effect of morpho-anatomical traits on either biomechanical trait in forbs.ConclusionsOur results suggest that the observed responses in graminoids result from phenotypic constraints between resource acquisition and biomechanical defence. However, these phenotypic constraints appeared to be released in forbs, questioning the idea of a universal relationship between these two functions.
   We investigated how leaf biomechanics responds to grazing and fertilization, and its coordination with resource acquisition traits. Management intensification favoured species with lower leaf toughness in graminoids, but not in forbs. In graminoids, low toughness was related to fast acquisition, while this was not the case in forbs. Variations in leaf anatomy are hypothesized to explain these differences.image

AB  - Forest-grassland ecotones are a mosaic of grassland, savanna, and upland forest. As such, landowners may have opportunities to choose to manage their lands for multiple objectives. We estimated the economic returns from managing forest and rangeland in southeastern Oklahoma, USA to produce different combinations of timber, cattle forage, and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann) browse for a 40-year period. We further conducted a survey to understand landowner perceptions of obstacles to adopting active management that involve timber harvest and prescribed fire. The highest net return was obtained from the treatment with harvested timber that was burned every four years (uneven-aged woodland/forest) because it had the greatest gross return from a combination of timber (46%), cattle forage (42%), and deer browse (11%). The return from this treatment was greater than that for managed for timber only (closed-canopy forest) or prioritizing cattle and deer (savanna). Survey results suggested that landowners were aware of the benefits of active management but that the majority (66%) considered cost a major obstacle in the management of their forest or rangeland. In particular, women forestland owners and older landowners considered cost an obstacle. Our findings advocate integrated timber, cattle, and deer management as the best economic strategy within the forest-grassland ecotone and for targeted outreach and landowner education related to the benefits of active management.

AB  - Theory posits that the persistence of species in ecological communities is shaped by their interactions within and across trophic guilds. However, we lack empirical evaluations of how the structure, strength and sign of biotic interactions drive the potential to coexist in diverse multi-trophic communities. Here, we model community feasibility domains, a theoretically informed measure of multi-species coexistence probability, from grassland communities comprising more than 45 species on average from three trophic guilds (plants, pollinators and herbivores). Contrary to our hypothesis, increasing community complexity, measured either as the number of guilds or community richness, did not decrease community feasibility. Rather, we observed that high degrees of species self-regulation and niche partitioning allow for maintaining larger levels of community feasibility and higher species persistence in more diverse communities. Our results show that biotic interactions within and across guilds are not random in nature and both structures significantly contribute to maintaining multi-trophic diversity.

AB  - Mountain grazing lands are key constituents of the natural, economical and cultural heritage, but at the same time sensitive to climate and land use change, hence requiring urgent adaptation and management strategies. These must be based on a better understanding of the distribution of mountain pastoral resources across space and time.
   In this study we model the distribution and the productivity of grassland surfaces in a topographically complex protected area (Gran Paradiso National Park, 710 km(2)) in north-western Italian Alps. The objective of our work was threefold: a) modelling the distribution of mountain grasslands across the entire park at a 20-meters spatial resolution, b) classify pastoral surfaces according to productivity classes, and c) according to thirteen pastoral categories. We used a random forest approach to combine a massive terrain vegetation survey as ground truth, with remote-sensing-derived, climatic and topographic layers as predictors.
   Grassland presence/absence was classified with high accuracy (up to 88%) and, compared to the standard Copernicus European Grassland Product, revealed the presence of extensive high altitude grassland areas potentially available for wild herbivores. Grassland productivity was modelled with remarkably high accuracy both according to three broad productivity classes (90% accuracy) and to a more detailed classification into thirteen pastoral categories (83% accuracy). Productivity estimates agree well with satellite-derived leaf area index maps and with area-averaged NDVI seasonal patterns.
   We conclude that combining tailored field campaigns and high-resolution remote sensing allows for robust prediction of grassland distribution and productivity even in complex terrains. This information can contribute to improve the management of pastoral resources and promote effective adaptation strategies.

AB  - Human-elephant conflict is growing in Africa as human populations and development increases, creating disturbance to elephant habitats. Beehive fences have been trialed as a coexistence tool with some success but all studies have looked at small sample sizes over a short time period. Our study analyses the behavior of African elephants (Loxodonta africana) that approached a network of beehive fence protected farms in two conflict villages over 9 years next to Tsavo East National Park. We compare differences in elephant raids and beehive occupation rates annually, during a drought, and during peak crop production seasons. Out of 3999 elephants approaching our study farms 1007 elephants broke the beehive fence and entered the protected farm areas (25.18%). This was significantly less than the 2649 encounters where elephants remained either outside the farm boundary or broke into the control farms (66.24%). A further 343 elephants entered the farm by walking through a gap at the end of a fence (8.56%). The annual beehive fence break-through rates averaged 23.96% (+/- SE 3.15) resulting in a mean of 76.04% elephants deterred from beehive fences protected farm plots. Over six peak crop growing seasons the beehive fences kept between 78.3% and 86.3% of elephants out of the farms and crops. The beehive fences produced one ton of honey sold for $2250; however, a drought caused a 75% reduction in hive occupation rates and honey production for 3 years after negatively impacting honey profits and the effectiveness of the fences. Beehive fences are very effective at reducing up to 86.3% of elephant crop-raids during peak crop seasons after good rainfall, but any increase in elephant habitat disturbance or the frequency and duration of droughts could reduce their effectiveness as a successful coexistence tool.

AB  - Beavers and muskrats are semi-aquatic, generalist herbivorous rodents regarded as invasive in southern South America, with high impacts on the ecosystem. They share some morphological characters of the skull, but different body sizes and phylogenetic history, showing evident shape differences in young and adult skulls during the development in both species. Considering their similar ecological specializations, skull shape could be achieved through different or similar patterns of allometric growth during ontogeny. We analyzed quantitatively the ontogenetic series including 94 specimens of beavers and muskrats and performed multivariate and bivariate analyses considering 20 linear measurements. Our main results from the different approaches suggest high differences in the ontogenetic trajectories of beavers and muskrats, implying disparity in the muscular, func-tional, and structural conditions of the skull of both species. These differences reflect that although skulls might undergo similar mechanical stress, it is possible to reach a cranial morphology compatible with the similar behavioral and ecological specializations between both species from patterns of skull development that are markedly different.

AB  - Agricultural landscape expansion and land development have disrupted wildlife habitats and movement pathways, limiting species' access to critical resources. Identifying multispecies corridors across human-dominated landscapes is crucial to facilitate safe and unobstructed movement while minimizing negative interactions between humans and wildlife. We conducted a spatial distribution analysis to delineate potential high conflict areas and assess connectivity for the movement of focal species across Peninsular Malaysia. Using conflict data for the Asian elephant ( Elephas maximus), ), Malayan sun bear ( Helarctos malayanus), ), and Malayan tiger ( Panthera tigris) ) spanning an eight-year period (2013-2020), we predicted conflict risk distribution with MaxEnt. We then overlaid the resulting risk maps onto a unified resistance surface and predicted least-cost corridors between high conservation value (HCV) patches. We ranked these corridors by their ecological importance in a plantation landscape. We identified pinch point areas (bottlenecks) to denote locations most critical to species movement along the corridors. Our results suggested that potential high conflict areas were primarily located in eastern and southern Peninsular Malaysia. We identified 89 HCV core patches that were interconnected by 126 linkages. The mean length of the least-cost corridors was 13.41 km. Among the top 10 linkages ranked by centrality value, three crossed commercial plantations for <30 % of their length, and three were highly bottlenecked. This study underscores an ecological approach that considers human-wildlife conflict and habitat connectivity analysis for effective land use planning and critical zone designation.

AB  - This study investigates the potential of sheep wool as an organic amendment to alleviate salinity stress and enhance the productivity of Lavandula officinalis in arid and semi-arid regions. A two-factor factorial design was employed under greenhouse conditions with five replications. The experiment tested varying levels of sheep wool fertilizer (SW) at concentrations of 0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4%, alongside four salt concentrations: distilled water (control), 30 mM, 60 mM, and 90 mM NaCl. The study indicated that the application of sheep wool fertilizer significantly mitigated the adverse effects of NaCl on the growth, photosynthetic, and biochemical characteristics of L. officinalis. Increasing levels of sheep wool correlated with improved plant performance, while higher NaCl concentrations led to declines across all measured characteristics. Optimal performance was observed at the 2% SW treatment. Sheep wool fertilizer represents a promising strategy to enhance plant resilience in saline conditions. This study highlights the importance of optimizing sheep wool concentrations to maximize plant growth and stress tolerance. Future research should focus on investigating the long-term effects of different sheep wool doses and explore synergistic interactions with other organic amendments or bio-stimulants to improve agricultural sustainability in saline environments.

AB  - The present study compares the trophic ecology of two guitarfishes (Pseudobatos percellens and Pseudobatos horkelii) from the continental shelf of the Sao Paulo State, Brazil, caught by the bottom pair trawls between 2007 and 2009. These two sympatric species are under different threat categories, "Vulnerable" and "Critically Endangered," respectively, according to Brazilian agencies. Thus, any study considering trophic ecology parameters is pivotal in understanding the trophic ecology role of such species in the ecosystem. The authors analysed 500 stomachs of P. percellens and 108 of P. horkelii, quantifying with dietary indexes: numerical (%N), gravimetric (%W), frequency of occurrence (%FO) and the prey-specific index of relative importance (%PSIRI). For P. percellens and P. horkelii, 26 and 14 different prey items were found, respectively. Crustacea and Teleostei were the most important prey items for both species, indicating a specialist feeding behaviour due to their low niche amplitude. The results provide evidence related to ontogenetic dietary shift in P. percellens and individual-level diet specialization in both species. These two benthic-demersal elasmobranchs are important mesopredators (3,7 for P. percellens, and 3,5 for P. horkelii) in the study area, with high trophic-level values.

AB  - Composting was the main way to treat food waste and achieve its resource utilization, but the fermentation of food waste could easily produce acid, which affects the microbial community of composting. As of now, the impact of this process on humification was still unclear. This study investigated the effects of initial pH on humic acid formation during food waste (FW) composting, as well as the microbial regulatory mechanisms under pH conditions of 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0. Our study investigated that adjusting the initial pH to 6.6, especially in 7.0, promoted total organic carbon degradation and compost maturation, as indicated by germination index and decreased electrical conductivity. However, higher pH levels also increased total nitrogen loss. Adjusting the pH to 6.0 or 7.0 facilitated the conversion of reducing sugars, amino acids and polyphenols into humic acid and promoted the formation of complex HA components. Our results also indicated that pH regulation inhibited Lactobacillus growth, reshaped bacterial composition, influenced amino acid and polyphenol dynamics, and ultimately enhanced humic acid formation in initial pH of 6.0, especially in initial pH 7.0. From a cost perspective, it was recommended to adjust the initial pH of food waste to 6.0 for composting.

AB  - The degradation of rangelands in semi-arid areas threatens pastoral livelihoods and ecosystem services, making it imperative that integrated approaches find a place in the sustainable land management program. In this regard, the study made use of GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation to determine livestock grazing suitability and degradation risks in the semi-arid Dawa watershed, integrating five relevant biophysical parameters (land use/cover, rainfall, water accessibility, slope, and soil type) with socio-economic indicators derived from expert informant surveys. Importantly, land use/cover classification recorded an accuracy of 98.3% (kappa = 0.97), confirming the soundness of the methodology. Among the species assessed, camels were found to have a fair share of appropriate rangelands, 72% moderately suitable, and 20% highly suitable, thus emphasizing the potential for specific management approaches targeting this species. Furthermore, with the three assembled socio-economic variables including service accessibility (beta = 0.65), infrastructure quality (beta = 0.61), and market accessibility (beta = 0.40), multiple regression analysis showed these were useful in explaining 78.9% of variance in rangeland suitability. In a way, these results stress the important need to run environmental and socio-economic affairs in parallel to halt land degradation, improve ecosystem production, and sustain pastoral livelihoods in the long run. Thus, the study recommends an enhancement of infrastructure and market integration, coupled with specific zoning as the prerequisite sustainable land management practices in semi-arid rangeland situations.

AB  - Carnivore energy requirements are particularly critical in human-dominated landscapes, where populations are vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures. This study investigates the feeding ecology of pumas (Puma concolor) in a fragmented Brazilian agroecosystem, using GPS collar data and camera trap surveys. We analyzed diet composition, niche breadth, and predation patterns to assess the impact of prey availability on puma foraging behavior. Our findings reveal that pumas in this landscape did not consume prey in proportion to their abundance. Wild species, particularly capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) and giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), were the primary prey items. This suggests a specialized diet, potentially influenced by prey availability and accessibility. The estimated mean kill rate was 0.94 +/- 0.5 prey/week, and pumas hunted every 2.8 +/- 1.15 day. The mean weight of prey was 2.3 kg (range: 1-100 kg), which is lower than reported in temperate regions. Our models suggest that total time spent at a kill site was the primary predictor of predation events. Understanding the foraging ecology of pumas is crucial for effective conservation and management strategies, especially in regions where the species is threatened. By providing insights into puma-prey interactions and potential conflict species, this study can inform the development of coexistence strategies between humans and wildlife.

AB  - T & uuml;rkiye represents an important biogeographic region connecting Southeast Europe with Southwest Asia, where pig domestication began in the western Palearctic. We studied the phylogenetic relationships and spatial distribution of new and published mitochondrial D-loop sequences of wild boars from T & uuml;rkiye, other parts of the Middle East, and from around the world to understand migration patterns within Asia Minor and other parts of the Middle East as well as across the Bosphorus/Sea of Marmara/Dardanelles, a current migration barrier to Southwest Europe. Our phylogenetic (ML, BI) and spatial (Geneland) analyses revealed haplotypes both endemic to Anatolia and with a wider distribution in the Middle East as well as European (E1) lineages. The latter suggested possible rare immigration into Anatolia at present times and prehistorical/historical anthropogenic translocations of wild boars or pigs, such as during the pre-Hellenic, Roman, and Byzantine periods or during the European crusades, and subsequent introgression into Anatolian wild boars. Import of pigs with E1 haplotypes and introgression into wild boars during the medieval Empire of Trebizond particularly by Italian merchants or settlers, is also suggested. Anatolian lineages that may have formed the basis of the archaic domestication process of pigs in the western Palearctic are discussed.

AB  - The impacts on marine species from secular warming and heatwaves are well demonstrated; however, the impacts of extreme cold events are poorly understood. Here we link the death of organisms from 81 species to an intense cold upwelling event in the Agulhas Current, and show trends of increasing frequency and intensification of upwelling in the Agulhas Current and East Australian Current. Using electronic tagging, we illustrate the potential impacts of upwelling events on the movement behaviour of bull sharks Carcharhinus leucas, including alterations of migratory patterns and maintenance of shallower dive profiles when transiting through upwelling cells. Increasing upwelling could result in 'bait and switch' situations, where climate change expands subtropical species' distribution, while simultaneously exposing climate migrants to an increased risk of cold-mortality events at poleward distributional limits. This shows the potential impacts of increased cold events, an understudied aspect of climate change research, and highlights the complexities of climate change effects on marine ecosystems.
   The authors link intensification of cold upwelling in two western boundary currents to the observed death of marine organisms, and upwelling avoidance behaviour in bull sharks. They raise concerns of increased risk of cold-mortality events for climate migrants at their poleward distribution limits.

AB  - The present study was carried out to prepare thyme essential oil (TEO) and ginger essential oil (GEO)-incorporated edible starch coating on buffalo meat to extend its refrigerated shelf-life. Edible coatings incorporated with antimicrobials can act as an active packaging system for the preservation of meat using biopolymers and plant-based essential oils. Buffalo meat samples were coated by hydrothermally treated starch solution incorporated with thyme and ginger essential oil at five different proportions (total of 2.5% of starch solution). A total of five treatments (S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5) along with two controls (S6 and S7) were subjected to microbiological [total viable count (TVC), Staphylococcus aureus count, psychrotrophic bacteria count (PTC), and coliform count] and physico-chemical analyses such as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) value, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) content, extract release volume (ERV), metmyoglobin (Met-Mb), pH, weight loss, and water activity at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 days of storage. These metrics were compared between days and between treatments. Compared with the uncoated control (S7), S4 decreased TVC by 2.60 log, and S5 decreased PTC, Staphylococcus aureus, and coliform by 4.71 log, 1.18 log, and 3.01 log, respectively, in 12 days. S4 reduced TBARS and TVBN by 46.14% and 27.86%, respectively, while S5 increased the ERV by 40.94% in 12 days when compared to S7. Metmyoglobin content, pH, ERV, and TVBN were found to have a high correlation with TVC, while pH was found to have a high correlation with TVBN and ERV. It can be concluded that the increase in TEO concentrations on starch coating increases the ability of buffalo meat to resist microbiological as well as chemical spoilage.

AB  - Species interact in different ways, including competition, facilitation and predation. These interactions can be non-linear or higher order and may depend on time or species densities. Although these higher-order interactions are virtually ubiquitous, they remain poorly understood, as they are challenging both theoretically and empirically. We propose to adapt niche and fitness differences from modern coexistence theory and apply them to species interactions over time. As such, they may not merely inform about coexistence, but provide a deeper understanding of how species interactions change. Here, we investigated how the exploitation of a biotic resource (plant) by phytophagous arthropods affects their interactions. We performed monoculture and competition experiments to fit a generalized additive mixed model to the empirical data, which allowed us to calculate niche and fitness differences. We found that species switch between different types of interactions over time, including intra- and interspecific facilitation, and strong and weak competition.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of seasonality on the richness and abundance of dipterans of the families Calliphoridae and Mesembrinellidae associated with the decomposition of a clothed Large White swine Sus scrofa domesticus (Artiodactyla: Suidae) carcass. Experiments were carried out in less rainy, rainy, and intermediate periods between 2010 and 2011 at Reserva Florestal Ducke, Manaus, Amazonas. Two pig carcasses, each weighing approximately 40 kg, were used in each period. A total of 63,872 individuals of 18 species of Calliphoridae and Mesembrinellidae were collected. The abundance and richness of these dipteran families were influenced by the interaction between period and decomposition stage. The compositions of the Calliphoridae and Mesembrinellidae assemblages differed among periods, with the fauna of the less rainy period being less similar to those of the intermediate and rainy periods than they were to each other. Three species were selected as indicators for the less rainy period, namely Paralucilia pseudolyrcea (Mello, 1969) (Diptera, Calliphoridae), Paralucilia nigrofacialis (Mello, 1969) (Diptera, Calliphoridae), and Eumesembrinella randa (Walker, 1849) (Diptera,Mesembrinellidae) while Chloroprocta idioidea (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830) (Dipetra, Calliphoridae) was selected as an indicator species for the rainy period; no taxon was selected as an indicator of the intermediate period. Among decomposition stages, only fermentation and black putrefaction had indicator taxa, with Hemilucilia souzalopesi Mello, 1972 (Diptera, Calliphoridae and Chysomya putoria (Wiedemann, 1830) (Diptera, Calliphoridae), respectively. Clothes did not prevent the laying of eggs and became a kind of protection for immature stages. The clothed model presented a delay in decomposition compared to other studies developed in the Amazon region.

AB  - Elephant dung is characterized by its high organic content, and through defecation in aquatic systems, dung may function as a resource that fuels primary production within these systems. However, how elephant dung directly or indirectly supports the secondary production of aquatic consumers in these ecosystems has not been adequately assessed. Here, we examined the role of elephant dung as an allochthonous subsidy in a riverine ecosystem by measuring the stable isotope values of basal resources and consumers across upstream and downstream sites of an austral river in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Stable isotope analysis showed that upstream, C3 macrophytes and dung contributed significantly to soil organic matter (SOM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). However, autochthonous production remained the primary source of carbon for consumers. Downstream, dung played a more significant role in SPM and SOM, with isotopic analyses showing increased reliance on terrestrial inputs. Overall, stable isotope mixing models indicated that dung contributed up to 51% of the dietary carbon for certain fish species and was a dominant source for freshwater invertebrates, including invasive aquatic gastropods such as Tarebia granifera. These findings provide further insights into the ecological function of large terrestrial herbivores in sustaining aquatic productivity and highlight the potential consequences of their decline on riverine food web dynamics. Understanding these trophic interactions in rivers could provide valuable insights into the flow of resources in aquatic food webs, particularly in response to allochthonous subsidies such as elephant dung.

AB  - Pinnipeds are sentinel species for marine pollution, but their role as vectors of trace elements (TEs) or rare earth elements (REEs) to ecosystems has been poorly studied. The present study tested pinniped feces for 61 elements, including REEs. Feces of adult seals (Mirounga leonina, Hydrurga leptonyx) from Fildes Bay, King George Island, Antarctica, were analyzed by ICP-MS. TEs varied by several orders of magnitude across the suite examined herein, with Fe, Al, Zn, Mn, HgII and Sr as the top six in both species. Of the REEs, Ce, Dy, Er, Eu, Gd, Ho, La, Lu, Nd, Pr, Sc, Sm, Tb, Y and Yb were found consistently in all samples and ranged from 0.935 to 0.006 mu g g(-1) d.w. The results show that both species act as biovector organisms of TEs and REEs through feces in remote environments, whose actual impacts and long-term fate need further exploration.

AB  - Moose herd-train collisions represent one of the potential hazards that railway operations must contend with, making the assessment of passive train safety in such scenarios a crucial concern. This study analyzes the responses of bullet trains colliding with moose herds and investigates the influence of various factors under these conditions. To achieve this goal, a multibody (MB) model was developed using the MADYMO platform. The displacement of the moose's center of gravity (CG) was employed to assess the safety boundaries, while the relative positions between the wheels and rails were used to evaluate the risk of derailment. The findings revealed that the collision forces exhibited multi-peak characteristics that were subsequently transmitted to the wheel-rail contact system, resulting in disturbances in the relative positions of the wheels and rails. However, these disturbances did not reach a level that would induce train derailment. Furthermore, larger moose herds exhibited higher throw heights, although these heights remained within safe limits and did not pose a threat to overhead lines. The primary safety risk in moose-train collisions stemmed from secondary collisions involving moose that had fallen onto the tracks and oncoming trains. This study offers valuable insights for enhancing the operational safety of high-speed trains and safeguarding wildlife along railway corridors.

AB  - By-product mutualisms are ubiquitous yet seldom considered in models of mutualism. Most models represent conditional mutualisms that shift between mutualism and antagonism in response to shifts in costs and benefits resulting from changes in environmental quality. However, in by-product mutualisms, benefits arise as a part of normal life processes that may be costly to produce but incur little-to-no additional costs in response to the interaction. Without costs associated with the interaction, they do not have antagonistic alternate states. Here, we present a conceptual model that differs from traditional conditional models in three ways: (1) partners exchange by-product benefits, (2) interactions do not have alternate antagonistic states, and (3) tradeoffs are allowed among factors that influence environmental quality (rather than all factors that contribute to environmental quality being combined into a single gradient ranging from high to low). We applied this model to bark and ambrosia beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae), a diverse group that associates with fungi and that has repeatedly developed two distinct pathways to by-product mutualism. We used independent axes for each major factor influencing environmental quality in these systems, including those that exhibit tradeoffs (tree defense and nutritional quality). For these symbioses, tradeoffs in these two factors are key to which mutualism pathway is taken.

AB  - Ecological impacts of plastic contamination on marine environment have been documented extensively, however its spread and impacts on terrestrial and freshwater fauna are still poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated diet of Asian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) for plastic ingestion around forested habitats of Uttarakhand state in India. We quantified plastic particles and other anthropogenic waste from elephant dung samples collected from edges and interiors of forest areas, confirming plastic ingestion by this endangered mammal species. Each human-derived item was identified, measured, and sub-categorized into plastic or other anthropogenic waste. About one-third (32%) of the elephant dung samples showed presence of anthropogenic waste. Plastic particles ranging from size 1-355 mm, comprised of 85% of the waste recovered from elephant dung samples (47.08 +/- 12.85 particles per sample). We found twice as many plastic particles (85.27 +/- 33.7/ 100 g) in samples collected from inside forest as compared to forest edge (35.34 +/- 11.14 plastic particles/100 g). A higher count (34.79 +/- 28.41 items/100 g sample) of non-biodegradable anthropogenic waste (glass, metal, rubber bands, clay pottery and tile pieces) was obtained from samples collected inside the forest area samples as compared to forest edge samples (9.44 +/- 1.91items/100 g). There were higher proportion of macroplastic (>5 mm) retrieved than microplastic (1-5 mm) in the elephant dung. The present study is the first systematic documentation of non-biodegradable waste ingestion by Asian elephants. High plastic presence in elephant dung highlights its widespread use near protected habitats and lack of waste segregation practices underlining the vulnerability of wild animals to plastic ingestion risk. We provide recommendations for developing a comprehensive solid waste management strategy to mitigate the threat of plastic pollution around critical elephant habitats in India.

AB  - Nest predation is a driving force in nest site selection and reproductive success across open-cup and cavity-nesting birds. However, we are just beginning to understand how perceived predation risk might affect nest site selection, particularly in cavity-nesting species. Because passerines have been shown to have a keener sense of smell than has traditionally been attributed to them, we tested whether Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) avoid nest cavities containing the odors of a potential nest predator, the house mouse (Mus musculus). Although Tree Swallows have historically suffered nest predation from deer mice (Peromyscus sp.), we hypothesized that these birds would equate these rodent odors. In the 2021 breeding season, we presented Tree Swallows with a choice of 2 nest boxes, 1 containing clean (unused) mouse cage bedding and the other containing bedding soiled with house mouse urine and feces. We concealed the bedding in both treatments under cardboard disks to eliminate visual cues and force Tree Swallows to rely on their olfactory abilities. We hypothesized that Tree Swallows would prefer to use odor-free boxes. Because Tree Swallows are constrained in their nest site choice, we did not assume that they would entirely avoid boxes with urine. Our analysis of the first box chosen from 46 box pairs in which Tree Swallows occupied both boxes found that nest boxes containing mouse odors were chosen first at the same frequency as boxes containing clean odor-free mouse bedding. However, we did find that the swallows showed a preference for wooden boxes. Received 7 April 2022. Accepted 8 December 2022.

AB  - This paper presents the study of modern pollen analogs from the Balearic Islands. While similar studies have been largely applied to mainland areas, research focused on modern vegetation dynamics on Mediterranean islands remains very rare. In this research, we combine vegetation surveys, pollen analysis and multivariate statistics to understand landscape composition. The main objectives of are: (1) to examine pollen-vegetation relationships in relation to environmental and land-use variables; (2) to understand modern pollen representation in a mosaic landscape structure; and (3) to propose pollen indicators that characterize the primary vegetation types from the Balearic Islands to better interpret past pollen records in Mediterranean island environments. Pollen results and Redundancy Analysis (RDA) distinguish three major groups: (a) Holm oak and box formations; (b) maquis and garrigues; and (c) anthropogenic and open habitats. Landscape form, mean decadal rainfall, mean decadal temperature, fire activity, trampling, slope percentage, wet/flooded soil, saline soil, distance to agropastoral cells, gHM index, domestic herbivory presence, agropastoral use, and soil type are the major variables explaining modern pollen assemblage variation in our research. Poaceae undiff., Plantago sp., Apiaceae undiff., Cerealia-t, and Cichorieae are highly correlated to human activities but should be interpreted cautiously when occurring in low values. Quercus ilex-t, Hypericum, and Buxus are correlated to humid locations while Pistacia, Pinus, Juniperus-t, and Olea to high mean decadal temperatures. Our study indicates how pollen analysis and multivariate analysis are powerful tools for characterizing the mosaic landscape, with special focus on the main vegetation types of the Balearic Islands.

AB  - Pear lace bug (Stephanitis nashi) is a significant herbivorous pest, harbouring a diverse microbiome crucial for crabapple (Malus sp.) host adaptation. However, the mutual influence of S. nashi- and plant-associated microbiomes on plant responses to pest damage remains unclear. This study found that S. nashi damage significantly altered bacterial community structure and reduced bacterial evenness in the crabapple phyllosphere. Notably, bacterial diversity within S. nashi was significantly lower than that in the environment, potentially influenced by insect developmental stage, bacterial diffusion stage and endosymbiont species number and abundance. Extensive bacterial correlation and diffusion effect between S. nashi and adjacent plant environments were observed, evident in a gradual decrease in bacterial diversity and an increase in bacterial acquisition ratio from soil to phyllosphere to S. nashi. Correspondingly, S. nashi significantly impacted the metabolic response of crabapple leaves, altering pathways involved in vitamin, amino acid and lipid metabolism and so forth. Furthermore, association analysis linked these metabolic changes to phyllosphere bacterial alterations, emphasizing the important role of diffusive phyllosphere microbiome in regulating S. nashi-crabapple interactions. This study highlights bacterial diffusion effect between insect and plants and their potential role in regulating insect adaptability and plant defence responses, providing new insights into plant-insect-microbiome interactions.

AB  - Nest boxes are a conservation tool for increasing the availability of nests. The efficacy of nest boxes can be assessed by examining the breeding parameters of birds in nest boxes to see whether data are comparable with tree cavities. The hornbill artificial nest research was conducted in Budo-Su-Ngai Padi National Park, Thailand since 2003. This project aims to increase the breeding propensity of two large species of hornbills; the Great Hornbill (Buceros bicornis) and the Rhinoceros Hornbill (Buceros rhinoceros) that coexist in the study area, by utilizing nest boxes. The nest boxes were constructed from fiber-reinforced plastic. There were two designs; small nest box: 50 x 49 cm at base and 95 cm height, and large: 65 x 70 cm at base and 95 cm height. Twenty nest boxes were installed between 2004 and 2006. These nest boxes were monitored from 2004 to 2021. The study results indicated that the proportion of nest occupancy of Great Hornbill breeding in natural nests was higher than nest boxes: 48.9% and 31.4%, respectively (the two binomial proportions test gives: Zc= 4.01, P < 0.0006 < alpha = 0.05). The results also showed that the Great Hornbill prefers to select a large nest box than a small one: 37.3% and 17.3%, respectively (the two binomial proportions test gives: Zc = 3.4, P < 0.00068 < alpha = 0.05). Eight nest boxes so far have been utilized by hornbills: six by Great Hornbill with 58 nesting successes and two by Rhinoceros Hornbill with 1 nesting success. The average life cycle of the fiberglass nest box is about 11.38 +/- 4.23 SD years. The study results suggest that reproduction parameters of hornbills in nest boxes are different from natural cavities in many aspects. Our two target species do not equally benefit from nest boxes.

AB  - Simple Summary Fat deposition capacity greatly impacts the production capacity of sheep. The production of high amounts of fat affects the economic benefits of animals. Gastrointestinal microorganisms play an important role in the characteristics of host fat deposition. This study compares differences in gastrointestinal microorganisms in sheep with different body mass indices. Results showed that there were different microflora compositions among different groups. This provides a new idea for the regulation of fat deposition traits in sheep. Fat deposition is the key factor affecting the efficiency of animal husbandry production. There are many factors affecting fat deposition, in which the gastrointestinal microbiota plays an important role. Therefore, the body mass index (BMI) was introduced into the evaluation of sheep fat deposition, and the different microbiota and functional pathways of the sheep gastrointestinal tract in different BMI groups were analyzed. We selected 5% of individuals with the highest and lowest BMI from a feed test population (357 in whole group). Microorganisms in 10 sites of the gastrointestinal tract in 36 individuals (18 in each group) were evaluated by 16S rRNA V3-V4 region sequencing. There were differences (p < 0.05) in fat deposition traits between different BMI groups. In the 10 parts of the gastrointestinal tract, the diversity and richness of cecal microflora in the high-BMI group were higher than those in low-BMI Hu sheep (p < 0.05). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that there was separation of the cecum between groups, and there were differences in the cecal microbial community. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that most biomarkers were in the cecum. On the basis of an indepth study of cecal microorganisms, 26 different bacterial genera were obtained (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis between them and the characteristics of fat deposition in sheep showed that Colidextribacter, Alloprevotella, and Succenivibrio were positively correlated with fat deposition, while Lachnospiraceae_ND3007_Group was negatively correlated (p < 0.05). The above results show that the cecum may be an important part leading to the difference of BMI in sheep, and its microorganisms may affect the level of fat deposition.

AB  - Small pelagic fish off the coast of Peru in the eastern tropical South Pacific (ETSP) support around 10% of global fish catches. Their stocks fluctuate interannually due to environmental variability which can be exacerbated by fishing pressure. Because these fish are planktivorous, any change in fish abundance may directly affect the plankton and the biogeochemical system.
   To investigate the potential effects of variability in small pelagic fish populations on lower trophic levels, we used a coupled physical-biogeochemical model to build scenarios for the ETSP and compare these against an already-published reference simulation. The scenarios mimic changes in fish predation by either increasing or decreasing mortality of the model's large and small zooplankton compartments.
   The results revealed that large zooplankton was the main driver of the response of the community. Its concentration increased under low mortality conditions, and its prey, small zooplankton and large phytoplankton, decreased. The response was opposite, but weaker, in the high mortality scenarios. This asymmetric behaviour can be explained by the different ecological roles of large, omnivorous zooplankton and small zooplankton, which in the model is strictly herbivorous. The response of small zooplankton depended on the antagonistic effects of mortality changes as well as on the grazing pressure by large zooplankton. The results of this study provide a first insight into how the plankton ecosystem might respond if variations in fish populations were modelled explicitly.

AB  - Purpose Diospyros mespiliformis which is commonly known as African ebony is a valuable fruit tree species with important medicinal and nutritional values. The tree has a slow growth rate that discourages its propagation and at present attempts made towards improving its growth performance are scanty. This study, therefore, evaluates the effect of the type and quantity of animal manure on the growth performance of Diospyros mespiliformis to determine the suitable type of manure and quantity of application that will improve its growth performance. Method Poultry, cow, and goat manures were applied to Diospyros mespiliformis seedlings at 0 g (control), 15 g (10 t/ha1), 30 g (25 t/ha1), and 40 g (35 t/ha1) in pots. The experiment was arranged in a 4 x 3 factorial in a completely randomized design with five (5) replicates. Results Type of manure had a significant effect on seedlings' stem height growth. The highest stem height growth of 11.64 +/- 1.54 cm was recorded by seedlings that received goat manure. The collar diameter and the number of leaves produced were not significantly affected by the type of manure. The Quantity of manure applied did not significantly affect stem height and collar diameter increment; however, it significantly affected the number of leaves produced. Application of 40 g of manures improved leaf production in Diospyros mespiliformis seedlings. Conclusion Application of animal manures improved the growth performance of Diospyros mespiliformis, however, seedlings that received goat manure had better growth performance.

AB  - Reliable estimates of the size and composition of harvested populations over time are key to designing adequate population management plans, regardless of management objectives. In Norway, a national system for collecting and analysing hunter-reported data on red deer (Cervus elaphus) has been operational for about 20 years. The system was expected to provide population metrics that would substantially improve deer population management routines at the municipal level. This has proven to be challenging when using existing state-of-the-art estimation methodology. The main reasons are that the variation in the observation data is generally much larger than population abundance variability, and that one does not have a clear understanding of the stochastic process generating the observation data. Here, using hunter-reported observation data and harvest data from six Norwegian municipalities collected in the period 2007-2023, we show that a straightforward estimation methodology based on population modelling can produce robust abundance estimates despite frequent low quality of the observation data. Its major assets are that it does not involve strong assumptions about the stochastic processes underlying the observation process and that it does not involve assumptions about initial population size and structure in terms of prior statistical distributions. We anticipate that the method can be applied in several other population management contexts, and we think that the results offer fresh perspectives on to what extent noisy citizen-collected time series data can be used to inform management decisions.

Here, we simulated browsing in a common garden experiment to study growth and physiological traits, measured from bulk needles, using a randomized block design with two levels of browsing severity and seedlings originating from 19 populations across Switzerland. Genetic factors explained most variation in growth (on average, 51.5%) and physiological traits (10.2%) under control conditions, while heavy browsing considerably reduced the genetic effects on growth (to 30%), but doubled those on physiological traits related to carbon storage. While browsing reduced seedling height, it also lowered seedling water-use efficiency (decreased delta C-13) and increased their delta N-15. Different populations reacted differently to browsing stress, and for seedling height, starch concentration and delta N-15, population differences appeared to be the result of natural selection. First, we found that populations originating from the warmest regions recovered the fastest from browsing stress, and they did so by mobilizing starch from their needles, which suggests a genetic underpinning for a growth-storage trade-off across populations. Second, we found that seedlings originating from mountain populations growing on steep slopes had a higher delta N-15 in the common garden than those originating from flat areas, indicating that they have been selected to grow on N-poor, potentially drained, soils. This finding was corroborated by the fact that nitrogen concentration in adult needles was lower on steep slopes than on flat ground, strongly indicating that steep slopes are the most N-poor environments. These results suggest that adaptation to climate and soil nitrogen availability, as well as ungulate browsing pressure, co-determine the regeneration and range limit of silver fir.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the lipid content and oxidation of fallow deer (FD), wild boar (WB), and pig meat (PM) at -18 degrees C for a 360-day storage period. The lowest fat content was observed in thigh meat (TM) of FD (2.53%; p < 0.05). The ratio of polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acids (PUFA/SFA), n-6/n-3, hypocholesterolemic/hypercholesterolemic index (h/H), and the lipid nutritional quality indexes were calculated. The PUFA/SFA ratio of each meat sample was compared with the required value of more than 0.4 while the optimal n-6/n-3 ratio was determined only in shoulder meat (SM) of FD meat samples (3.94; p < 0.001). An atherogenic index of lower than 1.0 was observed in each meat sample and a thrombogenic index of lower than 0.5 was observed only in TM of FD (0.53; p < 0.001). During the storage period, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of WB and PM samples showed a higher variability than the FD samples. On the initial day as well as on the 360th day of the storage period, the lowest MDA content in the loin of PM was measured. Long-term vacuum packaging resulted in lower lipid oxidation during meat storage (p < 0.01); however, the duration of the storage period significantly affected the level of lipid oxidation (p < 0.001).

AB  - The planktonic food web structure was investigated in a productive Mediterranean gulf during spring and fall. Plankton communities, rates of primary production (PP), bacterial production (BP) and grazing by microzooplankton and mesozooplankton were examined in a station influenced by Saharan dust, St1; a station located in the Boughrara Lagoon, St2; and a polluted station, St3, close to a phosphate industrial site. The high nutrient (12-17 mu M) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations (3.7-16.9 mg m(-3)) as well as the high rates of PP (1123-2638 mg C m(-2) d(-1)) and BP (128-1337 mg C m(-2) d(-1)), recorded throughout the sampling period, indicated the eutrophic character of the study site. Microzooplankton and mesozooplankton mostly showed seasonal changes in their composition and grazing rates. During spring, PP was dominated by nano- and micro-sized fractions, but pico-, nano- and microphytoplankton contributed equally to Chl a. Heterotrophic and mixotrophic microzooplankton consumed significant proportions of the daily production for bacterioplankton (50-72%) and size-fractioned phytoplankton (25-86%), whereas herbivorous copepods grazed daily on 13-15% of PP. These trophic links suggested that the multivorous food web prevailed in spring. During fall, picophytoplankton, mainly Synechococcus, dominated the Chl a and PP in St1, where microbivorous microzooplankton (mainly mixotrophic dinoflagellates) grazed >= 50% of the production of bacterioplankton and picophytoplankton, while mesozooplankton, dominated by detritivorous copepods, removed only 5% of PP, suggesting a microbial food web. In St2 and St3, Chl a and PP were dominated by large phytoplankton, which was substantially grazed by heterotrophic and mixotrophic microzooplankton (42-62% grazed d(-1)) and copepods (12-25% grazed d(-1)), indicating a carbon channeling throughout the herbivorous food web. The seasonal and spatial change in the planktonic food web implies different efficiencies in the export of carbon. Even in productive waters, picophytoplankton along with microzooplankton, including mixotrophic and heterotrophic organisms, significantly contribute to the ecological functioning of these systems and play a central role in structuring the carbon transfer pathway.

AB  - Spatially explicit densities of wildlife are important for understanding environmental drivers of populations, and density surfaces of intraspecific classes allow exploration of links between demographic ratios and environmental conditions. Although spatially explicit densities and class densities are valuable, conventional design-based estimators remain prevalent when using camera-trapping methods for unmarked populations. We developed a density surface model that utilized camera trap distance sampling data within a hierarchical generalized additive modelling framework. We estimated density surfaces of intraspecific classes of a common ungulate, white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus, across three large management regions in Indiana, United States. We then extended simple statistical theory to test for differences in two ratios of density. Deer density was influenced by landscape fragmentation, wetlands and anthropogenic development. We documented class-specific responses of density to availability of concealment cover, and found strong evidence that increased recruitment of young was tied to increased resource availability from anthropogenic agricultural land use. The coefficients of variation of the total density estimates within the three regions we surveyed were 0.11, 0.10 and 0.06. Synthesis and applications. Our strategy extends camera trap distance sampling and enables managers to use camera traps to better understand spatial predictors of density. Our density estimates were more precise than previous estimates from camera trap distance sampling. Population managers can use our methods to detect finer spatiotemporal changes in density or ratios of intraspecific-class densities. Such changes in density can be linked to land use, or to management regimes on habitat and harvest limits of game species.

AB  - An opportunistic survey for Echinococcus spp. in wild mammals was conducted in seven distinct study areas throughout Namibia, representing all major ecosystems, between 2012 and 2021. In total, 184 individually attributable faeces and 40 intestines were collected from eight species of carnivores, and 300 carcasses or organs of thirteen species of ungulates were examined for Echinococcus cysts. Nested PCR and sequencing of the mitochondrial nad1 gene led to the identification of five species of the Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato complex. Echinococcus canadensis G6/7 was found throughout Namibia at low frequency in lions, cheetahs, African wild dogs, black-backed jackals and oryx antelopes. Echinococcus equinus was present only in northern Namibia, locally at high frequency in lions, black-backed jackals and plains zebras. Echinococcus felidis was found only in one small area in the north-east of Namibia, but with high frequency in lions and warthogs. Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto was identified only in two African wild dogs in the north-east of Namibia, and Echinococcus ortleppi occurred in central and southern Namibia in black-backed jackals and oryx antelopes. The development of fertile cysts indicated active intermediate host roles of oryx antelopes for E. canadensis and E. ortleppi, of warthogs for E. felidis, and of plains zebras for E. equinus. Our data support earlier hypotheses of exclusive or predominant wildlife life-cycles for E. felidis involving lions and warthogs, and - in Namibia - for E. equinus involving lions and/or black-backed jackals and plains zebras. Our data further support an interlink of wild and domestic transmission for E. ortleppi. A possible involvement of livestock and domestic dogs in transmission of E. canadensis G6/7 and E. granulosus s.s., the two parasite species with highest zoonotic potential, is uncertain for Namibia and needs further investigation.

AB  - Energy stores and migration are important adaptations for animals in seasonal environments, but their roles may vary relative to an animal's endogenous and exogenous environment. In partially migratory populations, migrants and residents experience different seasonal environments; thus, the influence of energy stores on survival may differ relative to migratory tactic, with potential consequences to survival and fitness. Using data from Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis sierrae; hereafter, Sierra bighorn), we tested the hypothesis that body fat (energy stores) buffers animals against their environment, but that buffering capacity differs across environments experienced by high-elevation residents (using a single range year-round), traditional migrants (making 1 round-trip movement between high- and low-elevation ranges during winter) and vacillating migrants (making >= 2 round trips between high- and low-elevation ranges during winter). We predicted that: for animals with high levels of body fat, survival would be high regardless of migratory tactic; residents would require larger stores of body fat to survive than migrants; energy stores would be least influential to survival for vacillating migrants. High levels of body fat in autumn (>= 14% for females and >= 19% for males) largely buffered animals against harsh environments (survival >0.90) regardless of migratory tactic. At lower levels of body fat, traditional migrants had higher survival than residents. Vacillating migrants exhibited nearly 100% survival with no detectable effect of body fat on survival. Collectively, these results support the hypothesis that body fat buffers animals against harsh environments but that the buffering capacity differed relative to the environment and highly flexible behaviours (i.e. vacillating migration) can allow animals to decouple survival from body fat. Our work reveals that synergies between physiological and behavioural adaptations of animals in highly seasonal environments carry potential fitness consequences for individuals and demographic consequences for populations. Interactions among these adaptations are key to understanding nutritional prerequisites for persistence in variable environments.

AB  - When prevention of species extinction is the priority, captive breeding is a key component in conservation programmes, allowing the recording of pedigree information in studbooks. The genealogical information registered in Cuvier's gazelle studbook between 1975 and 2023 was analysed to (a) assess if the implemented mating policy was successful in preserving the genetic background of the founders (1 male:3 females) in the present population, and b) improve future management and breeding decisions. Although the maternal contribution of one founder female was lost and the mean inbreeding of the total live population was high (0.305 +/- 0.095), the breeding policy applied produced better results than expected from a population starting from four founders. It was successful in keeping the individual increase in inbreeding low (0.047 +/- 0.021), and, notably, the inbreeding tended to decrease during the last three decades of the breeding programme, ensuring the viability of this highly inbred population. Historical dissemination of individuals among the zoos of Europe and North America caused population structuring and genetic differentiation of the live North American population. However, it did not risk the viability of the captive population. The average relatedness coefficients allowed the identification of individuals with underrepresented genotypes, which is relevant to plan future mating guidelines to keep the founders' representation balanced in the next generations. This study highlights the importance of keeping long-term pedigree information to monitor changes in the genetic diversity of captive populations, which is crucial to implement optimal mating decisions and assuring their long-term viability within an ex situ conservation programme.

FX  - We are deeply grateful to Beatrix Koehler, present Director and former curator in Muenchener Tierpark Hellabrunn, for providing us with accurate information on the Cuvier's gazelle individuals transferred from Almeria to Hellabrunn in 1980, their descendants, as well as those sent from this German zoo to San Diego zoo in 1982-1988. Without this valuable information, we would never have been able to complete the genealogy of Cuvier's gazelle captive population in its studbook. We thank the workers and staff of Finca Experimental La Hoya for their expert handling of the animals since 1975. They help much in making feasible the recovery of this species in captivity. We also acknowledge the curators and keepers of all zoos in Europe, United States of America, and Canada for giving their support to the Cuvier's gazelle captive breeding programme, as well as to keep updated records in its international studbook. Last, but not least, we thank the three anonymous referees for their useful suggestions to improve the manuscript. Fundacion Rio Safari Elche provided partial financial support to complete this study.

AB  - Subtropical humid grazing lands represent a large global land use and are important for livestock production, as well as supplying multiple ecosystem services. Patch-burn grazing (PBG) management is applied in temperate grazing lands to enhance environmental and economic sustainability; however, this management system has not been widely tested in subtropical humid grazing lands. The objective of this study was to determine how PBG affected forage resources, in comparison with the business-as-usual full-burn (FB) management in both intensively managed pastures (IMP) and seminative (SN) pastures in subtropical humid grazinglands. We hypothesized that PBG management would create patch contrasts in forage quantity and nutritive value in both IMP and SN pastures, with a greater effect in SN pastures. A randomized block design experiment was established in 2017 with 16 pastures (16 ha each), 8 each in IMP and SN at Archbold Biological Station's Buck Island Ranch in Florida.
   PBG management employed on IMP and SN resulted in creation of patch contrast in forage nutritive value and biomass metrics, and recent fire increased forage nutritive value. Residual standing biomass was significantly lower in burned patches of each year, creating heterogeneity within both pasture types under PBG. PBG increased digestible forage production in SN but not IMP pastures. These results suggest that PBG may be a useful management tool for enhancing forage nutritive value and creating patch contrast in both SN and IMP, but PBG does not necessarily increase production relative to FB management. The annual increase in tissue quality and digestible forage production in a PBG system as opposed to once every 3 yr in an FB system is an important consideration for ranchers. Economic impacts of PBG and FB management in the two different pasture types are discussed, and we compare and contrast results from subtropical humid grazing lands with continental temperate grazing lands.

AB  - Deltamethrin is used against plant pests (e.g., mites and ants) and, in farm animals, against biting insects because of its acaricidal and repellent effects against ticks, thus protecting the sheep and cattle from the transmission of pathogens. However, its impact on the environment still needs to be fully evaluated. This study evaluates the impact of this pyrethroid on the nitrogen-fixing nodules in Medicago truncatula, a model legume. This research compares nodular biomass and root weight between a deltamethrin-treated section and an untreated control section of this legume. Our results indicate a significant reduction in the biomass of nitrogen-fixing nodules in the treated grove, suggesting that deltamethrin negatively affects the symbiotic relationship between M. truncatula and nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This reduction in nodule formation can impair soil fertility and plant growth, highlighting an ecological risk associated with pyrethroid's use in livestock farming. These findings underscore the need for a shift towards Green Veterinary Pharmacology (GVP), which promotes environmentally sustainable practices in managing livestock health. By minimizing our reliance on harmful chemical treatments, GVP offers viable solutions to protect and enhance ecosystem services such as biological nitrogen fixation that are essential for maintaining soil health and agricultural productivity.

AB  - Our study focused on quantifying available forage and the conditions for avoiding predation provided within the home ranges of Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus). We conducted transect surveys in both winter and summer-autumn home ranges of the Siberian roe deer in the Tieli Forestry Bureau of the Lesser Xing'an Mountains. Our results revealed significant differences: (1) In terms of the quantity and quality of available forage, the summer-autumn home range had substantially more available forage than the winter home range, with meadows and cornfields showing the highest edible biomass in each, respectively. In terms of forage quality, there were differences in hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin content between the two ranges. (2) In terms of the conditions for avoiding predation, the winter home range had lower vegetation coverage and greater visibility, making escape strategies more viable. In contrast, the summer-autumn home range had denser vegetation and limited visibility, making hiding strategies more viable. Our study offers comprehensive insights into the available forage and the conditions for avoiding predation, which is crucial for wildlife conservation strategies and habitat management in the region, as it directly informs strategies that address the seasonal forage requirements and predation avoidance of these deer, ultimately enhancing their prospects for survival in the area.

AB  - Deer keds [Lipoptena cervi (L. 1758)] are ectoparasitic and hematophagous dipterans. Originally native to Northern Europe, L. cervi records in the United States begin in 1907 when they were found in Pennsylvania and New Hampshire. Subsequently, they have been recorded from several states and parasitize many native cervids (Artiodactyla: Cervidae) including white-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus (Zimmerman 1780)]. Concurrently, blacklegged ticks [Ixodes scapularis (Say 1821)], and cases of Lyme disease are increasing in prevalence in the Northeast. The continued expansion and increase in vectors and vector-borne diseases present an opportunity for study and community outreach. We used a combination of active and passive collection techniques, using deer hunters as community scientists, to collect ectoparasites of deer in Pennsylvania over two hunting seasons (2018-2019, 2019-2020). Community scientists were recruited through Facebook groups, e-mail, and hunting clubs. In total, 1,226 L. cervi and 1,954 I. scapularis were collected from white-tailed deer harvested by the community and deer processors across both hunting seasons. The community collected 298 L. cervi and 472 I. scapularis during the 2018-2019 season. In the same season, 529 L. cervi and 577 I. scapularis were collected from deer processors. For the 2019-2020 season, 225 L. cervi and 381 I. scapularis were collected by the community and 174 L. cervi and 524 I. scapularis were collected from deer processors. Benefits and drawbacks were identified for each collection method and a combination of both methods was found to be most effective in gathering specimens without sacrificing standardization.

AB  - Relating ground photographs to UAV orthomosaics is a key linkage required for accurate multi-scaled lichen mapping. Conventional methods of multi-scaled lichen mapping, such as random forest models and convolutional neural networks, heavily rely on pixel DN values for classification. However, the limited spectral range of ground photos requires additional characteristics to differentiate lichen from spectrally similar objects, such as bright logs. By applying a neural network to tiles of a UAV orthomosaics, additional characteristics, such as surface texture and spatial patterns, can be used for inferences. Our methodology used a neural network (UAV LiCNN) trained on ground photo mosaics to predict lichen in UAV orthomosaic tiles. The UAV LiCNN achieved mean user and producer accuracies of 85.84% and 92.93%, respectively, in the high lichen class across eight different orthomosaics. We compared the known lichen percentages found in 77 vegetation microplots with the predicted lichen percentage calculated from the UAV LiCNN, resulting in a R-2 relationship of 0.6910. This research shows that AI models trained on ground photographs effectively classify lichen in UAV orthomosaics. Limiting factors include the misclassification of spectrally similar objects to lichen in the RGB bands and dark shadows cast by vegetation.

AB  - The movement of wild boars is a complex process influenced by both internal conditions and external factors. Despite their typically sedentary lifestyle, dispersion constitutes an integral element of the wild boar's behavior. This report documents the longest observed wild boar dispersal, involving a collared two-year-old male near Warsaw, Poland. The aim of this study was to present the characteristics of movement during the "nomadic phase", drawing comparisons with the "sedentary phase". The other aim was to evaluate the influence of meteorological factors on the minimum daily travel distance of the wild boar. We collected data from two-year-old males. The first exhibited long-distance dispersal and the second only demonstrated local movements. We calculated the minimum daily distance of both wild boars based on collar locations and calculated basic statistics of movement. We used a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log link function to assess the potential impact of weather conditions on the minimum daily distance of wild boars. We tested maximum daily temperature, average daily temperature, and the sum of daily precipitation. The wild boar during a "nomadic phase" covered a total of 922 km with a mean minimum daily movement of 6 km. The dispersion distance was 307 km. The highest value of the minimum daily distance reached 31.8 km/day. The second wild boar (near Warsaw) covered a mean minimum daily distance of 1.4 km; the highest value of the minimum daily distance was 3.9 km. Both wild boars exhibited no dependence of minimum daily distance on weather conditions. However, when intensive and non-intensive dispersion were analyzed separately, it was demonstrated that the maximum daily temperature positively influenced the minimum daily distance. We speculate that the wild boar was forced to search for water sources after dark on hot days, which induced a longer traveling distance in an unfamiliar environment. This study highlights the significant spatial capabilities of wild boar in the transmission of genes or pathogens. We speculate that extended daily distances during the initial "nomadic phase" might suggest a panicked escape from a perceived threat. It is plausible that the wild boar found improved shelter within tall cereal crops in July and August, which resulted in lower daily distances.

AB  - Background Sustainable rangeland management balances production and conservation. While a broad literature describesthe conservation benefits of prescribed fire, benefits for livestock production have emerged more slowly. Mineral nutrition is important for livestock health and performance, but the impact of prescribed fire on mineral concentration of forages, especially in the northern US Great Plains, remains unknown.Aims We investigated how burning affects the mineral concentration of forage early and late in the growing season.Methods Data were collected on mixed-grass prairie in south-central North Dakota, USA. Vegetation was clipped from recently burned, 1 year post-fire, 2 years post-fire, and not-yet-burned patches at the same sampling points in spring and late summer. Samples were analysed for calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc concentration.Key results Burning increased forage mineral concentration across most minerals. Phosphorous, potassium, copper and zinc were higher in burned areas in late spring and summer; calcium, magnesium and manganese were only higher during the late summer; Late-season iron levels increased with time since fire.Conclusions Prescribed fire has a positive effect on forage mineral content.Implications Prescribed fire has the potential to reduce mineral supplementation costs and improve cow performance.

AB  - Many commercial species are light-demanding and regenerate with difficulty in natural forest, which compromises the sustainability of logging. Okan, Cylicodiscus gabunensis Harms is one of the most exploited species in Central Africa and its regeneration is deficient in evergreen forest. In forest concessions, the enrichment of logging gaps with commercial species has already been tested but only for a few species. Mixed results have been obtained because the ability of seedlings to emerge from competing vegetation depends on the species, the environment and the silvicultural techniques adopted. This paper aims to determine the performance of C. gabunensis when planted in felling gaps. The impact of fertilization and biochar application on the performance of the seedlings was examined, as well as the role of predation played by large mammals. In 30 gaps, whose light levels were quantified, we planted nine seedlings and applied three treatments (fertilizer and biochar, fertilizer, control). The performance of the seedlings (survival, mammal damage and growth) was followed for 18 months. In another 30 gaps, the preferential consumption of C. gabunensis seedlings was quantified using camera traps. Seedlings had moderate and highly variable growth (1.84 cm to 2.50 cm in height and 0.201 mm to 0.267 mm in basal diameter per month, all treatments combined). Gap size and initial fertilization significantly boosted growth in diameter and survival rate. Elephants preferentially sought out C. gabunensis seedlings and after 18 months they destroyed 35% of the plants. Enrichment of logging gaps with C. gabunensis should therefore be limited to the largest gaps in forests with low elephant densities. Initial fertilization is recommended but not allowed under the sustainable management certification guidelines. We suggest that these standards should be adapted to maximize the chances of success.

AB  - The chemical communication signals the presence of individuals and territorial occupation, providing information about identity, sex, and reproductive status. This study aimed to characterize the use of latrines by the gray brocket deer, Subulo gouazoubira, in a remnant of the Atlantic Forest located in southeastern Brazil, as well as to describe its territorial marking behaviors, contributing to a better understanding of the species' social communication strategies. Four monitoring points were used, but latrine use was recorded at only two of them. Twenty-seven independent records of S. gouazoubira were obtained, totaling 29 specimens recorded, comprising 59 degrees%o males, 28 degrees%o females, and 14 degrees%o deer with undetermined sex. Twenty-five interactions with latrines and five types of behavior were recorded: defecation, urination, front paw scratching against the ground, tail shaking, and sniffing the area near the latrine. Among the recorded behaviors, 56 degrees%o were performed by females, 40 degrees%o by males, and 4 degrees%o by specimens with undetermined sex. There was variation in the types and frequency of behaviors recorded, indicating that territorial marking behavior might be variable between latrines. Latrine use also varied temporally concerning the time of day when behaviors were recorded and the interval between records of odoriferous marking at the same latrine. Differences in latrine use between males and females were also observed, suggesting intersexual variations in territorial marking strategy. The obtained results, although limited to a few sampling points, suggest complexity in territorial marking behavior and interaction with latrines in S. gouazoubira, highlighting spatial differences, distinct temporal dynamics, and variations between sexes.

AB  - In seasonal environments, herbivorous mammals employ physiological, morphological, and behavioral strategies to meet their nutritional demands despite fluctuating environmental conditions. Biochemical parameters that represent nuanced indicators of nutritional status and physiological function can provide a framework to understand animal-habitat interactions at a population level. Here, we assessed variation in Guanaco, Lama guanicoe, nutritional physiology in a temperate, semiarid region (Monte Le & oacute;n National Park, in southern Patagonia, Argentina), testing the hypothesis that their nutritional state responds to the seasonal variation in resources and energy demands of their annual cycle. We captured 36 free-ranging, adult guanacos between austral early spring and early autumn, and measured biochemical variables in blood serum that are proxies of nutritional intake and mobilization of stored energy (glucose, urea, creatinine, urea:creatinine, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase, nonesterified fatty acids). Urea was highest in early spring, following winter food deprivation, contrary to the expectation of enhanced urea retention and recycling. High urea levels may reflect the constraint of the energy demand of such recycling (e.g., cost of urea transfer or subsequent protein synthesis with recycled nitrogen) when food intake is still low. Guanacos maintained high and steady levels of glucose from early spring to early autumn, probably reflecting continuous hepatic gluconeogenesis from amino acid precursors. Low levels of nonesterified fatty acids in early spring suggest an apparent lack of seasonal mobilization of lipid stores, which is consistent with previous reports of very low body fat content for related species. Urea and creatinine were higher during pregnancy for females, potentially reflecting seasonal variations in food resources rather than the use of body proteins as an energy source, although future research is needed to address this issue. Our findings suggest that guanacos have a distinctive phenotype of macronutrient utilization compared to typical ruminants, indicating that seasonality in their nutritional state may differ from the general pattern in other large-bodied herbivores.
   Guanacos show seasonal nutrient and energy use patterns that differ from typical ruminants. Guanacos seem to rely on amino acids for glucose synthesis, to vary their urea recycling, and to rely less on fat storage. Their unique metabolism may be adaptations to arid, low-productivity environments.
   En entornos estacionales, los mam & iacute;feros herb & iacute;voros emplean estrategias fisiol & oacute;gicas, morfol & oacute;gicas y comportamentales para satisfacer sus necesidades nutricionales a pesar de la variaci & oacute;n de las condiciones ambientales. Los par & aacute;metros bioqu & iacute;micos que representan indicadores precisos del estado nutricional y la funci & oacute;n fisiol & oacute;gica pueden proporcionar un marco para comprender las interacciones animal-h & aacute;bitat a nivel poblacional. En este trabajo evaluamos la variaci & oacute;n de la fisiolog & iacute;a nutricional del guanaco (Lama guanicoe) en una regi & oacute;n templada y semi & aacute;rida (Parque Nacional Monte Le & oacute;n, en el sur de la Patagonia, Argentina), poniendo a prueba la hip & oacute;tesis de que su estado nutricional responde a la variaci & oacute;n estacional de los recursos y las demandas energ & eacute;ticas de su ciclo anual. Capturamos 36 guanacos adultos silvestres entre principios de primavera y principios de oto & ntilde;o austral, y medimos variables bioqu & iacute;micas en el suero sangu & iacute;neo que son indicadores de la ingesta nutricional y la movilizaci & oacute;n de la energ & iacute;a almacenada (glucosa, urea, creatinina, urea:creatinina, alb & uacute;mina, prote & iacute;na total, fosfatasa alcalina, & aacute;cidos grasos no esterificados). La urea fue m & aacute;s alta a principios de primavera, luego de la escasez de alimento en invierno, contrariamente a lo esperado de una mayor retenci & oacute;n y reciclado de urea. Los altos niveles de urea podr & iacute;an reflejar la limitaci & oacute;n de la demanda energ & eacute;tica de dicho reciclado (por ejemplo, el costo de la transferencia de urea o la s & iacute;ntesis de prote & iacute;nas con el nitr & oacute;geno reciclado) cuando la ingesta del forraje es todav & iacute;a baja. Los guanacos mantuvieron niveles elevados y constantes de glucosa desde principios de primavera hasta principios de oto & ntilde;o, lo que probablemente refleja una gluconeog & eacute;nesis hep & aacute;tica continua a partir de precursores de amino & aacute;cidos. Los bajos niveles de & aacute;cidos grasos no esterificados a principios de la primavera sugieren una aparente falta de movilizaci & oacute;n estacional de las reservas de l & iacute;pidos, en consonancia con estudios previos referidos al bajo contenido de grasa corporal en especies emparentadas. La urea y la creatinina fueron m & aacute;s elevadas durante la gestaci & oacute;n en las hembras, lo que podr & iacute;a reflejar variaciones estacionales en los recursos alimenticios m & aacute;s que el uso de prote & iacute;nas end & oacute;genas como fuente de energ & iacute;a, aunque se necesitan m & aacute;s estudios para abordar este mecanismo. Nuestros resultados sugieren que los guanacos tienen un fenotipo diferente de utilizaci & oacute;n de macronutrientes en comparaci & oacute;n con los rumiantes t & iacute;picos, indicando que la estacionalidad en su estado nutricional puede diferir del patr & oacute;n general en otros herb & iacute;voros de gran tama & ntilde;o.

AB  - Mistletoe-host systems exemplify an intimate and chronic relationship where mistletoes represent protracted stress for hosts, causing long-lasting impact. Although host changes in morphological and reproductive traits due to parasitism are well known, shifts in their physiological system, altering metabolite concentrations, are less known due to the difficulty of quantification. Here, we use ecometabolomic techniques in the plant-plant interaction, comparing the complete metabolome of the leaves from mistletoe (Viscum album) and needles from their host (Pinus nigra), both parasitized and unparasitized, to elucidate host responses to plant parasitism. Our results show that mistletoe acquires metabolites basically from the primary metabolism of its host and synthesizes its own defence compounds. In response to mistletoe parasitism, pines modify a quarter of their metabolome over the year, making the pine canopy metabolome more homogeneous by reducing the seasonal shifts in top-down stratification. Overall, host pines increase antioxidant metabolites, suggesting oxidative stress, and also increase part of the metabolites required by mistletoe, which act as a permanent sink of host resources. In conclusion, by exerting biotic stress and thereby causing permanent systemic change, mistletoe parasitism generates a new host-plant metabolic identity available in forest canopy, which could have notable ecological consequences in the forest ecosystem.

AB  - The lined seahorse (Hippocampus erectus) is a rare and valuable aquatic species with significant utilitarian value. Enhancing the growth and survival rates of juvenile lined seahorses is essential to address their high mortality rates, thereby aiding in resource recovery and artificial cultivation. This study conducted a 45-day feeding experiment using brine shrimp (Artemia salina) enriched with Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), Lentinus edodes polysaccharide (LNT), and Lycium barbarum polysaccharide (LBP) to feed juvenile lined seahorses. We assessed the effects of these three naturally extracted polysaccharides on growth performance, survival rate, intestinal morphology, physiological enzyme activities, and intestinal microbiota. The results showed that supplementation with these polysaccharides significantly enhanced the growth performance and survival rates of juvenile seahorses compared to the control group without polysaccharide enrichment (P < 0.05). Survival rates increased from 36 % in the control group to over 55 % with polysaccharide supplementation. Histologically, all three natural polysaccharides significantly improved the intestinal morphology of the juveniles, including increases in mucosal height, width, and muscle thickness. Physiologically, these polysaccharides positively influenced the activities of digestive, immune, and antioxidant enzymes. Analysis of the intestinal microbiota revealed that polysaccharide supplementation significantly increased the total bacterial count and community diversity, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria while inhibiting harmful ones at both the phylum and genus levels. Functional prediction of the intestinal microbiome indicated that microbial genes were predominantly enriched in metabolic pathways, confirming the potential benefits of these polysaccharides in promoting intestinal health. Overall, our findings suggest that supplementation with APS, LNT, and LBP effectively enhances the growth performance and survival rates of juvenile seahorses by improving their physiological conditions, intestinal structure, and microbiota. This study underscores the significance of naturally extracted polysaccharides in the cultivation of juvenile lined seahorses, offering new avenues for promoting healthy aquaculture practices and providing empirical support for their use as supplements in aquatic organisms.

AB  - Whilst exotic invasive species are a major threat to natural and modified ecosystems around the world, management programs to reduce their impacts often fail due to a lack of information about their biology and how best to control them in various situations. This paper reviews the currently available information on the biology, distribution, and management options for the invasive weed Senecio madagascariensis Poir. (fireweed). In addition, we developed a model to predict the climatic suitability of this weed around the world based on the current climate. Senecio madagascariensis originates from southern Africa but it has been introduced to several other countries including Australia. Climatic suitability suggests that there are large areas around the world suitable for the weed's growth where it is currently not present. The weed poses a major threat to livestock industries in these countries through its ability to reduce pasture production and poison animals. A range of control techniques have been used to try and manage S. madagascariensis. This paper highlights how a better understanding of the biology of S. madagascariensis can help determine the most effective treatments to impose and to further develop integrated management strategies. Besides using traditional approaches, the use of competitive pastures and more tolerant livestock (such as sheep and goats) are some of the other options recommended as part of an integrated approach. On-going research to identify host-specific biological control agents is also considered a priority.

AB  - Optimal foraging models predict that individual animals will optimize net energy gain by intensifying forage activity and/or reducing forage energy cost. Then, the free distribution model predicts an animal's distribution in a patchy landscape will match the distribution of the resources. If not modified by other factors, such patterns may be expected to be particularly explicit in variable and extreme, forage-limited, and patchy environments, notably alpine and Arctic environments during winter. The large ungulate wild mountain reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) surviving in such environments is used as a model during the forage-limited winter season. The largest wild reindeer area in Western Europe (Hardangervidda, 8130 km(2)) is actively managed to sustain 10,000-12,000 wild reindeer. Since 2001, 104 different individuals have been GPS-tracked at 3-hr intervals. In winter, mountain reindeer may either choose to seek out and forage in patchy snow-free habitats, typically on top of wind-blown ridges, or use energy-demanding digging through the snow to reach ground forage (cratering). We use late April satellite data from Landsat 5 and 8 (30 x 30 m), airborne laser scanning subsampling (processed to 1 x 1 m grid), and topographic information (1 m resolution) derived from digital aerial photographs (0.25 x 0.25 m resolution) to delineate snow-free patches, constituting less than 694 km(2). By overlaying recorded wild reindeer GPS positions winters 2001-2017 (188,942 positions), we document a strong positive selection for snow-free patches, which were used about four times more frequently than expected from a "random walk" model. On a daily basis, the preference for snow-free areas was slightly stronger in the evenings. In the sustainable management of wild mountain reindeer, the area of snow-free patches is an important predictor of winter forage availability and important winter source areas. It may be derived from remote sensing data.

Twenty-one floodplain and riverine wetlands in the Archer River catchment (north Queensland) were surveyed during postwet (June-August) and late-dry season (November-December) in 2016, 2017, and 2018, using a fyke net soaked overnight (similar to 14-15 hr) to test: (a) whether the fish assemblage are similar in wetlands with and without fences; and (b) whether specific environmental conditions influence fish composition between fenced and unfenced wetlands. A total of 6,353 fish representing twenty-six species from 15 families were captured. There were no wetland differences in fish assemblages across seasons, years and for fenced and unfenced (PERMANOVA, Pseudo-F < 0.589, p < .84). Interestingly, the late-dry season fish were far smaller compared to postwet season fish: a strategy presumably in place to maximize rapid disposal following rain and floodplain connectivity. In each wetland, a calibrated Hydrolab was deployed (between 2 and 4 days, with 20 min logging) in the epilimnion (0.2 m) and revealed distinct diel water quality cycling of temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH (conductivity represented freshwater wetlands), which was more obvious in the late-dry season survey because of extreme summer conditions. Water quality varied among wetlands in terms of the daily amplitude and extent of daily photosynthesis recovery, which highlights the need to consider local conditions and that applying general assumptions around water quality conditions for these types of wetlands is problematic for managers. Though many fish access wetlands during wet season connection, the seasonal effect of reduced water level conditions seems more overimprovised when compared to whether fences are installed, as all wetlands supported few, juvenile, or no fish species because they had dried completely regardless of the presence of fences.

AB  - Reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.) are an important food source for woodland and barren ground caribou herds. In this study, we assessed Cladonia classification accuracy in a rocky, Canadian Shield landscape near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories using both Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) sensors and high-resolution satellite sensors. At the UAV scale, random forest classifications derived from a multispectral, visible-near infrared sensor (Micasense Altum) had an average 5% higher accuracy for mapping Cladonia (i.e., 95.5%) than when using a conventional color RGB camera (DJI Phantom 4 RTK). We aggregated Altum lichen classifications from three 5 ha study sites to train random forest regression models of fractional lichen cover using predictor features from WorldView-3 and Planet CubeSat satellite imagery. WorldView models at 6 m resolution had an average 6.8% RMSE (R (2) = 0.61) when tested at independent study sites and outperformed the 6 m Planet models, which had a 9.9% RMSE (R (2) = 0.34). These satellite results are comparable to previous lichen mapping studies focusing on woodlands, but the small cover of Cladonia in our study area (11.6% or 16.8% within the barren portions) results in a high relative RMSE (62.2%) expressed as a proportion of mean lichen cover.

AB  - Effects of global climate change on population persistence are often mediated by life-history traits of individuals, especially the timing of somatic growth, reproductive development, and reproduction itself. These traits can vary among age groups and between the sexes, a result of differential life-history tactics and levels of lifetime reproductive investment. Unfortunately, the trait data necessary for revealing sex-specific breeding behaviors and use of breeding cues over reasonably large geographic areas remain sparse for most taxa. In this study, we assembled and analyzed a new reproductive trait base for the North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) from digitized natural history specimens and field censuses. We used the data to reconstruct sex-specific breeding phenologies and their drivers within and among North American ecoregions. Male and female phenologies varied across the geographic range of this species, with discordance in timing and intensity being highest in regions of lower seasonality (and longer breeding seasons). Reliance on environmental variables as breeding cues also appeared to vary in a sex-specific manner, being most similar for photoperiod and least similar for temperature (positive male response and negative female response); in addition, model validation indicated that phenological models generalized better for males than for females. Finally, our individual-level trait data also show that male reproductive investment (quantified as relative testis size) varies across the vastly different abiotic and social (i.e., female breeding) contexts studied here. By harmonizing across a broad set of digital data resources, we demonstrate the potential to uncover drivers of phenological variation within species and inform global change predictions at multiple scales of biological organization.

AB  - Phenotypic dissimilarity does not always evolve in concert with genetic diversification, resulting in cryptic species complexes that represent a major challenge for documenting actual biodiversity. Resolving these complexes is of paramount importance. Herein, we tested whether Saron marmoratus (Olivier, 1811) and S. neglectus de Man, 1902, two coral reef-dwelling shrimp species distributed over contiguous biogeographic provinces in the Indo-West Pacific and crossing various biogeographic and phylogeographic breaks, are such cryptic species complexes, as indicated by their significant diversity of color patterns. Firstly, a principal component analysis using 19 morphological traits confirmed that S. marmoratus and S. neglectus were morphologically distinctive, however, failing to detect morphologically defined groups within each of these taxa. On the other hand, molecular phylogenetic analyses (nuclear Histone 3 and mitochondrial 16S RNA markers) demonstrated a total of five well-supported clades in these two taxa, with moderate to deep genetic divergence among them. Species delimitation approaches indicated at least 10 (and a maximum of 15) putative cryptic species in the S. marmoratus and S. neglectus species complexes. Furthermore, color patterns segregated most but not all cryptic lineages. Altogether, the information above demonstrates that S. marmoratus and S. neglectus represent two cryptic species complexes, which diversified in somewhat parallel ways. Additional integrative studies, as we have shown here, to reveal the extend and magnitude of cryptic species complexes in coral reefs, are warranted given the current acute biodiversity crisis.

AB  - Predicting how plants allocate to different anti-herbivore defences in response to elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations is important for understanding future patterns of crop susceptibility to herbivory. Theories of defence allocation, especially in the context of environmental change, largely overlook the role of silicon (Si), despite it being the major anti-herbivore defence in the Poaceae. We demonstrated that elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) promoted plant growth by 33% and caused wheat (Triticum aestivum) to switch from Si (-19%) to phenolic (+44%) defences. Despite the lower levels of Si under e[CO2], resistance to the global pest Helicoverpa armigera persisted; relative growth rates (RGRs) were reduced by at least 33% on Si-supplied plants, irrespective of CO2 levels. RGR was negatively correlated with leaf Si concentrations. Mandible wear was c. 30% higher when feeding on Si-supplemented plants compared to those feeding on plants with no Si supply. We conclude that higher carbon availability under e[CO2] reduces silicification and causes wheat to increase concentrations of phenolics. However, Si supply, at all levels, suppressed the growth of H. armigera under both CO2 regimes, suggesting that shifts in defence allocation under future climate change may not compromise herbivore resistance in wheat.

AB  - Intraspecific variation of specialized metabolites in plants, such as terpenoids, are used to determine chemotypes. Tansy Tanacetum vulgare exhibits diverse terpenoid profiles that affect insect communities. However, it is not fully known whether patterns of their chemical composition and associated insects vary beyond the community scale. Here, we investigated the geographic distribution of mono- and sesquiterpenoid chemotypes in tansy leaves and their relationships with specific insect communities across Germany. We sampled tansy leaves from ten plants with and five plants without aphids in each of 26 sites along a north-south and west-east transect in Germany. Hexane-extracted metabolites from leaf tissues were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Plant morphological traits, aphid occurrence and abundance, and occurrence of ants were recorded locally. The effect of plant chemotype, plant morphological parameters, and abiotic site parameters such as soil types, temperature and precipitation on insect occurrences were analyzed. Plants clustered into four monoterpenoid and four sesquiterpenoid chemotype classes. Monoterpene classes differed in their latitudinal distribution, whereas sesquiterpenes were more evenly distributed across the transect. Aphid and ant occurrence was influenced by monoterpenoids. Plants of monoterpenoid class 1 were colonized by aphids and ants significantly more often than expected by chance, whereas in other classes there were no significant differences. Aphid abundance was affected by soil type, and average annual temperature positively correlated with the occurrence of ants. We found significant geographic patterns in the distribution of tansy chemodiversity and show that monoterpenoids affect aphid and ant occurrence, while the soil type can influence aphid abundance. We show that geographic variation in plant chemistry influences insect community assembly on tansy plants.

AB  - Insect outbreaks are a common multicausal population phenomenon that is characterised by a fast growth of the population, followed by an equally sudden collapse in a relatively short period in the manner of an excitable system. If the outbreaking insect is herbivorous or attacks trees or plants as a part of its life cycle, this phenomenon causes a major impact on the plant's population. As a consequence, outbreaks are a major cause of vegetation loss and tree mortality in ecosystems. Among the several causes of outbreaks, climatic/environmental variation is one of the most important. For example, droughts can weaken plant defences making them more susceptible to insect herbivore attacks. As the climatic-driven effects on plant populations are correlated to time and space, not only the type of variability but also its magnitude, are of key importance for the appearance of this phenomenon. In theoretical studies, noise colour is usually used as a proxy to represent the variability of forcing external variables, such as climate. In this study, we conducted a series of simulations using a spatially explicit model to analyse the effect of combining several types of spatial and temporal environmental noise colours (red, pink, white, blue, violet, and grey) on the frequency of outbreaks. We found that the frequency of outbreaks increased with the autocorrelation of noise. The combination of spatial and temporal white noise showed a low-risk scenario, while pink noise had a much higher frequency of this phenomenon. However, the combination of spatial grey noise (a noise composed of both low and high frequencies), with temporal low-frequency noise, resulted in all simulations causing severe outbreaks. We suggest two explanations for this. On one hand, the presence of high-frequency noise gave the herbivore the ability to percolate through refugees caused by the low-frequency noise; and, on the other hand, low-frequency temporal noise gave the herbivore time to kill all simulated host plants.

AB  - Invasive species are a significant challenge for freshwater ecosystems on a global scale. They can cause serious ecological and economic damage. The aim of our research was to document the range expansion of freshwater invasive fishes in Georgia. Fish studies were conducted during the years from 2019 to 2022 using standard methodologies. A DNA barcoding approach was also employed to validate our findings. During the course of the study, invasive Sharpbelly - Hemiculter leucisculus from different locations of eastern Georgia has been detected, which is the first case of the existence of this species in the country. In addition, we document a significant range expansion of two other non-native species in Georgia. Amur goby, Rhinogobius lindbergi, was collected in western Georgia, which was previously known only from eastern Georgia, and the occurrence of mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki, was confirmed in east Georgia for the first time. It is expected that the rapid expansion of the range of the mentioned species may lead to a decrease in local and endemic species populations in Georgia. With the development of aquacultural activities in the country, these risks will also increase.

AB  - The decomposition process is an important factor in forensics, and flies play a crucial role in the decomposition of animals and humans. However, there remains limited information on the effect of flies that attend death scenes. This study assesses the effect of the presence or absence of blowflies on the rate and process of cadaver decomposition in the spring, summer, and autumn from 2016 to 2020 on Yeongdo Island, Busan, South Korea. Nine blowfly species belonging to four genera in two subfamilies were sampled. The blowflies that approached the cadavers differed between seasons, but Chrysomya pinguis (Walker) was the dominant species regardless of the season. Blowfly presence on cadavers significantly affected the duration of the decomposition stage and the pattern of weight loss in nearly all scenarios. With the presence of blowflies, the decomposition rate was four times faster in spring, three times faster in summer, and nine times faster in autumn. These results show that the presence or absence of blowflies is an essential factor in the decomposition process of cadavers. Therefore, it should be taken into account when estimating postmortem intervals in medicolegal forensic entomology.

AB  - Simple Summary Bait is often used to attract wildlife to enhance viewing opportunities, increase harvest rates, or to improve population survey methods for research and management purposes. However, baiting wildlife can alter animal behavior, leading to negative outcomes such as increased disease transmission, competition, and susceptibility to predation. Our objectives were to determine the effects of short-term baiting on male white-tailed deer behavior and distributions within several properties in southwestern Georgia, USA. We used cameras at baited and unbaited locations to assess the impacts of bait on deer space use within home ranges and to determine whether bait caused shifts in the distribution of home ranges during summer and winter surveys. We found little evidence that short-term baiting affected the distributions of home ranges on the landscape; however, we found evidence that space use within home ranges was affected by bait. By concentrating deer space use within seasonal home ranges, bait may enhance disease transmission and change harvest susceptibility. Bait is often used to increase wildlife harvest susceptibility, enhance viewing opportunities, and survey wildlife populations. The effects of baiting depend on how bait influences space use and resource selection at multiple spatial scales. Although telemetry studies allow for inferences about resource selection within home ranges (third-order selection), they provide limited information about spatial variation in density, which is the result of second-order selection. Recent advances in spatial capture-recapture (SCR) techniques allow exploration of second- and third-order selection simultaneously using non-invasive methods such as camera traps. Our objectives were to describe how short-term baiting affects white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) behavior and distribution. We fit SCR models to camera data from baited and unbaited locations in southwestern Georgia to assess the effects of short-term baiting on second- and third-order selection of deer during summer and winter surveys. We found little evidence of second-order selection during late summer or early winter surveys when camera surveys using bait are typically conducted. However, we found evidence for third-order selection, indicating that resource selection within home ranges is affected. Concentrations in space use resulting from baiting may enhance disease transmission, change harvest susceptibility, and potentially bias the outcome of camera surveys using bait.

AB  - Glaciers on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, known as the "Asian Water Tower", directly affect the utilization of water resources in downstream regions. The currently available instrumental climatic dataset covers only a short period, and the resolution of proxy-based climate reconstructions is low, and these limitations restrict the accurate exploration of glacial changes on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau within the context of long-term climate change. Here, annual-resolution tree ring samples were collected from the oldest pioneer trees (Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. yunnanensis), from the bottom of a glacial valley on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, and used to reconstruct the glacial changes based on the relationship between the ages of the trees and their distances from the glacier terminal. Results indicate that Zepu glacier has been retreating since 1778 CE, with a total retreat distance of 2757 m and an average retreat rate of 11 m yr(-1). The rate of retreat has varied over time, with a maximum of 40 m yr(-1) between the 1950s CE and 1970s CE, and glacial retreat has been modulated mainly by temperature variability over interdecadal to centennial timescales. This study provides a new way to reconstruct the history of glacial retreat.

AB  - Deep-sea mining in the Pacific Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ), a low-energy sedimentary habitat with polymetallic nodules, is expected to have considerable and long -lasting environmental impact. The CCZ hosts extraordinarily high species diversity across representatives from all Domains of Life. Data on species biology and ecology remain scarce, however. The current study describes the reproductive biology of Ophiosphalma glabrum (Ophiosphalmidae) and Ophiacantha cosmica (Ophiacanthidae), two ophiuroids frequently found in the CCZ. Specimens collected in Spring 2015 and 2019 in four contract areas were examined morphologically and histologically. Size-class frequencies (disc diameter and oocytes feret diameters), sex ratios, gametogenic status, putative reproductive mode, and a simple proxy for fecundity are presented. Habitat use differs in each. While O. glabrum is epibenthic, occurring as single individuals, O. cosmica often forms size-stratified groups living on stalked sponges, suggesting gregarious settlement or retention of offspring (though no brooding individuals were found). Further molecular analyses are needed to establish whether O. cosmica groups are familial. In O. glabrum, for which sample sizes were larger, sex ratios approximated a 1:1 ratio with no size-structuring. In both species, individuals were at various stages of gametogenic maturity, but no ripe females were identified. Based on this, O. glabrum is most probably gonochoric. Reproductive mode remains inconclusive for O. cosmica. Both species are presumptively lecithotrophic, with vitellogenic-oocyte feret diameters exceeding 250 mu m. Oocyte feret diameters at times exceeded 400 mu m in O. glabrum, indicating substantial yolk reserves. Estimates of instantaneous fecundity (vitellogenic specimens of O. glabrum only) were confounded by interindividual variability in gonad characteristics. The well-furnished lecithotrophic larvae of O. glabrum would be capable of dispersing even under food-impoverished conditions. The current study examines ophiuroid reproductive biology over multiple localities in the CCZ concurrently for the first time, at sites characterised by differing productivity regimes. The reproductive biology of each species is thus discussed with reference to past evolutionary (habitat stability), contemporary (food supply), and future environmental drivers (potential impacts of deep-sea mining).

AB  - Remote sensing methods are commonly used to monitor the invasive riparian shrub tamarisk (Tamarix spp.) and its response to the northern tamarisk beetle (D. carinulata), a specialized herbivore introduced as a biocontrol agent to control tamarisk in the Southwest USA in 2001. We use a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) supervised classification method with WorldView-2 (2 m spatial resolution) multispectral images from May and August of 2019 to map healthy tamarisk, canopy dieback, and defoliated tamarisk over a 48 km segment of the Colorado River in the topographically complex Grand Canyon National Park, where coarse-resolution satellite images are of limited use. The classifications in May and August produced overall accuracies of 80.0% and 83.1%, respectively. Seasonal change detection between May and August 2019 indicated that 47.5% of the healthy tamarisk detected in May 2019 had been defoliated by August 2019 within the WorldView-2 image extent. When compared to a previously published tamarisk map from 2009, derived from multispectral aerial imagery, we found that 29.5% of healthy tamarisk canopy declined between 2009 and 2019. This implies that tamarisk beetle impacts are continuing to accumulate even though land managers have noted the presence of the beetles in this reach of the river for 7 years since 2012.

KW  - DECOMPOSITION ANALYSIS
AB  - Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, has emerged as a pressing global ecological and environmental challenge. Our study is dedicated to exploring the various factors influencing greenhouse gas emissions from animal husbandry and predicting their future trends. To this end, we have analyzed data from China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region spanning from 1978 to 2022, aiming to estimate the carbon emissions associated with animal husbandry in the region. Furthermore, we have constructed an SA-STIRPAT model grounded in scenario analysis to forecast the timing of the carbon emissions peak. Our findings reveal several notable trends. From 2001 to 2022, carbon emissions from animal husbandry in the region followed a pattern of "rapid growth, followed by smooth fluctuations, and then a gradual recovery." Notably, in 2019, the region reached a peak contribution to China's animal husbandry carbon emissions, accounting for 8.34% of the national total. Ruminants, including cattle, sheep, and camels, were identified as the primary emitters, responsible for 91.6% of the total greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, our study indicates that factors such as production efficiency, industrial structure, economic level, and population structure positively impact carbon emissions, while population size negatively affects animal husbandry's carbon footprint. Our model predicts that under both low-carbon and benchmark scenarios, carbon emissions from animal husbandry in the region are expected to decline after 2030. However, under a high-carbon scenario, emissions are anticipated to peak in 2040. In conclusion, to achieve Inner Mongolia's "dual carbon" goals, it is imperative to implement effective population control measures, enhance production efficiency, elevate the level of urbanization, and optimize the industrial structure.

Even though the impact of each disease on chamois populations has been described in detail, there is a lack of information about the potential impact of concomitant epidemics and the synzootic potential (co-occurring enzootic or epizootic processes producing worse health outcomes in wildlife) on chamois populations. Furthermore, whether a specific order of apparition of epidemics is more or less harmful for the host population is practically unknown not only for chamois but also for most mammal populations. Using a population viability analysis (PVA), we studied the consequences of multiple disease outbreaks with synzootic potential on growth rates and probabilities of extinction of virtual populations exposed to hard winters, density dependence, and co-occurring BD, IKC, and SM outbreaks. Such infections are not under cross-immunity nor density-dependent processes and thus are supposed to affect population demography independently. Heavy snowfalls are also likely to occur in our simulated populations. Our simulations showed that a second outbreak, even caused by a low virulent pathogen, causes an increase in the probability of extinction of the host population with regard to the first outbreak. IKC-BD- and SM-BD-affected populations had a higher risk of becoming extinct in 50 years confirming the extra risk of multiple outbreaks on the viability of the affected populations.

AB  - The evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) hypothesis encapsulates the importance of evolution and ecology for biological invasions. According to this proposition, leaving specialist herbivores at home frees introduced plant species from investing limited resources in defense to instead use those resources for growth, selecting for individuals with reduced defense, enhanced growth, and, consequently, increased competitive ability. We took a multispecies approach, including ancestral and non-native populations of seven weeds, as well as seven coexisting local weeds, to explore all three predictions (i.e., lower defense, greater growth, and better ability to compete in non-native than ancestral populations), the generality as an invasion mechanism for a given system, and community-level consequences of EICA. We assessed plant defenses by conducting herbivory trials with a generalist herbivore. Therefore, finding that non-native populations are better defended than ancestral populations would lend support to the shifting defense (SD) hypothesis, an extension of EICA that incorporates the observation that introduced species escape specialists, but encounter generalists. We also manipulated water additions to evaluate how resource availability influences competition in the context of EICA and plant plasticity in our semiarid system. We found that non-native populations of one study species, Centaurea solstitialis, were better defended, grew faster, and exerted stronger suppression on locals than ancestral populations, offering support to EICA through the SD hypothesis. The other species also displayed variation in trait attributes between ancestral and non-native populations, but they did not fully comply with the three predictions of EICA. Notably, differences between those populations generally favored the non-natives. Moreover, non-native populations were, overall, superior at suppressing locals relative to ancestral populations under low water conditions. There were no differences in plasticity among all three groups. These results suggest that evolutionary change between ancestral and non-native populations is widespread and could have facilitated invasion in our system. Additionally, although trading growth for shifted defense does not seem to be the main operational path for evolutionary change, it may explain the dominance of some introduced species in ruderal communities. Because introduced species dominate communities in disturbed environments around the world, our results are likely generalizable to other systems.

AB  - Animals balance costs of antipredator behaviors with resource acquisition to minimize hunting and other mortality risks and maximize their physiological condition. This inherent trade-off between forage abundance, its quality, and mortality risk is intensified in human-dominated landscapes because fragmentation, habitat loss, and degradation of natural vegetation communities is often coupled with artificially enhanced vegetation (i.e., food plots), creating high-risk, high-reward resource selection decisions. Our goal was to evaluate autumn-winter resource selection trade-offs for an intensively hunted avian generalist. We hypothesized human access was a reliable cue for hunting predation risk. Therefore, we predicted resource selection patterns would be spatiotemporally dependent upon levels of access and associated perceived risk. Specifically, we evaluated resource selection of local-scale flights between diel periods for 426 mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) relative to wetland type, forage quality, and differing levels of human access across hunting and nonhunting seasons. Mallards selected areas that prohibited human access and generally avoided areas that allowed access diurnally, especially during the hunting season. Mallards compensated by selecting for high-energy and greater quality foraging patches on allowable human access areas nocturnally when they were devoid of hunters. Postseason selection across human access gradients did not return to prehunting levels immediately, perhaps suggesting a delayed response to reacclimate to nonhunted activities and thus agreeing with the assessment mismatch hypothesis. Last, wetland availability and human access constrained selection for optimal natural forage quality (i.e., seed biomass and forage productivity) diurnally during preseason and hunting season, respectively; however, mallards were freed from these constraints nocturnally during hunting season and postseason periods. Our results suggest risk-avoidance of human accessible (i.e., hunted) areas is a primary driver of resource selection behaviors by mallards and could be a local to landscape-level process influencing distributions, instead of forage abundance and quality, which has long-been assumed by waterfowl conservation planners in North America. Broadly, even an avian generalist, well adapted to anthropogenic landscapes, avoids areas where hunting and human access are allowed. Future conservation planning and implementation must consider management for recreational access (i.e., people) equally important as foraging habitat management for wintering waterfowl.

AB  - Nero Siciliano (NS) is an autochthonous pig breed reared in northeastern Sicily; despite its high-quality meat products, NS is currently endangered. This study aimed to evaluate the genetic variability at nine loci within candidate genes for meat traits-Melanocortin 4 Receptor (MC4R), Ryanodine Receptor 1 (RYR1), Class 3 Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase (PIK3C3) and Leptin (LEP)-to provide useful information for preservation and exploitation of the NS pig breed. Distribution of the genetic variants was assessed in a representative sample of 87 pigs (18 boars and 69 sows) collected in nine farms located in the original breeding area. Genotypes have been determined using PCR-RFLP and Sanger sequencing. Alleles linked to different growth rates and back fat deposition showed high frequencies (MC4R c.175C-0.93; LEP g.3469T-0.91) in the whole sample. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and different allele distribution in boars and sows were observed. The RYR1 g.1843T allele, associated with Malignant Hyperthermia and Pale Soft Exudative meat defect, was reported in seven heterozygote pigs (q = 0.04) with one farm exhibiting a frequency of 0.29. Our results suggest the need for continuous monitoring of the genetic variants in NS both to maintain high meat quality and eradicate the RYR1 g.1843T allele.

   This study aimed to analyze if the well-known positive effects of immunocastration on the behavior and welfare of pigs are robust to varying environments. One hundred forty-four male pigs were studied with regard to their sex category (EM: entire males, IC: immunocastrates, BA: barrows) and housing environment (ENR: enriched, STD: standard, MIX: repeated social mixing). The second (=effective) vaccination was administered to the immunocastrates 5 or 6 weeks before slaughter according to the standard protocol. Regardless of housing conditions, beneficial effects of immunocastration on a reduction in undesired agonistic and sexual behavior, including penis biting and penile injuries, were observed. Enriched housing showed a beneficial effect on play, whereas the social mixing environment reduced the number of social nosing events. The novel result is that the beneficial effects of immunocastration on behavioral and welfare aspects apply independent from the housing environments assessed in this study.
   The aim of this study was to investigate whether the well-known positive effects of immunocastration on the behavior and welfare of pigs persist under varying environments. One hundred forty-four male pigs were studied with regard to their sex category (EM: entire males, IC: immunocastrates, BA: barrows) and housing environment (ENR: enriched, STD: standard, MIX: repeated social mixing). The vaccination of immunocastrates included two injections at the age of 12 and 22 weeks. Regardless of the housing conditions, frequencies of sexual and fighting behavior expressed by immunocastrates shifted from boar-like to barrow-like behavior after the second immunocastration vaccination (Mixed model analysis, p < 0.05). Penis biting decreased in IC after the second vaccination (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, p = 0.036) and penile injuries were lower in IC animals compared to EM (Mixed model analysis, p < 0.001). Housing-dependent effects on behavior could also be observed in the animals at a relatively young age. Enriched housing showed a beneficial effect on play behavior (Chi-square test, p < 0.001) and the social mixing environment reduced the number of social nosing events (Mixed model analysis, p < 0.05). The positive effects of immunocastration thus are robust to all housing conditions assessed in this study.

AB  - For many mammals living at higher latitudes, food scarcity and snow -hindered movements associated with their first winter are synonymous of trying months. In addition, most wild animals have to cope with parasites. Many studies have been conducted on captive animals to assess consequences parasitism on health over winter, but comparable studies on wild populations are scarce for large mammals. Here, we performed winter tick ( Dermacentor albipictus Packard, 1869) counts and collected body condition data (mass and hematological parameters) on 15 moose ( Alces alces (Linnaeus, 1758)) calves from two distinct climatic regions in northern and southern New Brunswick (Canada) in January. The same calves were recaptured 3 months later to observe variation in body condition parameters. Higher tick loads and more drastic changes of hematological parameters, such as hematocrit and creatinine in southern individuals, suggested that this population might be suffering more from the consequences of winter tick infestation than the northernmost population. However, other parameters that were not measured in our study, such as quantity and quality of food, could influence moose calves body condition at the southeastern limit of their range.

AB  - Simple Summary This study will assist in the conservation of genetic resources and breeding planning for the sustainable utilization of Thai swamp buffalo. It is essential to clearly understand the diversity of genetic resources for breeding planning and genetic conservation. High genetic variation has the potential to exist, and vice versa; the species may easily become extinct when low genetic variation exists. The study revealed that the indicators of the genetic diversity of the swamp buffalo population were also genetically diverse in the TLR2 coding region, as assessed by nucleotide diversity, and that genetic diversity was high. This indicates that it is easy to select and improve the available genetic tools to improve health and production in swamp buffalo when the populations are diverse. The authors suggest that TLR2 gene variations may have the potential for marker-based breeding programs aimed at breeding better disease resistance in swamp buffalo. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins important for directing immune responses. Their primary role is to recognize pathogens based on single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) characteristics. TLR2 is categorized as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that is important for the recognition of pathogens. Nucleotide variation in the coding region determines the conformation of the TLR protein, affecting its protein domain efficiency. This study aimed to identify SNPs in the coding region of TLR2 to enhance available genetic tools for improving health and production in swamp buffalo. A total of 50 buffaloes were randomly sampled from the northeastern part of Thailand for genomic DNA extraction and sequencing. Nucleotide sequences were aligned and compared with cattle and river buffalo based on the database. The results showed, there were 29 SNP locations in swamp buffalo and 14 different locations in both cattle and buffaloes. Haplotype analysis revealed that 27 haplotypes occurred. Swamp buffalo were identified from 13 SNPs based on biallelic analysis, which found eight synonymous and five nonsynonymous SNPs. Nucleotide diversity (& pi;) was 0.16, indicating genetic diversity. Genetic diversity (haplotype diversity; HD) was high at 0.99 & PLUSMN; 0.04. This indicates a high probability that the two sample haplotypes are different. The & pi; and HD values are important indicators of the genetic diversity of the swamp buffalo population. In summary, the Thai swamp buffalo population detected a polymorphism of the coding region of the TRL2 gene. Therefore, further, in-depth study of the relationship between these genes in the immune system and disease resistance should be recommended.

AB  - Agriculture is a major contributor of green house gas emissions and livestock component have significant contribution, sheep being an important part of animal husbandry also contributes to carbon footprints (CFs) of environment through enteric fermentation, manure emissions and inputs used in sheep husbandry. To augment productivity and lower environmental impact of livestock sector, intensive farming is a promising strategy; yet, the approach of feeding more amount of concentrate to increase the productivity of animals was less competent and severed environmental effects as compared to fodder production. Furthermore, to avoid dependence on grazing pastures and provide year round quality fodder to the animals, carbon foot print from forage production required for stall feeding should be taken in to consideration along with other agromonic practices for conducting life cycle assessment of sheep farming. In this study, rearing of popular sheep breeds (Malpura, Avishaan, Patanwadi and Kheri) along with dominant forage production systems (napier, perennial grasses, forage legumes and bajra) was assessed in terms of carbon foot prints and output of crops as well as sheep. Among the crops, perennial grasses required less input and very low CFs from inputs followed by forage legumes. The mean carbon foot print of finished lambs was 8.9, 9.5, 9.3 and 5.7 kg CO(2)e/kg live weight in Malpura, Avishaan, Patanwadi and Kheri, respectively. For production of 1 kg fodder on dry matter basis, Napier required around 224.6% higher carbon input than perennial grasses along with maximum productivity (carbon output) of 67.4% as compared to other crops. Grasses being marginal crops required very low carbon input approximately 794.5% lower as compared to Napier production. For meat, Avishaan proved its superiority in terms of higher meat production which resulted in higher CFs from meat in Avishaan which was around 89.9 and 85.5% higher than Malpura and Patanwadi, respectively. In case of milk, Patanwadi was the highest contributor having 20.1 and 14.3% higher CO2-e as compared to Malpura and Avishaan, respectively. The CFs for wool production was also more for Patanwadi by about 15.0 and 22.9% higher than Malpura and Avishaan, respectively. When the CFs of fodder production and sheep farming was studied together, it was revealed that Napier production with Patanwadi rearing contributed maximum CFs over other systems. Grass cultivation with Avishaan rearing resulted in least CFs contribution. The results suggest that environmental impact of animal production sector should be conducted considering the mean carbon footprints of all correlated farm variables for indepth information.

AB  - Spiders constitute a numerically dominant group of generalist predators in forest ecosystems, but their biocontrol function in forest plantations is not well understood. The biocontrol potential of spiders may depend upon interaction among pest type, forest type, season, trait composition, and spider community diversity. Using a correlative approach, we addressed this gap in knowledge in young (10-15 years) oak (Quercus spp.) and ash (Fraxinus spp.) forest plantations. We sampled (N = 103 samples) foliage-dwelling arthropods and leaves during late spring and autumn. We then measured traits of spiders (body size and hunting strategy) and examined two indicators of herbivory (leaf damage and leaf dry biomass). In oak plantations, abundances of Hemiptera negatively correlated with functional diversity of spiders consistently during the two seasons. Abundances of caterpillars negatively correlated with abundances of ambushers and marginally with abundances of orb-web building spiders during late spring. Abundances of herbivorous Coleoptera negatively correlated with functional evenness of spiders in autumn. Moreover, herbivory negatively correlated with abundances of Space-web builders and functional diversity of spiders in spring but with mean spider body size in autumn. In ash plantations, herbivory negatively correlated with spider abundances in autumn. Our findings provide indirect evidence that foliage-dwelling spiders can be useful for the biological control of forest pests. The biocontrol potential of spiders seems to depend on both functional diversity and identity. Therefore, forest pest management should focus not only on spider community composition but also functional trait diversity of spiders.

AB  - Trichinellosis is a notifiable zoonotic disease caused by parasitic nematode larvae belonging to the genus Trichinella. Domestic pig and wild boar are important hosts within the natural cycle of T. spiralis, the last one being an animal whose populations have experienced an important growth. Therefore, this paper studies the prevalence of Trichinella infection in wild boar in Spain, as well as its relation with hunting and its impact on public health during the period 2006-2019. For this purpose, different sources of information were consulted and analyzed depending on the autonomous communities of Spain and years. During the fourteen years of study, the number of wild boars hunted and the number of cases of Trichinella infection in them increased (from 172 cases in 2006 to 421 in 2019), although prevalence values remained low as the number of animals analyzed also increased. On the other hand, trichinellosis in humans tended to decrease (from a peak of 107 cases in 2007 to 11 cases in 2019). Nevertheless, the numbers of both wild boars and humans infected with Trichinella in Spain are among the highest in Europe, and this emphasizes the importance of food safety, sanitary controls of game meat and citizen awareness campaigns, which prevent the spread of Trichinella through the human population.

AB  - Monitoring programs must produce reliable estimates of animal population density to effectively guide management decisions and conservation action. Popular methods used to estimate density rely on visual encounters which are difficult to obtain for many large-bodied mammals in tropical forests. This study uses the Formozov-Malyshev-Pereleshin (FMP) method to produce density estimates for four terrestrial mammals based on track counts collected by Indigenous hunters in the Amazon. The focal species include collared peccary (Peccari tajacu), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris), and jaguar (Panthera onca). For each species, track detections were greater than visual detections and were found on more transects with a fewer number of surveys. Density estimates were produced for each focal species in hunted and nonhunted sites. These results were compared against the median of 84 density estimates located in the literature that differentiated between hunted and nonhunted sites in the Amazon. Results demonstrate that the FMP method is a reasonable and cost-efficient method. This method can directly engage Indigenous and other local peoples in research, as opposed to replacing their skills with technologies or professional biologists. Overall, this method complements traditional transect surveys and can improve our understanding and management of wildlife across the tropics.(c) 2023 Associacao Brasileira de Ciencia Ecol ogica e Conservacao.

AB  - Bark beetles are major causes of conifer mortality worldwide. We quantified genetic contributions to key chemical and physical traits in lodgepole pine that contribute to defense against mountain pine beetle, a native tree-killing herbivore. Assays were conducted with mature trees in replicated provenance trials. Among chemical defenses, monoterpene composition (relative proportions of various compounds) had higher genetic variability than monoterpene concentration (absolute quantities). Additionally, constitutive concentrations had higher genetic variabilities than induced concentrations elicited by simulated attack. Resin flow elicited by mechanical wounding likewise showed very low genetic variability. In previous studies with this and related systems, induced monoterpene concentration and resin flow are the two best predictors respectively of which trees will survive outbreaks under natural conditions. This means that expression of the most efficacious defense traits is strongly influenced by environmental factors. These low heritabilities despite their survival values likely arise from specific life history and ecological aspects of this system, such as the lengthy period between when lodgepole pines begin cone production and become large enough for brood development, the extended viability of serotinous cones post-mortem, the high heterogeneity of both resources and stressors that trees experience across landscapes, and a strong proximate-neighbor effect on tree mortality arising from beetle aggregation pheromones. However, low heritability values do not preclude long-term evolvability and coadaptation of de-fenses, for which there is extensive mechanistic and associational evidence in this system. Among other traits we evaluated, sesquiterpenes had higher genetic variability than monoterpenes. Sesquiterpenes are not known to influence conifer-bark beetle interactions but have anti-herbivore properties in some other plant-insect systems. The lengths of lesions formed in response to simulated attack showed no heritable component and likewise do not predict tree survival in nature. Bark texture was highly heritable and is known to influence beetle post-landing orientation and colonization patterns, but whether it influences survival patterns at the whole-tree level is unknown. Relationships between tree defenses and growth were generally positive, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity in resource quality among trees supersedes potential underlying substrate alloca-tion processes within trees. Similarly, relationships between various defense traits were generally positive rather than showing trade-offs, suggesting conifer resistance to native bark beetles entails coordinated defense syn-dromes. Implications to tree breeding, forest management, and coevolution between long-lived plants and rapidly reproducing herbivores are discussed. The extent to which these trends may apply to other bark beetle systems is evaluated, along with specific priorities for future research.

AB  - Purpose: To understand the effect of organic wastes as fertilizer and weed management on the growth and fruit yield of tomatoes to recommend the best organic waste fertilizer and weed management practices for the production of this crop in a derived savannah agro-ecology zone of Nigeria. Method: The experiment was conducted in Nsukka, Nigeria where the climate is characterized by mean annual rainfall of about 1600 mm, with a bimodal distribution pattern that peaks in July and October. The mean minimum and maximum temperatures are 21 degrees C and 31 degrees C, respectively. The relative humidity varies yearly, often in the range of 55 - 90%. The treatment is comprised of organic animal wastes as manure types which include: 20 t/ha of poultry manure, 20 t/ha of Pig dung, zero manure application(control), and 5 weed management practices: sawdust cover (17,000 tons/ha), rice husk mulch (23,000 tons/ha), black polyethylene mulch, hoe weeding, and weedy check. The treatment was laid out in a 3 x 5 factorial arrangement in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Results: Among the mulch materials used, rice husk plots consistently recorded the highest tomato fruit yield per hectare (34, 222.0 tons/ha). On the organic wastes, the pig dung treatment performed better than others used, the yield recorded per hectare was (15,533.0 tons/ha) for the tomatoes. Conclusion: The research found out that the use of pig dung should be adopted as well as the use of rice husk mulch on the soil surface as weed management practices to improve yield of tomatoes.

AB  - The biological larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti) is used worldwide to control reproduction of mosquitoes in freshwater habitats. However, its impact on the ecosystem including nontarget species is often unclear. In addition, it is unknown how Bti larvicide may interact with local mosquito predators to shape oviposition site selection of mosquitoes. We used an outdoor mesocosm experiment to investigate the effects of realistic concentrations of the bio-larvicide Bti on Culex oviposition, larval density, survivorship, and on densities of nontarget species. We also manipulated the complexity of the community by manipulating the presence of dragonfly larvae as a predator. Culex oviposition was unaffected by Bti but the larvicide effectively reduced larval density and survivorship in all treatments. Bti did not affect nontarget insects but stimulated phytoplankton density at the expense of lower herbivore density. The presence of dragonfly larvae in mesocosms did not reduce Culex oviposition or larval sensitivity to Bti. We conclude that Bti may effectively reduce the density and survivorship of Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in this part of East Africa, but possibly at the cost of higher phytoplankton densities. Bti-treated mesocosms were not more or less attractive for mosquitoes, suggesting that its application would not alter their oviposition behavior in the field.

AB  - The domestic sheep with over 1200 breeds descended from those early domesticated animals that are bred for a variety of resources such as meat, milk and wool. Akkaraman, a fat-tailed indigenous sheep breed of Turkiye, is widespread throughout Central Anatolia, with the largest indigenous sheep population. Assessing the genetic diversity and genomic structure of animal breeds is among the key contributors to deciphering adaptation to environmental extremes and constructing efficient genetic improvement strategies. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the genome of Akkaraman breed against various world-renowned transboundary sheep and indigenous sheep with fat and thin tails. Genetic similarities and differences between those breeds have been displayed by estimating and comparing various genetic diversity indices, linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates and fixation index (FST), runs of homozygosity (ROH) as well as PCA and neighbour-joining tree analysis. Akkaraman sheep were observed to form a cluster alongside Moghani, Karakas, Tibetan and Cyprus Fat Tail sheep, which are primarily the sole representatives of fat-tailed sheep in the study. This clustering was evident in both the PCA and neighbour-joining tree analysis. The Akkaraman sheep was also observed to have the lowest genomic inbreeding and one of the lowest numbers of ROHs, which might also indicate that the breed has not been exposed to historical intensive selection pressure, inbred mating or a massive population bottleneck that might leave strong marks of genomic homozygosity. The results improve our understanding of the genetic diversity in Akkaraman sheep in comparison with certain mainstream sheep breeds as well as those indigenous breeds from around the world. Additionally, findings will also provide valuable insights to perform further GWAS effectively by considering population structure, diversity and LD patterns observed among the breeds while providing practical knowledge that will contribute to designing efficient and successful genome-based selection programmes for worldwide sheep production systems.

AB  - Biodiversity is globally under pressure, and the current decline in insect biomass and diversity is likely caused by human activities. Key drivers of biodiversity loss include agricultural intensification and anthropogenic climate change. Nevertheless, a thorough understanding of potential interactions between both factors and the mechanisms underlying insect declines, in general, is still lacking.Here, the authors investigate the combined effects of nitrogen fertilisation and drought, as applied to host plants, on the preference and performance of the butterfly Lycaena tityrus.Individuals performed best on plants having received medium nitrogen levels, while performance was reduced by either a lack of or strong fertilisation, the former potentially caused by nitrogen limitation and the latter by increased concentrations of toxic allelochemicals. Female oviposition preference though was positively related to nitrogen fertilisation, resulting in a mismatch between preference and offspring performance at high nitrogen levels. Plant drought stress additionally reduced herbivore performance, and females appeared to suffer more from low-quality food than males.Our results indicate that increasing nitrogen fertilisation, as applied in intensive agriculture, may substantially reduce host-plant quality for insect herbivores, which may be exaggerated in the course of climate change due to the more frequent occurrence of droughts. Our study thus contributes to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying human-driven insect declines in agricultural landscapes and beyond.

AB  - Termites feed on vegetal matter at various stages of decomposition. Lineages of wood- and soil-feeding termites are distributed across terrestrial ecosystems located between 45 degrees N and 45 degrees S of latitude, a distribution they acquired through many transoceanic dispersal events. While wood-feeding termites often live in the wood on which they feed and are efficient at dispersing across oceans by rafting, soil-feeders are believed to be poor dispersers. Therefore, their distribution across multiple continents requires an explanation. Here, we reconstructed the historical biogeography and the ancestral diet of termites using mitochondrial genomes and delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotope measurements obtained from 324 termite samples collected in five biogeographic realms. Our biogeographic models showed that wood-feeders are better at dispersing across oceans than soil-feeders, further corroborated by the presence of wood-feeders on remote islands devoid of soil-feeders. However, our ancestral range reconstructions identified 33 dispersal events among biogeographic realms, 18 of which were performed by soil-feeders. Therefore, despite their lower dispersal ability, soil-feeders performed several transoceanic dispersals that shaped the distribution of modern termites.

AB  - The Bronze Age in Europe is characterized by major socio-economic changes, including certain aspects of animal husbandry. In the Alpine region archaeozoological data, though not very abundant, reveal that cattle were the most important domestic animals in this time period. They were probably used differently in the lowlands than at higher altitude, traction became more important and people increasingly exploited them for dairy products rather than for meat. Thus, a crucial question in this context is whether these major events are accompanied by changes in genetic diversity of cattle. Here we report partial mtDNA d-loop data (320 bp) obtained by PCR from 40 alpine cattle excavated at different sites in South Tyrol, Italy, and Grisons, Switzerland. Most cattle belong to the main European taurine T3 haplogroup, but a few members of T2 and Q haplogroups were identified. Moreover, genetic diversity measures and population genetic statistics indicate different cattle histories at different sites, including bottlenecks and potential admixture. However, Bronze Age Alpine cattle appear to be linked to modern rural cattle mainly from Italy.

AB  - Maintaining a healthy status is crucial for the successful captive breeding of critically endangered Rhinopithecus brelichi, it is conducive to ex situ conservation of this species and rejuvenation of its population. However, changes in the feeding environment and food can affect the composition and function of the gut microbiota in R. brelichi, ultimately impacting its health and adaptation. Herein, 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to determine the gut microbiota composition and functional variations between wild and captive R. brelichi populations. The results showed that the captive group had higher alpha diversity than the wild group, and significant differences were observed in their beta diversity. Captive and wild R. brelichi showed similar microbiota at the phylum level, which mainly comprised Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, and Spirochaetota, but captivity reduced the Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio. Differential abundance analysis revealed that the relative abundance of microbiota related to cellulose degradation, such as Prevotellaceae_UCG_001, Christensenellaceae_R_7_group, Ruminococcus, and Fibrobacter, differed significantly between the two groups. Furthermore, the potential pathogens Acinetobacter and Treponema were significantly abundant in wild and captive groups, respectively. Functional predictions demonstrated that the most significant functional pathways at the second level between captive and wild monkeys were carbohydrate, amino acid, and lipid metabolisms. The captive monkeys exhibited higher digestive capacity and endocrine regulation as well as a higher risk of infectious diseases than wild monkeys. These findings can serve as a valuable theoretical basis for promoting the healthy breeding of R. brelichi and as a guide for future evaluation of the health of wild and captive monkeys.

AB  - Sheep flocks can be reared in different production systems that differ in the duration of indoor housing and grazing restriction. Indoor housing can lead to aggressive interactions, such as blocking, threats and butts, whereas grazing restriction may cause wool-pulling. Wool-pulling is an abnormal behaviour that appears in confined flocks and affects the wool condition of affected animals. Wool condition has been included in some sheep welfare assessment protocols, but in most cases the causes of wool alteration are not addressed. Therefore, it would be useful to establish whether changes in wool condition may be attributable to wool-pulling behaviour. The aim of this study was to find out the effect of grazing restriction on the prevalence of wool-pulling behaviour, assessing wool cover as an indicator of this behaviour, and to analyse the effect of grazing restriction on the prevalence of aggressive behaviours. Two groups of twenty Ripollesa pregnant ewes were used, a temporary grazing group (G) and a permanently housed group (H). Group G had access to pasture daily from 10:00 h to 15:00 h, while Group H remained in the barn throughout the experimental period (10 weeks). The behaviour of all sheep was video-recorded along a ten-week period, two days per week 45 minutes each day, and an ethogram that included wool-pulling, aggressive behaviours, resting and rumination was developed and used. Wool-pulling was observed exclusively in Group H. On the other hand, a four-scale score of wool cover was used to assess wool pulling behaviour, and the score evolved significantly different in both groups. In Group G, no change in woolcover was observed whereas in Group H, wool-cover change was observed in eleven out of twenty ewes throughout the experimental period. A positive correlation was found (R=0.98, P=0.01) between wool pulling observed by direct observation and wool-cover assessment, and it was concluded that wool cover is a potentially useful indicator of wool-pulling behaviour. The frequency of aggressive behaviours was higher in Group H than in Group G during the entire experimental period (35 ewes vs. 11, P=0.04), which suggests that it was caused by grazing restriction.

AB  - Migration is a diverse behavior exhibited by a wide array of organisms. Variability in the type of movements is rooted in their purpose, environmental factors, demographics, and individual physiological condition. The ability of caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) to efficiently move long distances and have a high degree of plasticity in their movements allows them to respond and be resilient to dynamic and dramatic differences in environmental conditions. I used 88 collared, sympatric, adult, female, barren-ground Nelchina Caribou Herd caribou in east-central Alaska to assess their migratory strategy (as indexed by the distance between winter and summer ranges) and how this might affect their movements. Employing 41,682 movement vectors from 39 of these individuals equipped with GPS collars, I compared the annual and monthly movements of caribou that were found on different winter ranges. Distances between winter and summer ranges for individual caribou were correlated with their annual movement, but not for caribou that wintered within the same area. As expected, caribou with the greatest distance between their winter and summer ranges (300 km) traveled the most annually (2132 km/year), whereas caribou with the shortest distance between ranges (71 km) traveled the least annually (1368 km/year). However, caribou that migrated the furthest exhibited greater movement rates in all non-migratory summer months and most non-migratory winter months, as well as during migration. Movement rates were the greatest in summer, peaking in July, regardless of where caribou wintered. During the winter months, movement rates were similar among caribou found on different winter ranges and decreased over the winter, reaching minimums in January-March. Caribou that migrated the shortest distance and had lower movement rates tended to be found in smaller groups in summer. The connection between group size and movement rates may be a function of competition or a small-scale example of the larger-scale phenomenon of range expansion of large herds. Environmental factors, such as snow depth and temperature, were also correlated (negatively and positively, respectively) with caribou movement rates. Survival was not significantly different for caribou utilizing different winter ranges, which implies that the benefits of this long-distance migration can be offset by its costs. A more detailed understanding of the drivers and variability of caribou movement should help improve the management of this declining species.

AB  - Supplemental feed for free-ranging deer is often advocated by managers to compensate for winter survival. However, providing extra food has great costs so it is important to know how essential supplemental feed is for deer populations. In our study, supplemental feed is supplied year round for free-ranging Pere David's deer Elaphurus davidianus since early 2019 to help them survive food shortages in the Jiangsu Dafeng Milu National Nature Reserve. To understand use of supplemental feed, we quantified the biomass contributions of C3 plants, C4 plants and supplemental feed consumed by free-ranging deer by assessing their faecal carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values in May, July, October and December. The diet-faeces trophic shift of deer was assessed using semi-captive animals. Faeces in both areas were collected and faecal delta C-13 values revealed more variable diets of free-ranging deer than semi-captive deer in different months. MixSIAR model showed that C4 plants contributed greatly to deer diet biomass (75.1, 82, 64.3, 79.4%, respectively in May, July, October and December) compared with C3 plants and supplemental feed. We suggest that managers should consider the efficiency of long-term supplemental feed and consider the selection of C3 and C4 plants during restoration.

AB  - Increasing human populations and expanding development across the globe necessitate continual progress in understanding and mitigating human-wildlife conflict. California, USA has the largest human population and at least half of the state is suitable mountain lion (Puma concolor) habitat. The juxtaposition of high human abundance within and adjacent to mountain lion habitat make California relevant for understanding human-large carnivore conflict. We compiled 7,719 confirmed incidents of mountain lions depredating domestic animals over a 48-year period (1972-2019) to examine temporal trends in mountain lion depredations as well as factors influencing annual depredation rates at the county level. Linear regressions demonstrated that the overall number of depredation events and those involving pets (e.g., dogs [Canis lupus familiaris] and cats [Felis catus]) and small hoofstock (primarily sheep [Ovis aries] and goats [Capra aegagrus hircus]) have increased significantly over time with small hoofstock comprising the majority of depredations. Poisson regression models revealed human density and agricultural productivity were negatively associated with increasing depredation rates while amount of suitable habitat and number of mountain lions removed in the previous year were positively associated with increasing depredation rates. In general, our results point to smaller-sized hoofstock operations in areas of suitable mountain lion habitat as key factors in predicting mountain lion depredations in California. Further, the permanent removal of offending individuals appears to increase the potential for conflict in the following year. Broadly speaking, improving husbandry standards for pets and small hoofstock living in areas occupied by large carnivores may be the most effective way to reduce human-predator conflict in California and elsewhere.

AB  - Marine macroalgae are exposed to multiple sources of stress. As a result, perennial macroalga habitats have become depleted in many coastlines. Here, we investigated the role of mesograzers in the sharp decline of a unique strain of Chondrus crispus (the giant Irish moss) found solely in a lagoon in Atlantic Canada. This study was prompted by damage resembling grazing scars that appeared on the fronds as the population declined, for which no grazer had been identified. We identified potential grazers of the seaweed by deploying 4 types of experimental clumps of giant Irish moss and sampling the epifauna that colonized them. Laboratory assays were then run with an abundant species, the amphipod Gammarus oceanicus, to measure feeding rates and test whether this mesograzer is capable of consuming the alga and creating measurable damage. G. oceanicus readily consumed the Irish moss at a grazing rate of 5.24 mg amphipod(-1) d(-1) and created deep lateral grazing wounds similar to those observed in the field. An additional experiment was conducted to assess whether a co-acting stressor in the lagoon, the accumulation of fine sediments, could explain the appearance and spatially patchy distribution of the damage in the population. Giant Irish moss fronds that had been buried under sediment lost twice as much biomass as those that had not. These results suggest that grazer activity and declining conditions in the lagoon have a negative and additive effect on this unique strain of Irish moss, with clear implications for its restoration.

AB  - With 9 million hogs, North Carolina (NC) is the second leading hog producer in the United States. Most hogs are housed at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where millions of tons of hog waste can pollute air and water with fecal pathogens that can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and/or nausea (known as acute gastrointestinal illness (AGI)). We used NCs ZIP code-level emergency department (FD) data to calculate rates of AGI ED visits (2016-2019) and swine permit data to estimate hog exposure. Case exposure was estimated as the inverse distances from each hog CAFO to census block centroids, weighting with Gaussian decay and by manure amount per CAFO, then aggregated to ZIP code using population weights. We compared ZIP codes in the upper quartile of hog exposure ("high hog exposed") to those without hog exposure. Using inverse probability of treatment weighting, we created a control with similar demographics to the high hog exposed population and calculated rate ratios using quasi-Poisson models. We examined effect measure modification of rurality and race using adjusted models. In high hog exposed areas compared to areas without hog exposure, we observed a 11% increase (95% CI: 1.06, 1.17) in AGI rate and 21% increase specifically in rural areas (95% CI: 0.98, 1.43). When restricted to rural areas, we found an increased AGI rate among American Indian (RR = 4.29, 95% CI: 3.69, 4.88) and Black (RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.91) residents. The association was stronger during the week after heavy rain (RR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.62) and in areas with both poultry and swine CAFOs (RR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.48, 1.57). Residing near CAFOs may increase rates of AGI ED visits. Flog CAFOs arc disproportionally built near rural Black and American Indian communities in NC and arc associated with increased AGI mast strongly in these populations.

AB  - The interplay of predator encounters and antipredator responses is an integral part of understanding predator-prey interactions and spatial co-occurrence and avoidance can elucidate these interactions. We conducted hard-part dietary analysis of coyotes (Canis latrans Say, 1823) and space use of coyotes and woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) to test two competing hypotheses about coyote and caribou predator-prey spatial dynamics using resource selection functions. The high encounter hypothesis predicts that coyotes would maximize encounters with caribou via high spatial co-occurrence, whereas the predator stealth hypothesis predicts that through low spatial co-occurrence with caribou, coyotes act as stealth predators by avoiding habitats that caribou typically select. Our dietary analysis revealed that similar to 46% of sampled coyote diet is composed of caribou. We found that coyote share space with caribou in lichen-barren habitat in both summer and winter and that coyotes co-occur with caribou in forested habitat during summer, but not during winter. Our findings support predictions associated with the high encounter predator hypothesis whereby coyotes and caribou have high spatial co-occurrence promoting caribou in coyote diet.

AB  - Protected areas serve as population strongholds for many large carnivores, with multi-use landscapes along their borders forming the front-lines of wildlife conservation. Understanding large carnivore population dynamics within working landscapes is difficult where anthropogenic mortality is high and unregulated. This study focused on working ranches, where killing jaguars (Panthera onca) and their prey was prohibited, to gain insight into jaguar population potential across multi-use landscapes. Faced with forest fragmentation, presence of domestic livestock, and dynamic land-use practices, we expected jaguar populations in working landscapes to be predominantly male and transient, with low cub production, and inflated population densities in remnant forest patches, versus protected areas where we expected native forest habitat and stable jaguar territories. Using camera traps and spatial-capture recapture analyses, we observed that male jaguars demonstrated larger-scale movements and were more detectable than females (0.07 +/- 0.01 SE vs. 0.02 +/- 0.01 SE) in both working and protected landscapes. Female jaguars in ranches traveled farther than females in parks. Carnivore density increased with forest cover and wild prey activity, decreased with domestic prey activity, and was marginally higher in ranches (4.08 individuals/100 km(2) +/- 0.73 SE) than in parks (3.59 individuals/100 km(2) +/- 0.64 SE). Females outnumbered males in both landscapes (2.20-2.60 females/100 km(2) vs. similar to 1.60 males/100 km(2)), although local male density reached up to 11.00 males/100 km(2) in ranches (vs. 3.50 males/100 km(2) in parks). While overall jaguar density was patchier in protected areas (<(x)double over bar> = 0.69 parks, 0.54 ranches), inter-annual patchiness was higher within ranches (Moran's I = 0.49-0.60 ranches, 0.69-0.70 parks), reflecting changes in cattle management. Despite major habitat alterations, working landscapes can support carnivore densities equivalent to (or exceeding that of) unmodified forest habitat, provided that wildlife-tolerant ranching practices are maintained.

AB  - How fetal and maternal cell types have co-evolved to enable mammalian placentation poses a unique evolutionary puzzle. Here we integrate and compare single-cell transcriptomes from six species bracketing therian mammal diversity: opossum (a marsupial), Malagasy common tenrec (an afrotherian), mouse and guinea pig (rodents), and macaque and human (primates). We identify a conserved transcriptomic signature of invasive trophoblast across eutherians, probably representing a cell type family that radiated with the evolution of haemochorial placentation. In the maternal stroma, comparative analysis reveals that the endocrine decidual cell evolved from an immunomodulatory predecidual cell type retained in Tenrec and resembling early human decidua. Fetal and maternal cell signalling shows a pronounced tendency towards disambiguation-the exclusive expression of ligands by only one partner-although few ligand-receptor pairs follow an escalatory arms race dynamic. Finally, we reconstruct the uteroplacental cell-cell communication networks of extinct mammalian ancestors, identifying signalling innovations and widespread integration of fetal trophoblast and maternal decidual cells into signalling networks. Together, these results reveal a dynamic history of cell type innovation and co-evolution at the fetal-maternal interface.

AB  - Within African savannas, seasonal rainfall influences the survival of mammalian grazers by determining the availability and quality of food. The strength of these effects may, however, vary depending on the availability of reserve and buffer resources within the home range of an individual. From 1999 to 2019, 24% of the white rhino (Ceratotherium simum simum) calves born in Ithala Game Reserve died without a known cause. To explore this, we investigated the impacts of seasonal rainfall on calf survival, and whether these relationships were modified by the availability of woodlands (i.e., reserve resources) and bunch grasslands (i.e., buffer resources) within the home ranges established by the mothers. We found that nearly all of the deceased calves died during their first dry season after weaning had commenced. The likelihood of a calf surviving this period was positively influenced by rainfall during the dry season and negatively influenced by its duration. However, these effects were more pronounced when the availability of woodlands within the home range of the mother was high. Ultimately, calf deaths were caused by a combination of low dry season rainfall, long dry seasons, and the selection of home ranges with insufficient bunch grasslands by some mothers. With climate change models predicting increased dry season durations and a reduction in dry season rainfall, our results highlight future challenges for the conservation of white rhinos and other large herbivores.
   How is white rhino calf survival influenced by seasonal rainfall and home range choice of the mother? In our study, calf survival was positively affected by dry season rainfall and negatively affected by dry season duration. However, these effects were amplified if a mother selected a home range with an abundance of woodlands.

AB  - The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmermann 1780) was an apex species for Precolumbian subsistence in the anthropogenic savannas and tropical dry forests bordering Parita Bay on the central Pacific coast of Panama. This paper focusses on Late Preceramic Cerro Mangote, a multi-component site whose domestic occupation corresponds to a maximum time-period of 7900 and 4600 cal BP. At this time, this site?s inhabitants developed mixed subsistence strategies including farming and hunting, along with coastal fishing and invertebrate collection. Communities across the seasonally dry and windy plains and foothills of the central Pacific practiced swidden agriculture ? a variety of plant food production that would have favored ?garden hunting? (sensu Linares 1976), which, in this region, most likely involved white-tailed deer because of this species? acknowledged attraction to cultivated plots. Zooarchaeological and taphonomic analyses of white-tailed deer bone, tooth and antler samples from Cerro Mangote are based on two sequential Late Preceramic occupation layers. Results reveal that the same strategies for white-tailed deer hunting and for the treatment of their carcasses continued without change throughout the Late Preceramic period at Cerro Mangote.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance caused by antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) threatens human health. ARGs in animal manure can be degraded by composting. This study explored the changes in ARGs and microbial communities during co-composting of pig manure and tea stalks with (T) thermophilic microbial agents, including Geobacillus toebii ZF1 and Geobacillus sp. ZF2 for 15 days in a 4 L vacuum flask. Composting without thermophilic microbial agents served as control (CK). The results showed that the compost temperature of group T peaked at 72.1 degrees C and maintained above 70 degrees C for 4 days. The maximum temperature of group CK was 64.0 degrees C. The seed germination index showed that group T had reached maturity on day 9, while group CK reached maturity on day 15. The dominant bacteria in group CK were Bacillus. In group T, the dominant bacteria changed from Bacillus and Corynebacterium to Geobacillus. Compared with that of group CK, group T increased the removal of cmx, baeS and TaeA by 24.6%, 18.6% and 12.1%, respectively. Group T promoted and inhibited the removal of arlR and novA, respectively (p < 0.05), while group CK showed the opposite effect. Network analysis suggested that group T effectively inactivated Dietzia, Clostridium and Corynebacterium (p < 0.05) and promoted the removal of cmx and baeS. These results showed that thermophilic microbial agents could accelerate the maturation of pig manure and tea stalks, change microbial communities and promote the removal of ARGs. It is of great significance to reduce the spread of ARGs and, in turn, human health risks.

AB  - Currently, most studies on ungulates' behavior are conducted during the daylight hours, but their nocturnal behavior patterns differ from those shown during day. Therefore, it is necessary to observe ungulates' behavior also overnight. Detailed analyses of nocturnal behavior have only been conducted for very prominent ungulates such as Giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis), African Elephants (Loxodonta africana), or livestock (e.g., domesticated cattle, sheep, or pigs), and the nocturnal rhythms exhibited by many ungulates remain unknown. In the present study, the nocturnal rhythms of 192 individuals of 18 ungulate species from 20 European zoos are studied with respect to the behavioral positions standing, lying-head up, and lying-head down (the typical REM sleep position). Differences between individuals of different age were found, but no differences with respect to the sex were seen. Most species showed a significant increase in the proportion of lying during the night. In addition, the time between two events of "lying down" was studied in detail. A high degree of rhythmicity with respect to this quantity was found in all species. The proportion of lying in such a period was greater in Artiodactyla than in Perissodactyla, and greater in juveniles than in adults.

AB  - The addition of adequate proportions of organic residues to formulate substrates with soil, render positive results on germination and seedling growth by providing benefits to the physical and chemical attributes of the soil. Determining an adequate proportion of such residues is essential to obtain seedlings exhibiting morphophysiological quality. This study aims to evaluate seed emergence and the development of Caesalpinia pulcherrima (L.) Swartz and Cassia grandis L. f. seedlings in organic substrates. The experiment was set in a completely randomized design arranged in 2 x 3 x 5 factorial scheme, consisting of two soil classes (Oxisol and Entisol), three types of organic substrate (COP (organic compost from tree pruning + cattle and goat manure), CLU (urban waste compost), RES (residue from the extraction of sisal fiber) and five percentages of organic residues (0, 20, 40, 60, 80). The percentage of emergence and emergence speed of seeds, plant height, number of leaves, root length and dry mass were determined. The species showed better results for these variables when adding organic residues to the substrate. The addition of 80% COP or CLU to the substrate provided higher mean values for percentage of emergence in seeds of Caesalpinia pulcherrima, and the substrate constituted by only soil provided higher dry mass in seedlings of this species. The combination of 50% COP and 50% soil (Oxisol and Entisol) resulted in higher means for the percentage of seed emergence, velocity of emergence and biomass production in Cassia grandis L. f. seedlings.

AB  - Insect herbivores interact via plant-mediated interactions in which one herbivore species induces changes in plant quality that affects the performance of a second phytophagous insect that shares the food plant. These interactions are often asymmetric due to specificity in induced plant responses to herbivore attack, amount of plant damage, elicitors in herbivore saliva and plant organ damaged by herbivores. Parasitoids and their symbiotic polydnaviruses alter herbivore physiology and behaviour and may influence how plants respond to parasitized herbivores. We argue that these phenomena affect plant-mediated interactions between herbivores. We identify that the extended phenotype of parasitoid polydnaviruses is an important knowledge gap in interaction networks of insect communities.

AB  - The plant most commonly known for producing latex is the Par & aacute; rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis. There are, however, thousands of latex-bearing plant species, and these species exhibit a diverse array of different types of latex, each type in accordance with its producers' main selective pressure after injury. One key function of latex is to seal, but the most crucial necessities for wound sealing differ by the environment. For species growing in arid climates, for example, minimizing water loss is crucial whereas in tropical ecosystems a strong (chemical) defense against herbivores, parasites, and germs is of more imminent importance. This diversity of ecosystems and species' environments is mirrored by a respective diversity in latices' chemical compositions, material properties, and coagulation times. While some plant species solely rely on evaporation of water for their latex coagulation, the H. brasiliensis latex contains the coagulation assisting protein Hevein, allowing for coagulation in 30 min. With coagulation times of 10 s and below, species of the genus Campanula pose considerable challenge to the measurement of latex characteristics. We here present an overview to the coagulation of latex in the genus Campanula and reveal substantial differences to the latex coagulation of H. brasiliensis. For a collection of 6 different Campanula species, we determined coagulation times under different temperatures, latex dry weights, contact angles of water droplets on latex surfaces and imaged laticifer cross-sections using cryo-SEM. We found Campanula latex to coagulate significantly faster than Hevea latex and no evidence of Hevea-like lutoids in the laticifers. A coagulation test in a pressure chamber further revealed Campanula latex to coagulate at pressures of 8 bar, where latex coagulation in Ficus benjamina, which is described to have similar coagulation mechanism as Hevea, has previously been reported to be impaired. Our findings thus suggest Campanula latex coagulation to follow a different mechanism than the one described in Hevea.
   De meest bekende latexproducerende plant is de Braziliaanse rubberboom, Hevea brasiliensis. Naast Hevea zijn er nog duizenden latexhoudende plantensoorten, die onderling een grote diversiteit aan latexen produceren. Elk type latex weerspiegelt de voornaamste selectriedruk op de respectievelijke soort na een verwonding. Een belangrijke functie van latex is wondsluiting, maar de noodzaak voor wondsluiting hangt af van de habitat van de plant. Voor soorten die groeien in bijvoorbeeld een droog klimaat, is het minimaliseren van waterverlies cruciaal, terwijl in tropische ecosystemen een sterke (chemische) verdediging tegen herbivoren, parasieten en bacteri & euml;n van groter belang is. Deze diversiteit aan ecosystemen en habitats van soorten wordt weerspiegeld in een respectievelijke diversiteit in de chemische samenstelling, materiaaleigenschappen en coagulatietijden van latex. Terwijl het latex van sommige plantensoorten coaguleert enkel door verdamping van water, bevat het latex van H. Brasiliensis het coagulatiebevorderende eiwit heve & iuml;ne, wat coagulatie binnen 30 minuten mogelijk maakt. Met coagulatie in 10 seconden of minder vormen soorten van het geslacht Campanula een aanzienlijke uitdaging voor het meten van latexkenmerken. Met dit onderzoek geven wij een overzicht van de coagulatie van latex in het geslacht Campanula en onthullen substanti & euml;le verschillen met de latexcoagulatie van H. Brasiliensis. Voor een collectie van 6 verschillende campanulasoorten hebben we de coagulatietijden bij verschillende temperaturen, het drooggewicht van het latex en de contacthoeken van waterdruppels op latexoppervlakken gemeten. Daarnaast hebben we dwarsdoorsneden van laticifers vastgelegd met behulp van cryo-SEM. In onze experimenten coaguleerde Campanula latex significant sneller dan Hevea latex. Onze cryo-SEM beelden toonden geen Hevea-achtige luto & iuml;den in de latificers van Campanula. Een coagulatietest bij hoge luchtdruk toonde tevens aan dat Campanula latex coaguleert bij een druk van 8 bar. Deze luchtdruk is gemeld de latexcoagulatie te verstoren in Ficus benjamina, waarvan het coagulatiemechanisme beschreven is als vergelijkbaar met dat van Hevea. Onze bevindingen suggereren dat de coagulatie van Campanula latex een ander mechanisme volgt dan welke beschreven is voor Hevea.
   La plante la plus connue pour produire du latex est l'arbre & agrave; caoutchouc, Hevea brasiliensis. Cependant, il existe des milliers d'esp & egrave;ces de plantes qui pr & eacute;sentent une grande vari & eacute;t & eacute; de types de latex diff & eacute;rents, chacun & eacute;tant reli & eacute; & agrave; la pression s & eacute;lective principale de leurs producteurs apr & egrave;s l & eacute;sion. Une des fonctions cl & eacute;s du latex est protectrice, les n & eacute;cessit & eacute;s les plus cruciales pour l'obturation des plaies diff & egrave;rent selon l'environnement. Pour les esp & egrave;ces qui poussent dans un climat aride, par exemple, la minimisation de la perte d'eau est cruciale, tandis que dans les & eacute;cosyst & egrave;mes tropicaux, une d & eacute;fense chimique forte contre les herbivores, les parasites et les germes est plus importante. Cette diversit & eacute; d'& eacute;cosyst & egrave;mes et d'environnements des esp & egrave;ces se refl & egrave;te dans une diversit & eacute; respective de la composition chimique, des propri & eacute;t & eacute;s mat & eacute;rielles et des temps de coagulation du latex. Alors que certaines esp & egrave;ces de plantes ne d & eacute;pendent que de l'& eacute;vaporation de l'eau pour la coagulation de leur latex, le latex de H. brasiliensis contient la prot & eacute;ine Hevein qui aide & agrave; la coagulation, permettant ainsi une coagulation en 30 minutes. Avec des temps de coagulation de 10 secondes et moins, les esp & egrave;ces du genre Campanula posent un d & eacute;fi consid & eacute;rable pour la mesure des caract & eacute;ristiques du latex. Nous pr & eacute;sentons ici une vue d'ensemble de la coagulation du latex dans le genre Campanula et r & eacute;v & eacute;lons des diff & eacute;rences substantielles avec la coagulation du latex de H. brasiliensis : pour une collection de 6 esp & egrave;ces diff & eacute;rentes de Campanula, nous avons d & eacute;termin & eacute; les temps de coagulation sous diff & eacute;rentes temp & eacute;ratures, les poids secs du latex, les angles de contact des gouttes d'eau sur les surfaces de latex et imager les sections transversales des laticif & egrave;res & agrave; l'aide de la cryo-SEM. Nous avons constat & eacute; que le latex de Campanula coagule significativement plus vite que le latex d'Hevea et qu'il n'y a pas de preuve de la pr & eacute;sence de lutoides de type Hevea dans les laticif & egrave;res. Un test de coagulation dans une chambre & agrave; pression a r & eacute;v & eacute;l & eacute; en outre que le latex de Campanula coagule & agrave; des pressions de 8 bar, alors que la coagulation du latex de Ficus benjamina, qui est d & eacute;crite comme ayant un m & eacute;canisme de coagulation similaire & agrave; celui d'Hevea, a & eacute;t & eacute; pr & eacute;c & eacute;demment signal & eacute;e comme & eacute;tant alt & eacute;r & eacute;e. Nos r & eacute;sultats sugg & egrave;rent ainsi que la coagulation du latex de Campanula suit un m & eacute;canisme diff & eacute;rent de celui d & eacute;crit pour Hevea.
   Die wohl bekannteste latexproduzierende Pflanze ist der Par & aacute;-Kautschukbaum (Hevea brasiliensis). Neben Hevea gibt es jedoch Tausende von latexhaltigen Pflanzenarten, welche eine Vielzahl unterschiedlicher Latizes produzieren. Die jeweilige Latexzusammensetzung und die Art der Koagulation nach einer Verletzung korreliert mit den dominierenden Selektionsdrucken im jeweiligen & Ouml;kosystem. Eine wichtige Funktion des Latex ist der Wundschluss, die Notwendigkeit f & uuml;r den Wundschluss ist allerdings unterschiedlich f & uuml;r verschiedene Lebensr & auml;ume. F & uuml;r Arten, die z.B. in einem ariden Klima wachsen, ist die Minimierung des Wasserverlustes entscheidend, w & auml;hrend in tropischen & Ouml;kosystemen eine starke (chemische) Verteidigung gegen Pflanzenfresser, Parasiten und Keime von gr & ouml;ss erer Bedeutung ist. Diese Vielfalt der & Ouml;kosysteme und der Lebensr & auml;ume der Arten spiegelt sich in einer entsprechenden Vielfalt der chemischen Zusammensetzung, der Materialeigenschaften und der Koagulationszeiten der Latizes wider. W & auml;hrend einige Pflanzenarten f & uuml;r die Gerinnung ihres Latex ausschlie ss lich auf die Verdunstung angewiesen sind, enth & auml;lt der Latex von H. brasiliensis das koagulationsf & ouml;rdernde Protein Hevein, das eine Koagulation innerhalb von 30 Minuten erm & ouml;glicht. Mit Koagulationszeiten von 10 Sekunden und weniger stellen die Arten der Gattung Campanula dagegen erhebliche Herausforderung f & uuml;r die Messung der Latexeigenschaften dar. Wir geben in dieser Studie einen & Uuml;berblick & uuml;ber die Latexkoagulation bei der Gattung Campanula und zeigen wesentliche Unterschiede zur Latexkoagulation von H. brasiliensis auf. F & uuml;r eine Auswahl von 6 verschiedenen Campanula-Arten haben wir die Koagulationszeiten bei unterschiedlichen Temperaturen, das Trockengewicht des Latex und den Kontaktwinkel von Wasser auf der Latexoberfl & auml;che gemessen, sowie Querschnitte der Milchr & ouml;hren angefertigt und mittels Cryo-SEM visualisiert. In unseren Versuchen koagulierte Campanula-Latex deutlich schneller als Hevea-Latex. Die Cryo-SEM Aufnahmen ergaben keine Hinweise f & uuml;r Hevea-& auml;hnliche Lutoide in den Milchr & ouml;hren von Campanula. Ein Koagulationstest in einer Druckkammer zeigte au ss erdem, dass Campanula-Latex bei einem Druck von 8 bar koaguliert, w & auml;hrend die Latexkoagulation bei Ficus benjamina bei & auml;hnlichem Druck beeintr & auml;chtigt ist. Der Koagulationsmechanismus bei Ficus & auml;hnelt dem von Hevea. Unsere Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass die Koagulation von Campanula-Latex einem anderen Mechanismus folgt als dem f & uuml;r Hevea beschriebenen.

AB  - Spreading of Mycobacterium bovis causing animal tuberculosis (TB) at livestock-wildlife-environment interfaces remains a significant problem. Recently, we provided evidence of widespread environmental contamination of an endemic animal TB setting with viable and dormant M. bovis cells able to recover metabolic activity, making indirect transmission via environmental contamination plausible. We now report the first whole genome sequences of M. bovis recovered from the environment. We establish epidemiological links at the environmentanimal interface by phylogenomic comparison of these M. bovis genomes with those isolated from livestock and wild ungulates from the same area. Environmental and animal genomes are highly intertwined and distribute similarly into the same M. bovis lineages, supporting several instances of environmental contamination. This study provides compelling evidence of M. bovis excretion into the environment and viability maintenance, supporting the environment as a potential source of new infection. These insights have clear implications for policy formulation, advocating environmental surveillance and an ecosystem perspective in TB control programs. Environmental Implication: We report the first whole genome sequences of M. bovis from the environment and establish epidemiological links at the environment-animal interface, demonstrating close phylogenomic relatedness of animal and environmental M. bovis. Definitive evidence of M. bovis excretion into the environment with viability maintenance is provided, supporting the environment as a potential source of new infection. Implications of this work include methodological innovations offering a tool to resolve indirect transmission chains and support customized biosecurity measures. Policy formulation aiming at the control of animal tuberculosis and cost mitigation should consider these findings, encouraging environmental surveillance in official eradication programmes.

AB  - Sarcophagids are a diverse group of flies most commonly associated with carrion. In the neotropics the group is highly diverse but for some regions of Central America it is still poorly studied. For Honduras only 15 species are known compared to the more than 100 in the neighboring Costa Rica. During 2019 we collected sarcophagids attracted to decomposing pigs (Sus domesticus Erxleben, 1777, Artiodactyla, Suidae) in a multicropping system surrounded mostly by farmland in Zamorano, Honduras. Thirteen species were found, nine being new records for the country: Blaesoxipha plinthopyga (Wiedemann, 1830), Dexosarcophaga transita Townsend, 1917, Helicobia surrubea (Wulp, 1895), Oxysarcodexia peltata (Aldrich, 1916), Peckia chrysostoma (Wiedemann, 1830), Peckia pexata (Wulp, 1895), Peckia volucris (Wulp, 1896), Ravinia lherminieri (Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830), and Titanogrypa placida (Aldrich, 1925). Blaesoxipha plinthopyga, Oxysarcodexia bakeri (Aldrich, 1916), and Peckia lambens (Wiedemann, 1830) were the most abundant species and were found in every stage of decomposition. Two additional species were collected in the study area: Argoravinia rufiventris (Wiedemann, 1830) on a dead opossum (Didelphis marsupialis Linnaeus, 1758, Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae), and Tripanurga aurea (Townsend, 1917), also a new country record, on bird feces. Including the new country records, Honduras now has a diversity of 25 species distributed in 11 genera.

AB  - Background. The coastal floodplains of northern Australia are fire-prone, but the impact of fire on floodplain biota is not well understood. Aims. In this study, we sought to characterise the fire history of six adjacent floodplains in coastal Northern Territory, Australia. Methods. We built a fine-scale 31-year fire history (1988-2018) to compare fire regimes on floodplains across land tenures and floodplain fire regimes with the surrounding savanna fire regime, determine the extent to which current fire regimes are meeting existing ecological fire thresholds, and investigate the relationship between rainfall totals and the extent of burning. Key results. Floodplains in conservation reserves burnt more frequently than those on pastoral lands, and savannas burnt more often than floodplains. Current floodplain fire regimes comfortably meet existing ecological fire thresholds. The proportion of floodplain burning is inversely proportional to the amount of rain in the previous wet season. Conclusions. Floodplain fire regimes vary markedly between land-use types, and floodplain fire regimes differ to those of savannas. The current management thresholds for floodplain fire regimes would benefit from further evidence of conservation outcomes.Implications. For more effective floodplain fire management, research is needed to generate floodplain-specific thresholds that best conserve their considerable conservation value.

AB  - Citizen Scientists together with an increasing access to technology provide large datasets that can be used to study e.g. ecology and biodiversity. Unknown and varying sampling effort isa major issue when making inference based on citizen science data. In this paper we propose a modeling approach for accounting for variation in sampling effort due to accessibility. The paper is based on an illustrative case study using citizen science data of moose occurrence in Hedmark, Norway. The aim is to make inference about the importance of two geographical properties known to influence moose occurrence; terrain ruggedness index and solar radiation. Explanatory analysis shows that moose occurrences are overrepresented close to roads, and we use distance to roads as a proxy for accessibility. We propose a model based on a Bayesian Log-Gaussian Cox Process specification for occurrence. The model accounts for accessibility through two functional forms. This approach can be seen as a thinning process where probability of thinning, i.e. not observing, increases with increasing distances. For the moose case study distance to roads are used. Computationally efficient full Bayesian inference is performed using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation approach for spatial modeling. The proposed model as well as the consequences of not accounting for varying sampling effort due to accessibility are studied through a simulation study based on the case study. Considerable biases are found in estimates for the effect of radi-ation on moose occurrence when accessibility is not considered in the model.

AB  - Collaborative governance regimes may be vulnerable because of dependency on stakeholders??? voluntary engagement and efforts. This study focuses on the Swedish moose management system, a multi-level collaborative governance regime inspired by the ecosystem approach. Self-determination theory is used to explore perceived prerequisites of basic needs for intrinsic motivation across sub-groups of stakeholder representatives who are engaged across different social-ecological contexts. Questionnaire data collected among representatives at two governance levels, moose management groups (n = 624) and moose management units (n = 979), were subjected to two-step cluster analysis. The analyses revealed two sub-groups of representatives, characterized by differences in species composition and land ownership structure: managers of multi-ungulate areas and managers of large-carnivore areas. In several respects, these groups significantly differed in how they perceived the prerequisites. This included prerequisites of perceived competence with regard to their need for knowledge of topics and usefulness of monitoring methods, perceived autonomy operationalized as possibilities to perform their tasks with sufficient time, resources, and support from their organizations, and perceived relatedness to different groups of actors. Further efforts should be made to understand the conditions required for representatives to energize and direct their behavior. The institutional system must better fit the needs of stakeholder representatives across various local contexts, otherwise the space for local voluntary engagement might be hampered.

AB  - The growing concerns about the relation of livestock activities and sustainability has led to technological progress and the adoption of best practices for reducing their impacts on the environment, including carbon emissions. In southern Italy, farming Mediterranean buffalos for milk production represents a significant portion of the economy. In this study we evaluate the environmental impacts of buffalo milk production using the Life Cycle Assessment approach. The analysis uses a cradle-to-gate system boundaries, an attributional approach and a Functional Unit equal to kg of Energy Corrected buffalo Milk (ECM). We use primary data collected from three farms in Southern Italy, covering a wide range of conditions including organic farming. We investigate the role of allocation method on the overall results and the role of buffalo milk productivity on the environmental impact estimates of milk production. Our results indicate that the environmental impacts of milk production are highly dependent on the chosen allocation method. The life cycle greenhouse gases emission ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 kgCO(2)eq per kg of ECM, which are slightly larger compared to those of cow milk; this is mainly due to higher milk productivity of cows compared to buffalos. The hot-spot analysis shows that the largest source of climate change impacts are direct emissions from enteric fermentation. The comparative analysis shows that no farm out-performs the other across the entire spectrum of categories and that the milk productivity of buffalos is a key aspect determining the environmental performance of each farm.

AB  - Archaeological studies of pre-historic Arctic cultures are often limited to artefacts and architecture; such records may be incomplete and often do not provide a continuous record of past occupation. Here, we used lake sediment archives to supplement archaeological evidence to explore the history of Thule and Dorset populations on Somerset Island, Nunavut (Canada). We examined biomarkers in dated sediment cores from two ponds adjacent to abandoned Thule settlements (PaJs-3 and PaJs-13) and compared these to sediment cores from two ponds without past human occupation. Coprostanol and epicoprostanol, delta 15N measurements, sedimentary chlorophyll a and the ratio of diatom valves to chrysophyte cysts were elevated in the dated sediment profiles at both sites during Thule and Dorset occupations. Periods of pronounced human impact during the Thule occupation of the site were corroborated by 14C-dated caribou bones found at both sites that identified intense caribou hunting between ca 1185 and 1510 CE. Notably, these sediment core data show evidence of the Dorset occupation from ca 200 to 500 CE at sites where archaeological evidence was heretofore lacking. We highlight the utility of lake sediments in assisting archaeological studies to better establish the timings, peak occupations and even lifestyle practices of the Dorset and Thule Arctic peoples.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of sex on meat quality and fatty acid (FA) composition in growing-finishing pigs. Meat samples were collected from gilts, surgically castrated males and immunocastrated males. Surgical castration was carried out at 5 days of age, whereas immunocastration was performed with two injections of Improvac administered 4 weeks apart, at 9 and 15 weeks of age. Pigs were fed complete diets containing 17% and 15% of total protein, respectively Pig Nutrient Requirement. Feed and water were available ad libitum. Pigs from each group were kept in separate pens, and they were slaughtered at BW of around 105 kg. The pigs were slaughtered according to the usual procedure in meat plants. Samples of the longissimus lumborum muscle (musculus longissimus lumborum, LL), approximately 10 cm thick, were collected from the right half-carcasses to determine the proximate chemical composition, physicochemical properties and sensory attributes of meat. The content of dry matter, total protein (Kjeldahl method), crude fat (Soxhlet extraction) and crude ash, and the FA profile of meat samples were determined. Fatty acids were separated by gas chromatography. Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were prepared according to the modified Peisker method. Fatty acids were identified by comparing their retention times with those of pure FAME standards (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and peaks in the analyzed samples. The relative content of FAs was expressed as the percentage of the total surface area of all FAs detected in each sample. Sex had no influence on the quality or processing suitability of pork, but it affected the intramuscular content, which is an important consideration for consumers.

AB  - The gut microbiome can help the host adapt to a variety of environments and is affected by many factors. Marine carnivores have unique habitats in extreme environments. The question of whether marine habitats surpass phylogeny to drive the convergent evolution of the gut microbiome in marine carnivores remains unanswered. In the present study, we compared the gut microbiomes of 16 species from different habitats. Principal component analysis (PCA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) separated three groups according to their gut microbiomes: marine carnivores, terrestrial carnivores, and terrestrial herbivores. The alpha diversity and niche breadth of the gut microbiome of marine carnivores were lower than those of the gut microbiome of terrestrial carnivores and terrestrial herbivores. The gut microbiome of marine carnivores harbored many marine microbiotas, including those belonging to the phyla Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, and Proteobacteria, and the genus Peptoclostridium. Collectively, these results revealed that marine habitats drive the convergent evolution of the gut microbiome of marine carnivores. This study provides a new perspective on the adaptive evolution of marine carnivores.

AB  - Once widespread in Europe, the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) suffered massive population declines in the second half of the 20th century and became extinct in some countries. For future conservation programs, it is important to understand the major causes of extinction. Here, we compared extinct and extant populations in Bavaria (Germany) and Tyrol (Austria) concerning the availability of roof trusses as roosts, as well as concerning heavy metals found in feces (lead, Pb; cadmium, Cd), persistent organic pollutants in the air of the roosts (lindane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and pentachloroanisole), landscape parameters (broadleaf forest, cropland, urbanisation), and light-pollution proxies (minimum and maximum radiance). We did not detect any recolonisation in extinct populations. One third of the buildings concerned are currently inaccessible for R. hipposideros because of closed entrances. Most roosts contained residues of lindane and pentachloroanisole, some of DDT. Pb and Cd concentrations were significantly higher for extinct than for extant colonies; these contaminations may at least partly explain the lack of recolonisation for the two thirds of buildings with open entrances. None of the parameters analyzed correlated significantly with the size of extant colonies. For further insight in the conservation biology of the lesser horseshoe bat in the Greater Alpine Space, assessment of transitional and hibernation roosts, linear habitat elements around roosts, and food availability in the face of insect decline will be necessary.

AB  - Earth's most imperiled and iconic wildlife are facing tough decisions under increasing human pressure and limited resources. Swimming across rivers and water bodies filled with high densities of predators may be one such example. In African lions Panthera leo, previous water crossings (recorded in the peer-reviewed and gray literature, on film, and found using Google Search, and YouTube) have recorded distances ranging from <10 to 100 m, with some resulting in mortality by Nile Crocodiles Crocodylis niloticus. However, we observed a coalition of male lions swimming >1 km across Uganda's Kazinga channel located in the Queen Elizabeth National Park six times, and recorded this behavior on film on February 1st 2024. We speculate that three factors could be driving these lions to take long-distance swims with a high density of crocodiles and hippos Hippopotamus amphibius, namely (1) the lack of lionesses in this ecosystem, (2) intraspecific fights over territory with other male coalitions, and (3) the only other land connection giving lions access to the peninsula is a small road bridge with a strong human presence.

AB  - Submerged aquatic plants with mixed reproduction mode may show enhanced clonal growth explained by environmental conditions. For Stuckenia pectinata (L.) Bo<spacing diaeresis>rner this has been linked to within-lake factors, both biotic (tuber predation, herbivory, periphyton shading) and abiotic (hydrological connectivity, sediment type). We investigated the S. pectinata population from Lake Naivasha, where submerged aquatic plants tolerated strong historical water level fluctuations until introduced crayfish, shading by floating exotic weeds and increased turbidity nearly eradicated them, although some stands now rebounded in various lake areas. Using 13 nuclear microsatellite loci, we analyzed genetic diversity and structure of S. pectinata subpopulations along the southeastern shoreline of the main lake and inside Crescent Island Crater, a peripheral lake basin enclosed within the rim of an extinct volcano. Results revealed a predominantly sexual reproductive strategy with limited clonal expansion in the main lake contrasting with pronounced clonal growth in the crater basin. Each subpopulation experienced recent bottlenecks. Crater basin subpopulations exhibited the strongest divergence, lower clonal diversity and larger-sized clones. We explain this differentiation by the exposed crater rim acting as barrier, isolating the crater basin from the main lake during recent decades when low water levels prevailed, accompanied with less negative impact from alien species than in the main lake. Clonal extension occurred on steepsloping hard sandy substrates, that likely prompted local reproductive adaptations. Genetic diversity, clonal structure and connectivity patterns are discussed in the light of the specific history and features of Lake Naivasha.

AB  - Societal Impact Statement From its beginning in 1846, Cambridge University Botanic Garden was conceived of as a plant science research and teaching facility. It has supported major advances in biology, including understanding of evolution and genetics. It promotes outreach to the public and students, explaining to all the importance of plants for life on Earth. It is part of a global network of botanic gardens and similar institutions dedicated to plant conservation and knowledge exchange. Perhaps most importantly, it celebrates the life-enhancing beauty of plants in all their diversity. Cambridge University Botanic Garden was established on its current site in 1846 by Charles Darwin's mentor, John Stevens Henslow. Many of Henslow's plantings and herbarium specimens still exist. William Bateson, who was one of the rediscoverers of Mendel's laws of inheritance and who coined the term 'genetics', worked at the Garden at the dawn of the last century. The attractive landscape is visited by 330,000 members of the public annually, and as originally intended by Henslow, it is an important resource for botanical teaching and research by the University and its collaborators. The Garden's collection comprises about 8000 plant species, 14,000 accessions, nine national collections and a diverse 2000 tree arboretum. Detailed analyses have revealed that, while most of the accessions are also held by other botanic gardens worldwide, several hundred are unique to Cambridge. As well as studies on fundamental principles of biology, the Garden's collection underpins research on global food security and applications in diverse fields such as engineering. As an example of research exploiting the Garden's range of floral forms, analyses of the visual factors determining the interaction between flowers and pollinating insects are described. Bee foraging behaviour may be altered by experimentally manipulating the structural and developmental bases of petal iridescence. The phylogenetic distribution of petal iridescence is consistent with the trait having evolved independently several times in the angiosperms.

AB  - Reliable population estimates are one of the most elementary needs for the management of wildlife, particularly for introduced ungulates on oceanic islands. We aimed to produce accurate and precise density estimates of Philippine deer (Rusa marianna) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa) on Guam using motion-triggered cameras combined with distance sampling to estimate densities from observations of unmarked animals while accounting for imperfect detection. We used an automated digital data processing pipeline for species recognition and to estimate the distance to detected species. Our density estimates were slightly lower than published estimates, consistent with management to reduce populations. We estimated the number of camera traps needed to obtain a 0.1 coefficient of variation was substantial, requiring > ten-fold increase in camera traps, while estimates with precision of 0.2 or 0.3 were more achievable, requiring doubling to quadrupling the number of camera traps. We provide best practices for establishing and conducting distance sampling with camera trap surveys for density estimation based on lessons learned during this study. Future studies should consider distance sampling with camera traps to efficiently survey and monitor unmarked animals, particularly medium-sized ungulates, in tropical, oceanic island ecosystems.

AB  - Bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum) and Napoleon wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) are large, charismatic species with high economic and cultural value in Palau and are important for ecosystem function.As a result of intense fishing pressure, landings in Palau for both species declined dramatically in the 1990s and, in response, national legislation was enacted in 2006 that imposed a total ban on the extraction, possession, and sale of both species.In 2013 and 2021, fisheries-independent stock assessments were conducted and found that the spawning potential ratios (SPRs) for bumphead parrotfish increased slightly from 30% to 34%. Conversely, the SPRs for Napoleon wrasse declined from 12% in 2013 to 4% in 2021. Despite the fishery being closed since 2006, these data suggest the likelihood of significant poaching, resulting in low SPR values, particularly for Napoleon wrasse.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, marine tourism played a central role in the economic and social life of Palau. A willingness-to-pay survey found that divers would pay $1.27 million (2020 USD) more for strictly managed catches of both species, and nearly $3.00 million more if the fishery remained closed.The total market value for bumphead parrotfish peaked in 1995 at $112,190. The peak total market value for Napoleon wrasse was $66,434 in 2002. The welfare gain/loss for diver tourism is an order of magnitude greater than the fishery market gain/loss, and healthy marine ecosystems are essential for the post-COVID-19 economic recovery of Palau. However, because of the cultural importance of these species, there is a desire to manage this fishery for customary use.Opening a general subsistence harvest season is not recommended ecologically; however, the results suggest that if the SPR of bumphead parrotfish can recover to 40%, a limited quota of individuals with a total length of >95 cm could be sustained, which could be allocated via lottery. However, the fishery for Napoleon wrasse should remain closed given the extremely low SPR values and limited number of large adults in the population.

AB  - Practical gaps in knowledge of fence ecology or its specific requirements still exist despite numerous recommendations scattered throughout various articles. We recently carried out two different studies on fences in a French context whose results corroborate this observation, and highlight the need to synthetise and prioritise scientific and technical research. The first study was an exploratory research project on escape devices used to allow ungulates to exit fenced transport infrastructure right-of-way. The second study entailed drafting a guide on the mitigation of the fence's ecological impacts, using solar energy plants as a case study. Both were based on different types of information gathering, ranging from bibliographical research to interviews with governments officials, operating companies, engineering offices, naturalists and hunters' associations.Based on the similarities between these two studies, the urgency of certain needs, and the clear potential for these approaches to extend beyond France's borders, we have identified two key categories for future actions. The first category is a series of six research priorities: Diversifying monitoring of exclusion fencing; Developing practice-oriented fence mapping tools; Further studying the impact of fencing on animal vehicle collisions; Considering animal behaviour in monitoring protocol; Ex-situ testing of devices' effectiveness; and Studying large-scale effects of fencing. The second category comprises six method recommendations: Accurately documenting fences; Early planning of scientific monitoring; Contextualising fencing requirements; Defining effectiveness goals and criteria; Taking advantage of opportunistic Animal-Fence Event observations; and Developing artificial intelligence and computer vision to map fences. All these items are supported by examples drawn from one study or the other.Our conclusions indicate that, in the context of major expansion of fences, such recommendations must be integrated at all stages of development work. If this is not implemented, the free movement of animal species will not be adequately protected and the erosion of biodiversity will be further exacerbated.

AB  - Between September and December, whale sharks (Rhincodon typus) aggregate in the coastal waters off Nosy Be, an island in north-western Madagascar. Swimming with these sharks has become an important tourism activity, but no formal protection is in place in Madagascar to protect this endangered species from the potential negative effects of tourism or other human impacts. Boat-based surveys (n = 405) were conducted from tourism vessels from September to December, 2015-2019. For most sightings (98%), whale sharks were sighted while foraging for bait fish at the surface, in association with mackerel tuna (Euthynnus affinis) and seabirds (Sternidae). A total of 408 individual whale sharks were individually photo-identified over this period. All individuals were immature, and 82% of sexed sharks were male. Sharks ranged from 3.0 to 8.0 m in total length (TL), with a mean TL of 5.65 +/- 0.94 m (n = 66) for females and 5.46 +/- 1.09 m for males (n = 295). Most sharks (72% of the identified individuals) were only identified once within the study period. Movement modelling showed an open population with a short mean residence time of 7.2 days. Resightings were recorded from up to 12 years apart (2007-2019). Ten sharks were seen in all five seasons during 2015-2019. A basic POPAN mark-recapture model estimated a total population size of 681 (608-763) sharks over the 2015-2019 period. Nosy Be waters are an important foraging ground for juvenile whale sharks. Sighting data demonstrate that a high proportion of the sharks' preferred habitat lies outside existing protected areas, but within an identified Key Biodiversity Area. National species-level protection and increased spatial management is warranted to secure the continued presence of whale sharks in this region.

AB  - As wild pigs (Sus scrofa) expand throughout North America researchers are increasingly being tasked with trapping and marking entire sounders (family groups) to attach monitoring devices or other identifying markers to gather knowledge to inform management. Capture and marking procedures can be challenging, dangerous for both researchers and animals, and time consuming, particularly when handling sounders. We developed an integrated pig-handling system to efficiently sort, weigh, chemically immobilize, and mark multiple wild pigs simultaneously in a controlled manner. To assess the functionality of the system, we evaluated 18 capture events in Texas, USA, from January 2018 to March 2019, where we marked 221 pigs of varied age classes and group sizes (2-19 animals). Using the pig-handling system, we chemically immobilized 51 large (41-101 kg) pigs and manually restrained 170 smaller (<45 kg) pigs with injury rates below 4%. Average handling times for large pigs was 71.9 (SD = 25.7) min and <1 min for smaller ones. We released sounders intact and routinely recorded them together on motion-activated cameras. Incorporating a handling system into wild pig research and management is encouraged to facilitate safe handling procedures for both pigs and handlers. (c) 2021 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Invasive macroalgae Eucheuma sp. and Kappaphycus spp. (E/K) became a dominant benthic feature in Ka over bar ne'ohe Bay throughout the past four decades - occurring on up to 74 ha of reef area and growing up to three meters thick, which prompted intensive management action. In 2013, E/K cover began decreasing at managed and unmanaged sites. This study examined the extent and timing of the E/K decline and evaluated environmental and ecological drivers beyond management contributing to the decline. E/K continued to recede into 2017 and remains sparse in Ka over bar ne'ohe Bay today. Increasing over the sampling period, herbivore biomass was negatively correlated with E/K cover, and other significant, non-linear relationships emerged between E/K cover and coral cover, sea surface temperature, wind, and rainfall. This study uncovers several possible mechanisms explaining a boom and bust in E/K abundance, emphasizes the importance of herbivory, and highlights the resilience of coral reefs in Ka over bar ne'ohe Bay.

AB  - Grazing livestock derive most of their mineral requirements from foraging. The presence of toxic elements in soils has become a significant concern for food safety and ecosystem services. Understanding the mineral content profiles in soil and forage is crucial for assessing animal health, predicting potential transfers of minerals or heavy metals into the food -chain, and assessing threats to the environment and human health. In this study, Na, Mg, P, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb were measured to determine the mineral status of three different pasture -based farming systems (with grazing sheep livestock) in a Spanish region of significant economic importance. A risk assessment evaluation of animal, environmental, and human health was performed on soil, forage, feed, serum, milk, and wool. Notably, traces of Pb, and As were identified in pastures in all farms. Our calculation of pollution indices revealed moderate levels of contamination by various elements, including Co, Cu, Zn, Se, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb. The two farms with more intense agrosystem practices showed a significant potential ecological risk, characterized by high soil levels of Hg and Cd. Animals from these farms also had high concentrations of these metals in wool. Although the target Hazard Quotient derived from milk consumption suggests that dairy products from this area are safe for consumption for adults, only milk from a dehesa farm (mix of woodland and pastureland) was free of potential health concerns related to Pb exposure. Our assessment of mineral profiles reveals a cohesive relationship between soil quality and derived animal products, particularly of the Merino sheep breeding and farming system. The results reveal the importance of adopting and reinforcing strategies to preserve dehesas as a sustainable and environmentally friendly agrosystem in the western Mediterranean region.

AB  - Entomopathogenic nematodes are increasingly used in biological pest control, and are considered to be envi-ronmentally friendly. However, due to their potentially wide range of insect hosts, they may detrimentally affect biodiversity. We here investigate effects of nematode applications against the oak processionary moth, Thau-metopoea processionea, on non-target organisms using beat sheet sampling and light trapping. While such effects have been repeatedly explored for soil and xylobiontic arthropods, effects on herbivorous insects are largely unexplored. We found no statistically significant short-or longer-term effects on either Lepidoptera or other insect orders. While we cannot completely rule out some weak short-term reductions in individual numbers (-12 %), considerable long-term effects on non-target insects can be largely ruled out. Provided a targeted localized application, applying the nematode Steinernema feltiae seems to be an environmentally friendly method for controlling populations of T. processionea at locations with increased risks for human health.

AB  - Vertebrate scavenging can impact food web dynamics, but our understanding of this process stems predominantly from monitoring herbivore carrion and extrapolating results across carcass types. Recent evidence suggests carnivores may avoid intraguild scavenging to reduce parasite transmission. If this behavior is widespread across diverse ecosystems, estimation of nutrient cycling and community scavenging rates are likely biased to a currently unknown degree. We examined whether the time to initiate scavenging, carcass persistence, or the richness of species scavenging in the boreal forest of Yukon, Canada, differed between carnivore and herbivore carcasses. Vertebrates took longer to initiate scavenging on carnivore carcasses (3.2 d) relative to herbivore carcasses (1.1 d), and carnivore carcasses persisted on the landscape for over a month longer (48.4 d and 5.5 d, respectively). The longer persistence times were due to the reduction in scavenging by carnivores such as Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis). Decreased scavenging was caused by changes in the propensity to consume carnivore carrion, as the number of species detecting a carcass within the first week did not differ between carnivore and herbivore carcasses. These results have ramifications for our understanding of nutrient cycling and food web dynamics in the boreal forest and provide further support that carcass type should be included in future studies.

AB  - This study aimed to predict the habitat suitability of Asian elephants in Madhesh Province, Nepal, by using maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling based on the occurrence data and environmental variables, including bioclimatic, topographic, vegetation-related, and anthropogenic variables. The study was conducted under current and future climate scenarios for the year 2100. Among the districts of Madhesh Province, the largest suitable habitats for elephants are located in Rautahat district (30%) followed by Bara district (21%), with Dhanusha district having the smallest suitable area (1%). Elevation, slope, annual precipitation, precipitation of the driest quarter, and temperature seasonality were identified as the most important variables affecting habitat suitability. A total of 1037.3 km2 was identified as the current highly suitable habitat for elephants, primarily in grasslands and shrublands. The results of the study depict a slight increase in highly suitable areas under the emission scenarios shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) 2-4.5 and SSP 5-8.5 but a severe decrease in suitable habitats and a drastic increase in unsuitable habitats. The research emphasizes the possible influence of human activities and land use on the living environment of elephants. The study, therefore, suggests that the authorities should prioritize future land use management to lessen the potential harm to the habitats of elephants and other endangered species in Nepal. It is also imperative to identify how elephants utilize their spatial habitat within their range to help park authorities devise efficient management strategies.

AB  - Phenols can play a significant role in plant tolerance of drought and herbivory. We assessed the concentration, richness and structural complexity of soluble phenols (hereafter phenols) in leaves of different species representing different plant morphotypes of arid ecosystems. We selected seven species representative of the three main plant morphotypes of the Patagonia Monte (Argentina): tall evergreen shrubs (TES), medium evergreen shrubs (MES), and perennial grasses (PG). These morphotypes differed in plant height, rooting depth, proportion of photosynthetic tissues, specific leaf area, and concentration of phenols and N in leaves. We found 48 compounds belonging to six types of phenols differing in structural complexity (low complexity: simple phenols, phenolic acids and phenolic esters; medium complexity: hydroxycinnamic acids and phenylpropenes; and high complexity: quinones, flavonols and flavones). Phenols of low and medium complexity were the most abundant in all morphotypes, while those of high complexity, probably the most costly for plants, were nearly exclusive of some tall evergreen shrubs. In general, PG, MES and TES had low, intermediate and high phenol concentration (8.5, 27.2, 202.5 mg g(-1) DW, respectively) and richness (15, 25, 37 compounds, respectively) in leaves. The richness of phenols was significantly and positively related to phenol concentration. However, we did not find distinctive phenol compound patterns among morphotypes. Our results suggest that drought and, to some extent, herbivory have exerted selective selection pressure on richness and phenol concentration in leaves of contrasting morphotypes but the type of phenols accumulated probably depends on intrinsic species attributes within each morphotype.

AB  - Following the flush of spring growth of primary production (the ???green wave??? hypothesis) has been applied as a universal explanation for spring migration timing of avian herbivores. However, studies of the green wave hypothesis have focused on species feeding intensively on above-ground primary production. To test whether a facultative grazer strictly follows the green wave, we used 16 complete tracks in time and space of spring migrating tundra bean geese (Anser serrirostris) fitted with telemetry devices from two flyways between Yangtze River Floodplain winter areas and Anadyr (Russia)/Central Arctic breeding grounds. We combined these with high spatial resolution MODIS satellite-derived plant production data to relate the timing of spring migration to that of the green wave index (GWI) at different staging regions and on breeding areas. Results showed that, at stopovers south of 52??N, eastern tundra bean geese fed mainly on cropland and arrived at stopover sites ahead of 50% GWI. At all subsequent stopover sites in Russia, eastern tundra bean geese fed exclusively on natural forage land, and followed GWI northwards, finally overtaking GWI to arrive at the breeding sites in advance of these dates. These data show that satellite-derived GWI are generally poor predictors of the arrival dates of spring migrating eastern tundra bean geese, but that deviations related to differential habitat use along the flyway and the need to arrive on the breeding areas ahead of snowmelt to coincide subsequent hatching of goslings with optimal food availability.

AB  - Characterization of intestinal microbiota is of great interest due to its relevant impact on growth, feed efficiency and pig carcass quality. Microbial composition shifts along the gut, but it also depends on the host (i.e., age, genetic background), diet composition and environmental conditions. To simultaneously study the effects of producing type (PT), production phase (PP) and dietary crude protein (CP) content on microbial populations, 20 Duroc pigs and 16 crossbred pigs (F2), belonging to growing and fattening phases, were used. Half of the pigs of each PT were fed a moderate CP restriction (2%). After sacrifice, contents of ileum, cecum and distal colon were collected for sequencing procedure. Fattening pigs presented higher microbial richness than growing pigs because of higher maturity and stability of the community. The F2 pigs showed higher bacterial alpha diversity and microbial network complexity (cecum and colon), especially in the fattening phase, while Duroc pigs tended to have higher Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in cecum segment. Lactobacillus was the predominant genus, and along with Streptococcus and Clostridium, their relative abundance decreased throughout the intestine. Although low CP diet did not alter the microbial diversity, it increased interaction network complexity. These results have revealed that the moderate CP restriction had lower impact on intestinal microbiota than PP and PT of pigs.

AB  - Climate change is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of large-scale wildfires and threaten scores of wildlife species. However, the state of understanding of how medium-sized ground -dwelling mammals, of which many are threatened, respond to such wildfires remains limited. The Australian 'Black Summer ' fires were unprecedented in their extent and severity, and burned large swathes of habitat for threatened species, providing an opportunity to address this information deficit. We used camera -trapping to investigate how populations of several small, threatened macropods and other medium-sized ground -dwelling mammals in five wildfire -affected subtropical study areas responded to the 'Black Summer ' fires, two years on from the event. We examined whether occupancy was influenced by fire, habitat, or landscape variables to evaluate capacity to survive severe fire events and identify populations of conservation significance. Four species of small macropod (three threatened) were restricted to different subsets of the study areas but there was no evidence this was influenced by the wildfires. The red -legged pademelon showed a negative response to fire severity whereas occupancy of the other three was not influenced by fire. Two common species groups (bandicoots and brushtail possums), and the feral cat, were widespread and also showed no difference in occupancy in fire -affected areas. Vegetation cover positively influenced the occupancy of the northern long -nosed potoroo and the red -necked pademelon, and presumably offset any fire effect 2 years after the wildfires. Our study confirms that populations of threatened and non -threatened medium-sized mammals can recover following severe wildfires and suggests that conservation of most of the threatened macropods could be focused on threats other than wildfire in reserves where they appear to be most abundant.

AB  - Fish-habitat associations are fundamental ecological relationships characterising marine community assembly. The strength of fish-habitat associations can be indicative of ecosystem resilience, making them important benchmarks for ecological monitoring. These relationships are relatively unknown in mesophotic (30-150 m) marine systems due to the constraints of sampling in deeper waters. We aimed to assess fish-habitat associations in two unstudied no-take National Park Zones in the recently established Abrolhos Marine Park, Western Australia. We used the first baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) in this area to quantify demersal fish and benthic habitats between 33 and 154 m depth and modelled associations among fish species, traits and environmental covariates using Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC). Significant evidence of species-environment, trait-environment, and species-species associations was identified which may influence local community assembly. Benthic habitats explained 62.4% of the modelled variation in fish abundance, and 7 of the 21 modelled species showed strong statistical relationships with habitat, particularly macroalgae. The modelled species-environment relationships enabled us to infer the distribution of a subset of fish species across these understudied no-take zones. This study demonstrates the potential of discrete opportunistic studies using stereo-BRUVs for investigating the key drivers of community assembly in mesophotic marine environments. Our findings emphasise the importance of ongoing efforts to map and monitor benthic habitats and bathymetry as influential drivers of higher order species distribution beyond the coastal zone.

AB  - Wild boars (Sus scrofa L.) are considered among the most harmful invasive species worldwide, causing irreversible ecosystem damage, acting as zoonotic spreaders and reservoirs, threatening human and animal health, and having an important economic impact. Accordingly, the present study has assessed the rickettsial exposure, tick infestation of wild boars, and rickettsial DNA presence in ticks from infested animals from the Cerrado biome in midwestern Brazil. Anti-Rickettsia spp. antibodies were detected in serum samples of wild boars by immunofluorescence assay. Overall, 106/285 (37.2%) wild boar serum samples from 13 to 18 (72.2%) municipalities showed seroreactivity to at least one of the four Rickettsia spp. antigens tested, the largest number of wild boars serologically tested to Rickettsia spp. in this type of study. Among the 106 seroreactive animals, 34 showed possible homologous reactions between R. parkeri, R. amblyommatis, and R. bellii, with endpoint titers between 128 and 512. A sample of 45 ticks collected from four culled wild boars was identified as Amblyomma sculptum, and all tested negative for rickettsial DNA presence. In conclusion, this study has provided a reliable sampling seroprevalence and indicated high exposure of wild boars to rickettsial agents, with a potential interaction with Rickettsia spp. from the spotted fever group within the Cerrado biome from midwestern Brazil.

AB  - The status of pinnipeds on mid-Atlantic ridge islands is reviewed to detect trends that may relate to climate change. Small numbers of southern elephant seals Mirounga leonina breed on Gough Island (40 degrees S, 10 degrees W) and at Bouvetoya (54 degrees 24 ' S, 03 degrees 21 ' E) where numbers remained small over similar to 68 years. Vagrant southern elephant seals wandered farther north to tropical Saint Helena Island (15 degrees 57 ' S, 5 degrees 41 ' W) in historical times but have not been recorded there more recently. This suggests a contraction of their distributional range, as manifested in the decline in numbers to imminent extinction at Gough Island. At Gough Island and at Tristan da Cunha (37 degrees 05 ' S, 12 degrees 17 ' W), leopard seals Hydrurga leptonyx and Antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella are occasional seasonal transients from Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands and the circumpolar sea ice farther to the south. Large populations of Antarctic fur seals A. gazella and sub-Antarctic fur seals A. tropicalis breed at Bouvetoya and Gough Island, respectively. The current state of both populations is uncertain as other populations of conspecifics in the South Atlantic and South Indian oceans are in decline ostensibly contingent upon reduced food availability, likely precipitated by climate change.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) damage agriculture and the environment, as well as transmit diseases to animals and people. Hunters are particularly vulnerable to zoonotic disease risks when harvesting wild pigs. Management agencies have endeavored to inform the public about disease risks associated with wild pigs and best practices for mitigating such risks. However, the extent that this guidance has reached hunters and influenced their practices is unclear. We approached this topic through an analysis of wild pig hunting videos on YouTube. We found evidence of relatively few behaviors and communications regarding disease risks and best practices for personal safety. In contrast, many videos showed behaviors that could increase the risk of disease transmission to the subjects and other animals. We emphasize the importance of understanding the influence of social media on viewers and discuss implications for management agencies, including opportunities for strategic messaging in public health campaigns.

AB  - Composting is an effective method for utilizing agricultural straw waste and livestock manure resources. Using deer manure and corn straw as raw materials, the changes in various indexes were studied during composting under different initial C/N ratios, initial moisture contents, and particle sizes of corn straw, and compost maturity was evaluated. Moisture content, total organic carbon content, and C/N ratio all declined during composting, while total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total potassium, pH, germination index, and electrical conductivity increased. The grey relational analysis method was used to evaluate maturity. The results showed that a mixture of stalk and deer manure with initial moisture content of 55%, initial C/N ratio of 30:1, and a straw particle size of 1.5-3.5 cm constituted the optimal experimental conditions. Taguchi analysis indicated that initial moisture content exerted the greatest influence on compost maturity, followed by initial C/N ratio and crushed straw particle size. This study provides an important reference for the utilization of compost derived from a mixture of livestock manure and straw.

AB  - Severe defoliation of mangrove species is reported in several parts of the world. We analyzed the effect of a severe defoliation event resulting from the attack of a lepidopteran caterpillar (an insect outbreak) on the litterfall production. The attack occurred between 2009 and 2010 in a mangrove in southeastern Brazil. Leaf litter production by different mangrove species between 2008 and 2019, was considered in the analysis. The infestation directly affected the species Avicennia schaueriana Stapf & Leechm in all physiographic types assessed, with a decrease in leaf litter production between 43% and 86% since the monitoring began (2009) until the year when defoliation reached the maximum (2011). A decrease in the impact of defoliation was observed along the tidal flooding gradient, with more pronounced effects in forests located in the transition zone with the salt-flat, and progressive decrease towards fringe forests. In fringe and basin forests, leaf litter production by Laguncularia racemosa (L.) decreased between 52% and 67% between 2009 and 2011, respectively, and increased 30% in transition forests. Contrarily, the contribution of Rhizophora mangle (L.) increased 7% in basin, became noticeable in transition, and decreased by 25% in the fringe forests. The time required for A. schaueriana to recover the level of debris production was 8 years, and still reflect the effect of the severe, selective defoliation process on the dynamics and ecological succession of mangrove forests. A model that determines the stages of defoliation and their direct and indirect impacts on litter was developed.

AB  - In large herbivores, the timing of births often coincides with the seasonal peak of food resources availability, likely to improve juvenile survival and reduce reproduction costs. Some species, however, breed year-round, even in seasonal environments. Demographic processes, such as to what extent being born during the lean season reduces survival of juveniles and reproductive females, remain understudied in large mammals inhabiting tropical ecosystems. We investigated survival rates in plains zebras (Equus quagga) in Hwange National Park (Zimbabwe), a highly seasonal savanna ecosystem. We used capture-recapture models to analyse long-term demographic data (2008-2019). We investigated the effect of seasonality as a categorical (wet versus dry season) and continuous (duration of the dry season) variable on survival. We found little variability in early juvenile survival (phi = 0.458 +/- 0.044 SE, < 6 m.o.), whereas late juvenile and yearling survivals were higher and decreased with increasing length of the dry season (from 0.850 +/- 0.095 SE to 0.480 +/- 0.120 SE). Female survival was high (> 0.703 +/- 0.057 SE and up to 0.995 +/- 0.006 SE) but decreased with exposure to the dry season in non-reproductive females. The probability of females becoming reproductive in the following year was not affected by the length of the dry season (0.423 and 0.420 for reproductive and non-reproductive females, respectively). Our results highlight the importance of individual quality in reproductive performance, as reproductive females seem to buffer the effect of environmental variability on their own survival and that of their foal.

AB  - Few landscape-scale experiments test the effects of predators on the abundance and distribution of prey across habitat gradients. We use the assisted colonization of a top predator, the Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii), to test the impacts of predation on the abundance, habitat use and temporal activity of a widespread prey species, the omnivorous common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Before introduction of devils to Maria Island, Tasmania, Australia, in 2012, possums were abundant in open grasslands as well as forests. Predation by devils caused high mortality of possums in grasslands, but individuals with access to trees had a higher survival probability. Possum abundance declined across the whole island from 2012-2016, as possums disappeared almost completely from grasslands and declined in drier forests with more open understorey. Abundance remained stable in wet forests, which are not preferred habitat for possums but provide better refuge from devils. Abundance and habitat use of possums remained unchanged at a control site on the adjacent Tasmanian mainland, where the devil population was low and stable. This study demonstrates how spatial variation in predator-caused mortality can limit both abundance and habitat breadth in generalist prey species, excluding them entirely from certain habitats.

AB  - On a population level, individual plasticity in reproductive phenology can provoke either anticipations or delays in the average reproductive timing in response to environmental changes. However, a rigid reliance on photoperiodism can constraint such plastic responses in populations inhabiting temperate latitudes. The regulation of breeding season length may represent a further tool for populations facing changing environments. Nonetheless, this skill was reported only for equatorial, nonphotoperiodic populations. Our goal was to evaluate whether species living in temperate regions and relying on photoperiodism to trigger their reproduction may also be able to regulate breeding season length. During 10 years, we collected 2,500 female reproductive traits of a mammal model species (wild boar Sus scrofa) and applied a novel analytical approach to reproductive patterns in order to observe population-level variations of reproductive timing and synchrony under different weather and resources availability conditions. Under favorable conditions, breeding seasons were anticipated and population synchrony increased (i.e., shorter breeding seasons). Conversely, poor conditions induced delayed and less synchronous (i.e., longer) breeding seasons. The potential to regulate breeding season length depending on environmental conditions may entail a high resilience of the population reproductive patterns against environmental changes, as highlighted by the fact that almost all mature females were reproductive every year.

AB  - Phytoplankton employ a variety of defence mechanisms against predation, including production of toxins. Domoic acid (DA) production by the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia spp. is induced by the presence of predators and is considered to provide defence benefits, but the evidence is circumstantial. We exposed eight different strains of P. seriata to chemical cues from copepods and examined the costs and the benefits of toxin production. The magnitude of the induced toxin response was highly variable among strains, while the costs in terms of growth reduction per DA cell quota were similar and the trade-off thus consistent. We found two components of the defence in induced cells: (i) a 'private good' in terms of elevated rejection of captured cells and (ii) a 'public good' facilitated by a reduction in copepod feeding activity. Induced cells were more frequently rejected by copepods and rejections were directly correlated with DA cell quota and independent of access to other food items. By contrast, the public-good effect was diminished by the presence of alternative prey suggesting that it does not play a major role in bloom formation and that its evolution is closely associated with the grazing-deterrent private good.

AB  - Herbivores are commonly classified as host specialists or generalists for various purposes, yet the definitions of these terms, and their intermediates, are often imprecise and ambiguous. We quantified host breadth for 240 non-native, tree-feeding insects in North America using phylogenetic diversity. We demonstrated that a partitioning of host breadth: (1) causes 67% of non-native insects to shift from a generalist to specialist category, (2) displays a reduction in host breadth from the native to introduced range, (3) identifies an inflection point in a model predicting the likelihood of non-native insect ecological impact, with a corresponding change in behaviour associated with specialists versus generalists, and (4) enables three models for strong prediction of whether a non-native forest insect will cause high impacts. Together, these results highlight the primacy of how herbivore host recognition and plant defences mediate whether novel host interactions will result in high impact after invasion.

AB  - Shrubs are important factors in the assembly of desert plant and animal communities. By providing shelter and resources to other plants and animals, shrubs can change plant-animal interactions including those with consumers and pollinators. Here, we test the hypothesis that shrubs facilitate the reproduction of other desert plants by influencing pollination and compensa-tion for consumer pressure. We used the known benefactor Larrea tridentata as our focal shrub species and the flowering annual Malacothrix glabrata as a potential protege in the Mojave Desert. We tested the effects of facilitation (shrub microsite), consumer pressure (both artificial folivory and florivory), and pollination (ambient or supplemented) on flower and seed production of the annual M. glabrata. We found that floral production and seed mass were similar between microsites but that pollen was limited under shrubs in the absence of any other manipulation. Plants under shrubs produced more flowers and seeds than in the open when folivory and florivory treatments were applied. Malacothrix glabrata experienced a cost to association with L. tridentata in terms of pollen limitation but plants were better able to compensate for consumer pressure under shrubs through increased flower and seed production when damaged. Therefore, association with shrubs involves a reproductive trade-off between costs to pollination and benefits to compensation for consumer pressure.

AB  - Life history trade-offs are one of the central tenets of evolutionary demography. Trade-offs, depicting negative covariances between individuals' life history traits, can arise from genetic constraints, or from a finite amount of resources that each individual has to allocate in a zero-sum game between somatic and reproductive functions. While theory predicts that trade-offs are ubiquitous, empirical studies have often failed to detect such negative covariances in wild populations. One way to improve the detection of trade-offs is by accounting for the environmental context, as trade-off expression may depend on environmental conditions. However, current methodologies usually search for fixed covariances between traits, thereby ignoring their context dependence. Here, we present a hierarchical multivariate 'covariance reaction norm' model, adapted from Martin (2023), to help detect context dependence in the expression of life-history trade-offs using demographic data. The method allows continuous variation in the phenotypic correlation between traits. We validate the model on simulated data for both intraindividual and intergenerational trade-offs. We then apply it to empirical datasets of yellow-bellied marmots (Marmota flaviventer) and Soay sheep (Ovis aries) as a proof-of-concept showing that new insights can be gained by applying our methodology, such as detecting trade-offs only in specific environments. We discuss its potential for application to many of the existing long-term demographic datasets and how it could improve our understanding of trade-off expression in particular, and life history theory in general.
   This proof-of-concept paper highlights that the context dependence of trade-offs can be successfully detected, hence potentially improving our understanding of life-history theory. Photo credit: Arpat Ozgul. Sheep illustration from Phylopic by Gabriela Palomo-Munoz.image

AB  - Purpose Dicrocoeliosis can be an important cause of production loss in ruminants due to the cost of liver condemnation at slaughter. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Dicrocoelium infection and to predict the ecological niches and climatic variables that support dicrocoeliosis in the Himalayan ranges of Pakistan. Methods and Results Dicrocoelium was detected in 33 of 381 liver samples and 238 of 6060 blood samples taken from sheep and goat herds in the area. The prevalence of dicrocoeliosis was higher in sheep than in goats and highest in females aged more than 3 years. An environmental risk map was created to predict active zones of transmission and showed the highest probability values in central parts of the Chitral district in the northwest of Pakistan. Climatic variables of the mean monthly diurnal temperature range (Bio2), annual precipitation (Bio12), and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the presence of Dicrocoelium infection. Conclusion Together, the findings of this study demonstrate the most suitable ecological niches and climatic variables influencing the risk of dicrocoeliosis in the Himalayan ranges of Pakistan. The methods and results could be used as a reference to inform the control of dicrocoeliosis in the region.

AB  - An investigation was conducted in the vicinity of a sustainable pig farm to assess the presence of antibiotics through SPE-HPLC/MS/MS, microbial communities via Illumina high-throughput sequencing, and antibiotic resistance genes using SmartChip technology. The study revealed that tetracyclines were the predominant antibiotics detected in the soil and sediment surrounding the pig farm, with residual concentrations ranging from 33.3 to 1244.2 mu g center dot kg-1. The most prevalent phyla identified at various sampling sites were Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. A total of 188 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and 9 mobile genetic elements were found in the sediment, with aminoglycoside (particularly aadA2-03), sulfonamide (specifically sul2), and tetracycline (particularly tetX) resistance genes being the most frequently observed. The presence of tetracycline residue was observed to influence the composition of the microbial community, whereas no significant association was found between antibiotics and ARGs. Examination of the correlation between ARGs and bacteria at the phylum level demonstrated that Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Planctomycetota, and Gemmatimonadota were the predominant phyla associated with ARG presence near an intensive pig farm. Notably, Cyanobacteria may function as a continual reservoir and/or shelter for ARGs, thereby potentially contributing to the dissemination of ARGs in the sediment environment in close proximity to a pig farm. This study presents evidence of the ecological risks posed by antibiotics in a pig farm-cropland system, highlighting the connection between microbial community structure and ARGs. Therefore, the issue of antibiotic residues must be factored into the sustainability of animal husbandry practices.
   An evaluation of the use of antibiotics was conducted in the area surrounding a sustainable pig farm.Tetracycline residue had a considerable effect on the microbial community composition.No meaningful connection was observed between antibiotics and their resistance genes.Cyanobacteria may serve as a sustained reservoir for ARGs and thus contribute to the distribution of ARGs.

AB  - The genus Camellia is widely distributed, primarily in East Asia. Camellia japonica is located at the northern limit of this genus distribution, and understanding changes in its distribution is crucial for understanding the evolution of plants in this region, as well as their relationship with geological history and climate change. Moreover, the classification of sect. Camellia in Japan has not been clarified. Therefore, this study aims to understand the evolutionary history of the Japanese sect. Camellia. The genetic population structure was analysed using SNP data and MIG-seq. The relationship between the Japanese sect. Camellia, including the related species in China, was further inferred from the phylogeny generated by RA x ML, SplitsTree and PCA. Population genetic structure was inferred using a Bayesian clustering method (ADMIXTURE). We subsequently employed approximate Bayesian computation, which was further supported by the coalescent simulations (DIYABC, fastsimcoal and Bayesian Skyline Plots) to explore the changes in population, determining which events appropriately explain the phylogeographical signature. Ecological niche modelling was combined with genetic analyses to compare current and past distributions. The analyses consistently showed that C. japonica and C. rusticana are distinct, having diverged from each other during the Middle to Late Miocene period. Furthermore, C. japonica differentiated into four major populations (North, South, Ryukyu-Taiwan and Continent). The Japanese sect. Camellia underwent speciation during archipelago formation, reflecting its ancient evolutionary history compared with other native Japanese plants. C. rusticana did not diverge from C. japonica in snow-rich environments during the Quaternary period. Our results suggest that both species have been independent since ancient times and that ancestral populations of C. japonica have persisted in northern regions. Furthermore, the C. japonica population on the continent is hypothesised to have experienced a reverse-colonisation event from southern Japan during the late Pleistocene glaciation.

AB  - The water bodies of the Saskatchewan Prairies suffer multiple stressors, and demand for water is expected to increase. Water quality models can help evaluate water management strategies and risks such as climate change. This study assesses the impact of interbasin water transfers on the water quality of a strategic, eutrophic prairie reservoir that receives poor-quality watershed run-off. A one-dimensional WASP model was used to estimate nutrient transformations in the transfers along a 97 km river channel. The WASP model was then loosely coupled to a two-dimensional CE-QUAL-W2 model of the downstream receiving reservoir. Output from the WASP model was manually transformed into boundary conditions for the CE-QUAL-W2 reservoir model. This method improves on an earlier attempt to estimate nutrient transformations in the transfers using linear regression. Results from the loosely coupled models suggest Buffalo Pound Lake would respond well to the interbasin transfers. The number of threshold exceedances decreased for all modeled water quality variables. Nutrient concentrations were most influenced in the open water season following spring freshet. Any additional reduction of threshold exceedances during winter was minimal in comparison. These results are interesting from a management perspective as increased transfers under winter operations risk ice damage to the river channel.

AB  - Natural ecological systems typically exhibit transient dynamics, driven by various ecological and environmental factors. Understanding the root causes of transient behaviour and the associated regime shifts is of central importance for the sustainable management of ecosystems. Here, we develop and analyse a process-based model to describe the interaction between plants and their herbivore predators and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying transient patterns in plant-herbivore systems. Our model involves key components including seed-reproduction rates, plant dispersal abilities, the germination probabilities of seeds surviving predation, local interactions among plants, seed-predation rates, and herbivore conversion efficiencies. The plant-herbivore system has exhibited short-term and long-term transient behaviour and strong dependence of plant demography and predation pressure on abrupt transient shifts and duration of transients. Our results have demonstrated that high seed-reproduction rates obstruct long transients and can lead to extinctions of plants with low dispersal abilities. Herbivore predators have also exhibited delayed response to abrupt increases in plant density, even if their seed-predation rate is high. Taken together, our findings suggest that transient patterns are predominantly driven by the ecological and environmental pressure that plants experience.

AB  - Genomic prediction, the technique whereby an individual's genetic component of their phenotype is estimated from its genome, has revolutionised animal and plant breeding and medical genetics. However, despite being first introduced nearly two decades ago, it has hardly been adopted by the evolutionary genetics community studying wild organisms. Here, genomic prediction is performed on eight traits in a wild population of Soay sheep. The population has been the focus of a >30 year evolutionary ecology study and there is already considerable understanding of the genetic architecture of the focal Mendelian and quantitative traits. We show that the accuracy of genomic prediction is high for all traits, but especially those with loci of large effect segregating. Five different methods are compared, and the two methods that can accommodate zero-effect and large-effect loci in the same model tend to perform best. If the accuracy of genomic prediction is similar in other wild populations, then there is a real opportunity for pedigree-free molecular quantitative genetics research to be enabled in many more wild populations; currently the literature is dominated by studies that have required decades of field data collection to generate sufficiently deep pedigrees. Finally, some of the potential applications of genomic prediction in wild populations are discussed.

AB  - Wildlife species are often used as bioindicators to evaluate the extent and severity of environmental contami-nation and the effectiveness of remediation practices. A common approach for investigating population-or community-level impacts on bioindicators compares demographic parameter estimates (e.g., population size or density) between sites that were subjected to different levels of contamination. However, the traditional analytical method used in such studies is nonspatial capture-recapture, which results in conclusions about po-tential relationships between demographics and contaminants being inferred indirectly. Here, we extend this comparative approach to the spatially explicit framework, allowing direct estimation of said relationships and comparisons between study areas, by applying spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models to bioindicator (deer mice [Peromyscus spp.]) detection data from two study areas that were subjected to different industrial activities and remediation practices. Bioindicator density differed by 178% between the neighboring study areas, and the area with the highest soil concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, chromium, and zinc had the highest bio-indicator density. Under the traditional nonspatial approach, we might have concluded that soil chemical levels had negligible influences on demographics. However, by modeling density as a spatial function of select chemical concentrations using SCR models, we found strong support for a positive relationship between density and soil chromium concentrations in one study area (beta = 0.82), which was not masked by or associated with habitat -related metrics. To obtain reliable inferences about potential effects of environmental contamination on bio-indicator demographics, we contend that a comparative spatially explicit approach using SCR ought to become standard.

AB  - The importance of animals for mediating ecosystem processes has long been recognized by ecologists. Traditionally, consumer-mediated dynamics have been considered through consumptive pathways such as predation and herbivory. Yet, consumers also play critical roles in mediating "bottom-up" pathways associated with nutrient dynamics. Foundational research demonstrated the importance of these dynamics in terrestrial, freshwater, and pelagic marine ecosystems, and introduced novel perspectives on the role of animals such as wildebeest, lacustrine fishes, and zooplankton, respectively, for providing an important source of nutrients that limit primary production. This research inspired a substantial body of research on the importance of consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics for ecosystem function. Despite this, only recently have ecologists begun to extend this line of thinking toward coastal marine ecosystems. The data presented herein is a comprehensive study of consumer nutrient dynamics from invertebrates and fishes that live in subtropical and tropical Caribbean coastal marine waters, including mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs. This data set represents the largest, to my knowledge, published nutrient stoichiometry data set from a single system, including estimates of excretion rates (n = 900 individuals total; n = 667 individual fish, size range 0.14-2,597 g [2-107 cm]; n = 233 invertebrates, size range 0.04-487 g), and somatic nutrient content analyses (n = 658 individuals total, n = 494 vertebrates, n = 164 invertebrates). These data also include delta C-13 and delta N-15 stable isotopes of whole body, body mass (wet mass), taxonomic identification to class-level, and functional group classification. These data have been used to test basic ecological theory, to scale individual-level processes to coral reef, mangrove, and seagrass ecosystems, and to understand the role of human impacts for mitigating consumer-mediated nutrient dynamics. While these findings have helped improve our understanding of nutrient dynamics in tropical coastal ecosystems, these data offer a wealth of additional promise for advancing ecological theory and applied science in tropical marine ecosystems and beyond. Users are free to use and analyze the data. Attribution should be given to this presentation of the data.

AB  - Herbivory plays a fundamental role in determining the structure of savannas. The impacts of small and medium-sized mammalian herbivores on trees in savannas remain poorly understood because most research attention focuses on large herbivores such as elephants whose destructive effects on trees can be pervasive at landscape scales. On the other hand, feeding activities of generalist herbivores such as Cape porcupines on woody plants can lead to tree mortality. This study investigated the utilisation of woody plants by the Cape porcupine in three mesic savanna sites in South Africa. We determined the woody plant diet of the porcupine for the early and late dry seasons at Roodeplaat Farm in Gauteng Province, and at Goss Game Farm and Bisley Valley Nature Reserve in KwaZulu-Natal Province. Thirty and twenty randomly located quadrats (30 m x 30 m) were laid at Roodeplaat and Goss, respectively, while 10 smaller quadrats (10 m x 10 m) were laid at Bisley. We measured stem diameter and the length and width of bark scars made by porcupines on stems of woody plants. We collected ten dung samples from each study site in the wet and dry seasons for quantification of woody material in porcupine diet. Porcupine foraging behaviour impacted different tree species at each site: Vachellia robusta at Roodeplaat, Spirostachys africana at Goss and Vachellia nilotica at Bisley. Each of these trees was dominant at each site. More scarring and tree mortality were recorded at Bisley with almost 70% tree sapling mortality occurring on trees that porcupine fed on. The size of bark scars was greater at Goss (P < 0.01) than at Roodeplaat and Bisley, which were similar. The area of bark damage on S. africana trees differed significantly by stem diameter size class (P = 0.007) and was greater for small stems (size class < 7.1 cm) than the larger stems (size classes 7.1-14 cm and 14.1-21). For all the study sites, dung samples revealed that woody material contributed over 80% of the porcupine diet during the dry season, but was lower at 35% during the wet season for Roodeplaat, although it was consistently high for Bisley at 79%. Porcupine foraging activities substantially contributed to tree mortality at each site. We posit that porcupine induced mortality on dominant tree species at each site may contribute to structural heterogeneity in woody plant vegetation in mesic savannas.

AB  - Camelina sativa, commonly referred to as camelina or false flax, has emerged as a promising cover crop with the potential to mitigate climate change-a pressing global challenge that demands urgent and sustainable solutions. Belonging to the Brassicaceae family and native to Europe and Central Asia, camelina is an oilseed crop known for its resilience in diverse climates, including arid and semi-arid regions, making it adaptable to various environments. A breeding program started from a study of six winter varieties and five spring varieties of camelina is described: these genetic materials were characterized by SSRs molecular markers and by GBS technique. Molecular data clearly showed all spring varieties were genetically similar and distinguishable from the winter varieties, which, in turn, clustered together. Using molecular data, parental varieties belonging to the two different clusters were selected to generate new genetic variability. The new variety obtained, selected through the bulk method based on three parameters: yield, earliness, and weight of 1000 seeds, has allowed the generation of the new genetic material provisionally named C1244. Chemical characterization was performed (bromatological and glucosinolates analysis) to better describe C1244 in comparison with benchmark varieties. The new variety exhibited early maturity, similar to spring varieties, making this genetic material promising for use in intercropping systems, a high weight of 1000 seeds (1.46 g) which improves and facilitates seeding/harvesting operations and a high oil content (33.62%) akin to winter varieties making it valuable for human and animal food purposes.

AB  - Accurately assessing the status of threatened species requires reliable population estimates. Despite this necessity, only a small proportion of the global distribution range of the vulnerable snow leopard (Panthera uncia) has been systematically sampled. The Indian section of the Greater Himalayas, which includes Kishtwar High Altitude National Park (KHANP), harbours potential snow leopard habitat. Nevertheless, there has been limited ecological and conservation research focusing on species that are specific to KHANP, as well as limited research on the broader biodiversity of the Greater Himalayas. We used Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture (SECR) models to provide-to our knowledge-the first robust snow leopard population density and abundance estimates from KHANP. We also provide a Relative Abundance Index (RAI) for non-volant mammals (excluding small rodents). Our study sampled three catchments within the Dachhan region of KHANP-Kibber, Nanth and Kiyar-using 44 cameras over a 45-day period between May and June 2023. We identified four unique snow leopard individuals across 15 detections in nine camera locations. SECR analysis estimated a density of 0.50 snow leopards per 100 km2 (95% confidence interval: 0.13-1.86), corresponding to an abundance of four individual (4-9) adults. Camera trapping revealed a total of 16 mammal species, including the endangered Kashmir musk deer (Moschus cupreus). Marmots (Marmota caudata) had the highest RAI of 21.3 (+/- 0.2). Although the estimated density and abundance of snow leopards in our study area had relatively wide 95% confidence intervals, our combined results of snow leopard densities and RAIs of prey species such as ibex and marmots indicate that KHANP is a potentially important area for snow leopards. Given the geopolitical history of Jammu and Kashmir in India, the region where KHANP is located, wildlife research remains a low priority. We hope our study encourages authorities to support further research. This study is an initial step towards evaluating the potential of KHANP as a conservation landscape under the Government of India's Project Snow Leopard.

AB  - Human-carnivore conflicts over predation on domestic animals are a global challenge. Knowledge of determinants and patterns of predation on domestic animals is an essential prerequisite to develop and apply effective interventions against carnivores. Yet, it is surprisingly little known about how these determinants and patterns vary across different parts of the distribution areas of individual carnivore species. We synthesized published information on Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx) predation in terms of: (a) domestic prey species, (b) selectivity, kill rates and consumption; (c) problem seasons; (d) problem individuals and sex/age categories of lynx; (e) problem areas (hotspots); (f) predation in Europe and Asia; and (g) effects of livestock protection interventions. Using a global database of dietary profiles (104 cases from 39 publications), we found that the main domestic animals killed and consumed by lynx are semi-domestic reindeer (Rangifer tar-andus) and sheep (Ovis aries). Predation patterns on these two species are very different. Reindeer tend to be predated as a main wild prey species, whereas sheep are primarily available during summer and appear to be killed upon chance encounters (mainly lambs), mostly by male lynx, in predictable hotspot areas. As sheep and especially reindeer graze over remote areas without human attendance, only few interventions can be effectively used, with a primary focus on hotspot areas and peak seasons associated with the highest losses to lynx. Electric fencing and herding have been recommended as practical tools for sheep protection on small to medium scales, whereas compensation of confirmed losses is mostly ineffective as poaching still remains to be the major cause of lynx mortality. Risk-based compensations and performance payments are promising, but their application in lynx has yet to be tested.

AB  - Introduction: Agricultural organic waste recycling can supply nutrients for crop production and partially replace chemical nitrogen fertilizers, which is beneficial for waste management and environmental protection. Nevertheless, comprehensive evaluation of the effects of different organic materials applications on crop yield and the environment is limited. Methods: Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive investigation of the synergistic effects of straw, pig manure, and biogas residue recycling on the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) systems was carried out in the North China Plain. Field experiments were conducted from 2019 to 2021, comprising five treatments: straw (ST), pig manure (PM), and biogas residue (BR) partially replacing chemical nitrogen fertilizer, sole application of chemical nitrogen fertilizer (CF), and a control with no nitrogen application (WN). Results and discussion: The results showed that organic materials significantly increased soil total nitrogen (3.04%-9.10%) and N recovery efficiency (REN; 42.21%-44.99%), but pig manure was more beneficial in increasing crop yields (3.50%), especially wheat yields (8.72%), and REN was significantly higher than that of the other treatments. Organic materials performed differently in wheat and maize seasons, and wheat yield could be improved by organic materials return. Organic materials stimulated N2O emission in wheat season (4.28%-32.20%), while biogas residue inhibited the N2O emission in maize season (47.47%). The negative effect of straw and biogas residue on yield decreased with increasing years of return, and pig manure continued to contribute to yield. In conclusion, pig manure is the optimal alternative that can increase crop yield, soil N content, and REN without stimulating N2O emissions.

AB  - Predicting how climate change affects biotic interactions poses a challenge. Plant-insect herbivore interactions are particularly sensitive to climate change, as climate-induced changes in plant quality cascade into the performance of insect herbivores. Whereas the immediate survival of herbivore individuals depends on plastic responses to climate change-induced nutritional stress, long-term population persistence via evolutionary adaptation requires genetic variation for these responses. To assess the prospects for population persistence under climate change, it is therefore crucial to characterize response mechanisms to climate change-induced stressors, and quantify their variability in natural populations. Here, we test developmental and transcriptomic responses to water limitation-induced host plant quality change in a Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) metapopulation. We combine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy on the plant metabolome, larval developmental assays and an RNA sequencing analysis of the larval transcriptome. We observed that responses to feeding on water-limited plants, in which amino acids and aromatic compounds are enriched, showed marked variation within the metapopulation, with individuals of some families performing better on control and others on water-limited plants. The transcriptomic responses were concordant with the developmental responses: families exhibiting opposite developmental responses also produced opposite transcriptomic responses (e.g. in growth-associated transcripts). The divergent responses in both larval development and transcriptome are associated with differences between families in amino acid catabolism and storage protein production. The results reveal intrapopulation variability in plasticity, suggesting that the Finnish M. cinxia metapopulation harbours potential for buffering against drought-induced changes in host plant quality.

AB  - The livestock sector accounts for 18% of total anthropogenic carbon emissions and is an important source of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. China occupies a large proportion of total livestock carbon emissions worldwide, especially in the pig industry, which is significant to China's agricultural economy and also a key area for China to achieve the "Carbon peaking and Carbon neutrality goals." This study uses the life cycle approach to calculate the GHG emission status of China's pig farming industry from 2001 to 2020, and then, we establish a logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) model to identify the main driving factors and a Tapio decoupling model to analyze its decoupling status. We decompose the emission sources as well as decoupling index into five drivers: technological progress, livestock structure, policy bias, affluence, and population. The results reveal that the carbon emission of China's pig industry is in a weak growth trend and overall in a weak decoupling state but has volatility, which is closely related to the "Pig Cycle" in China. Decomposition analysis shows that increasing affluence and population growth are the main drivers of GHG emissions; simultaneously, technological progress, livestock structure, and policy bias are the main drivers of emission reduction. Meanwhile, technological and policy factors positively contribute to the decoupling status, while affluence level, population, and livestock structure changes negatively inhibit the decoupling status. The study concludes that technological advances, optimized economic structures, the guidance of green consumption patterns, and the solution to the "Pig Cycle" problem are crucial to further reduce GHG emissions from China's pig industry; meanwhile, technological changes have a dominant role in promoting carbon decoupling in pig farming.

AB  - The change in nutrient availability in the soil can affect key functions of forest ecosystems, such as insect herbivory. Although insect herbivory is particularly relevant because it can impact on the growth and mortality of forest plant species, the evidence of the impacts of fertilizers addition on herbivory patterns is limited. In this study, we specifically evaluated how herbivory frequency on the timber species Nothofagus antarctica is affected by the addition of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and their combinations to the soil, using a long term full-factorial field experiment in a North-Patagonian Forest (Argentina). Our study investigated the effects of fertilizers (N, P, and K) on herbivory frequency and leaf nutrient concentrations of the studied species. We found that the addition of fertilizers to the soil increased herbivory frequency, which was mediated by increases in leaf nutrient concentrations. Furthermore, we observed that interactions between fertilizers in leaf nutrient concentrations generally produced increases in herbivory, both in the amount of leaf consumed and in the foliar damage percentage. These findings suggest that fertilization can have complex effects on plant-herbivore interactions, and that the specific effects may depend on the identity of the nutrients that combined, the plant species, and the level of nutrient availability. Our results provide evidence that changes in soil nutrient availability are important in forest ecosystems, and that should be considered to develop effective management strategies for the sustainable use of natural resources in Patagonian forests.

AB  - Plants can sustain various degrees of damage or compensate for tissue loss by regrowth without significant fitness costs. This tolerance to insect herbivory depends on the plant's developmental stage during which the damage is inflicted and on how much tissue is removed. Plant fitness correlates, that is, biomass and germination of seeds, were determined at different ontogenetic stages, vegetative, budding, or flowering stages of three annual brassicaceous species exposed to feeding by Pieris brassicae caterpillars at different intensities. Fitness costs decreased with progressive ontogenetic stage at which damage was inflicted. Feeding on meristem tissues on vegetative and budding plants limited the plant's ability to fully compensate for tissue loss, whereas feeding on flowers resulted in full compensation or overcompensation in Sinapis arvensis and Brassica nigra. Herbivory promoted germination of seeds in the following year, thereby causing a shift in relative contribution to the next year's generation at the expense of contributing to the long-lived seed bank. Herbivory intensity affected fitness correlates of B. nigra and to a lesser extent of Sisymbrium officinale, but not of S. arvensis, demonstrating that even closely related plant species can differ in their specific responses to herbivory and that these can differently affect reproductive output. In terms of fitness costs, annual plant species can be quite resilient to herbivory. However, the extent to which they tolerate tissue loss depends on the ontogenetic stage that is under attack. Seed persistence in the soil has been proposed as a bet-hedging strategy of short-lived species to increase long-term fitness. Herbivore-induced changes in seed germination can result in a shift in the relative contribution of seeds to the seed bank and next year's generation.

AB  - The northeastern Tibetan Plateau is the region with the longest history of development, most densely populated, and most obvious land use of the Tibetan Plateau. However, there is a lack of accurate knowledge of the timing and intensity of the human impacts on vegetation during the mid-to-late Holocene. In this study, we quantitatively compare the pollen assemblages from farmland with surrounding natural vegetation and results show that agricultural activities lead to an increase of Brassicaceae, cerealia Poaceae, and Hippophae pollen. Vegetation and climate change since 5 cal ka BP for Guli Lake in Hehuang Valley have been reconstructed from pollen and sediment chemistry data; and anthropogenic pollen indicators identified from a sediment core are combined with evidence from archaeological sites and historical documents, revealing that agricultural activity began after 4.8 cal ka BP but initially had a limited impact on vegetation. By 0.5 cal ka BP, the impact of farming activity on the vegetation increased significantly and oil-seed crops were cultivated, but the vegetation was still strongly affected by climate. Due to its superior natural condition, favourable government policy, and advanced agricultural technology, the Hehuang Valley became a pioneer area for agricultural expansion into the high-elevation region of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - The region of Coquimbo has the highest percentage of goats (Capra hircus) in Chile and is severely affected by droughts. This can lead to environmental challenges such as limited water and forage availability when goats are kept in natural grasslands. The objective of this study was to assess the welfare of dairy goats in semi-intensive production systems under drought conditions. The study was carried out in La Serena city, region of Coquimbo, Chile and 22 semi-intensive dairy goat farms were assessed using the Animal Welfare Indicators protocol. In each evaluation, the following indicators and information were gathered: physical and behavioural indi-cators of animal welfare, farmers' sociodemographic information, farm facilities, husbandry practices and management of the farm, and farmers' perception of animal welfare. Of the goats evaluated (n = 446), the vast majority had a body condition score (BCS) considered normal (n = 349; 78.25%). The main welfare problems were poor hair condition, faecal soiling, overgrown claws and improper disbudding or dehorning. The majority of farmers (96%) considered it 'rather important' or 'very important' to handle their goats in a gentle manner, expressing concern about the welfare of their animals and considering pain as a negative experience for goats. A lower than expected percentage of very thin animals (low BCS) were seen, considering the drought conditions and the forage shortage that affects the region, and no animals were observed with signs of thermal stress. The semi-intensive production systems could be an alternative to pasture-based systems to overcome environmental challenges.

AB  - Roadways may pose barriers to long-distance migrators such as some ungulates. Highway underpasses mitigate wildlife-vehicle collisions and can be an important management tool for protecting migration corridors. In northern California, 3 underpasses were built on United States Route 395 (Route 395) in Hallelujah Junction Wildlife Area (HJWA) in the 1970s for a migratory mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) herd that had been negatively affected by highway traffic. To determine whether these underpasses were still reducing mule deer mortalities >40 years after construction, we investigated deer use of the underpasses from 2006-2019 using cameras, global positioning system (GPS) collars, and roadkill records. We used occupancy models, approximations of GPS-collared mule deer movement paths, and roadkill locations to estimate the highway crossing patterns of deer. From camera data, there was higher use of the underpasses by deer during migration (spring [Mar-Jun], fall [Oct-Dec]) than in summer (Jul-Sep), when only resident deer were present. Higher underpass usage occurred in the spring compared to fall migrations. Eleven of 21 GPS-collared migrating mule deer crossed Route 395. We estimated 30% of the crossings (by 7 of the 11 deer) occurred south of the underpasses where deer could easily access the highway because of short (1-m high) and deteriorating highway fencing. Roadkill data confirmed that deer-vehicle collisions were occurring south of the underpasses and at the underpasses. This was likely due to deteriorating infrastructure at the underpasses that allows wildlife access to the highway. Overall, our study indicated that although underpasses can provide safe passage for migratory deer decades (>40 yr) after their construction, deteriorating infrastructure such as fencing and gates can lead to wildlife mortalities on highways near underpasses.

AB  - Lolium perenne L. and Sorghum sudanense (Piper) Stapf. are 2 common forages fed to blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur Hodgson, 1833) in captivity. However, the effect of these 2 forages on the gastrointestinal microbiota is largely unknown. We analyzed the diversity of the microbiota in the feces of captive blue sheep fed with L. perenne (group F1) and S. sudanense (group F2) by 16S rRNA sequencing. A total of 20 major phyla and 29 genera fecal bacterial communities were detected in the 2 groups. The F1 and F2 groups shared common microbiota at the phylum level, which mainly consisted of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 were the top 4 dominant taxa at the genus level. The percentage of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010 was significantly higher in the F2 group (similar to 2.75-fold) than in F1 group. The diversity and abundance of the microbial community in F2 was higher than that in F1. Although both of L. perenne and S. sudanense affect the metabolism of the gastrointestinal microbiota of blue sheep, the S. sudanense improves more aspects of metabolism and biogenesis. In summary, our results demonstrated that L. perenne and S. sudanense affect blue sheep gastrointestinal microbiota in different ways. But S. sudanense efficiently improved the gastrointestinal microbiota of blue sheep.

AB  - Rhinolophus bats have been identified as natural reservoirs for viruses with global health implications, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) and swine acute diarrhoea syndrome-related coronavirus (SADSr-CoV). In this study, we characterised the individual viromes of 603 bats to systematically investigate the diversity, abundance and geographic distribution of viral communities within R. affinis, R. sinicus and 11 other bat species. The massive metatranscriptomic data revealed substantial viral genome resources of 133 vertebrate-infecting viral clusters, which contain occasional cross-species transmission across mammalian orders and especially across bat families. Notably, those viruses included nine clusters closely related to human and/or livestock pathogens, such as SARS-CoVs and SADS-CoVs. The investigation also highlighted distinct features of viral diversity between and within bat colonies, which appear to be influenced by the distinct host population genetics of R. affinis and R. sinicus species. The comparison of SARSr-CoVs further showed varied impact of host specificity along genome-wide diversification and modular viral evolution among Rhinolophus species. Overall, the findings point to a complex interaction between host genetic diversity, and the way viruses spread and structure within natural populations, calling for continued surveillance efforts to understand factors driving viral transmission and emergence in human populations. These results present the underestimated spillover risk of bat viruses, highlighting the importance of enhancing preparedness and surveillance for emerging zoonotic viruses.

AB  - Ex-situ conservation, the transplanting of individuals outside of their natural range, can dramatically alter biotic interactions among species. Here, we explored the shifts in the herbivory pressure and defense strategies of ex-situ populations of five endangered tree species (Pterostyrax psilophyllus, Davidia involucrata, Dipteronia sinensis, Tapiscia sinensis, and Tetracentron sinense) after 20-35 years since translocation. All species were not native to the ex-situ site and only P. psilophyllus had a closely related native species (Pterostyrax corymbosus). We compared the leaf damage type, herbivory rate, and chemistry (total phenols, tannins, N, and P) of each species, and assessed the relationship between the herbivory rate and leaf chemistry between the ex-situ and wild populations. Excluding P. psilophyllus, all species in the ex-situ populations showed changes in the type of leaf damage and lower overall herbivory rates. Ex-situ populations of P. psilophyllus showed reduced total phenol, N, and P levels, while the other four species showed decreased total phenol and tannin levels, or increased N and P levels. The herbivory rate was positively correlated with the N and P levels in wild populations, and negatively correlated with the total phenol content in ex-situ populations. These differences reflect the reduced herbivory pressure, decreased defense ability, and shift in defense strategy of ex-situ populations. We showed that prolonged exposure to the ex-situ environment led to the maladaptation of these endangered plant species to herbivory pressure in the natural environment, and that these shifts should be considered in ex-situ conservation and reintroduction strategies. ? 2021 The Authors.

AB  - In the year 2012 a total of seven individuals (one bull and six cows) of European bison (Bison bonasus) were introduced to a fenced 200 ha area in a forest district (Almindingen, Island Bornholm, Denmark) in the Baltic Sea. In 2017 the herd was supplemented by introduction of another bull. The animals all originated from a population in the Polish Bialowieza forest. Faecal samples were recovered with intervals and subjected to a copro-parasitological investigation (applying egg flotation, sedimentation and Baermann technique). In addition, parasites were sampled during necropsy of animals euthanized or found dead three years after introduction. The animals carried a range of parasite types including trematodes (liver fluke Fasciola and rumen fluke), cestodes (Moniezia), nematodes (Dictyocaulus viviparus, trichurids, and other gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) including Trichostrongylus axei and Haemonchus contortus). Egg and larval morphology also suggested presence of GIN genera Nematodirus, Ostertagia and Cooperia. The trematodes did not establish a life cycle in the recipient area, as judged by examination of calves born in the new area, but the cestode and several nematode species occurred in these animals. Especially Dictyocaulus viviparus was successfully spread and occurred together with GIN at moderate to high infection intensities at most sampling points. The reproduction among bison in the herd was high during the first few years. The exact birth rate is unknown but up to 24 calves are believed to be born during the ten year study period. Mortality among adults and calves occurred and in early June 2022 the total number of live animals was 11 (seven males, three females, one calf). The possible impact of the parasite infections on the bison health and future wildlife infection status is discussed.

AB  - Pachylemur is a large extinct lemur once widespread on Madagascar that survived in pockets until at least 500 years ago. The role of humans as agents of megafaunal extinction on Madagascar is heavily debated. Here we evaluate human impacts drawing from research on lemur hunting today combined with evidence from Madagascar's oral history as well as its archaeological and paleontological records. Living lemurs are hunted throughout Madagascar, primarily for subsistence but also for commercial trade. Wildlife consumption is driven primarily by poverty and resultant food insecurity. Protected status, wildlife consumption taboos, and broad preference for domestic meats appear insufficient to buffer most lemur taxa from extinction at current harvest rates in the Makira region, if not elsewhere. Singlefactor explanations for megafaunal extinction, such as rapid overkill or climate change, are not viable. There was long temporal overlap for Pachylemur and humans on Madagascar. There was no island-wide drought when the megafauna began to crash around 1,200 years ago; some parts of Madagascar were unusually wet while others were unusually dry. Stable isotope (d15N) values for radiocarbon-dated Pachylemur bones also show no evidence that aridification contributed to its demise. Butchered bones of Pachylemur from the paleontological site Tsirave spike in frequency just over 1,000 years ago, indicative of sustained exploitation over a similar to 100year period. Pachylemur shared many traits with its closest living relative, variegated lemurs (Varecia), including frugivory. Oral histories of an animal presumed to be Pachylemur indicate it dwelt in the largest trees in the forest, was active at twilight, and exhibited highly aggressive antipredator behavior. Like Varecia, Pachylemur was likely dependent on large, patchily distributed trees for fruit, and possibly also for reproduction (e.g. to nest and stash non-clinging young), making it especially vulnerable to habitat degradation. We thus conclude that both habitat degradation and hunting played a role in the extinction of Pachylemur.

AB  - Mineral licks are critical resources for herbivores in Amazonia and other tropical regions which may be deficient in dietary minerals or consuming alkaloid-laced leaves which may cause gastrointestinal issues. However, mineral licks are also important locations for predators, including human hunters. Animals visiting mineral licks must balance the benefits of relief of physiological stressors with the risk of predation, and they may employ behavioral adaptations to do so. We used camera trap data on six large-bodied mammal species at 52 mineral licks in the same watershed in the Peruvian Amazon to assess how mineral licks contribute to visiting species' perception of risk. We tested the effects of a range of covariates including direct and indirect measures of risk, habitat characteristics, and soil properties on visit duration, a behavioral adaptation species may use to mitigate risk, in a generalized linear mixed-effects modeling framework. Tapirs, collared peccaries, and paca minimized visit duration in risky licks, while howler monkeys, red brocket deer, and black agoutis had higher visit duration in risky licks, potentially due to increased vigilance and reduced feeding efficiency. The strong relationships between risk and behavior across species demonstrates the ecological value of mineral licks for both predators and prey, as prey must seek mineral licks but at great cost. Conserving mineral licks in landscapes may be a critical component to the conservation of both herbivores and carnivores in Amazonia, and for food security of local people.

AB  - The Loess Plateau region of China suffers from severe soil erosion, and the selection of effective slope-protection vegetation is essential to prevent soil and water loss. This study focused on individual plants of common species in the Loess Plateau, such as Caragana korshinski Kom., Hippophae rhamnoides Linn., Pinus tabuliformis Carr., Robinia Pseudoacacia Linn., Populus tomentosa Carr., Prunus armeniaca Lam. The root spatial distribution, geometric morphology, and fractal characteristics of these plants were measured using the whole-root-excavation method, and the vertical pull-out force of their root systems was quantified using the in situ whole-plant root-pulling method. The results showed that H. rhamnoides dominates in the vertical spatial distribution of its root system through a larger number of inclined roots. C. korshinskii, P. tomentosa, R. pseudoacacia, and P. armeniaca dominate in the horizontal spatial distribution of their root systems through a greater number of horizontal roots. P. tabuliformis, on the other hand, achieves a relatively balanced distribution in both horizontal and vertical spaces through its well-developed taproot and numerous lateral roots. In terms of the geometric morphology and fractal characteristics of their root systems, H. rhamnoides and C. korshinskii exhibit a larger number of fine roots and complex branching, resulting in a higher total-root length, total-root surface area, and root fractal dimension. The soil-stabilizing ability of H. rhamnoides, C. korshinskii, and R. pseudoacacia was stronger, mainly influenced by their total-root length, total-root surface area, and inclined root quantity, and these species can be prioritized as typical vegetation for soil and water conservation in the construction of Loess Plateau vegetation. From the perspective of slope stabilization and soil conservation alone, we strongly recommend planting shrub vegetation in the Chinese Loess Plateau.

AB  - Large herbivores are key regulators of open habitats across the world. Free roaming ponies have a prominent ecological role in many Atlantic landscapes, where different habitats with conservation interest are linked to ponies' occurrence. The traditional management of wild ponies, which implies minimum human intervention, is declining in Galicia, NW Spain. Changes in the management regimes include the confinement of ponies in fenced areas, the use of improved pastures (IPs) and rotation between fields. Indirect effects of these changes are expected on the ecological condition of important habitats for conservation such as dry and wet heathlands and bogs. We studied social structure, spatial ecology and habitat use in 29 mares fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars and field observations in two areas of Galicia dominated by wet heaths and blanket bogs (Xistral), and dry heaths (Sabucedo). We used spatial location and field observations to identify each band, and calculated band size, sex ratio, home range (HR) and core area size and overlap, as well as habitat use. We accounted for differences by adjusting Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) for these variables as functions of management type: free roaming vs. rotation, use of IPs, fencing, and available ranging area. Larger bands were found in smaller commons, with fencing and rotation management. Home ranges, but not core area, varied as a function of the available ranging area. Band overlap was higher in fenced areas with rotation management. Increasing management may concentrate grazing pressure by reducing HRs and increasing spatial overlap between bands, which may have a long-term effect on habitat quality and conservation.

AB  - The golden orchid Cephalanthera falcata is on the verge of extinction from Japan due to foraging by the agromyzid fly Japanagromyza tokunagai and the decline of pollinator bees. Artificial pollination and bagging treatments that exclude foraging flies are promising conservation measures. I examined the rates of fruit set and ripe seed production resulting from the artificial pollination and bagging of C. falcata at one field site in Fukui Prefecture, Japan. I tested 13 individuals over 3 years from 2021 to 2023, classified into three treatment groups: (1) no artificial pollination + no bagging (8 individuals), (2) artificial pollination + no bagging (3 individuals), and (3) artificial pollination + bagging (2 individuals). Artificial pollination resulted in an average of 4 fruits per individual (range: 1-6 fruits), while untreated plants produced 2.1 fruits on average (range: 1-6 fruits; Wilcoxon's rank sum test, p = 0.151). Additionally, the mean damage rate per individual, which was calculated as the proportion of fruits damaged by J. tokunagai out of all fruits, was 0% in the bagged group and 100% in the untreated group (Wilcoxon's rank sum test, p < 0.001). Thus, the bagging of C. falcata produced statistically significant improvements in ripe seed production. However, artificial pollination of C. falcata did not produce statistically significant improvements in fruit set production. My results suggest that fruit set production is not affected by artificial pollination for C. falcata. The damage of C. falcata by J. tokunagai is quite noticeable, with serious implications for the species' ongoing reproduction and survival.

AB  - The Himalayan goral (Naemorhedus goral) is facing threats, such as habitat degradation and human disturbances, which are increasing. To aid their conservation, it is crucial to understand the anthropogenic and ecological factors that influence Himalayan goral occurrence. We conducted a study in Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, Nepal using remote cameras to detect Himalayan gorals during late winter (March 2022) and spring (May 2022). Himalayan gorals were more likely to be detected in late winter (p = 0.253 & PLUSMN; 0.064) compared to spring (p = 0.187 & PLUSMN; 0.056) and the effects of anthropogenic and ecological factors on Himalayan gorals varied between these periods. During late winter, the distance to the nearest human settlement (& beta;settlement = 1.971 & PLUSMN; 1.147) and the number of other wild ungulates detected (& beta;ungulates = 2.954 & PLUSMN; 1.193) had a positive effect on Himalayan goral occurrence. In contrast, only the number of wild ungulate detections (& beta;ungulates = 3.262 & PLUSMN; 1.292) had a positive impact on Himalayan goral occupancy during spring. The number of livestock and carnivores detected during each season did not influence Himalayan goral occupancy. Our results highlight the importance of considering ecological and anthropogenic variables in understanding occupancy and distribution of Himalayan gorals to inform species conservation strategies.

AB  - Glucocorticoid (GC) levels have significant impacts on the health and behaviour of wildlife populations and are involved in many essential body functions including circadian rhythm, stress physiology and metabolism. However, studies of GCs in wildlife often focus on estimating mean hormone levels in populations, or a subset of a population, rather than on assessing the entire distribution of hormone levels within populations. Additionally, explorations of population GC data are limited due to the tradeoff between the number of individuals included in studies and the amount of data per individual that can be collected. In this study, we explore patterns of GC level distributions in three white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations using a non-invasive, opportunistic sampling approach. GC levels were assessed by measuring faecal corticosterone metabolite levels ('fCMs') from deer faecal samples throughout the year. We found both population and seasonal differences in fCMs but observed similarly shaped fCM distributions in all populations. Specifically, all population fCM cumulative distributions were found to be very heavy-tailed. We developed two toy models of acute corticosterone elevation in an effort to recreate the observed heavy-tailed distributions. We found that, in all three populations, cumulative fCM distributions were better described by an assumption of large, periodic spikes in corticosterone levels every few days, as opposed to an assumption of random spikes in corticosterone levels. The analyses presented in this study demonstrate the potential for exploring population-level patterns of GC levels from random, opportunistically sampled data. When taken together with individual-focused studies of GC levels, such analyses can improve our understanding of how individual hormone production scales up to population-level patterns.

AB  - In polygynous systems, such as that exhibited by reindeer Rangifer tarandus, mate choice can be difficult to disentangle from male intrasexual competition because male behavior may constrain female choice. Multiple mating may provide an avenue for female mate choice, though it is difficult to identify using behavioral estimators alone. Molecular techniques address this issue by affording ecologists an opportunity to reassess mating systems from a genetic perspective. We assessed the frequency and possible explanations for multiple mating in reindeer using a genetic approach to determine the success of observed copulations in a semi-domesticated herd in Kaamanen, Finland. Behavioral and genetic data were synthesized with population characteristics over a 7-year period to test the hypothesis that, if present, polyandry in reindeer is driven by sexual harassment from sub-dominant males. We observed multiple mating in 42% of females, with as many as 60% exhibiting multiple mating in certain years. We found no evidence that multiple mating resulted from sexual harassment by sub-dominant males, suggesting that it is likely a deliberate strategy among females. Conversion rate of copulations into paternities varied with male size, with smaller males more likely to experience mismatch than larger males. Female preference for larger males persisted despite the occurrence of multiple mating, possibly suggesting a mechanism for cryptic post-copulatory selection. We suggest further research to delineate the possible influence of cryptic post-copulatory selection and multiple mating to defend against infertility in exhausted males.

AB  - Aspen forests provide wildlife, watershed, and aesthetic value, and the potential for reduced fire occurrence, behavior, and severity. There is interest in planting aspen to achieve various management objectives. However, few studies have investigated the optimal conditions for aspen seedlings in the western US. We conducted two experiments to address this knowledge gap. First, we tested the effects of shading structures (i.e., logs) and biochar on the survival and growth of 960 outplanted aspen seedlings in three exclosures in a recent fire footprint. Second, we tested whether experimentally placing logs near 120 naturally-occurring post-fire aspen seedlings affected survival or growth. Survival of outplanted seedlings was high (66%) despite hot and dry conditions in the years of the study. Logs and biochar had minimal effects on planted seedling survival and growth, but in one exclosure, survival of planted seedlings was lower in log and log + biochar treatments, likely due to the protection logs provided to small mammalian herbivores. Survival was higher for naturally-occurring seedlings with logs placed on the south side compared to control seedlings in one site, and growth was higher for naturally-occurring seedlings with a nearby log, but not significantly so. In sites where aspen seedling survival and growth are relatively robust, management actions to modify the microsite may not be necessary.

AB  - The Nanhui Dongtan Wetland is the most extensively reclaimed part of the Yangtze River Estuary wetland. In recent decades, urbanization has led to the extensive reclamation of the intertidal wetlands of Nanhui Dongtan. Macrobenthos are crucial as secondary production groups in the food web. However, there is a lack of in-depth research on the response mechanisms of macrobenthic communities to environmental disturbances in reclaimed wetlands. This study investigated the impact of hydrological connectivity changes caused by land reclamation on the macrobenthic community based on the macrobenthic community composition in preserved tidal flats and closed and open reclamation areas in Nanhui Dongtan. The results showed that the macrobenthos species richness in the closed reclamation area was significantly lower than that in the other areas. After dividing the functional groups of macrobenthos, structural equation modeling revealed a negative correlation between the salinity and the functional group composition. Analysis of the food sources revealed significant positive correlations between predatory and sediment-feeding populations and sediment organic matter content, between detritivorous group and environmental chlorophyll-a content, and between herbivorous group and suspended organic matter content in water. Therefore, variations in hydrological connectivity in different reclamation areas caused differences in food source distribution, which led to different compositions of macrobenthic functional groups. The results of this study provide a theoretical reference for the study of intertidal wetland habitat restoration.

AB  - Sharing space with large carnivores on a human-dominated continent like Europe results in multiple conflictful interactions with human interests, of which depredation on livestock is the most widespread. We conducted an analysis of the impact by all four European large carnivores on sheep farming in 10 European countries, during the period 2010-2015. We ran a hierarchical Simultaneous Autoregressive model, to assess the influence of several ecological factors on the reported depredation levels. About 35,000 (SD = 4110) sheep kills were compensated in the ten countries as caused by large carnivores annually, representing 0.5% of the total sheep stock. Of them, 45% were recognized as killed by wolves, 24% by wolverines, 19% by lynx and 12% by bears. We found a positive relationship between wolf distribution and the number of compensated sheep, but not for the other three species. Depredation levels were lower in the areas where large carnivore presence has been continuous compared to areas where they disappeared and returned in the last 50 years. Our study shows that a few large carnivores can produce high damage, when the contribution of environmental, social, and economic systems predisposes for it, whereas large populations can produce a limited impact when the same components of the system reduce the probability that depredations occur. Time of coexistence plays in favour of a progressive reduc-tion in the associated costs, provided that the responsible agencies focus their attention both on compensation and co-adaptation.

AB  - In this paper, we explore and integrate different currencies that may underlie large-game hunting to guide a trans-Holocene analysis of variation in artiodactyl utilization using massive archaeofaunal data-sets from predominantly open-air sites from the Bonneville and Wyoming basins. The available empirical data continue to suggest that artiodactyls yield consistently higher return rates than lagomorphs allowing us to leverage predictions from both the prey choice and energetic risk-gain models that the relative importance of artiodactyl hunting should scale closely with climate-based change in their abundance on the landscape. We document with modeled climate data that seasonal variables correlated with the relative frequency of artiodactyl hunting, but that summer temperature had a significant overriding effect in both regions. Controlling for the negative relationship between summer temperature and artiodactyl abundances, we then document enhanced artiodactyl hunting in general and bison more specifically during the Fremont period that is consistent with a costly signaling hypothesis and the unique socio-ecological conditions of this context. Thus, climatic variation and its influence on artiodactyl abundances drives the overall trajectory of Holocene large game hunting variation but measurable and more subtle influences of costly signaling are also detected.

AB  - This study investigated species diversity and seasonal abundance of Stomoxyinae and tabanid flies, which are significant pests and vectors of animal pathogens, on a beef cattle and a buffalo farm in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, southern Thailand. During a one-year period from December 2020 to November 2021, flies were collected using Nzi traps from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. over three consecutive days each month, resulting in the capture of 1912 biting flies, representing seven Stomoxyinae and nine tabanid species. The five most prevalent species were Tabanus megalops, Haematobia irritans exigua, Stomoxys calcitrans, Stomoxys indicus, and Stomoxys uruma. Fly density was notably higher on the beef cattle farm compared to the buffalo farm, with most species peaking during the rainy season, except for H. i. exigua, which was more abundant during the dry season. This study also examined the influence of temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall on fly density, revealing species-specific patterns. These findings offer updated insights into species diversity and seasonal trends, providing critical baseline data essential for the development of effective control strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of these flies on livestock health.

AB  - Climate change may affect plant-herbivore interactions and their associated ecosystem functions. In an experimental evolution approach, we subjected replicated populations of the invasive Ambrosia artemisiifolia to a combination of simulated warming and herbivory by a potential biocontrol beetle. We tracked genomic and metabolomic changes across generations in field populations and assessed plant offspring phenotypes in a common environment. Using an integrated Bayesian model, we show that increased offspring biomass in response to warming arose through changes in the genetic composition of populations. In contrast, increased resistance to herbivory arose through a shift in plant metabolomic profiles without genetic changes, most likely by transgenerational induction of defences. Importantly, while increased resistance was costly at ambient temperatures, warming removed this constraint and favoured both vigorous and better defended plants under biocontrol. Climate warming may thus decrease biocontrol efficiency and promote Ambrosia invasion, with potentially serious economic and health consequences.

AB  - Maternal effects are the influence of maternal phenotype and the maternally-provided environment on the phenotype (i.e., expression of traits) of offspring. Frequently, maternal effects are manifest both before and after parturition. Pre-parturition effects are primarily direct allocation of energy to the offspring that is in utero. Post-parturition effects can include direct (e.g., nursing and defending offspring) and indirect (e.g., selection of habitat that is relatively safe or has high nutritional value) influences. While both direct and indirect effects are often discussed, there is a paucity of information on the relative importance of each type on offspring due to the difficulty in monitoring mothers prior to parturition and mother-offspring relationships after parturition in free-ranging animals. Our objective was to determine the importance of direct maternal effects on birth weight, growth rates, and survival of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) fawns from birth through the first 18 months of life. We determined the effect of nutritional condition of the dam (mother) on birth weight (pre-parturition direct effect). We also examined the post-parturition direct effect of dam nutritional condition on growth rates and survival of fawns. Direct maternal effects were evident both before and after parturition; dams in better nutritional condition produced offspring with greater mass at birth, higher rates of growth, and increased survival. Our findings demonstrate that maternal nutritional condition influences fawn health from gestation through recruitment. These links highlight the importance of considering direct maternal effects when examining population dynamics and reproductive success in long-lived mammals. Management plans for ungulates should include assessment of nutritional condition of adult females to maximize likelihood of effective conservation.

AB  - This study quantifies the marine benthic debris caught in a coastal trawl fishery and its impact on capturing small organisms and codend selectivity. From April to September in both 2023 and 2024, marine debris caught during regular fishing operations by two beam trawlers in Tachibana Bay, Nagasaki, was collected and analysed. Any marine organisms found within the debris were identified and measured. The selectivity experiment was conducted in October 2024, adding five plastic bags inside the codend for experimental tows and without plastic bags for control tows. The codend selectivity for the experimental and control tows was estimated either from logistic or contact probability models. There were 1249 pieces of marine debris weighing 45.04 kg collected, which is a small quantity in the coastal waters of Japan, with plastic exceeding 94 % by both number and weight. Among the plastic debris, 250 organisms of 23 species were found trapped, showing a positive correlation (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) between marine benthic plastic debris and bycatch. Three species, Metapenaeopsis barbata, Acropoma japonicum, and Nuchequula nuchalis, were selected for the selectivity analysis. The contact probability model fits better for experimental tows, while the logistic model fits better for control tows for all three species. The estimated contact probabilities were 0.62, 0.48, and 0.59 for the three species. The selectivity curve indicated higher retention probabilities for smaller fish in nets containing plastic bags, suggesting that marine debris adversely affects the selectivity of trawl nets by trapping small organisms.

AB  - Desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations often occur in remote areas at low densities, leading to gaps in knowledge of life history. In November 2011, we translocated 11 female desert bighorn sheep from the Fra Cristobal Mountains and 9 from Red Rock Wildlife Management Area (RRWMA) to the Peloncillo Mountains in southwestern New Mexico. In December 2012, we captured 21 adult females in the Peloncillo Mountains, 14 of which were recaptured from 2011. We fitted each animal with a very high frequency (VHF) collar and vaginal implant transmitter (VIT) to monitor for parturition. We captured 26 lambs (5 females, 7 males in 2012; 7 males, 7 females in 2013), recorded morphometric measurements and fitted lambs with VHF collars to monitor survival. Over the study, 14 lambs died, with 12 mortalities from predation, one from abandonment, and one from unknown causes. Lambing season was protracted over 3-4 months and survival was unrelated to birth timing. Body mass differences between sex varied by year, suggesting a connection to annual climate. Because most studies focus on captive animals with access to supplemental food, captive lambs may not be representative of free-ranging populations. Thus, we investigated morphological trends in a free-ranging population.

AB  - Monitoring trends in animal populations is essential for the development of appropriate wildlife management strategies. However, long-term studies are difficult to maintain mainly due to the lack of continuous funding. In this scenario, the collaboration between local stakeholders and researchers can be a fruitful partnership to monitor game species for long periods and vast territories. We present an experimental framework with the involvement of researchers, local hunters and game managers for the continuous monitoring of wild ungulate populations. By combining vehicle-based counts with distance sampling techniques, we implemented and validated a sampling scheme able to provide demographic information for the effective management of wild ungulate populations. Here, we used an Iberian red deer (Cervus elaphus) population as a model. The project implementation involved 30 participants including 24 stakeholders and 6 field technicians/data analysts with experience in monitoring wild ungulates. A total of eight teams covered 29 itineraries, synchronously, in two periods of ecological relevance for red deer, early summer and early autumn. Density estimates were consistent among sampling periods and characterized by acceptable coefficients of variation (approximately 20%). Our results prove that the application of the proposed framework is feasible (three to four itineraries per team), cost- and time-effective (one week per sampling period) and produce population estimates fit for management. Being based on direct observations, the method would provide important demographic indicators (e.g. population density, age structure and fawn recruitment, and group size) about wild ungulate populations. Apart from engaging interested stakeholders, the success of our proposal relies on three key actions including the theoretical and field instruction of participants, the definition of timely and unbiased survey designs and the maintenance of participants' motivation. The implementation of rigorous and standardized sampling protocols is pivotal for data integration through time and space. In the absence of continuous funding, the voluntary collaboration between entities should be fostered to study and mitigate the potential threats to wild ungulate populations resulting from disease, unregulated hunting and environmental changes.

AB  - The diet of Rhinolophus euryale was studied in southeastern Slovakia by an analysis of faeces collected from netted bats. Prey availability was studied using light traps, counting flying insects on the transect, and sweeping the vegetation. The diet composition was dominated by Lepidoptera, especially in July and September, which corresponds with most diet analyses reporting the species as a Lepidopteran specialist. Nonflying arthropods were almost absent from the diet, suggesting that the species obtains most of its food mainly by aerial hawking. The spring diet showed unusually high volumes of Diptera; this differed significantly from the evidence from its core distribution area in the Mediterranean. This suggests a higher flexibility of the trophic niche in the marginal parts of the species range. Our results suggest sex differences in diet. Possible conservation measures for these marginal populations should consider the protection of diverse mosaic landscapes, including urbanised patches. Such areas with long, warm interfaces of open and bushy and/or forest habitats have high moth flying activity, and riparian patches provide dipteran prey in spring when moths are scarce. The prediction of the prosperity of the studied northernmost populations of R. euryale during the ongoing climate change is ambiguous since various conceivable scenarios could work: (i) good prosperity of the population thanks to a warmer climate, higher production and higher flying activity of prey, or (ii) a worse situation due to unevenly distributed precipitation and higher evaporation, which may negatively affect wet habitats providing the important spring diet of tipulid dipterans.

AB  - In agriculturally dependent regions interspersed with wildlands, crop damage and livestock depredation by wildlife threatens rural livelihoods and undermines conservation efforts. Determining the species, human ac-tivities and landscape features correlated with losses to wildlife is critical for developing effective mitigation approaches. To better understand drivers of wildlife damage, we surveyed 419 households in the western Serengeti of Tanzania about agricultural practices and wildlife-induced losses. Using a causal inference frame-work and hierarchical Bayesian models, we assessed the influence of environmental and household character-istics on damage by different wildlife species. Crop loss to elephant was the most widespread form of damage; crop loss to baboon and vervet monkey was less common. Livestock depredation by hyena was widespread and common, while depredation by lion was rare and localized. The majority of respondents perceived wildlife as the greatest threat to crop production, whereas reproductive efficiency and environmental factors were seen as greater threats than wildlife to livestock. The risk of crop and livestock damage was consistently and negatively associated with human disturbance, and positively associated with farm and herd size. The influence of other factors, including woody cover, slope, and proximity to settlements varied across forms of damage and species. Our findings suggest that land use planning may be a generalizable approach to reducing wildlife damage, but variability in the drivers, extent, conservation status, and tolerance for losses indicate that species-specific mitigation strategies are required. Multi-species assessments offer broad insights into human-wildlife in-teractions and can aid in the identification and prioritization of mitigation measures.

AB  - Some pathogens sustain transmission in multiple different host species, but how this epidemiologically important feat is achieved remains enigmatic. Sarcoptes scabiei is among the most host generalist and successful of mammalian parasites. We synthesize pathogen and host traits that mediate sustained transmission and present cases illustrating three transmission mechanisms (direct, indirect, and combined). The pathogen traits that explain the success of S. scabiei include immune response modulation, on-host movement capacity, off-host seeking behaviors, and environmental persistence. Sociality and host density appear to be key for hosts in which direct transmission dominates, whereas in solitary hosts, the use of shared environments is important for indirect transmission. In social den-using species, combined direct and indirect transmission appears likely. Empirical research rarely considers the mechanisms enabling S. scabiei to become endemic in host species-more often focusing on outbreaks. Our review may illuminate parasites' adaptation strategies to sustain transmission through varied mechanisms across host species.

AB  - Introduction : Actinorhizal symbioses are gaining attention due to the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in sustainable agriculture. Sea buckthorn (Hippophae L.) is an important actinorhizal plant, yet research on the microbial community and nitrogen cycling in its nodules is limited. In addition, the influence of environmental differences on the microbial community of sea buckthorn nodules and whether there is a single nitrogen-fixing actinomycete species in the nodules are still unknown. Methods : We investigated the diversity, community composition, network associations and nitrogen cycling pathways of the microbial communities in the root nodule (RN), nodule surface soil (NS), and bulk soil (BS) of Mongolian sea buckthorn distributed under three distinct ecological conditions in northern China using 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic sequencing. Combined with the data of environmental factors, the effects of environmental differences on different sample types were analyzed. Results: The results showed that plants exerted a clear selective filtering effect on microbiota, resulting in a significant reduction in microbial community diversity and network complexity from BS to NS to RN. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in the microbiomes of BS and NS. While RN was primarily dominated by Actinobacteria, with Frankia sp. EAN1pec serving as the most dominant species. Correlation analysis indicated that the host determined the microbial community composition in RN, independent of the ecological and geographical environmental changes of the sea buckthorn plantations. Nitrogen cycle pathway analyses showed that RN microbial community primarily functions in nitrogen fixation, and Frankia sp. EAN1pec was a major contributor to nitrogen fixation genes in RN. Discussion: This study provides valuable insights into the effects of eco-geographical environment on the microbial communities of sea buckthorn RN. These findings further prove that the nodulation specificity and stability of sea buckthorn root and Frankia sp. EAN1pec may be the result of their long-term co-evolution.

AB  - There have been a number of suggested driving factors for Late Miocene expansion of C-4 plant coverage, including a decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, enhanced aridity and seasonality, shifts in fire regimes, and tectonic uplift. In order to identify and discriminate the driving factors of vegetation changes, continuous records from the same section or basin are required. We present micro-charcoal-based fire history and C-4 vegetation abundance records spanning the Miocene from the Yanwan Section in the Tianshui Basin, on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NE TP). Based on statistical analyses, the micro-charcoal concentrations were relatively low before similar to 10 Ma, and after that time, there was an exponential increase. The C-4 plant abundance shows a strong increase after 8 Ma, about 2 million years after the micro-charcoal concentrations started increasing. We compare our records with published CO2, pollen, seasonality, herbivorous mammalian fossil and tectonic records from the same section and basin. We find that C-4 vegetation, fire intensities, and opening landscapes increased simultaneously after 8 Ma. This indicates that a fire-grassland feedback, initially driven by aridification, was the trigger for the Late Miocene expansion of C-4 plants. We speculate that herbivorous mammalian species may also have played a minor role. During the Miocene, there is a trend towards enhanced seasonality and a decline in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which were also necessary preconditions for the expansion.

AB  - Darwin's frogs Rhinoderma darwinii and Rhinoderma rufum are the only known species of amphibians in which males brood their offspring in their vocal sacs. We propose these frogs as flagship species for the conservation of the Austral temperate forests of Chile and Argentina. This recommendation forms part of the vision of the Binational Conservation Strategy for Darwin's Frogs, which was launched in 2018. The strategy is a conservation initiative led by the IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group, which in 2017 convened 30 governmental, non-profit and private organizations from Chile, Argentina and elsewhere. Darwin's frogs are iconic examples of the global amphibian conservation crisis: R. rufum is categorized as Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct) on the IUCN Red List, and R. darwinii as Endangered. Here we articulate the conservation planning process that led to the development of the conservation strategy for these species and present its main findings and recommendations. Using an evidence-based approach, the Binational Conservation Strategy for Darwin's Frogs contains a comprehensive status review of Rhinoderma spp., including critical threat analyses, and proposes 39 prioritized conservation actions. Its goal is that by 2028, key information gaps on Rhinoderma spp. will be filled, the main threats to these species will be reduced, and financial, legal and societal support will have been achieved. The strategy is a multi-disciplinary, transnational endeavour aimed at ensuring the long-term viability of these unique frogs and their particular habitat.

AB  - Myricaria Desv. (Tamaricaceae) is a genus of riparian plants found in montane regions throughout Eurasia. We present molecular phylogenies covering the entire Eurasian range of the genus using the chloroplast interspacer region psbA-trnH, the chloroplast region trnL-trnF, and the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS). Biogeographical analyses of the DNA sequencing data based on Takhtajan's Floristic Provinces using a Bayesian Binary Markov Chain Monte Carlo reconstruction show that the origin of Myricaria is the Tibetan Floristic Province, specifically in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. A molecular clock analysis was also performed. We estimate that the crown age of Myricaria is around 22.8 Ma and that the common ancestor of all European Myricaria occurred around 8.8 Ma ago. By covering the entire native range of the genus, our analyses confirm previous hypotheses on the origin and migration patterns of Myricaria, namely a central Asian centre of origin, followed by a westward migration to Europe via the central Asian mountain ranges, the Caucasus, and Eastern Europe. The divergence times and migration routes of Myricaria are remarkably similar to that of the genus Hippophae L.

AB  - The investigation of a limestone cave on the Ryonggok-ri of Sangwon County, North Hwanghae Province, DPRK, has yielded many faunal remains including Late Pleistocene deer, brown bears and horses. Uranium series dating of fossil teeth yielded dates of similar to 72ka at the base of Layer 2 - the bone-bearing unit - and similar to 44ka at the top. The rich and diverse mammal remains of Ryonggok Cave No. 1 are indicative of warm and humid temperate conditions during the Late Pleistocene, and reflect the presence of both dense forests and open grassland. In addition, pollen and spores from the site include two families and 24 genera of trees, six families and a genus of grasses and herbs, and two families and six genera of ferns, corroborating the environments inferred from the faunal remains.

AB  - Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide. In 2018-2022, we investigated the presence of HEV RNA in 1233 stool samples collected in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, including humans (16), Tibetan pigs (624), yaks (312), sheep (267), and dogs (14). HEV RNA was only detected in Tibetan pig faecal samples (18.27%, 114/624). To perform molecular characterization of HEV strains in Tibetan pigs, we obtained 21 complete HEV genome sequences between 2018 and 2022. Sequence comparisons showed that 21 HEV strains from Tibetan pigs shared the mean nucleotide identities with the reference HEV strains ranging between 82.9% and 94.9% and 89.3% and 92.1% similarities with human HEV strains. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that all HEV strains were genotype 4, closely related to human HEV strains. Sequence recombinant analysis showed five potential recombinant strains identified in this study, of which SWU/D18/2018 (GenBank No. MK410044) was recombinant with human and swine HEV strains, located 6509-6878 nt from the recombination point. Based on the Bayesian evolutionary trees, we found that most HEV strains diverged later than human HEV (16 Tibetan pig HEV strains diverged later than 1979, and seven human HEV strains diverged earlier than 1979). Therefore, we speculated that the prevalence of HEV 4 in Tibetan pigs possibly originated from humans in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - To investigate the foraging preferences of the Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus) from the Janghang wetlands located in Han River estuary in South Korea, we elucidated their diet compositions using DNA extracted from their fecal samples. Samples were collected from the Janghang wetlands from June 2013 to January 2015. For dietary analysis, we amplified the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) regions, followed by cloning and sequencing. We were able to detect 20 families and 35 genera of plants from 77 fecal samples, showing that water deer in the Janghang wetlands mainly preferred Salicaceae (27.5%), Fabaceae (17.5%), and Poaceae (14.2%). In winter, the relative frequency of woody plant detection (81.3%) was much higher than that in other seasons. Our results suggest that Korean water deer in Janghang wetlands browse or graze depending on the locally-available plants species in their habitat as intermediate feeders. Non-invasive approaches using fecal samples could be applied to study food webs of various species and ecosystems for conservation and management of wildlife.

AB  - Large vertebrates are extremely sensitive to anthropogenic pressure, and their populations are declining fast. The white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) is a paradigmatic case: this African megaherbivore has suffered a remarkable decline in the last 150 years due to human activities. Its subspecies, the northern (NWR) and the southern white rhinoceros (SWR), however, underwent opposite fates: the NWR vanished quickly, while the SWR recovered after the severe decline. Such demographic events are predicted to have an erosive effect at the genomic level, linked to the extirpation of diversity, and increased genetic drift and inbreeding. However, there is little empirical data available to directly reconstruct the subtleties of such processes in light of distinct demographic histories. Therefore, we generated a whole-genome, temporal data set consisting of 52 resequenced white rhinoceros genomes, representing both subspecies at two time windows: before and during/after the bottleneck. Our data reveal previously unknown population structure within both subspecies, as well as quantifiable genomic erosion. Genome-wide heterozygosity decreased significantly by 10% in the NWR and 36% in the SWR, and inbreeding coefficients rose significantly by 11% and 39%, respectively. Despite the remarkable loss of genomic diversity and recent inbreeding it suffered, the only surviving subspecies, the SWR, does not show a significant accumulation of genetic load compared to its historical counterpart. Our data provide empirical support for predictions about the genomic consequences of shrinking populations, and our findings have the potential to inform the conservation efforts of the remaining white rhinoceroses.

AB  - Current theory predicts that plains zebra (Equus quagga) populations should be resource-limited. Long-term, detailed work in the Hwange ecosystem (Zimbabwe) on zebras and all their major predators provides empirical data to test this on a population that has been at a low density for at least 2 decades and is largely naturally regulated. Information on body condition is used as an indicator of resource use, and offtakes by the three major predators are estimated from a synthesis of data on densities and diets. This information leads to rejection of the expectations for resource limitation. Zebras provide a significant part of the diets of all the main predators and are important (11%) for the most abundant of these, spotted hyaenas (Crocuta crocuta). Using conservative values, we calculate that the three main predators, hyaenas, lions (Panthera leo), and leopards (Panthera pardus), kill some 17.5% of the zebra population. Given that this estimated offtake is of the same order of magnitude as maximum population growth (22.3% per year), we conclude that this population is likely to be limited by predation. Further work is needed to better understand the mechanisms by which the greater susceptibility of juveniles to predation in ungulates contributes to population limitation.

AB  - Invasive plant species often competitively displace native plant species but some populations of native plant species can evolve adaptation to competition from invasive plants and persist in invaded habitats. However, studies are lacking that examine how variation in abiotic conditions in invaded landscapes may affect fitness of native plants that have adapted to compete with invasive plants. I tested whether invasion by Parthenium hysterophorus in Nairobi National Park - Kenya may have selected for native plant individuals with greater competitive ability than conspecific naive natives in nutrient-rich and mesic soil conditions. I compared vegetative growth and seed yields of invader-experienced and conspecific naive individuals of seven native species. Invader-experienced natives grew shorter than naive natives regardless of growth conditions. Nevertheless, the two groups of native plants also exhibited treatment-specific differences in competitive ability against P. hysterophorus. Invader-experienced natives displayed plasticity in seed yield under drought treatment, while naive natives did not. Moreover, drought treatment enhanced competitive effects of invader-experienced natives on P. hysterophorus, while nutrient enrichment relaxed competitive effects of invader-experienced natives on the invader. The results suggest that P. hysterophorus may have selected for shorter native plant genotypes that also exhibit plasticity in competitive ability under drought conditions.

AB  - This research provides new information about the effect of drought on horse chestnut growth (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) in different ages. Global climatic scenarios predict a higher frequency of heatwaves and drought periods; however, investigations into the growth reaction of horse chestnut to drought are completely lacking. Approximately 50-year-old solitary, 100-year-old solitary, and 100-year-old canopy horse chestnut trees in a floodplain area were investigated. Growth reactions measured using automated dendrometers with respect to meteorological variables and water table depth were investigated during the years 2019-2021. Cambial activity was shown to be driven by tree age, as younger trees had higher stem radial increment rates. Both mature tree groups suffered from a low depth of water level and from higher sensitivity to meteorological variables, as growth was limited when mean daily vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exceeded 600 Pa. Together with a lower probability of growing days and a shorter growing season (GS) with earlier cessation of growth resulted in a lower total year radial increment (GRO) and basal area increment (BAI) when compared to younger trees. The young trees also exhibited lower tree-water-deficit-induced stem shrinkage (TWD) across all the studied years. Overall, horse chestnut trees in this floodplain area could be endangered by the decreasing level of soil water, with a greater age exacerbating the effects of drought. The year water deficit exceeded -340 mm in this locality every year, which has to be compensated for by regular flooding.

AB  - A new species of Heligmosomoides Hall, 1916 is proposed for nematodes collected from deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, in western Canada. The unequivocal diagnostic character for this species is the presence of two internal bursal membranes. Only four species, Heligmosomoides bullosus, Heligmosomoides douglasi, Heligmosomoides montanus and Heligmosomoides vandegr, are characterized as possessing a single internal bursal membrane. The genetic distance between Heligmosomoides bibullosus sp. nov., and its putative sister Glade Heligmosomoides vandegrifii is congruent with their geographic separation by the mountain range of the Rockies and 4000 km; both morphological difference as well as geography and genetic distance suggest isolation among the two species. Further, H. bibullosus sp. nov. infects deer mice (P. maniculatus) whereas H. vandegrifti is frequently collected in white-footed mice (P. leucopus). Finally, this study supports the taxonomic importance of the monodelphic/didelphic condition as a diagnostic trait within the family, the paraphyly of Heligmosomoides, and reveals undocumented diversity of Heligmosomoides in Nearctic rodents of the Neotominae. The present taxon is the third species in members of this subfamily of rodents.

AB  - This study analyses zooarchaeological material recovered from the late precolumbian site of El Flaco (AD 990-1450), northern Dominican Republic. The faunal assemblage from this inland settlement demonstrates terrestrially focused modes of faunal exploitation but with some resources obtained from coastal ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, sandy-bottom, and reefs, which are located approximately 20 km to the northwest. This study establishes last occurrence dates for extinct taxa; examines the spatial distribution of fauna; explores modes of food procurement; and the effects of agricultural activities on local fauna by investigating animal remains from three excavation units. A diachronic study of animal remains from one artificial mound demonstrates changing patterns in resource exploitation, such as an increasing consumption of land crab over a roughly 100-year period. This study follows previous research that examined the isotope ecology of endemic species from El Flaco that indicates some hutias were possibly scavenging or being fed cultivated plants. Palaeoenvironmental data suggest that Indigenous landscape transformations led to the creation of mosaic environments, which may have attracted and supported certain species, implying that the inhabitants of El Flaco likely did not have to venture far to trap or hunt many of the animals upon which they relied.

AB  - No-till farming and manure application are means of storing carbon in soil and increasing soil quality. However, the organic fertilization of no-till soils may sustain subtropical agroecosystems for only a limited period until the soil quality declines. The C, N, P, and other nutrient cycles are perturbed due to the nutrient imbalance in manures and their application on the soil surface, which poses a risk for nutrient dispersion into the environment. Long-term N-based manure application also impacts the apparent nutrient recovery (ANR) by crops and, hence, the crop quality. Our objective was to monitor changes in soil quality and to measure nutrient recovery from N-based organic fertilization in a Brazilian agroecosystem. A long-term experiment was established in May 2004 on Typic Hapludalf soil in Southern Brazil. The experiment comprised two periods: 2004-2009 and 2009-2020. The treatments were unfertilized (control), pig slurry, pig deep litter (swine manure and rice husk), cattle slurry, and mineral fertilizer (urea, triple superphosphate, and K chloride). Grain and cover crops were grown. The maize grain yield and oat biomass were used as indicators of productivity. The application of cattle slurry, pig deep litter, and pig slurry increased the grain production by 20% on average compared to mineral fertilization. Organic manuring increased the soil pH by up to one unit, while urea acidified the soil. The highest crop yields were obtained with pig deep litter, which increased the levels of P, K, Ca, Mg, and C in the soil test. Pig deep litter showed the highest N-ANR for the aboveground part of the plants. The ANRs for P, K, Ca, and Mg were also highest when pig slurry had been applied. The ANR values for the micronutrients varied widely among the organic sources but indicated large marginal offtake gains compared to mineral fertilization. The N-based fertilization with animal manures increased the rate of nutrient uptake by plants but led to an accumulation of nutrients in the soil, threatening the sustainability of the system. Manure applications must be monitored regularly to avoid the accumulation of nutrients that could impair the soil quality and become an environmental problem in the future.

AB  - Invertebrates have a central role in food webs and ecosystem functioning. By boosting productivity, allochthonous nutrient inputs influence the food webs of recipient communities. Understanding how allochthonous nutrient subsidies affect invertebrates is crucial, particularly in highly productive coastal areas. Here, we examine how mangrove macroinvertebrates are impacted by nutrient-rich guano delivered by nesting seabird populations at Aldabra Atoll in the Indian Ocean. We compare nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios and nitrogen composition of basal resources and macroinvertebrate consumers in mangroves with and without nesting seabirds. Seabird-derived nutrient enrichment increased the nitrogen content of basal food sources and herbivorous littorinid gastropods and sesarmid crabs. In mangroves with breeding seabirds, mean carapace widths of sesarmid and omnivorous portunid crabs were 6% and 11% larger, respectively. Isotopic niches of littorinid gastropods and sesarmid crabs were larger and had higher overlap at seabird compared to non-seabird sites. Epiphytic macroalgae and guano comprised >50% of resource contributions to littorinid gastropods and sesarmid crabs at seabird sites. This differed markedly from non-seabird sites where the main resource contributions were 77% mangrove leaves for littorinid gastropods, 36% sediment organic matter, and 41% mangrove leaves for sesarmid crabs. The increased sizes of mangrove crabs suggest that seabird nutrient enrichment can promote mangrove crab fisheries productivity and benefit the provisioning of mangrove ecosystem services. By shifting resource use of functionally important macroinvertebrates, we discuss how seabirds modify trophic interactions, with potential consequences for mangrove ecosystem processes and resilience.

AB  - The competitive relationship and coexistence pattern among close related species have long been one of the hot issues in ecological research. Interspecies interactions can exert important influences on the local distribution of rare species. Black muntjac Muntiacus crinifrons is an endemic species to eastern China, currently restricted to limited regions. In contrast, Chinese muntjac Muntiacus reevesi is the most common and widespread deer in southern China. Both species co-occur in southern Anhui and western Zhejiang Province. Little is known about the interaction of these two sympatric-related species. In this study, to investigate the site use determinants and co-occurrence pattern of the two sympatric muntjac species, we conducted a camera trap survey across about 250 km(2) in mountainous area of southern Anhui Province, China. We adopted a multistep approach to incorporate habitat preferences while modeling occupancy and detection. We found that the two species did not separate along elevation gradient (range from 400 m to 1,400 m) as described in previous studies. Results of single-species occupancy models indicated that elevation had positive effects on the site use of both species, while slope had an opposite influence on their site use. Positive effects of elevation on the site use implied that both species try to avoid human interference at low elevations. Significant negative effect of slope on the site use of black muntjac suggested that the species prefer habitat with gentle slope and avoided steep. Co-occurrence models and species interaction factors provided evidence that the two muntjac species had an independent occupancy (psi(BM CM) = psi(BM cm), SIF = 1) and exhibited a positive species interaction in detection probability (p(BM) r(BM CM)). Combined with the results of previous studies, we suggested that it was fine differentiation in microhabitats and food resources utilization rather spatial or temporal segregation that allowed the two species co-occurrence. The site use determinants revealed in our study would be useful for the habitat conservation and restoration for the rare black muntjac, and the co-occurrence pattern of the two sympatric muntjac species could provide useful information for deep understanding of the coexistence mechanism among forest-dwelling ungulates.

AB  - Parasites represent a critically understudied component of reef communities-a knowledge gap that has become more evident as infectious diseases emerge. Here, we test the roles of competing ecological and evolutionary factors in driving infections by an emerging infectious phenomenon: Black spot syndrome (BSS) in Caribbean reef fishes. BSS, a condition associated with localized hyperpigmentation in the dermis and fins of fishes, has recently been linked to infection by trematode parasites in the genus Scaphanocephalus. Using phylogenetic generalized linear mixed models, we evaluated the influence of host phylogeny, habitat preference, body size, and trophic position on infection abundance. Metacercariae of Scaphanocephalus were recorded in 29 of 41 fish species, including 21 new host species records, and within 306 fish (62.3% prevalence). Among species, infection load increased significantly with host body size and decreased with host trophic level, such that large-bodied herbivores tended to support the most infection. There was no significant effect of host phylogeny on infection load. These results suggest the parasite is a generalist in its use of fish intermediate hosts and emphasize the influence of local variation in parasite exposure risk. Overall, the count of visible spots per fish was a positive predictor of Scaphanocephalus abundance among species and individuals, although not all fish species exhibited spots, even when infection loads were high. Findings from this study indicate that Scaphanocephalus infections are far more prevalent in reef fishes than previously recognized and highlight the importance of investigating infection patterns beyond the external symptoms of BSS.

AB  - Introduction: Fruit wings serve various ecological functions, including facilitating wind dispersal, providing physical protection to seeds, and regulating seed germination. While many studies have reported the role of fruit wings in plants, little is known about their protective function during fruit development.Methods: In this study, winged fruits damaged by insects in natural populations of three Zygophyllum species (Z. potaninii, Z. lehmannianum and Z. macropterum) were investigated. We measured and compared the percentage of damaged winged fruits, seed set, seed mass, seed germination, and seedling growth of different insect herbivory categories.Results: The results revealed that the percentage of winged fruits with damaged wings only (low predation) was significantly higher than that of with damaged both fruit wings and fruit bodies (high predation). Furthermore, winged fruits with low predation had significant higher seed set, seed mass, seed germination, and dry mass and relative growth rate (RGR) in the seedlings which grown from the seeds, than that from winged fruits with high predation.Discussion: These results demonstrate that the presence of the fruit wings may provide protection for the seeds to alleviate harm from insect predation before dispersal. These findings provide new insights into the function of fruit wings and the reproductive strategies of desert plants.

AB  - Ongoing support for an eradication program depends on clear information being provided to on-ground operational and managerial personnel and funding agencies about the performance of control effort. This paper describes the methods used to track the success of control activities during goat eradication on Kangaroo Island, Australia, from 2006 to 2017. A range of techniques were used during the program to monitor the goat population, including helicopter surveys, Judas goats, walking transects, camera trapping, scat count transects, and opportunistic community observations. A Bayesian catch-effort model contained within a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet enabled data from multiple monitoring techniques to be accommodated. The familiar spreadsheet format made it relatively easy for operational staff to add data and visualize the strength of individual or combined monitoring techniques to track population decline. This provided greater incentive to maintain accurate records of hunting and survey effort during the eradication program. Combined survey effort data indicated there was a 1% chance that feral goats remained extant at the beginning of 2017. This probability was reduced to 0.1% if in another 12 months no further feral goat activity was detected by hunting effort and landholder/manager monitoring.

AB  - Poaching is a global driver of wildlife population decline, including inside protected areas (PAs). Reducing poaching requires an understanding of its cryptic drivers and accurately quantifying poaching scales and intensity. There is little quantification of how poaching is affected by law enforcement intensity (e.g., ranger stations) versus economic factors (e.g., unemployment), while simultaneously accounting for imperfect detection. Using extensive data of poaching events (i.e., seizures) and censuses of nine ungulate species across the PAs and unprotected lands of Iran from 2010 to 2018, we developed a single-visit hierarchical (N-mixture) model to accurately estimate annual poaching of Iranian ungulates and to differentiate between social and ecological effects on annual poaching intensity. We found that poaching detectability increased with numbers of ranger stations. A recent surge in poaching (2013-2018) coincides with rising unemployment rate. We estimated that 19,727 ungulates (95% confidence interval 11,178-36,195) were poached across the country during 2010-2018. Poaching intensity was positively related to unemployment rate, road density, and ungulate abundance. Our simulations demonstrated that the Poisson and Negative binomial N-mixture models had adequate performance when the conditions of S acute accent olymos et al. (2012) were satisfied, in particular, when at least one covariate is unique to both the detection and abundance parts of the model. Overall, we suggest that single-visit models offer unique insights into understanding the link between poaching intensity, economic conditions , law enforcement in large-scale landscapes while accounting for imperfect detection of poaching events.

AB  - Simple SummaryThe Iberian pig is appreciated for the organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of its meat. Traditional breeding is extensive, but many farms perform intensive breeding for increased productivity. In these cases, Duroc boars are the source of semen for artificial insemination (AI). There is little information on this kind of breeding; therefore, we analyzed the records from a farm near Merida (Spain). Our main interest was the effect of parity (number of previous farrowings) and season on the reproductive results of the farm. Sows between 2 and 4 previous farrowings showed the best fertility and prolificacy. Additionally, the results were higher for AI performed in autumn and winter, with a drop in reproductive performance earlier in the year than for other breeds, which usually decline by summer-early autumn. Increasing day length in the spring combined with higher temperatures in late spring-summer could lower performance during these periods. These results could help improve the management of Iberian sow farms.The Iberian pig is an autochthonous breed from the Iberian Peninsula highly valued for its meat. The sows are often bred as Iberian x Duroc crossings for increased efficiency. Since sow parity and season affect the reproductive performance, we evaluated two-year records from a commercial farrow-to-finish farm (live, stillborn, and mummified piglets after artificial insemination, AI). A total of 1293 Iberian sows were inseminated with semen from 57 boars (3024 AI). The effects of parity (gilts, 1, 2-4, 5-10, and > 10 farrowings) and season were analyzed by linear mixed-effects models (LME). The data were fitted to cosinor models to investigate seasonal effects within parity groups. The effects of maximum daily temperature (MDT) and day length change (DLC) during spermatogenesis, pre-AI, and post-AI periods were analyzed with LME. The 2-4 group was the optimal one for parity. A seasonal effect was evident between spring-summer (lower fertility/prolificacy) and autumn-winter (higher). Cosinor showed that the seasonal drop in reproductive performance occurs earlier in Iberian sows than in other breeds, more evident in gilts. MDT negatively affected performance in all periods and DLC in spermatogenesis and pre-AI. These results are relevant for the improvement of Iberian sows' intensive farming.

AB  - Understanding how novel adaptive traits arise, evolve and impact other aspects of an organism's phenotype is a foundational question in evolutionary biology. We explore this by focusing on Onciderini (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Lamiinae), a tribe of longhorn beetles commonly referred to as twig girdlers because the females of some species girdle live trees to deposit their eggs. We reconstructed the first time-calibrated phylogeny of the Onciderini, based on three genetic markers (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 'cox1', Wingless 'Wg' and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase domain of the CAD locus 'CPS'), and used morphometric data, employing multiple models of trait evolution and phylogenetic regressions, to assess whether girdling behaviour predicts head size or head size sexual dimorphism. Our results indicate that onciderines originated c. 49 million years ago 'Ma' (95% highest posterior densities 'HPD': 44.1-54.57 Ma) and consist of two major lineages, which we formalize as subtribes Hypsiomina and Onciderina. Additionally, our analyses revealed several taxonomic inconsistencies within the tribe, which we rectify by proposing new synonymies, including Jamesia Jekel as a synonym of Hypselomus Perty, Cipriscola Dillon & Dillon of Hypsioma Audinet-Serville and Psyllotoxus Thomson and Taricanus Thomson as a synonym of Oncideres Lacordaire, and a new combination for Periergates kenjii Nearns & Swift as Oncideres kenjii (Nearns & Swift) comb. nov. Using this new phylogenetic framework, we identified five independent unidirectional origins of girdling behaviour within the tribe. Overall, our results suggest that girdling influences head size evolution in Onciderini, as it is associated with an increase in both male and female head size of girdler species. Despite this, girdling and non-girdling lineages do not consistently differ in head size sexual dimorphism. This study refines the classification of Onciderini and marks a significant step in understanding the evolutionary dynamics shaping the diversity of twig-girdler beetles, a group with notable ecological and economic importance.

AB  - The history of fruit-tree utilization by prehistoric people has become an important issue that has attracted increasing attention in recent years. However, the question of how people used fruit trees has not yet been answered; in particular, the impacts of different subsistence strategies on human behavior regarding fruit-tree utilization (wild gathering or conscious cultivation) have not yet been considered. Here, we present the results of charcoal identification of fruit trees from 16 dated archeological sites in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (NETP) spanning the period c. 5,200-2,600 BP. We combine this with reported multidisciplinary evidence to explore the history of fruit-tree utilization as well as its relation to the subsistence strategy in the NETP during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. Our results demonstrate that Rosaceae [Prunus L., Prunus Padus L., Maloideae L., and Malus baccata (L.) Borkh], Elaeagnaceae (Hippophae L. and Elaeagnus angustifolia L.), and Rhamnaceae (only Ziziphus Mill.) were used by people in the NETP, and there was a downward trend in the use of fruit trees during the late Neolithic and Bronze Age. This is in notable contrast to the situation in the Chinese Loess Plateau in the parallel period. The cold-dry climate during the Bronze Age seemed to be one of the reasons. The fruit trees used by people in the NETP were likely gathered from the wild rather than consciously cultivated, and the subsistence strategy of agropastoralism may have played a significant role during the processes.

AB  - North-Central Texas preserves an early Permian record of floristic change from the Asselian through the Kungurian. The regional floras that occur during that time interval vary compositionally in systematic ways and indicate major periods of environmental change. Here we describe two such floras from the late Artinskian, found in close geographic and stratigraphic proximity, the latter collection (1991) initially was thought to be from the same site as an earlier collection (1974), but proved to be from a different layer in the same area. The two floras, "Farmer's Tank" and "Cattle Tank" were analyzed quantitatively. They are composed of the same basic mixture of taxa but with strikingly different dominance-diversity profiles; Farmer's Tank is dominated by walchian conifers with subdominant marattialean tree ferns and gigantopterids, and Cattle Tank by marattialean tree ferns with subdominant noeggerathialeans and callipterids with conifers fourth in rank. These floras are from the early phases of a change in regional floras from heavily dominated by conifers and other xeromorphic, drought-tolerant elements, to "mixed" floras rich in, even dominated by marattialean tree ferns, but retaining a major component of drought-tolerant elements. These quantitative differences may reflect differences in the environment of deposition, but also possibly in season of the year - the Farmer's Tank collection is rich in seeds of considerable variety (13 morphotypes), whereas the Cattle Tank collection contains few seeds. These floristic features strongly suggest a landscape under seasonal climatic conditions with a period of moisture deficit.

AB  - This study evaluated heavy metals and minerals concentrations in dairy and plant-based milk alternatives available in Pakistan using ICP-MS. A total of 324 raw milk samples (cow, buffalo, goat, sheep, camel), 48 heat-treated samples (UHT, pasteurized, powdered), and 21 plant-based milk (coconut, almond, soy, oat, rice, walnut, cashew) were analyzed. Results showed significant differences in heavy metal levels across milk types. Chromium was the most common heavy metal in raw milk, especially in buffalo milk (0.16 mg L-1). Heat-treated milk had lower heavy metal concentrations than raw milk, with pasteurized milk showing higher cadmium levels (0.08 mg L-1). Among plant-based milk, oat milk had the lowest heavy metal concentration (0.02 mg L-1), while powdered milk had the least contamination overall. Findings highlight the need for stringent quality control to ensure safety and nutritional standards in dairy and plant-based milk products.

AB  - Variations in forage availability, selection and preferences can lead to intense foraging competition and depletion of food consequently lowering diet quality and population performance of black rhino species. This study investigated seasonal variations in rhino diet, foraging, preference and browsing intensity and how this is influenced by plant diversity and availability in Mkomazi National Park (MKONAPA). Fifty-eight square grids were randomly selected in each season, and plots were laid for vegetation assessment during wet and dry seasons in the sanctuary. Browsed species by rhinos were compared with rhino feeding data from fourteen rhino range areas within Africa. More than 85% of species edible in MKONAPA were similar to those in rhino range areas. Acalypha ornata, Grewia similis and Commiphora africana were highly utilised specie in both seasons. Diversity and abundance of consumed browses decreased towards the dry season while browsing intensity increased with forage preference in both seasons and was prominent when browse availability was low in dry seasons. Our study established seasonal variation in dietary composition, browsing intensity and preferences for black rhinos. We suggest establishing nutritional composition of preferred forages, assessing density of competitor browsers, translocating excess rhinos or expanding the sanctuary to meet the recommended ecological carrying capacity.

AB  - The first quantitative video survey of the benthic megafauna was carried out on a transect in the eastern part of the Kara Sea from the slope of the Voronin Trough to the upper shelf in the depth range from 1680 to 70 metres. The data were obtained using the TUV "Videomodule" during the 89th cruise of the R/V Akademik Mstislav Keldysh in autumn 2022. It was shown that the megabenthos in this area differs significantly from that of the western part of the sea and Blagopoluchiya Bay (Novaya Zemlya). In the eastern part of the Kara Sea, echinoderms dominated, among which ophiuroids were in the first place, whereas in the western part of the sea and the Blagopoluchiya Bay, the key component of the megafauna was the snow crab Chionoecetes opilio. Single adults of Ch. opilio were recorded for the first time at almost all stations in the eastern part of the sea, but, in contrast to the western area, the snow crab has not yet become dominant here and has not influenced the benthic communities.

AB  - Aim Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have been identified as a dominant factor in evolutionary and ecological processes underlying contemporary species distribution. In contrast, anthropogenic activity during the Holocene has been largely neglected in phylogeographic inference. Here, by integrating archaeological evidence, phylogeographic analyses and a climatic niche-based approach, the role of Holocene human activity in determining the evolutionary trajectory of insect pests is investigated using Hyalopterus arundiniformis (HAR) as a model. Location Eurasia. Methods We compiled archaeological records and historical data for the host plant (i.e. peach) of HAR. Phylogeographic structure, genetic diversity and gene flow were estimated. Historical demographic dynamics were explored using coalescent-based analyses. The origin and dispersal history were assessed using an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approach. The changes in climatic niche breadth during geographic expansion were evaluated via niche comparison analyses. Results Our results revealed that HAR originated in Southwest China and dispersed to Southeast and Northwest China, and it was then introduced to western Eurasia from Northwest China. The climatic niche shifted significantly with range expansions, and niche expansion explained the largest proportion of niche dynamics. Population size expansion occurred in the Holocene and coincided with the domestication and trans-Eurasian trade of peach. Main conclusions The geographic range, effective population size and climatic niche breadth of HAR expanded following the human-mediated dispersal of its host plant during the Holocene. Our results highlight that the expansion of Neolithic agriculture and trans-Eurasian crop exchange along ancient communication routes may have played an important role in shaping the distribution and demographic dynamics of herbivorous insects. This study also provides essential information for pest management and biological invasions.

AB  - Simple Summary Pere David's deer is native to the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Yellow River in China. However, the wild population became extinct in China around 1900. In 1986, 39 Pere David's deer were reintroduced into Dafeng. Up until now, its wild population has reached 2658, with a total of 6119 in 2021. At present, due to the continuous increase in the population, the repeated grazing on the same plants by the Pere David's deer has affected the re-growth of plants, which has led to insufficient natural food. Therefore, feeding supplement with silage is necessary. As a key nutritional factor, diet is the most important for the gut microbiota and metabolites of wild animals. In order to determine the effect of different dietary patterns on the nutrition and health of Pere David's deer in Dafeng Reserve in spring, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of Pere David's deer feces by UPLC-MS/MS and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to reveal its intestinal chemical environment and the differences in the fecal microbiome. Altogether, our data explored the significant changes in the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways during the transition from full silage to a combination diet with silage and plant in spring. These data provided important information to make more reasonable measures for Pere David's deer's protection. A deep understanding of the effect of seasonal dietary changes on the nutrition and health of Pere David's deer in Dafeng Reserve will contribute greatly to Pere David's deer's protection. In this reserve, there were three seasonal dietary regimes: feeding on naturally occurring plants (PLANT diet), silage (SILAGE diet), and a combination of natural plants and silage (COMB diet). To some extent, the COMB diet reflects the seasonal transition from silage to the all-natural plant diet, especially in early spring. However, little is known regarding the gut microbiota changes and metabolic consequences under the COMB diet. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry, the gut microbiota and fecal metabolites of Pere David's deer under these three diets were compared. Results showed the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota was significantly lower under the COMB diet compared to either the SILAGE or PLANT diets. Although no significant changes were observed in the core phyla, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, among the three dietary regimes, a significant lower abundance of several other phyla (Spirochaetes, Melainabacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucobacteria) was observed in the COMB diet compared to the SILAGE diet. A greater number of fecal metabolite differences was identified between the COMB and SILAGE or COMB and PLANT diets than between the SILAGE and PLANT diets, suggesting that the COMB diet had more of an effect on the metabolism of Pere David's deer. The integrated pathway analysis showed that several metabolic pathways were significantly affected by the different dietary regimes, such as tryptophan metabolism, vitamin metabolism, and the platelet activation pathways. These metabolic changes reflect the responses and adaptations of Pere David's deer to different diets. Taken overall, our data reveal the difference in the gut microbiota and metabolic pathways of Pere David's deer under three dietary regimes in Dafeng Reserve, which provides important information for Pere David's deer conservation.

AB  - Cross-species communication, where signals are sent by one species and perceived by others, is one of the most intriguing types of communication that functionally links different species to form complex ecological networks. Global change and human activity can affect communication by increasing fluctuations in species composition and phenology, altering signal profiles and intensity, and introducing noise. So far, most studies on cross-species communication have focused on a few specific species isolated from ecological communities. Scaling up investigations of cross-species communication to the community level is currently hampered by a lack of conceptual and practical methodologies. Here, we propose an interdisciplinary framework based on information theory to investigate mechanisms shaping cross-species communication at the community level. We use plants and insects, the cornerstones of most ecosystems, as a showcase and focus on chemical communication as the key communication channel. We first introduce some basic concepts of information theory, then we illustrate information patterns in plant-insect chemical communication, followed by a further exploration of how to integrate information theory into ecological and evolutionary processes to form testable mechanistic hypotheses. We conclude by highlighting the importance of community-level information as a means to better understand the maintenance and workings of ecological systems, especially during rapid global change.

AB  - The chubbyhead barb, Enteromius anoplus, as currently described, is the most widely distributed freshwater fish in South Africa. The species occurs in almost all the major river systems across the country, with the exception of the small coastal drainages on the south coast. The use of a comprehensive data set of mitochondrial (mtDNA) cytochrome b (cyt b) sequences uncovered the presence of four distinct lineages or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within E. anoplus: (a) the Gouritz lineage endemic to the Gouritz River system, (b) the Olifants lineage endemic to the Olifants-Doring River system, (c) the Orange lineage endemic to the Orange River system and (d) the Eastern Cape lineage which is distributed across six river systems from the Great Fish to the Buffalo rivers in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. The present study provides a new diagnosis for E. anoplus s.s. (the Gouritz lineage), revalidates Enteromius cernuus (the Olifants lineage) and Enteromius oraniensis (the Orange lineage) as distinct species. The study also provides a description for a new species, Enteromius mandelai sp. nov (the Eastern Cape lineage). E. cernuus and E. mandelai differ from both E. anoplus and E. oraniensis by having a complete lateral line (vs. an incomplete lateral line in the latter species). E. cernuus further differs from the other three species by having long maxillary barbels which reach or exceed the vertical through the middle of the eye and the lowest number of circumpendicular scales (10-12 vs. 12-16 for the other three species). E. oraniensis is distinctive from the other three species by having inconspicuous barbels. These findings add to the growing body of literature that shows that the freshwater fishes of the Cape Fold and adjacent freshwater ecoregions have narrow geographic ranges. This has ramifications for conservation planning and management, as well as the understanding of the evolutionary history of the stream fishes in these global endemic hotspots.

AB  - Although the 13.2-13.8 ky old Lovas red ochre mine, Central Transdanubia, Hungary is a very important Upper Palaeolithic archaeological site being the second oldest in mainland Europe, we have little knowledge of the conditions under which and how long the pits were cultivated and the post-mining sedimentation processes. The aim of the study was to study certain human circumstances of the mining activities, reveal the former ecological conditions which influenced the sedimentation processes and investigate how the changing climatic conditions led to the formation of the fossil macrofaunal assemblage of the archaeological site. The removal of ca. 25 m3 of pigment material from the pits was equivalent to a maximum of 8750-11042 transport occasions per person, although the pre-transport processing of the material could notably reduce the weight of the transportable pigment and the time demand. Based on the lower thermal comfort limit, mining activities could be performed predominantly in the summer months. In the relatively humid Belling-Allered period, the redeposition of the excavated barren material to the cavity could be rapid after the termination of the mining activity. In the Younger Dryas Stadial and the early Holocene, the recharge and covering of the former pits with sediment could be slow and it started to increase only in the mid-Holocene period. The modelling of the potential distribution range of five macrofaunal elements indicates that all the species occurred at the site in the Belling-Allered period in the wider environment of the Lovas red ochre mine. The reconstructed boreal forest biome in the time of cultivation of the mine can explain well the dominance of fossil elk bones found in the fossil assemblage.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate elephant habitat conditions in the Sai Yok National Park, Thailand, using high-resolution Pl & eacute;iades imagery and InVEST Model's Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) model. Land use was also analyzed as an input in the model using feature selection via the Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and classification using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The risk and vulnerability of the elephant habitat were analyzed using several corresponding indices to understand the spatial distribution of anthropogenic activities and point out the areas for immediate conservation needs. The research results show a rapid change in land use between 2013 and 2022, with forest cover significantly decreasing and cultivated land increasing. Habitat degradation index data indicates that changes in land use have resulted in a significant decline in habitat quality due to palpable human pressure. This study also highlighted the eastern boundary of the study region as a possible risk zone for elephant habitat, where the tourism sector is expanding. Despite the potential to improve local livelihoods, these economic activities would eventually negatively influence elephant habitats. The integration of decision support technology with the results provided by this study can help stakeholders and policymakers create sustainable land-use plans that are ecologically diligent.

AB  - The Middle and Late Bronze Ages of western Anatolia (modern Turkey) remains poorly understood in comparison with its Mycenaean and Hittite neighbours, especially in agricultural economies and land use. Kaymakci is the largest Middle and Late Bronze Age citadel excavated to date in western Anatolia and new archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological data from the site presented here shed new light on regional agricultural economies and land use. Agricultural practices at Kaymakci focused on barley and bitter vetch farming and pig, caprine, and cattle husbandry within a diverse and extensive economic system that made substantial use of wild plants and animals for food, technology, and fuel. Goats and pigs were managed primarily for meat, while sheep and cattle were managed to produce a range of secondary products. Wood charcoal analysis reconstructs both deciduous and evergreen oak woodlands, which also dominate the contemporary landscape. In regional perspective, Kaymakci is most similar to the northern Aegean agricultural tradition, but with elements of Anatolian practices as well, representing a hybrid position between the Aegean and Anatolian worlds as seen in other lines of archaeological evidence from the site.

AB  - Understanding ecological- and management-related predictors of mammal space use within protected areas is critical for management planning. This is particularly true in small, fenced and isolated reserves where we hypothesised that management-related activities will influence large herbivore space use more than ecological characteristics. We used camera trap data to assess the space use patterns for 18 ungulate species in the small and isolated Majete Wildlife Reserve (Majete) in the understudied Miombo woodland ecoregion of southern Malawi. In the 2018 dry season, the 691 km(2) reserve was systematically surveyed for ungulate presence at 140 camera trap locations. Over a period of 5456 camera days, the survey yielded 11 078 independent detections of 18 ungulate species and three predators. Using a single-species occupancy modelling framework, the probability of space use of ungulates was assessed in relation to five management (fire exposure, fire frequency, water availability, distance from fence and road) and five ecological (visibility, grass biomass, vegetation type, terrain ruggedness and predator abundance) space use covariates, while accounting for imperfect detection. Top-ranked models contained multiple covariates for 15 of the 16 species modelled, with only nyala's (Tragelaphus angasii) space use best predicted by vegetation type only. Distance to water, vegetation type, visibility and fire frequency were predictors having strong influences on six or more species each. More management-related covariates reflected in top models, but ecological covariates had more meaningful effect sizes making us reject the hypothesis. Importantly though, distance from the roads and fence were also identified as prominent predictors. Notably, black rhinoceros' (Diceros bicornis) probability of space use increased with distance from the reserve boundary. Beyond informing habitat management for ungulates in Majete, these results can form the basis for understanding species-specific space use patterns in other small reserves with similar characteristics and threats.

AB  - Habitat use by wild animals may be subject to spatial and temporal changes. The Kalamaili Mountain Ungulate Nature Reserve (KNR), inhabited by >80 % of Chinese khulan (Equus hemionus), is one of the most important desert ungulate reserves in Northwestern China. However, frequent human disturbance caused by mining development and road construction in KNR has interfered with or completely blocked their movement and access to parts of the reserve. In our study, we assessed the distribution of suitable habitat and ecological corridors of khulan before the mining development (2005), at the peak of mining development (2011), and after ecological restoration and expressway construction (2019). The results showed that most of the core habitat and ecological corridors of khulan were concentrated in the middle of the reserve and on the east side of the road. The habitat of khulan in KNR went from a good natural habitat in 2005 to deterioration due to mining development in 2011. Then it partially recovered due to ecological restoration from 2015 onwards. However, in 2019, road con-struction likely hindered its recovery to pre-mining levels. The location of corridors accordingly varied with the change of core habitat in different years. Nevertheless, the corridors intersecting roads generally had higher centrality values, indicating their higher importance. Our study revealed the significant impacts that mining development and road construction have had on the distribution of core habitats, ecological corridors, and movement of khulan. These results provide a scientific basis and valuable arguments for strengthening habitat connectivity for khulan.

AB  - Simple Summary Herbs, as supplementary feed, have shown positive effects on livestock. The yak is a unique animal on the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, and plays important roles in local livelihoods and ecology. Because of the harsh climate conditions, early weaned yak calves often face environmental and nutritional stress. The herbal active ingredients of some herbs improve the antioxidant capacity and immunity of animals. In the current study, early-weaned yak calves were supplemented with three widely used Chinese traditional herbal root extracts to examine whether they can improve the immune response and antioxidant capacity. The results demonstrated that the supplementary herbs increased the serum antioxidant capacity, and improved the energy and nitrogen metabolism of the yak calves. Chinese traditional herbs are used widely as feed supplements to improve the immune response and antioxidant capacity of livestock. Twenty early-weaned 4-month-old yak calves (72.3 +/- 3.65 kg) were divided randomly into four groups (n = 5 per group); three groups were provided with supplementary 80 mL/kg DMI of the root water extracts of either Angelica sinensis, Codonopsis pilosula or Glycyrrhiza uralensis, and one group (control) was not provided with a supplement. Compared to control calves, calves consuming the three herbal extracts increased serum concentrations of albumin (ALB) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), but decreased serum concentrations of free fatty acids (FFAs) and malondialdehyde (MDA) (p < 0.05). Calves consuming A. sinensis decreased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total cholesterol (TC), and increased (p < 0.05) serum concentration of total proteins (TP). Serum FFA concentrations increased (p = 0.004) linearly with time in the control group, but not in the groups consuming herbs. Serum metabolomic data demonstrated that A. sinensis and C. pilosula regulate mainly amino acid metabolism, while G. uralensis regulates mainly carbon and amino acid metabolism. It was concluded that the three herbal root extracts, as dietary supplements, improved energy and nitrogen metabolism, and enhanced the antioxidant capacity of yak calves.

AB  - Worldwide, transportation agencies have been involved in road mitigation efforts to reduce road mortality and promote connectivity of endangered species. Baseline data on how mammals respond to highway construction, however, are rarely collected in road mitigation and monitoring studies, including in the USA. Our goal in this study was to assess differences in the response of the mammal community to highway construction along a gradient of human land use (HLU) from July 2019 to November 2020 in southern Texas, USA. We compared the species composition of the terrestrial mammal community at five sites along a highway before and during highway construction and assessed diel activity for seven species at different HLU levels between these two time periods. We found that mammal community composition was lower during the construction period at each HLU level. There were greater differences in the composition of the mammal community in the pre-construction and construction periods as HLU decreased. Community diversity was greatest in areas with a low level of HLU, followed by areas of medium and high levels, with more carnivores, large ungulates, and rodents at medium and low HLU sites. For many species, diel activity patterns across all sites during the construction period reflected activity patterns in areas of higher HLU during the pre-construction period. Our study shows that community composition and behavior (diel activity) are likely to change in response to highway construction regardless of the degree of HLU. These results may influence how scientists and transportation agencies consider potential impacts on wildlife species during road construction and affect their attempt to mitigate these impacts.

AB  - Neurological symptoms resulting from selenium(Se) exposure significantly impact the health and conservation of Przewalski's gazelle. In this study, we performed proteomic and metabolomic analyses of the liver in Przewalski's gazelle for the first time, aiming to reveal the hepatic metabolic mechanisms underlying the neurological symptoms caused by Se exposure. We identified 89 differentially expressed proteins and 30 metabolites with altered regulation. Using multi-omics integrated analysis, we identified a neurofunctional regulation network composed of three metabolic pathways, with (S)-3-amino-2-methylpropionate transaminase being the key enzyme in the regulatory network. Molecular docking revealed that the binding of selenocysteine to (S)-3-amino2-methylpropionate transaminase may act as a key factor in activating this regulatory network. Consequently, these findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of neurological symptoms caused by Se exposure and have significant implications for the conservation in Przewalski's gazelle.

AB  - Fossils of plant-insect interactions are direct evidence of paleoecological relationships between these two dominant groups in terrestrial ecosystems. We present a variety of plant-insect interactions from the late Early Cretaceous (latest Albian) in the Estercuel locality in northeastern Spain (Iberian Peninsula), affecting two types of terrestrial angiosperms and the basal eudicot Klitzschophyllites, which is one of the oldest putative members of aquatic Ranunculales found to date. The study of these interactions revealed 23 different damage types belonging to eight functional feeding groups (hole feeding, margin feeding, skeletonization, surface feeding, piercing and sucking, mining, oviposition and galling), suggesting these angiosperms were an important source of food and lodging for insects in the Iberian ecosystems during the late Early Cretaceous. Notably, the diversity of damage in the leaves of angiosperms suggests a diverse community of herbivorous insects and a variety of strategies of interactions with plants at the end of the Early Cretaceous in the southwestern Tethys realm.

Experimental results declared that the fungal abundance significantly reduced among the both biochar applied treatments but three dominant phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycota were still relatively greater abundance present. There were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the relative abundance and diversity of fungi among all three treatments. Interestingly, biochar addition regulated the overall fungal community in final compost. Compared with the control group, the abundance of fungi was positively mobilized, and especially CSB showed a better effect. Conclusively, biochar has potential to inhibit and reduce the ARGs population and mobility in compost. Thus, these findings offer new insight to understand the succession of ARFs during PM composting.

AB  - Introgressive hybridization may lead to contrasting evolutionary outcomes that are difficult to predict since they depend on the fitness effects of endogenous genomic interactions and environmental factors. Conservation of endemic biodiversity may be more effective with require direct measurement of introgressed ancestry and fitness in wild populations, especially for keystone taxa at risk of hybridization following species introductions. We assessed the relationship of non-native ancestry with growth and body condition in the basin-restricted Neosho Bass ( Micropterus velox; NB), focussing on two streams in the NB native range that are admixed extensively with non-native Smallmouth Bass (M. dolomieu; SMB). We quantified the genetic composition of 116 fish from Big Sugar Creek (N = 46) and Elk River (N = 70) at 14 microsatellite loci. Using back-calculated total length-at-age estimated from sagittal otoliths, we assessed whether genetic ancestry explained variation in von Bertalanffy growth model parameters, accounting for sex and stream effects. We then assessed the relationship between ancestry and body condition. We found no differences in growth parameters by sex, stream, or ancestry, suggesting phenotypic homogenization which could be mediated by selection on body size. We found a negative correlation between SMB ancestry and condition, including lower condition in Big Sugar Creek, possibly reflecting a trade-off between maximum length and condition with respect to overall fitness. We show that ongoing non-native introgression, which may be augmented by anthropogenic SMB introductions, may attenuate evolutionary differentiation between species and directly influence fitness, possibly having critical implications for long-term persistence and management of adaptive potential in a popular and ecologically important endemic sportfish.

   The reduction of biodiversity determines the loss of species and breeds, with the consequent disappearance of production systems, knowledge, cultures and local traditions. The Nero Lucano pig is a native breed of Southern Italy (Basilicata region) recovered, starting from 2001, because of the high quality of its cured meat products. This study gives a picture of the low genetic variability of this breed. Knowledge of individual inbreeding levels allows for planning of interventions to reduce the negative effects of the low effective population size and, then, improve the efficiency of the actual recovery project.
   The Nero Lucano (NL) pig is a black coat colored breed characterized by a remarkable ability to adapt to the difficult territory and climatic conditions of Basilicata region in Southern Italy. In the second half of the twentieth century, technological innovation, agricultural evolution, new breeding methods and the demand for increasingly lean meat brought the breed almost to extinction. Only in 2001, thanks to local institutions such as: the Basilicata Region, the University of Basilicata, the Regional Breeders Association and the Medio Basento mountain community, the NL pig returned to populate the area with the consequent possibility to appreciate again its specific cured meat products. We analyzed the pedigrees recorded by the breeders and the Illumina Porcine SNP60 BeadChip genotypes in order to obtain the genetic structure of the NL pig. Results evidenced that this population is characterized by long mean generation intervals (up to 3.5 yr), low effective population size (down to 7.2) and high mean inbreeding coefficients (F-MOL = 0.53, F-ROH = 0.39). This picture highlights the low level of genetic variability and the critical issues to be faced for the complete recovery of this population.

AB  - Cattle fever ticks (CFT) represent a significant economic burden to the livestock industry worldwide, and novel methods are needed for treatment of CFT on livestock and wildlife. Two similar botanical pesticides, Stop the Bites (R)! and Arkion (R) Fly and Tick Spray, were evaluated in a pen trial to control CFT on cattle using a motion activated 3-D Quik Hand (TM) livestock sprayer. The cattle were repeatedly treated passively as they crossed through the sprayer to travel between compartments of the pen to access food and water/shade. Both formulations of the botanical pesticides caused significant mortality to CFT when compared to the untreated water control. The 3-D Quik Hand (TM) sprayer is a novel tool for the low-volume and high-frequency application of pesticides to control CFT. This tool could provide a new option in addition to treatment using dipping vats, spray boxes, or truck mounted sprayers for use by the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program and livestock producers. It may also be useful to treat nilgai antelope and white-tailed deer infested with CFT as they move through gaps in livestock fencing or natural or man-made funnels that lead to water or other lures. Further research is warranted to optimize the rates of the botanical pesticides and methods to deploy the 3-D Quik Hand (TM) sprayer in the field.

AB  - Diel activity patterns of animal species reflect constraints imposed by morphological, physiological, and behavioral trade-offs, but these trade-offs are rarely quantified for multispecies assemblages. Based on a systematic year-long camera-trap study in the species-rich mammal assemblage of Lake Manyara National Park (Tanzania), we estimated activity levels (hours active per day) and circadian rhythms of 17 herbivore and 11 faunivore species to determine the effects of body mass and trophic level on activity levels and cathemerality (the degree to which species are active throughout the day and night). Using generalized least squares and phylogenetic generalized least squares analyses, we found no support for the hypothesis that trophic level is positively associated with activity levels. We found no support for activity levels to scale positively with body mass in herbivores or to differ between ruminants and nonruminants; in faunivores, we also did not detect relationships between body mass and activity levels. Cathemerality was positively associated with activity levels but did not scale significantly with body mass. Overall, our findings caution against trophic level or body mass-associated generalized conclusions with regard to diel activity patterns.

AB  - Wild pig (Sus scrofa) eradication in demographically open populations has seemed an impossible feat for managers, but more recently, whole sounder removal (WSR) has been proposed as a trapping strategy that has the potential to be successful in eradicating wild pigs from an area. However, little empirical data exist concerning implementation of whole sounder removal strategies. Our objective was to implement and describe wild pig management using WSR. We established a 27-km(2) area (northwest section) where sounders were removed using WSR and a 29-km(2) area (southeast section) where GPS collars were deployed on Lowndes Wildlife Management Area in Alabama. Prior to implementing WSR, we used game cameras over bait at a density of one camera/km(2) in November 2014 and counted 65 and 100 individuals in our northwest and southeast sections, respectively. We began WSR July 2015 and by May 2016, we reduced the estimated population by 90%. However, due to births and seasonal movements of pigs in the periphery of the study area, the population fluctuated between 10-20 individuals from May 2016 to December 2017. In December 2017, we removed the last known remaining sounder, and using game cameras, observed no sounders in the northwest section for the following 7 months, the remaining length of the study. We determined that using the WSR approach can lead to a delay before inevitable recolonization. Therefore, WSR can be a successful tool to significantly reduce a wild pig population and potentially provide managers a pig-free area.

AB  - Themeda triandra (kangaroo grass) is the most widespread plant species in Australia. Using herbarium specimens, we quantified awn-length variation across its distribution in relation to climate. We found that awn lengths were shortest around the eastern and southern coast of Australia (with short awns also concentrated in the Pilbara), increasing in length progressively inland and towards the north. There was a significant positive relationship between awn length and mean annual temperature. Further research is needed to understand why awn lengths vary, and how awn-length variation affects seed and seedling fitness in natural habitats.

AB  - Despite the well-known potential of agroforestry systems to sustain livelihoods and ecosystem services, their targeted adoption in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of West Africa is low. To address this, we used questionnaires with 279 farmers to understand their socio-economic characteristics determining the adoption of agroforestry technologies and to record the preferred tree species in the Koulikoro region of Mali and West-Central region of Burkina Faso. The result of a binary logistic regression showed that income, off farm activities, average number of owned sheep, cooperative membership, forage security, and maintained trees and shrubs fostered the adoption of agroforestry technologies. Contrarily, the adoption of agroforestry technologies was negatively influenced by household size and crop yield. Our data show that agroforestry parklands are the most popular agroforestry technology. The most common agroforestry tree species in the study region was Vitellaria paradoxa C. F. Gaertn. The dominance of V. paradoxa within these parklands may be partly explained by the tree's adaptation to severe drought and fire hazards, which are common to the study region. The study also revealed that smallholder farmers in Mali maintained trees on farms mainly for food security, whereas in Burkina Faso trees were mainly kept for maintaining soil fertility. We conclude that in all initiatives aimed at promoting the adoption of agroforestry in the study region, efforts should be made to consider farmers' socioeconomic characteristics, tree preferences, and perceptions (as identified in this study).

AB  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), defined as small, random departures away from perfect symmetry, is frequently recommended as a sensitive and universal indicator of environmental stress imposed by both abiotic and biotic factors. However, the stress sensitivities of FA and of other morphological traits are rarely compared directly. Here, we tested the hypothesis that leaf FA, rather than leaf size, is more sensitive to simulated herbivory. We performed blind measurements of FA and length of the same leaves of juvenile mountain birches (Betula pubescens var. pumila) after removal of 0, 2, 4, 8 and 16% of their leaf area during five consequent years. The leaf length in defoliated birches was 88% of that in control birches, indicating that simulated herbivory was stressful for trees. By contrast, leaf FA did not differ significantly between defoliated and control birches, despite a sufficient (91%) power of statistical analysis. Thus, leaf size, rather than leaf FA, was a more sensitive indicator of stress. This low sensitivity of FA to stress, discovered with the use of blind methods, contrasts a large pool of earlier studies, many of which have been likely influences by confirmation bias.

AB  - Adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) grazing, a grazing system in which individual paddocks are grazed fora short duration at a high stock density and followed by a long rest period, is claimed to be an effective tool to sustainably manage and improve grasslands and enhance their ecosystem services. However, whether AMP grazing is superior to conventional grazing (n-AMP) in reducing soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is unclear. Here, we measured CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes between August 2017 and August 2019 in 12 pairs of AMP vs. n-AMP ranches distributed across an agro-dimatic gradient in Alberta, Canada. We found that field GHG fluxes did not differ between AMP and n-AMP grazing systems, but instead were regulated by specific management attributes, environmental conditions, and soil properties, including cattle stocking rate, cultivation history, soil moisture content, and soil bulk density. Specifically, we found that seasonal mean CO2 emissions increased with increasing cattle stocking rates, while CH4 uptake was lower in grasslands with a history of cultivation. Seasonal mean CO2 emissions increased while CH4 uptake decreased with increasing soil moisture content. In addition, CH4 uptake decreased with increasing soil bulk density. Observed N2O emissions were poorly predicted by the management, environmental conditions, and soil properties investigated in our study. We conclude that AMP grazing does not have an advantage over n-AMP grazing in reducing GHG fluxes from grasslands. Future efforts to develop optimal management strategies (e.g., the use of sustainable stocking rates and avoided cultivation) that reduce GHG emissions should also consider the environmental conditions and soil properties unique to every grassland ecosystem.

AB  - Antagonistic coevolution of plants and insects is hypothesized to promote biological diversity. This study shows convergent evolution of a gene that encodes the GABA receptor, a target of plant toxins, in herbivorous insects and their predators. It further demonstrates that the evolution of resistant GABA receptors is associated with insect diversification.
   The molecular mechanisms of coevolution between plants and insects remain elusive. GABA receptors are targets of many neurotoxic terpenoids, which represent the most diverse array of natural products known. Over deep evolutionary time, as plant terpene synthases diversified in plants, so did plant terpenoid defence repertoires. Here we show that herbivorous insects and their predators evolved convergent amino acid changing substitutions in duplicated copies of the Resistance to dieldrin (Rdl) gene that encodes the GABA receptor, and that the evolution of duplicated Rdl and terpenoid-resistant GABA receptors is associated with the diversification of moths and butterflies. These same substitutions also evolved in pests exposed to synthetic insecticides that target the GABA receptor. We used in vivo genome editing in Drosophila melanogaster to evaluate the fitness effects of each putative resistance mutation and found that pleiotropy both facilitates and constrains the evolution of GABA receptor resistance. The same genetic changes that confer resistance to terpenoids across 300 Myr of insect evolution have re-evolved in response to synthetic analogues over one human lifespan.

AB  - Trophic cascades reportedly structure ecological communities through indirect species interactions. Though the predator-herbivore-autotroph relationship has received much attention, mechanistic evidence supporting intraguild trophic cascades is rare. We established 348 remote camera sites (1 August-5 September 2019) across seven study areas of varying wolf (Canis lupus) density including one study area where wolves were absent in northern Michigan, USA. Using multi-species occupancy modeling at species-relevant spatial scales, we evaluated the hypothesis that increased wolf occurrence suppresses coyote (C. latrans) occurrence with corresponding increased red fox (Vulpes vulpes) occurrence mediated by land cover edge density, human presence, and temporal partitioning. Remote cameras recorded >600,000 images and included 6,370, 10,137, and 4,876 detections of wolves, coyotes, and foxes, respectively. Fox occupancy probability was more than three times as high (0.29) at camera sites where wolves were present, relative to sites wolves were absent (0.09). Pairwise species interactions supported expected size-based dominance patterns among canids and insignificant effects were directionally consistent with reported reduced strength of top-down effects in peripheral wolf range. Increased edge density also increased co-occurrence of coyote and wolves, likely a function of increased prey availability and refugia for coyotes. Though foxes occurred in spatial proximity to wolves, competition was limited by greater temporal partitioning than observed between coyotes and foxes that were spatially segregated. Collectively, our results provide marginal support for the reported trophic cascade among wolves, coyotes, and foxes wherein top-down effects may be reduced near the edge of current wolf distributions. As predators continue to recolonize portions of their historic range, knowledge of the effects on intraguild predators has implications for species management and predicting prey population responses.

AB  - The increasing frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs) is a globally recognized problem that can severely impact both the animals and humans involved in these accidents. Introduced wild pigs (Sus scrofa) have been present in various parts of the USA for centuries, but no study on wild pig-vehicle collisions (WPVCs) has been conducted on a national scale for the USA Using data provided by State Farm, we derived the number of vehicle collisions with wild pigs by state in the USA over the 2015-2022 period and the associated vehicle damage costs. In 2022, we estimated that a total of 16,714 wild pig-vehicle collisions occurred, which necessitated $103.8 million in vehicle repair costs. Texas bore the highest burden ($56.2 million), followed by Florida ($12.4 million). We showed that the ratio of collisions with wild pigs to vehicle miles traveled increased with state-level wild pig density and that this ratio is more than seven times higher in Hawaii and Texas than could be expected based solely on the local wild pig densities. Compared to other WVCs, only 1.64% of these accidents were caused by WPVCs. Nationally, WPVCs caused 0.18% of the annual attrition in wild pig populations. WPVCs impose a substantial financial burden to the USA that is unlikely to decrease in the immediate future. WPVC risks are driven by state-specific effects indicating the presence of strong influencing factors at the individual state level. It is thus imperative that transportation and wildlife managers adequately study the issue and collect the data required for mitigation.

AB  - Certain local breeds of goats have adapted to severe water restriction in arid and semi-arid regions, but little is known about the adaptability of high-producing dairy goats to water restriction while grazing under temperate conditions. The aim of this study was to assess effects of water restriction of lactating Alpine goats during the daytime at pasture (8 h/d) on herd-level drinking water intake and individual milk production and grazing time. Goats remained in the barn between evening and morning milkings, where each animal was offered 600 g of concentrate and 400 g of hay each day, with free access to water. Twenty four goats were used in a crossover design, for two consecutive 14-d periods. The study was conducted in early summer, with a daily mean ambient temperature of 18.2 +/- 3.5 degrees C (range of 13-27 degrees C over all the study days), a mean temperature-humidity index of 64 +/- 4.9 (range of 56-76). Goats had access to a high-quality multispecies pasture with a mean of 216 +/- 44 g DM/kg fresh matter. Total drinking water intake averaged 5.57 L/d and did not differ significantly between treatments. Goats with water access at pasture drank a mean of 1.88 L of water per day during the grazing period, but drank 2.24 L less per day in the barn than goats without water access at pasture. Drinking water intake increased by 0.57 L per day for each degrees C increase in daily mean ambient temperature. Daily milk production, milk composition, body weight, and daily grazing time did not differ between treatments. Only the duration of the first morning meal at pasture differed significantly between treatments. Thus, water restriction for 8 h per day during grazing periods does not seem to influence the variables measured for Alpine dairy goats under temperate conditions.

AB  - Submerged macrophytes are vital in shallow lakes, as they provide critical ecosystem functions and services and can stabilize the clear-water conditions by various mechanisms. Nutrient enrichment reduces the resilience of macrophyte dominance in shallow lakes, thereby making them susceptible to shifts towards phytoplankton dominance following perturbations. Here, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the individual and combined effects of nutrient enrichment and the addition of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) on the abundance of submerged macrophytes, epiphyton, and phytoplankton. We hypothesized that moderate nutrient enrichment facilitates macrophyte abundance, but also phytoplankton abundance after macrophyte removal by herbivorous fish. Our data showed that herbivory by grass carp could trigger a shift from macrophytes to algal dominance in mesocosms with moderate nutrient concentrations, but not in those with low nutrient concentrations. Moderate nutrient enrichment alone promoted submerged macrophyte growth, whereas the introduction of grass carp induced a collapse of submerged macrophytes regardless of nutrient conditions. Moreover, the introduction of grass carp showed more negative effects on light conditions of the water column in mesocosms with moderate nutrient concentrations compared to those with low nutrient concentrations. A recovery of submerged macrophytes might thus be limited by low light availability in lakes with moderate nutrient conditions suffering grass carp perturbation. Our results suggest that submerged macrophyte-dominated shallow lakes with moderate nutrient conditions are vulnerable to perturbation by herbivorous fish such as grass carp. In turn, managing the abundance of herbivores in these lakes can support the dominance of macrophytes and associated clear water conditions.

AB  - Plants produce diverse chemical defenses with contrasting effects on different insect herbivores. Deploying herbivore-specific responses can help plants increase their defensive efficiency. Here, we explore how variation in induced plant responses correlates with herbivore species, order, feeding guild, and level of specialization. In a greenhouse experiment, we exposed 149 plants of Salix fragilis (Linnaeus, 1753) to 22 herbivore species naturally associated with this host. The insects belonged to four orders (Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera), three feeding guilds (external leaf-chewers, leaf-tying chewers, and sap-sucking), and included both dietary specialists and generalists. Following herbivory, we quantified induced changes in volatiles and nonvolatile leaf metabolites. We performed multivariate analyses to assess the correlation between herbivore order, feeding guild, dietary specialization, chewing damage by herbivores, and induced responses. The volatile composition was best explained by chewing damage and insect order, with Coleoptera and Lepidoptera eliciting significantly different responses. Furthermore, we recorded significant differences in elicited volatiles among some species within the two orders. Variation in nonvolatile leaf metabolites was mainly explained by the presence of insects, as plants exposed to herbivores showed significantly different metabolites from controls. Herbivore order also played a role to some extent, with beetles eliciting different responses than other herbivores. The induction of volatile and nonvolatile leaf metabolites shows different levels of specificity. The specificity in volatiles could potentially serve as an important cue to specialized predators or parasitoids, increasing the efficacy of volatiles as indirect defenses. By contrast, the induction of nonvolatile leaf metabolites was largely unaffected by herbivore identity. Most nonvolatile metabolites were downregulated, possibly indicating that plants redirected their resources from leaves in response to herbivory. Our results demonstrate how diverse responses to herbivores can contribute to the diversity of plant defensive strategies.

AB  - This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Fritillaria meleagris L. (Snake's Head Fritillary). The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of Britain and Ireland: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Fritillaria meleagris is a perennial spring bulb that grows in wet mesotrophic meadows and wet openings in woodlands. In Britain, it is localised to floodplain meadows but occurs as an intentional introduction in a range of habitats. There are several large populations on the floodplains of the River Thames and its tributaries in Wiltshire, Berkshire and Oxfordshire. Fritillaria meleagris occurs on mesotrophic alluvium soils often overlaying calcareous gravel with a relatively wide pH range. It favours a high ground water table during winter months and spring followed by good drainage of the soil throughout the summer. Fritillaria meleagris plants regularly experience prolonged dormancy. From 30% to 99% of plants in a population can remain below-ground for more than a year. Fritillaria meleagris produces nectar and is mainly pollinated in April by bumblebee queens in England. Other pollinators include insects of the orders Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, particularly bumblebees, hoverflies and butterflies. The release of the seeds from the pod in May-June can take a month. Seeds require warm and cold treatments for the embryo to fully form. Air pockets aid seed flotation on the surface of flood water for up to a month. The seeds of Fritillaria meleagris do not form a seed bank, germinating either during flotation or on bare ground. Fritillaria meleagris declined in Britain during the 20th century due to agricultural improvement and ploughing of floodplain grasslands. In all, 20 or so remaining populations survive in ancient hay meadows. Several of its British locations receive statutory protection as designated sites. However, recent work suggests that F. meleagris was probably introduced to Britain as an ornamental, and the level of protection it receives is therefore likely to change.

AB  - Simple Summary Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) is a species that is currently classified as endangered and found in China and Vietnam. In order to prevent their extinction, China initiated captive breeding programs in the 1950s. Maintaining the high genetic diversity of the population is a crucial factor for ensuring the sustainable and rapid growth of these captive populations. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) possesses a unique lineage of matrilineal evolution, and the control region (CR) is considered to be one of the most popular molecular markers for conducting a genetic diversity analysis and determining maternal lines. In this study, we assessed the current genetic diversity status of 338 individuals from seven captive forest musk deer populations located in the Shaanxi province using mtDNA CR, and the results showed that the genetic diversity was high. We also made full use of previous mtDNA CR data clearly defining 65 haplotypes with their frequency and concluded with about 90 maternal lines. The analysis revealed no significant genetic differentiation among the populations, and the populations might not have experienced rapid population expansion. The current study represents the most comprehensive research of genetic diversity of captive forest musk deer to date, and will be helpful to preserve and enhance the genetic diversity of the captive forest musk deer populations. Forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii) are endangered ruminants whose adult males secrete musk. China has been breeding forest musk deer artificially since the 1950s in an effort to restore wild populations, with Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces as the two main sites for captive breeding. Genetic diversity is a significant indicator that determines the long-term viability and status of a population, particularly for species at risk of extinction. In this study, we analyzed the current genetic makeup of seven captive forest musk deer populations in the Shaanxi province, using the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) as the molecular marker. We sequenced 604 bp of mtDNA CR, with an average content of A+T higher than G+C. We observed 111 variable sites and 39 different haplotypes from 338 sequences. The nucleotide diversity (Pi) and haplotype diversity (Hd) were 0.02887 and 0.908, respectively. Genetic differentiation between these populations was not significant, and the populations might not have experienced rapid growth. By combining our sequences with previous ones, we identified 65 unique haplotypes with 26 rare haplotypes and estimated a total of 90 haplotypes in Shaanxi province captive populations. The Shaanxi province and Sichuan province obtained 88 haplotypes, the haplotypes from the two populations were mixed together, and the two populations showed moderate genetic differentiation. Our findings suggested that captive forest musk deer populations in the Shaanxi province had high genetic diversity, with a rich founder population of about 90 maternal lines. Additionally, managers could develop genetic management plans for forest musk deer based on the haplotype database. Overall, our study will provide insights and guidelines for the conservation of genetic diversity in captive forest musk deer populations in the Shaanxi province.

AB  - Sharks are one of the most threatened marine animals, with fishing identified as the prime human activity responsible for population declines. The tropical eastern Pacific, a biogeographic region spanning the coastal areas from Mexico to Peru including the Colombian Pacific coast and the Galapagos archipelago, forms critical habitat and migratory routes for sharks and other marine megafauna. The Colombian government recently announced a total (blanket) ban on all forms of shark fishing in the country, including artisanal and industrial. Prohibiting shark fisheries in Colombia could drive fishing and trade under-ground, fueling criminality, and marginalization. This will not only undermine recent efforts of local communities and researchers to manage small-scale fisheries, but will criminalize a key source of income for a historically marginalized part of Colombian society. To be effective and ethical, this government decision needs to be rethought incorporating a more holistic management strategy consented among different stakeholder groups.

AB  - Developing successful conservation programs for genetically depleted species is challenging. Survival and adaptive potential are related to genetic and habitat factors; therefore, conservation programs are designed to minimize risks associated with inbreeding and loss of genetic diversity. The greater mouse-deer (Tragulus napu) is a true forest species that contributes to seed distribution dynamics in forests. However, with continuous demographic decline over the last century in the wild, only captive populations of the greater mouse-deer remain on the Thai mainland. A restoration program initiated 20 years ago has increased their population to more than 100 individuals but maintaining high genetic diversity in a small captive population is crucial for successful recovery. Microsatellite genotyping and mitochondrial D-loop and SRY gene sequence analyses were performed to examine the genetic diversity and population structure in 123 greater mouse-deer (64 females and 59 males). Highly reduced effective captive population size with trends of inbreeding were observed. No historical bottleneck was observed. These conditions have reduced their reproductive fitness and ability to adapt to environmental change, increasing the risk of population decline and eventual extinction. Demographic analyses suggested a recent captive population expansion due to effective animal welfare and reproduction. The results also suggested that population size at equilibrium is the main factor of allelic diversity (number of alleles). Large habitat carrying capacity, representing each fixed captive population size can support the genetic diversity of greater mouse-deer. We also identified suitable habitat areas for reintroduction and long-term in situ conservation of greater mouse-deer using maximum entropy modeling. Based on the environmental variables, species distribution modeling for greater mouse-deer indicated lowland tropical forest regions in the Khlong Saeng-Khao Sok forest complexes as most suitable and requiring urgent habitat improvement. These findings highlight the relevance of careful genetic monitoring and habitat suitability for the long-term conservation of greater mouse-deer and enhance the success of future conservation plans.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Mammalian hybrids frequently form in nature between closely related species, and the majority are sterile due to the production of chromosomally unbalanced gametes. In Italy, the widespread wild boar has had negative consequences for free-range pig farming, which is considered the best practice for pig welfare and is a common method of farming most autochthonous pig breeds. This study aimed to analyze the sperm DNA integrity, sperm meiotic segregation and nuclear spatial organization in a boar-pig hybrid, for the first time, to evaluate its fertilizing capacity. The results show that the hybrid presented a high frequency (64%) of motile spermatozoa with a regular chromosome composition and a specific spatial distribution. This study underlines how fertile boar-pig hybrids represent a growing problem for conserving autochthonous pig breeds.
   A wide range of mammalian hybrids has recently been found by chance or through population-screening programs, but studies about their fertilizing capacity remain scarce and incomplete. Most of them are assumed to be sterile due to meiotic arrest caused by the failure of chromosome pairings. In this study, we evaluated both sperm meiotic segregation, by 2D fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and sperm quality (Sperm Chromatin Structure Assay) by flow cytometer in a fertile boar-pig hybrid (2n = 37,XY) originating from a Nero Siciliano pig breed (Sus scrofa domesticus) and a wild boar (Sus scrofa ferus). Spermatozoa were also separated by a dual-layer (75-60%) discontinuous Percoll gradient, resulting in two fractions with a significantly better overall quality in the motile sperm fraction. These data were confirmed by FISH analysis also, where the frequencies of spermatozoa with a regular chromosome composition were 27% in total sperm fraction and 64% in motile sperm fraction. We also evaluated the nuclear architecture in all counted spermatozoa, showing a chromatin distribution changing when chromosome abnormalities occur. Our results demonstrate that the chromosome pairing has a minimal effect on the sperm segregation and semen quality of a boar-pig hybrid, making it fertile and harmful for the conservation of autochthonous pig breeds.

AB  - Landscape connectivity is critical to the long-term conservation of wildlife populations. Although anthropogenic linear infrastructures (ALI), including roads and canals, provide important resources to humans, they can affect wildlife through habitat fragmentation and reduced movement through landscapes. To increase landscape connectivity, crossing structures, including underpasses, can facilitate wildlife movement across landscapes experiencing ALI. However, little is known about how a suite of small- to medium-sized species use underpasses across seasonal and daily time periods, especially for some ALI such as major canals. We used specialized camera technology (i.e., the Hobbs Active Light Trigger [HALT] camera) to evaluate use of culvert underpass crossing structures (hereafter culverts) along the Central Arizona Project canal, Arizona, by a suite of mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates. Specifically, we evaluated (1) which wildlife species used culverts, (2) how the frequency of use varied across seasons (i.e., hot-dry, hot-wet, cool-wet) and (3) daily activity patterns of wildlife using culverts. We detected 31 species of wildlife using culverts, which included small- to medium-sized mammals (56.4% of crossings), reptiles (21.0% of crossings), amphibians (19.0% of crossings), and invertebrates (3.6% of crossings), including some species of conservation concern, such as the Sonoran Desert tortoise (Gopherus morafkai) and Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum). However, crossings by larger mammal species were less effectively detected with the HALT cameras. Reptile crossing frequency was similar between the 2 seasons that they were active during the hot-dry (May-June) and hot-wet (July-October) seasons and crossing frequency by some species of amphibians and invertebrates was higher in the hot-wet season. Throughout the entire year, small mammals used culverts more frequently in hot seasons (i.e., hot-wet and hot-dry) compared to the cool-wet (November-March) season. In addition, daily activity patterns varied by species, where species crossed culverts during diurnal (e.g., desert spiny lizards, Sceloporus magister and coachwhip snakes, Masticophis flagellum), crepuscular (e.g., cottontail rabbits, Sylvilagus audubonii and western diamondback rattlesnakes, Crotalus atrox), and nocturnal (e.g., deer mouse species, heteromyid species, woodrat species, desert stink beetle species) time periods. Our information can be used to manage wildlife crossing areas and increase landscape connectivity in relation to ALI.

AB  - Gastrointestinal parasites (GIPs) pose a significant threat to wildlife health and biodiversity, impacting reproductive activities, behavior, survival, and population dynamics. Identifying parasitic infections in wild animals can help to mitigate extinction risk and support conservation efforts. This study investigates the prevalence, diversity, and zoonotic risks of GIPs in six large wild mammals in Chitwan National Park, Nepal. Fresh fecal samples were collected between December 2022 and April 2023 and examined using direct wet mount and concentration methods. By analyzing 63 fecal samples: Royal Bengal Tiger ( Panthera tigris) (n = 7), Asian elephant ( Elephus maximus) (n = 9), One-horned rhinoceros ( Rhinoceros unicornis) (n = 10), Sloth bear ( Melursus ursinus) (n = 9), Spotted deer ( Axis axis) (n = 25), and Rhesus Monkey ( Macaca mullata) (n = 3), we identified 19 GIP types: 3 protozoan species ( Balantioides coli, Isospora spp., and coccidia) and 16 helminth species, revealing an 85.7% infection rate. Helminths had a higher prevalence (85.7%) than protozoans (22%). Among helminths, nematodes were the most prevalent (69.8%) followed by trematodes (38.0%) and cestodes (17.4%). Eleven types of nematodes, three types of cestodes, and two types of trematodes were recorded. Multiple infections were more common than single infections. The high prevalence of GIPs indicates a major health issue that could affect species survival and conservation efforts in Chitwan National Park, highlighting the need for proactive conservation and health monitoring strategies for conservation.

AB  - Relationships among species in the tree of life can complicate comparative methods and testing adaptive hypotheses. Models based on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process permit hypotheses about adaptation to be tested by allowing traits to either evolve toward fixed adaptive optima (e.g., regimes or niches) or track continuously changing optima that can be influenced by other traits. These models allow estimation of the effects of both adaptation and phylogenetic inertia-resistance to adaptation due to any source-on trait evolution, an approach known as the "adaptation-inertia" framework. However, previous applications of this framework, and most approaches suggested to deal with the issue of species non-independence, are based on a maximum likelihood approach, and thus it is difficult to include information based on prior biological knowledge in the analysis, which can affect resulting inferences. Here, I present Blouch, (Bayesian Linear Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Models for Comparative Hypotheses), which fits allometric and adaptive models of continuous trait evolution in a Bayesian framework based on fixed or continuous predictors and incorporates measurement error. I first briefly discuss the models implemented in Blouch, and then the new applications for these models provided by a Bayesian framework. This includes the advantages of assigning biologically meaningful priors when compared to non-Bayesian approaches, allowing for varying effects (intercepts and slopes), and multilevel modeling. Validations on simulated data show good performance in recovering the true evolutionary parameters for all models. To demonstrate the workflow of Blouch on an empirical dataset, I test the hypothesis that the relatively larger antlers of larger-bodied deer are the result of more intense sexual selection that comes along with their tendency to live in larger breeding groups. While results show that larger-bodied deer that live in larger breeding groups have relatively larger antlers, deer living in the smallest groups appear to have a different and steeper scaling pattern of antler size to body size than other groups. These results are contrary to previous findings and may argue that a different type of sexual selection or other selective pressures govern optimum antler size in the smallest breeding groups.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of pig manure-derived sulfadiazine (SDZ) on the species distribution and bioactivities of ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and complete ammonia oxidizer (comammox) within the soil were investigated pre- and post-fertilization. Kinetic modeling and linear regression results demonstrated that the DT50 value of different SDZ fractions under initial SDZ concentrations of 50 and 100 mg center dot kg- 1 exhibited the following trend: total SDZ CaCl2-extractable SDZ>MeOH-extractable SDZ, whereas their inhibiting effect on AOMs showed an opposite trend. qPCR analysis suggested that comammox was the predominant ammonia oxidizer in soils regardless of SDZ addition, accounting for as much as 77.2-94.7% of the total amoA, followed by AOA (5.3-22.5%), whereas AOB (<0.5%) was the lowest. The SDZ exhibited a significant effect on the AOM abundance. Specifically, SDZ exerted the highest inhibitory effect on comammox growth, followed by AOA, whereas negligible for AOB. The community diversity of AOMs within the pig manure-fertilized soils was affected by SDZ, and AOA Nitrososphaera cluster 3 played a key role in potential ammonia oxidation capacity (PAO) maintenance. This study provides new insights into the inhibition mechanisms of pig manure-derived antibiotics on AOMs within the fertilized soil.

AB  - In this paper, measurements of 2.012 bone remains from four different domestic species (sheep, goats, cattle and pigs) originating from 33 Bronze Age archaeological sites from the Balearic Islands, mainland Iberia, southern France and Sardinia, and spanning about 2500 years (3700-700 cal. BCE) have been compared. The results show that a decrease in animal size occurred in the Balearic Islands during the Bronze Age. It was not a local phenomenon but rather was a general pattern that happened in different territories. Yet it was more marked on the islands. The evidence shows that the four analyzed species were not affected in the same way and it was a nonlinear phenomenon. Indeed, during the Late Bronze Age some archaeological sites from the Balearics had taller caprines compared with the other contemporaneous places, also on the continent. A multi-factor explanation for these fluctuations is proposed in this paper, showing that animal sizes generally decreased during late prehistory -especially cattle- and this process could reflect different factors such as a combination of limited feeding, increased human pressure and endogamy.

AB  - Bycatch of depleted and vulnerable species is a pressing conservation issue that undermines the sustainability of fisheries worldwide. Here, we utilised spatiotemporal modelling of fisheries-independent survey data to evaluate the potential for existing and proposed Marine Conservation Areas (MCAs) in Atlantic Canada to reduce bycatch vulnerability for three severely depleted species--Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), and white hake (Urophycis tenuis)-- commonly caught as bycatch in commercial trawl fisheries on the Scotian Shelf-Bay of Fundy. We overlaid predicted distributions of abundance for these depleted species with those of commercially targeted haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and pollock (Pollachius virens) to identify areas of high-vulnerability. Our analysis showed that a fully implemented MCA network would overlap with an average of 16% of high-vulnerability area for individual species and 20% when combined as a single group, an increase of 9% and 13%, respectively, from existing MCAs. This approach can be used more generally by employing readily available survey data to optimise both fisheries management and biodiversity objectives in marine conservation planning.

AB  - Bog asphodel, Narthecium ossifragum, is a flowering plant, commonly found in many wet acidic habitats, including upland blanket bogs where sheep and cattle grazing has been considered as the most feasible economic activity. It can be fatally toxic, especially to lambs, so there is concern that re-establishing blanket bog habitat will increase the distribution and abundance of bog asphodel and thus further threaten the marginal livelihoods of upland livestock farmers. (1) Analysis of vegetation survey data collected pre- and post-restoration from 43 restored shallow peatland sites on Exmoor, an upland area on the northern coast of the UK???s southwestern peninsula, showed only a small (4 %) increase in spatial distribution following restoration (rewetting). No increase in bog asphodel abundance was seen at six sites for which pre- and post-restoration percentage cover data were available. Moreover, bog asphodel did not appear post-restoration at any of the 21 sites (48 %) where it had not been recorded pre-restoration. (2) A separate detailed study at one site demonstrated typical bog asphodel phenology and a life history strategy of growing and reproducing very slowly but persisting despite cold, wet and acidic conditions. Therefore, bog asphodel is ecologically unlikely to respond within a decade to any major change in its environment, such as rewetting of the peat. However, bog asphodel on Exmoor does show significant variability in size and in the proportion of plants that flower year on year. (3) While the mechanisms by which bog asphodel exerts its toxic effect when ingested by ruminants have yet to be fully elucidated, the inconsistent pattern of toxicity seen in other parts of the UK and in northern Europe, where bog asphodel poisoning is reported to be a serious economic problem, may be driven by the influence of environmental factors on bog asphodel growth.

AB  - Compounds in sunscreen such as ultraviolet (UV) filters protect human skin from damage caused by UV radiation exposure. However, sunscreen components reach marine ecosystems after their release from human skin during activities such as swimming and washing, and are potentially toxic to marine organisms. TiO2 and ZnO nano -particles (NPs) are commonly used as inorganic UV filters. In this study, we explored the effects of TiO2 and ZnO NPs on natural phytoplankton assemblages in coastal seawater. Growth rates of natural phytoplankton assem-blages were significantly decreased by 10 mg L-1 TiO2 and 1 and 10 mg L-1 ZnO NP treatments. NP addition also modified the size structure of phytoplankton assemblages, and small phytoplankton (mainly cyanobacteria) are vulnerable to NPs. Because herbivore food preferences depend strongly on algal cell size, NP contamination could also affect higher trophic levels. Notably, small phytoplankton are an important component in microbial loop, and this energy transfer pathway may be more vulnerable to NP contamination.

AB  - An emerging research program on population and geographic range dynamics of Australia's mammals illustrates an approach to better understand and respond to geographic range collapses of threatened wildlife in general. In 1788, Europeans colonized an Australia with a diverse and largely endemic mammal fauna, where many species that are now extinct or threatened were common and widespread. Subsequent population declines, range collapses and extinctions were caused by introduced predators and herbivores, altered land use, modified fire regimes and the synergies between these threats. Declines in population and range size continue for many Australian mammals despite legislative protection and conservation interventions. Here, we propose an approach that integrates museum data and other historical records into process-explicit macroecological models to better resolve mammal distributions and abundances as they were at European arrival. We then illustrate how this integrative approach can identify the likely synergistic mechanisms causing mammal population declines across these and other landscapes. This emerging research approach, undertaken with fine temporal and spatial resolution, but at large geographic scales, will provide valuable insights into the different pathways to, and drivers of, extinction. Such insights may, in turn, underpin conservation strategies based on a process-explicit understanding of population decline and range collapse under alternative scenarios of impending climate and environmental change. Given that similar information is available for other regional biotas, the approach we describe here can be adapted to conserve threatened wildlife in other regions across the globe.

AB  - Food quality and availability, when combined with energetic demands in seasonal environments, shape resource acquisition and allocation by animals and hold consequences for life-history strategies. In long-lived species with extensive maternal care, regulation of somatic reserves of energy and protein can occur in a risk-sensitive manner, wherein resources are preferentially allocated to support survival at the cost of investment in reproduction. We investigated how Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), an alpine mammal in a highly seasonal environment, allocates somatic reserves across seasons. In accordance with the hypothesis of risk-sensitive resource allocation, we expected accretion and catabolism of somatic reserves to be regulated relative to preseason nutritional state, reproductive state, and variation among populations in accordance with local environmental conditions. To test that hypothesis, we monitored seasonal changes in percent ingesta-free body fat (IFBFat) and ingesta-free, fat-free body mass (IFFFBMass) in three populations of bighorn sheep in northwest Wyoming between 2015 and 2019 through repeated captures of female sheep in December and March of each year in a longitudinal study design. Regulation of somatic reserves was risk-sensitive and varied relative to the amount of somatic reserves an animal had at the beginning of the season. Regulation of fat reserves was sensitive to reproductive state and differed by population, particularly over the summer. In one population with low rates of recruitment of young, sheep that recruited offspring lost fat over the summer in contrast to the other two populations where sheep that recruited gained fat. And yet, all populations exhibited similar changes in fat catabolism and risk sensitivity over winter. The magnitude of body fat and mass change across seasons may be indicative of sufficiency of seasonal ranges to meet energetic demands of survival and reproduction. Risk-sensitive allocation of resources was pervasive, suggesting nutritional underpinnings are foundational to behavior, vital rates, and, ultimately, population dynamics. For species living in alpine environments, risk-sensitive resource allocation may be essential to balance investment in reproduction with ensuring survival.

AB  - 1. Chemical signals are crucial in mediating ecological and evolutionary adaptation of plants to their environments. Indeed, invasive plants may produce greater amounts of chemical metabolites in their new ranges. Some of these chemicals can enhance their mutualistic interactions and improve invasive plant performance, but genetic mechanisms of such adaptations are unexplored. 2. We used Triadica sebifera plants as a model to investigate evolutionary changes in chemical signals that enhance arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal associations. Previous studies found that T. sebifera plants from invasive populations had higher root exudate concentrations of the flavonoid quercetin and elevated AM fungal colonization compared with those from native populations. Here, we explored genetic variation in strigolactone concentrations in root exudates and their contribution to AM fungal colonization with strigolactone analogue GR24 additions. In addition, we studied how gene expression patterns related to flavonoid and strigolactone biosynthesis varied among invasive and native populations using comparative genomics, transcriptomics and fluorescent real-time quantitative PCR. 3. We found that plants from invasive populations had higher concentrations of the strigolactone 5-deoxystrigol in root exudates that were correlated with higher AM fungal colonization rates, relative to those from native populations. Exogenous applications of GR24, a synthetic analogue of 5-deoxystrigol, increased AM fungal colonization. We found higher expression of a single gene in flavonoid (FLS) and strigolactone (DAD1) biosynthesis pathways increased levels of quercetin and 5-deoxystrigol in plants from invasive populations, respectively. 4. Synthesis. Understanding the role of genetic evolution in enhancing mutualisms of invasive plants provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of plant invasion. This study suggests that an invasive plant enhanced its mutualisms by upregulating the expression of key genes related to secondary metabolites in root exudates which stimulate symbiotic relationships with AM fungi. Thus, these findings provide insights into genetic mechanisms that underlie higher AM fungal colonization and enhanced invasive plant performance.

AB  - Leaf resource allocation plays a significant role in the evolution of plant functional strategies, where tradeoffs between defense, structure, and different components of photosynthesis drive the partitioning of carbon and nitrogen. One hypothesized but underexplored mechanism of the success of many invasive species in competition with natives is reallocation of resources toward higher photosynthetic capacity, assuming they experience reduced pest consumption in their invaded ('away') range. We examined leaf function and chemistry in the context of carbon and nitrogen (N) budgets in home- (Japan) and away-range (France and USA) populations of the global invader, Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica (Houtt.) var. japonica). In 38 field populations, we measured photosynthetic CO2 (A-Ci) response curves and quantified the proportion of leaf N allocated to separate photosynthetic processes, including carboxylation (Rubisco content), light harvesting, and the electron transport chain, plus the amount of N allocated to cell structure (cell wall protein) and defense (total alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found significantly higher leaf N allocation to photosynthesis in both away range populations, particularly Rubisco content, along with higher total leaf N in USA populations. However, neither maximum carboxylation capacity nor light-saturated photosynthetic rates were greater in the away ranges, nor did we find reduced allocation to leaf structure (cell wall protein). Further, USA populations had significantly greater concentrations of defensive cyanogenic glycosides, where some native-range herbivores have unintentionally been introduced. Our study suggests that away-range changes in invader leaf function may be more complex than a simple expectation based on photosynthetic capacity.

AB  - Various direct and indirect environmental constraints have an impact on livestock performance. The physiological parameters, such as rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, are the primary indicators of thermal stress. Under a stressed environment temperature humidity index (THI) had established as a vital measurement to identify the thermal stress in livestock. THI in association with climatic variations can define the environmental effect as stressful or comfortable for livestock. Goats are small ruminants that adapt to a wide range of ecological variations due to their anatomical and physiological characteristics. However, the productivity of animals declines at the individual level during thermal stress. Stress tolerance can be determined through genetic studies associated with at the cellular level using physiological as well as molecular approaches. Information on genetic association with thermal stress in goats is scanty, this severely affects their survival and hence productivity of livestock. The ever-increasing demand for food across the globe needs deciphering novel molecular markers as well as stress indicators that play a vital role in livestock improvement. This review represents an analysis of current knowledge of phenotypic differences during thermal stress and signifies the importance of physiological responses and their association at the cellular level in goats. The regulation of vital genes associated with thermal stress such as Aquaporins (AQP 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8), aquaglyceroporins (AQP3, 7, 9, and 10) and super-aquaporins (AQP 11, 12); BAX inhibitors such as PERK (PKR like ER kinase), IRE 1(inositolrequiring-1); Redox regulating genes such as NOX; Transport of Na+ and K+ such as ATPase (ATP1A1) and several heat shock proteins have been implicated in heat-stress related adaptations have been elucidated. As these changes have a significant impact on production performance as well as on livestock productivity. Such efforts may help in the development of molecular markers and will assist the breeders to develop heat-tolerant goats with improved productivity.

AB  - Natural corridors are essential components of wildlife conservation but, when human-wildlife conflicts emerge, the participation of local communities becomes imperative to ensure their efficacy and long-term persistence. Therefore, local people initiatives and commitments (community-based strategies) promoting human-wildlife coexistence are urgently needed especially in African natural corridors dominated by elephants (Loxodonta africana). Wildlife rangers represent skilled technical staff who are involved in the monitoring and protection of wildlife but also in promoting human-wildlife coexistence and community awareness. They are the closest conservation staff to local communities and have broad experience in dealing with elephants around the villages. Therefore, collecting and recognizing the knowledge of wildlife rangers on the suitability of possible local solutions could contribute to the successful planning and implementation of human elephant mitigation measures at farmer level. This study aims to quantify wildlife rangers' preferences for community-based strategies to increase human-elephant coexistence in the Selous-Niassa Wildlife Corridor (Southern Tanzania). In particular, we evaluated wildlife rangers' preferences regarding three attributes: local farm-based mitigation measures, the implication of technical support in the implementation of those measures and the preferred level of cooperation in the local community for that implementation. In 2019, we conducted a discrete choice experiment by interviewing 63 wildlife rangers (41% of the total rangers working along the corridor). Results showed that the most preferred management strategy included building chili-oil fences by farmers cooperating at community level and technically supported by external institutions. Other strategies considered were (in decreasing order of importance) crop species selection, beehive fences, crop translocation, cooperation in small groups, and the use of noisemakers. The discrete choice analysis of wildlife rangers' preferences, including the type and level of cooperation, allows quantifying the suitability of different management strategies for mitigating human-wildlife coexistence challenges.

AB  - This case report presents a chronic abomasal sand impaction in a white-tailed deer in Florida. Abomasal impaction in ruminants can result from a low-quality diet or abnormal eating behavior. The farmer reported significant weight loss, abdominal enlargement, and general weakness in the deer. Post-mortem examination revealed a low body condition score, dehydration, and abdominal enlargement. Internal inspection identified pneumonia lesions in the left cranial lung lobe, which microbiological tests attributed to Trueperella pyogenes. Notable ruminal bloating was observed, characterized by gas accumulation. The abomasum was palpably firm and enlarged, predominantly filled with sand, except for a small ventral portion, with an estimated sand weight of approximately 5 kg. Although chronic sand impaction was suggested as the cause of death, it is posited that chronic sand-induced damage to the abomasal mucosal layer led to active subacute abomasitis, which compromised the animal's immune system and predisposed it to secondary infections. The University of Florida's Cervidae Health Research Initiative (CHeRI) conducted a post-mortem examination of a two-year-old white-tailed doe deceased at a northern Florida white-tailed deer farm. The carcass of the deer had notable emaciation and bloating. Upon opening of the carcass, there was pneumonia and the rumen was tympanic and enlarged. Additionally, the abomasum was distended and contained approximately 5 kg of sand. It is not uncommon for white-tailed deer to engage in geophagia (eating soil or sand), which typically does not result in diseases or fatalities. However, in this animal, we suspect a chronic process that created a physical barrier, hindering nutrient absorption and resulting in physical irritation of the abomasal mucosa with subsequent inflammation. This may have caused a disturbance in immune system function, allowing opportunistic bacteria to colonize and invade other organs, such as the lungs, contributing to the animal's death.

AB  - The whole population of Feutap still collects drinking water from two protected springs, some 1 km away from this small rural agglomeration. For many generations, the only improvement has been the protection of the springs during the 1980s. The resulting high incidence of gastrointestinal infections continues to hinder the socioeconomic development of this mountain community. This dynamic wherein "poverty begets disease, and disease begets poverty" seems endless given the number of water improvement programs and other health-focused campaigns in rural areas of Cameroon since the 1960s. Fortunately, the hydrographic regime of Feutap and its geographical situation enable the implementation of the Kilimanjaro Concept (KC), wherein rainwater is quantitatively harvested, partly infiltrated, and largely stored to (i) meet the whole-year water needs of the population, (ii) create new ecosystems, and (iii) enable irrigated agriculture. This communication prepares the implementation of the KC in Feutap, including the creation of irrigation ponds for agriculture and small farm animals (e.g., goats and sheep). The view is promoted that Feutap is a potential viable space in which life and work are possible, using the existing rainfall and the few natural springs in a sustainable manner. The presented concept can be extended to other hilly small communities with similar hydraulic regimes.

AB  - Ecological theory hypothesizes that plant trait diversity may be as important as the presence of specific functional traits (e.g., resistance) for the herbivore and predator communities within a population. We used experimental populations of wild woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca) to test whether the degree of plant genotypic diversity and/or the existence of specific resistance traits play a role in the host plant's community structure specifically, the community of generalist and specialist aphids and their natural enemies. In 2019, we studied the aphid abundance and relative predator abundance in an experimental field site in Alnarp, Southern Sweden; the field consisted of plots planted with combinations of 20 different wild strawberry genotypes. These strawberry genotypes were previously identified as either susceptible to or resistant against the herbivorous beetle (Galerucella tenella). Two aphid species, Chaetosiphon fragaefolii (specialist) and the exotic Aphis gossypii (generalist) were found in the plots and of the two species A. gossypii was dominant. The abundance of the specialist aphid (C. fragaefolii) was highest in susceptible plots with high genotypic diversity, while the generalist (A. gossypii) was highest in plots with a mix of resistant and susceptible plants with high genotypic diversity. Anthocorid predators, developed significantly higher population densities in strawberry plots with high genotypic diversity. Overall, predator abundance showed a positive correlation with aphid abundance. These results show that the specific functional trait of resistance as well as plant diversity affected aphids. Knowledge about these effects can be important factors to consider when designing strawberry plantings less susceptible to aphids.

AB  - Single-locus molecular delimitation plays a key role in meeting the need to expedite the exploration and description of the species on our planet. Multiple methods have been developed to aid data interpretation over the past 20 years, but species delimitation remains difficult due to their varying performance. In this study, we examine the accuracy of five widely used delimitation methods (i.e. BIN, ABGD, ASAP, GMYC and mPTP) in analysing 63 empirical data sets that included 1850 mitochondrial COI sequences derived from eriophyoid mites assigned to 456 morphospecies. Our results establish that all five methods resolve approximately 90% of morphospecies. We investigated some factors which might affect the species delimitation results, that is taxonomic rank, number of haplotypes per species, mean number of host plants per species, and geographical distance among sampling sites. We found complex interactions between these factors which affected delimitation effectiveness. An increase in haplotype number negatively affected delimitation accuracy, while increased geographical distance improved delimitation accuracy. BIN was influenced by the number of host plants per species as cryptic speciation linked to host plant usage might be prevalent in eriophyoid mites, while ABGD was not significantly impacted by other factors. Our results highlight multiple factors that affect molecular species delimitation and underline the value of employing multiple analytical approaches to aid species delimitation.

AB  - In mammals, Clusterin (Clu) is a pleiotropic glycoprotein associated with various physiological and pathological functions, and plays significant roles in innate immunity. However, immune function of Clu in teleost is essentially unknown. In this study, we studied the complement activation and antibacterial functions of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) Clu (PoClu). PoClu contains two conserved CL & alpha; and CL & beta; domains, and shares 30.46%-70.28% sequence identities with other Clu. We found that PoClu expression occurred in various tissues and regulated by bacterial stimulation. Recombinant PoClu (rPoClu) bound both gram-positive and -negative bacteria and sheep red blood cell, but failed to affect bacterial growth in vitro. rPoClu could significantly suppress the bactericidal and hemolysis activity of Japanese flounder serum. Consistently, the bactericidal and hemolysis activity of fish serum were enhanced by anti-rPoClu antibody, further confirmed the negative role of PoClu in complement activity. Furthermore, In vivo rPoClu also exhibited the negative role in host against bacterial dissemination. In conclusion, our results provide the first evidence to unveil that teleost Clu could play a negative role in complement activation and host against bacterial infection.

AB  - Macroinvertebrates and small fishes can both be important predators of zooplankton in littoral zones of shallow lakes. The aim of this study is to analyze how these predators may interact to affect zooplankton, algal biomass, and water turbidity. We performed a 15-day mesocosms experiment in 12 tanks (1300 l) simulating a littoral zone. A 2 x 2 factorial experiment was designed as follows: (1) Control without predators, (2) 7 nymphs of Anisoptera, (3) 2 visual zooplanktivorous fish and (4) 7 Anisoptera and 2 fishes. Results showed significant effects of fish on the abundance of Cladocera and its concentration among the macrophyte zone. On the other hand, we found no effects of Anisoptera on zooplankton abundance or distribution. No significant interaction between the predator effects was found on most response variables. Water turbidity increased only in the treatments with fish. Macrophytes offer a refuge for zooplankton to fish predation, but antagonist interactions appear when both predators were present, and the shelter effect of vegetated patches to the main herbivores against fish predation was less important when Anisoptera was present. The macroinvertebrate fauna of the littoral zone should be carefully considered in the restoration plans of shallow eutrophic lakes.

AB  - Teeth root morphology and integrity are essential to provide appropriate attachment, allowing for continuous and functional movement, with implications for adequate food processing, animal performance, and longevity. We studied the occurrence of supernumerary roots in mandibular molariform teeth of red deer (Cervus elaphus Linnaeus, 1758) from seven separate populations spanning a range of latitudes in the Iberian Peninsula. We analyzed the influence of several factors, including sex, origin (native vs. reintroduced), lineage, and habitat, to assess extra root prevalence variations. The highest prevalence in deciduous teeth was found in pm(3) (14%) and in permanent teeth in M1 (3%). We found significant differences between areas, lineages, and soil type; however, no significant relationships were found with the origin or the sex of individuals. We speculate that the high prevalence of supernumerary roots in M1 might be related to increased wear in grazers. Furthermore, we suggest that this high prevalence in deciduous teeth might be associated with a hard diet, dry climatic conditions, and a harsh weaning period, which indicate that supernumerary roots might have an adaptive value.

AB  - In areas of high human-elephant conflict, cultivating crops that are less attractive to elephants can be a viable strategy for coexistence. Farmers in these regions often grow crops like pineapple, which are palatable to elephants and attract them into human-dominated landscapes. This study, conducted in Ruam Thai Village, adjacent to Kuiburi National Park in Thailand, evaluated the socio-economic factors affecting farmers' interest in alternative crop cultivation and assessed the impact of elephants and environmental threats on plots containing pineapple and alternative crops. Our findings revealed that 70% of households (N = 239) rely on pineapple cultivation as their primary source of income. However, 49% of interviewed pineapple farmers reported that their cultivation was not profitable, largely owing to the high costs of agro-chemical inputs. The majority (91%) of farmers experienced negative consequences from living near wild elephants, and 50% expressed interest in cultivating alternative crops. Farmers who frequently experienced elephant visits, felt they could coexist with elephants, and perceived both positive and negative consequences from them were more likely to be interested in alternative crop cultivation. Elephants eliminated over 80% of the pineapple but less than 6% of any alternative crop species across all test plots. Using a crop scoring system based on ecological, economic, and social factors, we identified lemongrass and citronella as the most suitable alternative crop species for the study site. This multidisciplinary study highlights interventions needed to reduce barriers and increase motivators for local farmers to adopt elephant-friendly agriculture as a sustainable human-elephant coexistence strategy.

AB  - Phenotypic variation among individuals scales up when they associate with others, creating variation within and among groups that can shape group-level outcomes such as when and where groups move. While sociality is thought to be a fitness-rewarding behaviour, empirical evidence supporting how it influences individual behaviour and the resulting fitness consequences (e.g. risk experienced) remains limited, especially in the context of human-modified landscapes. Here, we use empirical observations to test whether sociality helps animals cross busy roads. Our data came from free-ranging elk in a population where >75% of the adults were tracked, and in which group size and composition were highly variable. We combined field observations with GPS collar data to quantify four social phenotypes of individuals and groups: dominance (initiation of successful agonistic interactions), social connectedness (number and importance of social connections), social familiarity (frequency of association with group members in the past) and social stability (time since fusion with group members). We then investigated how these four social phenotypes influenced an individual's probability of crossing a major highway and tested if particular social phenotypes made better road crossing decisions (i.e. crossed at lower traffic volume). We found that who is in a group shapes the behaviour of group members around anthropogenic risks. Individuals in groups that were more dominant, more connected, and, to a lesser extent, more familiar had a lower probability of crossing the highway. Individuals that had spent more time with group members had a higher probability of crossing the highway. Importantly, our results suggest that sociality plays a role in safe movements around anthropogenic risks. Individuals in highly connected and familiar groups were less likely to cross the highway at high traffic volumes. Our work provides empirical evidence that sociality influences the movements of group-living individuals through anthropogenic disturbances and helps individuals mitigate the risks associated with such disturbances. Developing a comprehensive understanding of animal sociality in human-modified landscapes is especially important as social behaviours are simultaneously threatened by human disturbances, which could be particularly detrimental for group-living species if those same behaviours help individuals mitigate risks.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in small ruminants in Austria by testing 22,019 serum samples with ELISA for the presence of specific antibodies. Furthermore, detailed investigations in five MAP-infected goat herds were carried out by ELISA, qPCR and bacterial culture. The found animal-level apparent MAP seroprevalence was 2.0% for goats and 0.7% for sheep (calculated true prevalence 3.5% and 1.2%, respectively). Herd-level apparent MAP seroprevalence was 11.1% for goat herds and 8.9% for sheep flocks. Significant risk factors for seropositivity in goat herds were: herd size, animal trading, farmed as a dairy herd, Animal Health Service membership and cohabitation with farmed game. For sheep flocks, seroprevalence was significantly higher in flocks with animal trading and where cattle or goats were kept in the flock, respectively. The overall apparent within-herd MAP seroprevalence in the five goat farms investigated was 21.8% (11.7%-28.0%, calculated true seroprevalence 38.6%) and an overall rate of MAP shedding of 12.3% was detected (5.0%-24.7%). It was possible to identify MAP by culture using boot swab samples in each herd. The results indicated a moderate MAP infection rate in small ruminants in Austria.

AB  - Key messageThe strategies of net carbon gain and defense/storage are evidenced to be complementary for the shade tolerance of seedlings of an emergent tropical tree.AbstractCariniana legalis is one of the largest endemic tree species in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. From two independent experiments we investigated the influence of nine leaf traits and leaf damage on the growth and whole-plant carbon gain of C. legalis seedlings in a wide gradient of light availability. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) At leaf scale, C. legalis seedlings are able to simultaneously maximize net carbon gain and maintain characteristics associated to defense/storage strategy under dense shade conditions. (b) At a whole-plant scale, leaf damage by simulated herbivory affects the ratio between carbon gain by leaves and carbon loss by stems and roots, altering the minimum thresholds of light to shade tolerance of C. legalis seedlings. All seedlings had positive relative growth rates (RGR) in low daily light integral (DLI), i.e. from 0.6 mol photons m-2 day-1. Our first hypothesis was partially accepted, as the highest plasticity values for light compensation point (LCP) and dark respiration rate (Rd) indicated that the net carbon gain under low light is related to a decrease in leaf metabolism and carbon loss. Additionally, the high values of leaf mass per area (LMA) and the low individual leaf area (ILA) can be important survival mechanisms for C. legalis seedlings under dense shade conditions. Our second hypothesis was accepted, as the whole-plant light compensation point (WPLCP) was significantly higher in seedlings with simulated herbivory compared to control. Leaf damage can affect the minimum thresholds of light for shade tolerance of C. legalis seedlings.

AB  - Diet composition modulates animals' ability to resist parasites and recover from stress. Broader diet breadths enable omnivores to mount dynamic responses to parasite attack, but little is known about how plant/prey mixing might influence responses to infection.Using omnivorous deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a model, we examine how varying plant and prey concentrations in blended diets influence resistance and body condition following infestation by Rocky Mountain wood ticks (Dermacentor andersoni).In two repeated experiments, deer mice fed for 4 weeks on controlled diets that varied in proportions of seeds and insects were then challenged with 50 tick larvae in two sequential infestations.The numbers of ticks successfully feeding on mice declined by 25% and 66% after the first infestation (in the first and second experiments, respectively), reflecting a pattern of acquired resistance, and resistance was strongest when plant/prey ratios were more equally balanced in mouse diets, relative to seed-dominated diets.Diet also dramatically impacted the capacity of mice to cope with tick infestations. Mice fed insect-rich diets lost 15% of their body weight when parasitized by ticks, while mice fed seed-rich diets lost no weight at all.While mounting/maintaining an immune response may be energetically demanding, mice may compensate for parasitism with fat and carbohydrate-rich diets.Altogether, these results suggest that a diverse nutritional landscape may be key in enabling omnivores' resistance and resilience to infection and immune stressors in their environments.

AB  - Symbiosis plays a critical role in plant biology. Temperate grasses often associate with several symbiotic fungi simultaneously, including Epichlo & euml; endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, in shoots and roots, respectively. These symbionts often modulate plant-herbivore interactions by influencing nutritional traits (i.e. AM fungi-mediated nutrient uptake) and/or the secondary chemistry (i.e. endophytic alkaloids) of their host plant. Moreover, such grasses also accumulate large amounts of silicon (Si) from the soil, which can be deposited in tissues to act as a physical anti-herbivore defence. Recent evidence suggests that both endophytes and AM fungi independently facilitate Si uptake. However, the consequences of their interactions with piercing-sucking insects (i.e. aphids), or whether Si supply, endophytes, and AM fungi interact in this regard, are currently unknown. While Si deposition may be less effective against aphids than other herbivores (i.e. chewing caterpillars), Si supply can also alter plant secondary metabolite defences, which could affect sucking insects. In a factorial greenhouse experiment, we evaluated whether these components, acting alone or in combination, altered (1) foliar primary chemistry, (2) Si and symbiont-chemical (endophytic alkaloids) defences, as well as (3) performance of the bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) feeding on tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). Endophytes decreased all aphid performance parameters, including population growth and reproduction by 40%, but their impact was reversed by the presence of AM fungi, leading to a 52% increase in aphid performance compared with plants solely hosting endophytes. This improvement in performance was associated with reduced loline alkaloid levels and higher shoot nitrogen in AM-endophytic plants. Endophytes and AM fungi exhibited antagonism, with endophytes reducing AM colonization by 34% and AM presence decreasing endophyte loline alkaloids by 44%. While both fungi jointly increased Si accumulation by 39% under Si-supplied conditions, Si had no noticeable effects on aphids. Moreover, although Si supply had no identifiable effects on AM colonization, it reduced endophyte peramine alkaloids by 24%. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that symbiotic fungal partnerships and silicon provision may benefit plants but could weaken anti-herbivore defences when combined. Revealing the complex interactions among diverse fungal symbionts and showcasing their effects on different anti-herbivore defences (chemical and physical) and herbivore performance for the first time.

AB  - Background Land use intensification may affect diversity, abundance, and functional morphological traits (FMT) related to dispersal, food acquisition, digestion, and nesting in some insects, possibly impacting their ecological role. Most studies of termites on the effects of afforestation focus on diversity and abundance, but changes in FMT have yet to be studied.Aim To better understand the response mechanisms to land use intensification, we compared the FMT of the worker and soldier caste of Heterotermes tenuis among Pinus caribaea plantations of four different ages and gallery forests of the Colombian Orinoquia.MethodologyWe measured thirty-eight FMTs in the worker and soldier castes of H. tenuis from gallery forests and pine plantations. Then, we used a Community-Weighted Mean (CWM), a PERMANOVA, and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to estimate the possible effect of land use type on the FMT of both castes. We selected the FMTs with the lowest intraspecific coefficient of variation (CV) from each caste to compare their size among the land use types and pine plantation ages.Results Land use type had a more significant impact on the FMT size of pine plantation workers than the age of the afforestation. FMT of the worker caste tends to be larger in gallery forests than in pine plantations, while the results were inconclusive for soldiers.Conclusion The results suggested a homogenization mainly of the feeding FMT of the worker caste of H. tenuis in pine plantations associated with the increase in the softwood food resource of P. caribaea.

AB  - Invasive plants are often attacked by both introduced specialist and native generalist natural enemies in new ranges. Soil fertility can potentially alter the interactions of these natural enemies with native versus invasive plants in ways that have largely unexplored implications for biological invasions and biological control. A common garden experiment was conducted to compare the performance of an introduced specialist flea beetle, Agasicles hygrophila, and/or a native generalist nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, on invasive alligator weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides, and its native congener sessile joyweed, Alternanthera sessilis, under different levels of soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). At a relatively low or moderate N and P levels, the flea beetle and the nematodes were not significantly affected by each other. Under these conditions, alligator weed responded plastically by producing more branches and biomass, as well as longer stolons, in response to attack by the flea beetle and/or the nematode, compared to sessile joyweed responses to similar levels of damage. However, under a relatively high N and P levels, nematode infestations significantly reduced flea beetle damage on alligator weed, resulting in significantly greater above- and below-ground biomass and longer stolons than plants without herbivory. In contrast, beetle herbivory significantly increased the level of nematode infestations on sessile joyweed, resulting in significantly fewer fine and coarse roots, and lower above- and below-ground biomass compared to plants without herbivory. Synthesis and applications. Our findings illustrate the importance of soil fertility in mediating interactions between specialist biocontrol agents and native generalists on native versus invasive plants. High phenotypic plasticity seems to be an important attribute that contributes to the success of invasive plants like alligator weed in relatively nutrient-poor environments. However, nutrient-rich environments could potentially confer greater growth benefits on invasive plants than on native ones by changing herbivore-herbivore interactions on plants differently. There is a great need to fully investigate the direct and indirect interactions between biocontrol agents and generalists across food webs following classical biocontrol releases. Nutrient measurements of both soil and water bodies should also be incorporated into all stages of biocontrol programmes.

AB  - Understanding how animals use their habitat is essential to understand their biology and support conservation efforts. Technological advances in tracking technologies allow us to follow animals at increasingly fine temporal resolutions. Yet, how tracking devices' sampling intervals impact results remains unclear, as well as which method to use. Using simulations and empirical data from wild boars tracked in Germany, we systematically examine how the temporal resolution of movement data in interaction with the spatial autocorrelation of the landscape affects the outcomes of two common techniques for analyzing habitat selection: resource-selection analysis (RSA) and an autocorrelation-informed weighted derivative (wRSA) as well as integrated step-selection analysis (iSSA). Each method differs in the definition of "available" locations (RSA) and the implementation of the movement model during parameter estimation (iSSA). Our simulations suggested that landscape autocorrelation has a much stronger effect on the estimated selection coefficients and their variability than the sampling interval. Higher sampling intervals (i.e., longer time between steps) are required for landscapes with high autocorrelation, enabling the animal to experience enough variability in clumped landscapes. Short sampling intervals generally lead to higher variability and fewer statistically significant estimates (in particular for wRSA). Our results complement recent attempts to outline a coherent framework for habitat-selection analyses and to explain them to practitioners. We further contribute to these efforts by assessing the sensitivity of two commonly used methods, RSA and iSSA, to the changes in sampling interval of movement data. We expect our findings to further raise awareness of pitfalls underlying the comparison of estimated selection coefficients obtained in different studies and to assist movement ecologists in choosing the appropriate method for habitat-selection analysis.

AB  - Over the past 100 years, the biodiversity of our planet has declined dramatically. To date, more than 142 500 species of animals have been included in the Red List of The World Conservation Union and about 40 000 of them are threatened with extinction (The IUCN horizontal ellipsis , 2022). Red Data Books of various levels are documents that keep records of rare and endangered species with an indication of their past and present distribution, reproduction features, and protection measures already taken and those necessary in the future. They act as a formal legal basis for the establishment of a special regime of protection in relation to these objects. The new edition of the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation (2021) includes four species of ungulates that are significant in the biocenoses of steppes and deserts. Two of them are no longer found in the wild in Russia: Przewalski's horse (Equus przewalskii Poljakov, 1881) is extinct in Russia since the 19th century and the onager (Equus hemionus Pallas, 1775) since the beginning of the 20th century. The state of populations of other two species, the saiga (Saiga tatarica Linnaeus, 1766) and the Mongolian gazelle or the dzeren (Procapra gutturosa Pallas, 1777), causes serious concern. The loss of members of this group from the ecosystems will not only reduce the biodiversity of arid biomes, but may also lead to their degradation. The last time the onager was seen on the territory of Russia in Transbaikalia was in 1926. For almost 20 years there have been discussions about its reintroduction in Dauria and the Northwestern Caspian region, however, the lack of a full-scale scientific research may make this initiative to be risky in all aspects. The northern boundary of the Mongolian gazelle range passes the territory of Russia. However, the number and state of its population in Russia largely depends on the state of its population in the territory of Mongolia. After the complete disappearance of the species in the 1970s-1980s in Altai, Tuva, and Transbaikalia, dzeren population began to recover in the 1990s, due to the increase of its North-Kerulen population in Mongolia: resuming of winter migrations to the territory of Southeastern Transbaikalia, favorable natural conditions, and effective protection of the species on the territories of two nature biosphere reserves, Daursky and Sokhondo, and the federal zakaznik (nature refuge) Dzeren Valley, contributed to the formation of a number of sedentary groups of these ungulates (Kirilyuk and Lushchekina, 2017). Now, the total number of the species in Russia is about 20 000 individuals (Kirilyuk, 2021). It is the first time for the saiga to be listed in the Red Data Book. In the 1980s, its numbers did not cause any concern: the species amounted to about 400 000 individuals. However, overhunting, intensive development of agriculture, reduction of suitable habitats, the economic crisis in the country, poaching, and temporary suspension of the nature protection activities led to a sharp decrease in the saiga population in the Northwestern Caspian region. In 2015 the population number was only 4000-5000 individuals (Karimova and Lushchekina, 2018). Until relatively recently, all three species were considered commercial. However, environmentally unfriendly forms of economic development of arid territories (plowing and land reclamation, overgrazing, construction of roads and other technical structures without taking into account regional features, etc.
   ) directly or indirectly contributed to the reduction of the ranges of the species and disruption of their seasonal migrations and spatial structure. All these resulted in population decrease, increasing their vulnerability to abnormal weather conditions (heavy snowfall, droughts, fires, etc.) and the pressure of legal and illegal hunting. The future of these unique animals depends, first of all, on man and his (our) attitude to the natural environment. Their well being should be facilitated by the implementation of measures developed by specialists and listed both in the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation and in approved specific strategies.

AB  - Simple Summary Classical swine fever is a highly contagious disease that infects both domestic pigs and wild boars. Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) has not been detected in domestic pigs in South Korea since 2016, but has been increasing in wild boars since 2017. Two cases of CSFV subgenotype 2.1d were detected in wild Korean boars in 2011, but then no cases were detected until 2016; however, 16 cases of CSFV were detected between 2017 and 2019. In this study, we report seven CSFV-positive samples obtained from wild boars in 2020. In addition, although 13 mtDNA haplotypes were detected in wild boars in South Korea, all 25 cases of CSFV that occurred in wild boars between 2011 and 2020 were detected in animals with haplotype 01. Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is one of the major pathogens that causes severe economic damage to the swine industry. Circulation of CSFV in wild boars carries the potential risk of reintroducing the virus into CSFV-free pig farms. This study carried out a genetic analysis of CSFV isolates from wild boars and analyzed the mtDNA haplotypes of the wild boars. Blood samples (n = 2140) from wild Korean boars captured in 2020 were subjected to qRT-PCR to detect CSFV, which was classified as subgenotype 2.1d based on phylogenetic analysis. CSFV had been detected in wild boars only in northern regions (Gangwon and Gyeonggi) of South Korea between 2011 and 2019. However, CSFV was identified in wild boars in the more southern regions (Chungbuk and Gyeongbuk) in 2020. Based on mitochondrial DNA analysis, all wild boars with CSFV were haplotype 01 (H01). Thus, we presume that the H01 haplotype is more susceptible to CSFV. In the future, infection of wild boars by CSFV is expected to occur intermittently every year, and we predict that most wild boars infected with CSFV will be haplotype H01.

AB  - Simple Summary Simple Summary: The rumen is the most important digestive organ of ruminants, and its rich microbial co-evolved with the host to play a crucial role in immunomodulation, defense, digestive metabolism, animal productivity, and meat quality control. It also forms a complex regulatory network with host genes and phenotypes that are involved in maintaining organismal homeostasis. In this study, we compared the differences in rumen microorganisms between crossbred progeny of sheep and Hu sheep, identified key biomarkers, and analyzed their relationship with rumen function. The results showed that microbial diversity was significantly higher in crossbred progeny, which was able to alter the microbial community structure to regulate rumen fermentation, promote carbon homeostasis, and enhance amino acid metabolism. In addition, there were significant correlations between biomarkers and key traits. Therefore, we suggest that there is a link between sheep rumen microbes and differential traits in crossbred progeny, which provides new insights for sheep trait improvement.Abstract This experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of three-way hybrid sheep and Hu sheep on serum indicators, rumen fermentation, rumen enzyme activity, and microorganisms in sheep. Healthy and similar birth weights from three groups (Hu, n = 11; Charolais x Australian White x Hu, CAH, n = 11; Charolais x Dorper x Hu, CDH, n = 11) were selected to be fed by the ewes until 45 days of age. Subsequently, they were weaned intensively and underwent short-term fattening for 3 months along with selected male lambs fed intensively. During this period, they were fed and watered ad libitum. Blood and rumen fluid were collected and analyzed for serum indicators and rumen fluid microorganisms, enzyme activity, and VFA, respectively, at the end of the fattening period. Compared with Hu lamb, the offspring of the three-way hybrid lamb showed significant improvements in body weight, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine content. However, there was no significant effect on serum immunity and antioxidant indices. In addition, the rumen fluid volatile fatty acid (VFA) molar concentration and microcrystalline cellulose and lipase content were significantly lower in the three-way hybrid lamb compared to Hu lamb, but beta-glucosidase, amylase, pepsin, and VFA molar ratio were not significantly affected. Subsequently, 16S rRNA sequencing diversity analysis revealed that three-way hybrid lamb significantly increased rumen microbial ACE and Chao1 indices compared to Hu lamb. Meanwhile, the abundance of Verrucomicrobiota and Synergistota significantly increased at the phylum level. Correlation analysis showed that Prevotella had the highest proportion, while Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group correlated most closely with others genus. The microbial communities isovaleric acid molar concentration and proportion were strongly correlated. In addition, there were significant differences in correlations between microbial communities and isobutyric acid, butyric acid and valeric acid content, and their molar proportion, but they were not significantly correlated with digestive enzymes. From the functional enrichment analysis, it was found that hybrid progeny were mainly enriched in the pyruvate metabolism, microbial metabolism in diverse environments, carbon metabolism, and quorum sensing pathways. In contrast, the Hu sheep were primarily enriched in the cysteine and methionine, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite pathways.
   These results suggest that hybridization can play a role in regulating organismal metabolism and improve animal production performance by influencing the structure and characteristics of microbial communities.

AB  - Introduction Parental environments can influence offspring fitness via clonal (asexual) propagation, and such clonal parental effects may vary among plant species and depend on offspring environments as well. Consequently, clonal parental effects may alter competitive interactions between plant species, and such impacts may vary with offspring environments.Methods We conducted a two-phase experiment with two clonal floating duckweeds, Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minor. In the parental phase, S. polyrhiza and L. minor were grown separately under two distinct nutrient conditions and produced offspring ramets. In the offspring phase, the ramets produced from the parental phase were grown with or without a heterospecific neighbor under the same two nutrient conditions.Results and discussion In the first phase, parent ramets of both species produced more biomass and offspring ramets under high nutrient availability than under low. In the second phase, nutrient availability experienced by the parents significantly affected the competitive ability of offspring in both species. Specifically, the offspring of L. minor suppressed those of S. polyrhiza more strongly when the parent of L. minor had been grown under high than low nutrient availability, although such clonal parental effects did not vary with nutrient availability experienced by the offspring. In contrast, the offspring of S. polyrhiza suppressed those of L. minor more strongly when the parent of S. polyrhiza had been grown under high rather than at low nutrient availability, but this effect occurred only under high nutrient availability for the offspring and diminished under low nutrient availability. These results suggest that clonal parental effects can influence competitiveness of plants and may vary depending on offspring environments. Our findings highlight the potential role of clonal parental effects in regulating interspecific interactions, which may further influence species composition and productivity of plant communities.

AB  - Simple Summary Succulent Aizoaceae (often called "mesembs" or ice plants) form a dominant component of the Succulent Karoo in southern Africa, constituting one of the most species-rich families within the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR). Despite the diversity and abundance of these plants, the diversity of insects specialized on them has never been surveyed methodically prior to this study. In a three-year study of the galling insects associated with succulent Aizoaceae in South Africa, we found that they support a rich community of gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), virtually all of which are new to science. This is not surprising, given that knowledge of the Afrotropical fauna of gall midges is scarce, with most species described in the 1900s. Here, we describe the new genus Ruschiola with ten species from succulent Aizoaceae in Namaqualand, the Knersvlakte and the Cedarberg regions of South Africa based on morphological, molecular and life history data. The genetic data were particularly important in this study for differentiating taxa, given that Ruschiola species are very similar morphologically. Members of this genus develop in leaf galls or in plant tissues without visible gall formation, and are highly host specific. Aizoaceae (Caryophyllales) constitute one of the major floral components of the unique Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR), with more than 1700 species and 70% endemism. Within succulent Aizoaceae, the subfamily Ruschioideae is the most speciose and rapidly diversifying clade, offering potential niches for the diversification of specialized herbivorous insects. Nevertheless, insect diversity on these plants has not been studied to date, and knowledge of gall-inducing insects in the Afrotropics is generally scarce. Our recent observations indicate that succulent Aizoaceae in the GCFR support a rich and largely unstudied community of gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Here, we provide a first report of their diversity with a description of a new genus, Ruschiola Dorchin, and ten new species, based on morphological and molecular analyses of material collected during a three-year targeted survey across major GCFR vegetation types. A high degree of morphological uniformity in Ruschiola suggests recent diversification and necessitated the use of molecular data and laboratory rearing from host plants to verify species boundaries and host ranges.

AB  - Livestock manure use in agriculture contributes to pollutants like antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and resistant bacteria. This practice could potentially facilitate ARGs development in soil ecosystems. Our study aimed to explore ARGs and bacterial communities in cattle manure from Ningxia beef cattle farms with varying breeding periods. We also assessed the impact of different application rates of cattle manure compost, created by mixing manure with different growing periods, on soil's physicochemical and heavy metal properties. High-throughput PCR and sequencing were used to analyze ARGs and bacterial communities. We aimed to understand ARGs dynamics in cattle manure during breeding stages and the impact of different fertilizer application rates on soil bacteria and resistance genes. We found 212 ARGs from cattle manure, spanning tetracycline, aminoglycoside, multidrug, and MLSB categories. Relative ARGs abundance was presented across breeding stages: lactation (C1), breeding (C3), pre-fattening (C4), calving (C2), and late fattening (C5). pH, total nitrogen (TN), electrical conductivity (EC), arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) presence significantly impacted ARGs quantity and microbial community structure in manure. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were the primary factor altering ARGs in manure (65.56%). Heavy metals contributed to 18.60% of ARGs changes. Manure application changed soil ARGs abundance, notably in soils with high application rates, primarily associated with aminoglycoside, multidrug and sulfonamide resistance. Soils with higher manure rates had elevated MGEs, positively correlated with most ARGs, suggesting MGEs' role in ARGs dissemination. Soil microbial community structure was influenced by fertilization, particularly with the highest application rate. Heavy metals (specifically Cd, contributing to 23.12%), microbial community changes (17.42%), and MGEs (17.38%) were the main factors affecting soil antibiotic resistance. Our study establishes a framework for understanding ARGs emergence in manure and treated soils. This informs strategies to mitigate environmental ARGs transmission and guides diverse livestock manure application and management.

AB  - Purpose Cryptosporidium is an intestinal zoonotic protozoan parasite that infects domesticated and wild animals. There are no reports on the prevalence and molecular characterisation of Cryptosporidium in the endemic Cyprus mouflon. The mouflon is strictly protected by national and international legislation. Its main distribution is Paphos State Forest and surrounding areas, where it may share the same water sources as free-ranging domestic goats. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. and genotypes in mouflon and free-ranging goats within the mouflon range.Methods Faecal samples of 70 mouflons and 34 free-ranging goats were screened for Cryptosporidium by PCR amplification and sequencing.Results Only one sample (1/70) belonging to a mouflon was PCR positive for Cryptosporidium. Based on sequencing of the 18S rRNA locus, this species was identified as Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum). No positive sample was detected in the free-ranging goats (0/34).Conclusion This is the first report on the molecular identification of this Cryptosporidium species in a Cyprus mouflon. The results indicate that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in Cyprus mouflon is low.

AB  - There has been growing interest in the practice of reduced-impact logging (RIL) to enhance various ecological services of selectively logged tropical forests. It is thus important to evaluate the effectiveness of different logging operations between RIL and conventional logging (CON). The Myanmar Selection System (MSS) has a long history and is well known for its use of elephants for skidding, which is considered one form of RIL. However, the difference in the impacts of logging operations between the MSS using elephants for skidding and machine-only-based operations commonly adopted in other countries is unknown. The present study evaluated ground disturbance along elephant skid trails, along logging roads and at log landings in four compartments logged under the MSS, comparing with reported values for CON and RIL in the other countries. The ground disturbance in the MSS compartments was, respectively, 2.1% and 0.4% in average for logging roads and log landings; it is not significantly different from that for CON and RIL (p > 0.05). In contrast, the disturbed area along elephant skid trails (0.9%) is much lower than that for CON (5.2%) and RIL (4.7%) (p < 0.05). A large difference in the width of skid trails was found between elephant skidding (1.0 m) and machinery (CON: 5.5 m, RIL: 4.6 m) (p < 0.0001). We conclude that elephant skidding can largely reduce ground disturbance due to much narrower width of the skid trails as compared with machine skidding, while MSS does not differ from the other countries in ground disturbance at logging roads and log landings.

AB  - The structure of the coat and integument of small ruminants reared in semi-arid regions have valuable char-acteristics that favor their adaptation to the region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the structural characteristics of the coat and integument and sweating capacity of goats and sheep in the Brazilian semi-arid region, using 20 animals, 10 of each breed, 5 males and 5 females of each species, grouped in a completely randomized design in a 2 x 2 factorial scheme (2 species and 2 genders) with 5 replicates. The animals were already being kept under the influence of high temperatures and levels of direct solar radiation before the day of the collections. At the time of the evaluations, ambient temperature was high, with low relative humidity. The pattern of epidermal thickness and sweat glands per body region was superior in sheep (P < 0.05), and the number of hair follicles and sweat rate were similar (P > 0.05) between the species. There was no difference (P > 0.05) in the evaluated characteristics between the genders, showing that they are not influenced by hormones. The morphology of the coat and skin of these animals showed a superiority of goats compared to sheep.

AB  - In response to intensified agricultural impacts on Aotearoa New Zealand's river systems, our study sought to demonstrate a novel approach for assessing freshwater quality through environmental DNA (eDNA) and promote a holistic understanding of ecological health. Employing 13 eDNA tree-of-life metabarcoding assays alongside 11 standard physicochemical attributes, we generated a comprehensive temporal and spatial dataset along a 3.5 km section of an upper river catchment. The study catchment moves from a culturally significant native bush area, through sheep and beef farming, to an organic dairy farm, capturing the transition through varying land uses. Our analysis focused on the detections of key culturally significant taonga (treasured) species, known animal sources of fecal contamination, and the taxon-independent community index (TICI) as a measure of ecological health. We identified 479 species including wh & imacr;o/native blue duck, long and short finned tuna/eels, kaharore bully/cockabully, k & omacr;kopu/dwarf galaxias, and k & omacr;ura/freshwater crayfish. Although Escherichia coli (E. coli) levels did not significantly vary across sites, eDNA sequence counts of cattle and deer were significant predictors of a site's E. coli levels, suggesting that eDNA could be a valuable indicator of fecal contamination sources. TICI scores were strongly correlated with changes in water quality attributes (Adj-R2 = 0.92) and consistently detected subtle declines driven by increased pastoral land use. Community leadership was central to our methodology, enabling local stakeholders, including mana whenua and farmers, to actively participate in water monitoring and data interpretation. This approach not only fulfilled regulatory requirements but also fostered a deep connection with the river, enhancing community-led conservation efforts. By enhancing the mauri (life force) of the community through active participation and capacity building, this approach exemplifies sustainable, collaborative efforts in environmental management and revitalization.

AB  - This study assessed the potential effect of a co-feed liquid whey-integrated diet on the fecal microbiota of 14 crossbred pigs. The experimental design was as follows: seven pigs were in the control group, fed with a control feed, and seven were in the experimental group, fed with the same control feed supplemented daily with liquid whey. The collection of fecal samples was conducted on each animal before the dietary treatment (T0) and one (T1), and two (T2) months after the beginning of the co-feed integration. In addition, blood samples were collected from each pig at the same time points in order to evaluate the physiological parameters. Taxonomic analysis showed a bacterial community dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Proteobacteria phyla that populated the crossbred pig feces. The diversity metrics suggested that the co-feed supplementation affected some alpha diversity indexes of the fecal microbiota. In addition, the differential abundance analysis at the genus level revealed significant differences for various genera, suggesting that the liquid whey supplementation potentially influenced a part of the bacterial community over time. Spearman's correlations revealed that the differential abundant genera identified are positively or negatively correlated with the physiological parameters.

AB  - Operating as ecological engineers, the increased distribution and abundance of wild hogs (Sus scrofa) has caused considerable socio-economic impacts. The international scope of economic research providing wild hog damage estimates are often confined to agricultural crops, while damage estimates among forest plantations are lacking. In Alabama, private landowners hold the majority of timberland acreage and are less equipped to absorb financial losses from wild hog damage than their industrial counterparts. A survey was conducted to estimate the economic impact of wild hogs, namely costs of damage and control, to privately owned forestlands. The survey was distributed in the summer of 2016 to a sample of 1160 private landowners across the State. A 35% response rate was achieved from the sampled group. Survey results indicated in 2013 to 2015 longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) were the only species damaged by wild hogs. Wild hogs caused damage to 34 and 13% of forest acres in longleaf and loblolly plantations, respectively. At $50.40 per acre, costs associated with replanting damaged longleaf acres were double those for loblolly. Survey results suggest the southern half of Alabama holds the largest wild hog populations and sustained the most damage to forest stands. Consequently, landowners in this region invested the most capital on control methods where the average cost per control technique ranged from $12-2750. Additionally, landowners who did not have wild hogs on their property were willing to pay around $14 per acre more for eradication than those with. We hope the findings from this survey will provide a better understanding of the economic impact of wild hogs in young forest plantations.

AB  - Aim The Island Rule-that is, the tendency for body size to decrease in large mammals and increase in small mammals on islands has been commonly evaluated through macroecological or macroevolutionary, pattern-orientated approaches, which generally fail to model the microevolutionary processes driving either dwarfing or gigantism. Here, we seek to identify which microevolutionary process could have driven extreme insular dwarfism in the extinct dwarf red deer population on the island of Jersey.
   Location Jersey, UK (Channel Islands).
   Taxon Red deer (Cervus elaphus).
   Methods We applied an individual-based quantitative genetics model parameterized with red deer life-history data to study the evolution of dwarfism in Jersey's deer, considering variations in island area and isolation through time due to sea level changes.
   Results The body size of red deer on Jersey decreased fast early on, due to phenotypic plasticity, then kept decreasing almost linearly over time down to the actual body size of the Jersey deer (36 kg on average). Only 1% of 10,000 replicates failed to reach that size in our simulations. The distribution of time to adaptation in these simulations was right skewed, with a median of 395 generations (equivalent to roughly 4 kyr), with complete dwarfism effectively occurring in less than 6 kyr 84.6% of times. About 72% of the variation in the time to adaptation between simulations was collectively explained by higher mutational variance, the number of immigrants from the continent after isolation, available genetic variance, heritability, and phenotypic plasticity.
   Main Conclusions The extreme dwarfing of red deer on Jersey is an expected outcome of high mutational variance, high immigration rate, a wide adaptive landscape, low levels of inbreeding, and high phenotypic plasticity (in the early phase of dwarfing), all occurring within a time window of around 6 kyr. Our model reveals how extreme dwarfism is a plausible outcome of common, well-known evolutionary processes.

AB  - This work assesses damage caused by Coraebus undatus (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) and Reticulitermes grassei Clement (Blattodea: Rhinotermitidae) in managed cork oak forests from the southern Iberian Peninsula. Lesions were diagnosed and quantified in relation to the following features: height and orientation in the trunk, diameter at breast height, solar exposure, understory presence and orography. The distribution patterns of lesions in the study area across 12 plots and in the trunk of the trees were also analyzed. The study was performed in "S-a de Hornachuelos " Natural Park (Cordoba, Spain) and the research area encompassed 12 environmentally-restored sampling plots. Data were recorded from 2007 to 2014, with yearly sampling from late June to mid-September, corresponding to the cork extraction period, since lesions caused by these insects are well distinguishable promptly after bark removal. The results reveal that C. undatus has low population levels and a non-uniform distribution pattern in the study area as well as in the trunk of the tree. It shows preference for medium height but not by any trunk orientation. R. grassei also shows low infestation levels and a preference to affect the trunk's base. Comparatively, C. undatus showed higher infestation levels than R. grassei. The location of damage was also different, since galleries made by C. undatus predominated at intermediate trunk heights while those of R. grassei were more frequent at lower heights. Our results further showed a low co-occurrence of both species in the same tree trunks, which could be explained in terms of overlapping in the distribution areas of both species. These results provide background information that will enable natural resources managers to detect changes and trends of these species and inform future management decisions.

AB  - Prescribed fire has been extensively used in recent years to control woody encroachment into mountain and other grassland-dominated landscapes. In the Aragon Pyrenees, prescribed burns have been mainly used to remove the native thorny shrub Echinospartum horridum (Vahl) Rothm., whose populations are spreading to the detriment of grasslands. To study the effectiveness of the burning of E. horridum to preserve grasslands for livestock grazing, the vegetation of six sites burned 0.5, 2, 3, 6, 15 and 35 years ago was sampled and compared with that of nearby unburned shrubland (control) and grassland (reference). In addition, the nutritional quality of E. horridum was examined and compared to that of the reference grassland to evaluate to what extent shrub growth can be controlled by herbivores after burning. Initial shrub cover recovered as early as 15 years after fire, with E. horridum being dominant. Plant diversity was greatest at intermediate number of years after fire. Initial floristic composition and life-form spectrum were restored 15-35 years after burning. Echinospartum horridum exhibited early lignification that restricts its availability as a palatable forage for the first two years after burning and makes it unlikely to be consumed thereafter, highlighting the difficulty in controlling the expansion of this species by livestock herbivory. The analysis of the nutrient levels suggested an increased shortage of limiting elements, such as phosphorus or sulfur, in the mid-term after burning due to substantial nutrient losses and exports during and after the burn. Our results question the suitability and sustainability of a single prescribed burn as management tool alone to control the expansion of E. horridum and call for caution in its application for fighting shrub encroachment in the Central Pyrenees.

AB  - Animals have adapted behavioral and physiological strategies to conserve energy during periods of adverse conditions. Hepatic glucose is one such adaptation used by grazing animals. While large vertebrates have been shown to have feed utilization and deposition of nutrients-fluctuations in metabolic rate-little is known about the regulating mechanism that controls hepatic metabolism in yaks under grazing conditions in the cold season. Hence, the objective of this research was to integrate transcriptomic and metabolomic data to better understand how the hepatic responds to chronic nutrient stress. Our analyses indicated that the blood parameters related to energy metabolism (glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein lipase, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1) were significantly (p < 0.05) lower in the cold season. The RNA-Seq results showed that malnutrition inhibited lipid synthesis (particularly fatty acid, cholesterol, and steroid synthesis), fatty acid oxidation, and lipid catabolism and promoted gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. For metabolite profiles, 359 metabolites were significantly altered in two groups. Interestingly, the cold season group remarkably decreased glutathione and phosphatidylcholine (18:2 (2E, 4E)/0:0). Moreover, integrative analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome demonstrated that glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, PPAR signaling pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis, steroid biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism play an important role in the potential relationship between differential expression genes and metabolites. The reduced lipid synthesis, fatty acid oxidation, and fat catabolism facilitated gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the PPAR and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways to maintain the energy homeostasis of the whole body in the yak, thereby coping with the shortage of forages and adapting to the extreme environment of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP).

AB  - Non-native deer populations are increasing in many parts of the world. Recreational hunting has commonly been advocated as a method for reducing deer population densities on private land, but there have been few robust evaluations of its effectiveness. We quantified the impacts of recreational hunting on a population of non-native fallow deer (Dama dama) on a private conservation reserve in Tasmania, Australia. We used a grid of 64 motion-sensitive cameras to estimate seasonal deer population density for three consecutive years. Recreational hunters recorded their hunting effort (date and duration of hunts), deer seen, and deer killed, and used a GPS to record where they hunted. Throughout the three-year period, deer density remained between 3.95 and 4.96 deer per km2, well above the mean 2.7 deer per km2 estimated for Tasmania. The 28 hunters killed a total of 128 deer (33 males, 87 females and 8 unknown) during 306 hunts. The annual harvest comprised 21%-26% of the total deer population (28%-38% of the female population). During the four-week 'buck' season (March), hunters exhibited more selective hunting behaviour characterised by frequent hunts that targeted mostly antlered males with low catch per unit effort (0.03 deer killed per hour). In contrast, the 8-month antlerless season (March-November) was characterised by a more opportunistic hunting behaviour with fewer hunts and a higher catch per unit effort (0.11 deer killed per hour). Our results show that the current regime of recreational hunting is not reducing the population. If landowners decide to rely on recreational hunting to reduce deer densities on their properties, more deer, especially females, need to be harvested annually. Changes to regulations that increase the number of deer harvested should be considered in parallel with greater incentives for recreational hunters to harvest more females. Other deer control methods, such as helicopter-based shooting and professional ground-based shooting, are likely to provide faster and greater reductions in the densities of non-native deer populations than recreational hunting while non-lethal management should be considered for local asset protection.

AB  - Simple Summary Ruminal microorganisms, especially bacteria, play a vital role in utilizing fibrous material in ruminants. The yak is a bovid on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau that traditionally only grazes natural pasture all year. During lactation, energy intake of yaks is often well below requirements, and yaks lose body weight. Today, to mitigate body weight losses during lactation, suckling yaks are often offered supplementary feed. This study examined the effect of dietary supplements on rumen bacteria in lactating yak. The yaks were offered supplementary concentrate feed (C), rumen-protected Lys and Met (RPA), or both (RPA+C). The ratio of the relative abundance of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in RPA+C was greater than in the RPA group, while there was no difference between C and RPA+C. The intakes of supplements resulted in a number of alterations in the abundances of bacteria at the genus level. When supplemented with C, yaks increased the concentration of ruminal total volatile fatty acids (VFAs), acetate, and butyrate. These results demonstrate that supplementary feed: (1) alters the composition of rumen microbiota and VFAs of lactating yaks; and (2) can be used to manipulate the composition of rumen microbiota. Traditionally, yaks graze only natural pasture all year round without supplements. Forage intake of lactating yaks is below energy and protein requirements, even in the summer, and suckling yaks lose a substantial amount of significant body weight. Today, to mitigate the loss in body weight, supplementary feed is being offered to lactating yaks. However, the effects of supplementary feed on ruminal bacterial communities in lactating yaks is unknown. In the current study, we examined the effect of supplementary feed on ruminal microbiota, using 16S rRNA sequencing, and on volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Twenty-four lactating yaks of similar body weight (218 +/- 19.5 kg) and grazing natural pasture were divided randomly into four groups and received different supplements: (1) rumen-protected amino acids (RPA); (2) concentrate feed (C); (3) RPA plus C (RPA+C); and (4) no supplements (control-CON). The concentrations of total VFAs, acetate, and butyrate were greater (p < 0.05) when supplemented with concentrate feed (C and RPA+C) than without concentrate feed (CON and RPA). Bacteroidetes (B) and Firmicutes (F) were the dominant ruminal bacterial phyla in all groups. The ratio of relative abundance of F:B in RPA+C was greater than in the RPA group, while there was no difference between CON and RPC (interaction, p = 0.026). At the genus level, the relative abundances of Absconditabacteriales_SR1, Bacteroidales-RF16-group, Bacteroidales_BS11_gut_ group, Prevotellaceae, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group were lesser (p < 0.05) with supplementary concentrate feed (C and RPA+C) than without concentrate feed (CON and RPA), whereas Butyrivibrio_2 and Pseudobutyrivibrio were greater (p < 0.05) with supplementary rumen-protected amino acids (RPA and RPA+C) than without rumen-protected amino acids (CON and C). These results demonstrate that supplementary feed: (1) alters the composition of rumen microbiota and concentrations of ruminal VFAs in lactating yaks; and (2) can be used to manipulate the composition of rumen microbiota.

AB  - Rocklands are present in South Florida, both on the peninsula and in the Keys. Previous work has shown that extrafloral nectaries on pine rockland plants in the Florida Everglades and surrounding areas play a role in attracting ant protectors. Species with nectaries are more abundant and ant activity greater in more recently burned pine rockland habitats compared with longer undisturbed rockland hammock forest. The floristic composition and prevailing climate of Keys rocklands differs substantially from those on the mainland, so we sought to investigate ant activity and the abundance of plants with extrafloral nectaries in Big Pine Key rockland habitats. Standard baiting methods were used to assess ant abundance and potential predation activity in hardwood hammock, shrubby pine rockland, and open pine rockland sites. Ant activity was the lowest in open pine rockland, greatest in hardwood hammock, and intermediate in shrubby pine rockland, the opposite of what has been observed in previous studies in southern peninsular Florida and on Andros, Bahamas. Sampling vegetation at these same sites revealed a larger proportion of plant species with extrafloral nectaries in the pine rocklands than the hammock, as observed previously in Everglades habitats. Possible reasons for differences in ant activity in Keys rockland habitats are discussed.

AB  - Closely related sexual and parthenogenetic species often show distinct distribution patterns, known as geographical parthenogenesis. Similar patterns, characterized by the existence of separate sexual and parthenogenetic populations across their natural range, can also be found in facultative parthenogens - species in which every female is capable of both sexual and parthenogenetic reproduction. The underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon in nature remain unclear. Features of the habitat, such as differences in host-plant phenotypes or niche breadth, could favour sexual or asexual reproductive modes and thus help to explain geographical parthenogenesis in natural insect populations. Megacrania batesii is a facultatively parthenogenetic stick insect that displays geographical parthenogenesis in the wild. We aimed to explore whether sexual and parthenogenetic populations of M. batesii displayed niche differentiation or variations in niche breadth that could explain the separation of the two population types. To do this, we sampled host plants from across the range of M. batesii and quantified phenotypic traits that might affect palatability or accessibility for M. batesii, including leaf thickness, toughness, spike size and density, plant height, and chemical composition. We also quantified host-plant density, which could affect M. batesii dispersal. We found little evidence of phenotypic differences between host plants supporting sexual versus asexual M. batesii populations, and no difference in host-plant density or niche breadth between the two population types. Our results suggest that habitat parameters do not play a substantial role in shaping patterns of geographical parthenogenesis in wild populations of M. batesii. Instead, population sex ratio variation could result from interactions between the sexes or dispersal dynamics.

AB  - Simple Summary Insufficient maternal milk is one of the important reasons for the low survival rate of young Asian elephants. Finding the optimal break milk supplementation for young Asian elephants is a matter of urgency. In our study, we investigated the microbiomes of young Asian elephants on different milk-containing diets (elephant milk only, elephant milk-plant mixed feed, and goat milk-plant mixed feed). Our results suggested that goat milk is not suitable for young elephants, and yak milk may be an ideal source of supplemental milk for Asian elephants. Evaluating the association between milk-containing diets and the microbiomes of young Asian elephants could assist establishing optimal breast milk supplementation to improve offspring survival rates. The microbiomes of young Asian elephants on different milk-containing diets (elephant milk only, elephant milk-plant mixed feed, and goat milk-plant mixed feed) were investigated using high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and phylogenetic analysis. Microbial diversity was lower in the elephant milk-only diet group, with a high abundance of Proteobacteria compared to the mixed-feed diet groups. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were dominant in all groups. Spirochaetae, Lachnospiraceae, and Rikenellaceae were abundant in the elephant milk-plant mixed-feed diet group, and Prevotellaceae was abundant in the goat milk-plant mixed-feed diet group. Membrane transport and cell motility metabolic pathways were significantly enriched in the elephant milk-plant mixed-feed diet group, whereas amino acid metabolism and signal transduction pathways were significantly enriched in the goat milk-plant mixed-feed diet group. The intestinal microbial community composition and associated functions varied significantly between diets. The results suggest that goat milk is not suitable for young elephants. Furthermore, we provide new research methods and directions regarding milk source evaluation to improve elephant survival, wellbeing, and conservation.

AB  - Some plant species express an extraordinarily high intraspecific diversity in phytochemicals (= chemodiversity). As discussed for biodiversity, higher chemodiversity may provide better protection against environmental stress, including herbivory. However, little is known about whether the resistance of a plant individual towards herbivores is mostly governed by its own chemodiversity or by associational resistance provided by conspecific neighbours. To investigate the role of chemodiversity in plant-aphid interactions, we used the Asteraceae Tanacetum vulgare, whose individuals differ pronouncedly in the composition of leaf terpenoids, forming distinct chemotypes. Plants were set up in a field consisting of plots containing five individuals of either the same or different chemotypes. Presence of winged aphids, indicating attraction, and abundance of winged and unwinged aphids, indicating fitness, were counted weekly on each plant. During the peak abundance of aphids, leaf samples were taken from all plants for re-analyses of the terpenoid composition and quantification of terpenoid chemodiversity, calculated on an individual plant (Shannon index, Hs(ind), also considered as alpha-chemodiversity) and plot level (Hs(plot), = beta-chemodiversity). Aphid attraction was neither influenced by chemotype nor plot-type. The real-time odour environment may be very complex in this setting, impeding clear preferences. In contrast, the abundance was affected by both chemotype and plot-type. On average, more Uroleucon tanaceti aphids were found on plants of two of the chemotypes growing in homogenous compared to heterogenous plots, supporting the associational resistance hypothesis. For Macrosiphoniella tanacetaria aphids, the probability of presence differed between plot-types on one chemotype. Terpenoid chemodiversity expressed as a gradient revealed negative Hs(plot) effects on U. tanaceti, but a positive correlation of Hs(ind) with M. tanacetaria abundance. Aphids of M. fuscoviride were not affected by any level of chemodiversity. In conclusion, this study shows that not only the chemotype and chemodiversity of individual plants but also that of conspecific neighbours can influence certain plant-herbivore interactions. These effects are highly specific with regard to the plant chemotype and differ between aphid species and their morphs (winged vs. unwinged). Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of analysing chemodiversity at different levels.

AB  - Introduced seaweeds can alter the structure and productivity of marine food webs, especially when they lack top-down control by native herbivores. However, relatively little is known about the role of consumption of introduced seaweeds by native herbivores, and the potential role of seaweed nutrient content to mediate local herbivore consumption. In southeastern USA estuaries, the introduced red seaweed, Gracilaria vermiculophylla, has transformed unvegetated intertidal mudflats into a patchwork of non-native seaweed beds. We used a series of laboratory feeding assays to assess how invertebrate and fish species on the Georgia coast utilize G. vermiculophylla as a novel food resource. Because G. vermiculophylla readily absorbs nutrients, we also tested the role of nutrient enrichment on its consumption. We found that G. vermiculophylla was not significantly consumed by the mud snail Ilyanassa obsoleta nor the mud crab Eurypanopeus despressus, but it was rapidly eaten and even preferred over the native seaweed Ulva lactuca by adult pinfish Lagodon rhomboides. Nutrient enrichment of G. vermiculophylla did not affect consumption rates by the amphipod Ampithoe valida, but did double consumption rates by pinfish over unenriched seaweed. The differential responses of native consumers highlight the importance of evaluating multiple species when investigating introduced species' impacts on recipient communities. Given that consumer identity and nutrient content of the seaweed mediated the consumption of the non-native seaweed, site-specific patterns of consumer populations and environmental conditions could lead to patchy abundance and impacts of the non-native seaweed.

AB  - Successful establishment of desired species during restoration is challenging in drylands. Much research has focused on the importance of the critical life stages such as germination and emergence, but factors influencing survival through the seedling stages of perennial grasses may be equally important. We asked whether seedling defoliation by insects and/or mammals could cause restoration failure. We quantified the degree of defoliation on seedlings of common perennial grass species at 46 restoration sites throughout Oregon, Idaho, and Nevada, and calculated survival probabilities during the first growing season after planting. At each site, we excluded small mammals and insects for 6 weeks and compared defoliation and survival probabilities with seedlings in controls without exclusions. Seedlings were classified as either: large perennial grasses (LPG), primarily from the Triticeae tribe, or Bluegrasses (Poa spp.). Defoliation of LPG reduced seedling survival, but the effect was small compared to the influence of meteorological variables, such as precipitation and temperature. Based on bite patterns, most defoliation resulted from insects. Only a small percentage of vegetation was removed (36% of individuals were defoliated, mean = 13.2% vegetation removal). Defoliation of bluegrasses was less common than that of LPG seedlings, with only 16% experiencing defoliation, primarily from insects (mean = 4.3% vegetation removal). Some defoliation did occur within the exclusion treatments, but the effect of defoliation on seedling survival did not appear to interact with treatment. Based on the results of this study, seedling herbivory is unlikely to be a major factor in restoration failure in the Northern Great Basin.

AB  - Sb(III) and As(III) share similar chemical features and coexist in the environment. However, their oxidase enzymes have completely different sequences and structures. This raises an intriguing question: Could Sb(III)oxidizing prokaryotes (SOPs) also oxidize As(III), and vice versa? Regarding this issue, previous investigations have yielded unclear, incorrect and even conflicting data. This work aims to address this matter. First, we prepared an enriched population of SOPs that comprises 55 different AnoA genes, lacking AioAB and ArxAB genes. We found that these SOPs can oxidize both Sb(III) and As(III) with comparable capabilities. To further confirm this finding, we isolated three cultivable SOP strains that have AnoA gene, but lack AioAB and ArxAB genes. We observed that they also oxidize both Sb(III) and As(III) under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Secondly, we obtained an enriched population of As(III)-oxidizing prokaryotes (AOPs) from As-contaminated soils, which comprises 69 different AioA genes, lacking AnoA gene. We observed that the AOP population has significant As(III)-oxidizing activities, but lack detectable Sb(III)-oxidizing activities under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Therefore, we convincingly show that SOPs can oxidize As(III), but AOPs cannot oxidize Sb (III). These findings clarify the previous ambiguities, confusion, errors or contradictions regarding how SOPs and AOPs oxidize each other's substrate.

AB  - Improving connectivity is the most commonly used approach employed in biodiversity conservation to mitigate habitat fragmentation. Graph-based networks relying on species-oriented definitions of nodes and edges are powerful tools for evaluating landscape connectivity. However, few studies have examined the effects of seasonal variation and uncertainty in parameterization of habitat suitability on the identification of priority sites. Here, a combination of the habitat suitability index, morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA), and graph-network analysis were combined to assess the influence of habitat variability on the identification of priority sites for reintroduction of South China tiger (Panthera tigris amoyensis). The combined approach was applied to the Hupingshan and Houhe National Nature Reserve and neighbourhood that are considered the most suitable places to harbour small populations of South China tigers. Six spatial or temporally static assessment scenarios for habitat suitability were used to account for uncertainties in the habitat requirement parameterizations of wild boars as the main prey for South China tigers. For each assessment scenario, three classification schemes (i.e., the P50, P70, and P90 schemes) were adopted to explain uncertainties in priority sites evaluation. In the static scenario, the minimum area of priority sites in the P50, P70, and P90 schemes was 321, 354, and 2,371 km2, respectively, while the areas encompassed by priority sites in the P50, P70, and P90 schemes considering the seasonal variability and habitat uncertainty were 0.2, 1.6, and 229.5 km2, respectively. These results suggest that priority areas with high conservation value differed among the six assessment scenarios. Conservation planning of landscapes consequently should consider the impacts of changes in landscape structures caused by seasonal variation and uncertainty in the parameterization of habitat suitability for the assessment of landscape priority sites rather than relying on purely spatial or temporally static connectivity analyses.

AB  - Fallow fields and hedgerows enhance agricultural landscape heterogeneity and boost predatory arthropod di-versity, though there is little direct quantitative evidence of their value in mediating pest suppression. Here, stable isotope analyses were used to quantify the influence of fallow field presence, fallow size proportion of farms, hedgerow volume and hedgerow type, on arthropod pest consumption by six predatory taxa. Levels of herbivory by four arthropod taxa on three vegetation groups: maize, beans and non-crops - were also considered. This was achieved through mixing model analysis with 813C and 815N stable isotope to identify and estimate food-source proportions incorporated into tissues of arthropod consumers collected from ten maize farms intercropped with beans in western Kenya. Fallow fields' presence supported predation on Lepidopteran her-bivores by attracting predatory bugs and wasps, and mediated lower herbivory levels. Fallow size proportion corresponded to higher taxa-level predation by ants and spiders on phytophagous beetles, and overall increase in bean herbivory, but predicted no difference in maize or non-crop herbivory. Higher hedgerow volumes did not affect overall predation pressure, but supported increased bean herbivory by Lepidoptera, and lower maize consumption by Orthoptera. Exotic hedgerows supported highest wasp predation on Lepidoptera while spiders consumed significantly more Orthoptera and phytophagous beetle pests on indigenous-hedgerow farms. Simi-larly, exotic hedgerows corresponded to enhanced Lepidoptera bean herbivory while trophic linkage of maize and non-crops to pests overall, were stronger with indigenous hedgerows. Thus, in addition to thicker hedgerows, predatory spillover impacts of wasps, bugs and beetles can be enhanced with fallow presence and exotic hedgerows, and that of spiders and ants, with larger fallows. Overall, the choice, combination and application of farm habitat structural features to maximize predatory arthropods' contributions to pest biocontrol requires knowledge of focal crops, dominant pest groups and their most important predators. The findings demonstrate that fallow fields and hedgerows are significant in supporting the biological component of integrated crop pest management.

AB  - Ancient tea plantations possess extremely important economic and cultivation value. In China, ancient tea plantations with trees over 100 years old have been preserved. However, the status of soil microorganisms, soil fertility, and soil heavy metal pollution in these ancient tea plantations remains unclear. This study took four Dancong ancient tea plantations in Fenghuang, Chaozhou City, and Guangdong Province as the research objects. Soil samples were collected from the surface layer (0-20 cm) and subsurface layer (20-40 cm) of the ancient tea trees. The rhizosphere soil microbial diversity and soil nutrients were determined. On this basis, the soil fertility was evaluated by referring to the soil environmental quality standards so as to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the soil in the Dancong ancient tea plantations. This study found that Proteobacteria, Acidobacteriota, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacteria in the rhizosphere soil of the Dancong ancient tree tea plantation. Ascomycota and Mortierellomycota are the dominant fungal phyla. Subgroup_2, AD3, Acidothermus, and Acidibacter were the dominant bacterial genera. Saitozyma, Mortierella, and Fusarium are the dominant fungal genera. The redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed that at the bacterial phylum level, Verrucomicrobia showed positive correlations with alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen (AN), available potassium (AK), and total nitrogen (TN); Proteobacteria exhibited a positive correlation with available phosphorus (AP); and Gemmatimonadetes was positively correlated with total potassium (TK). At the fungal phylum level, Ascomycota demonstrated a positive correlation with TK. TN, AN, and TK were identified as key physicochemical indicators influencing soil bacterial diversity, while TN, AN, AP, and AK were the key physicochemical indicators affecting soil fungal diversity. This study revealed that the soil of Dancong ancient tea plantations has reached Level I fertility in terms of TN, TP, SOM, and AP. TK and AN show Level I or near-Level I fertility, but AK only meets Level III fertility for tea planting, serving as the main limiting factor for soil fertility quality. Considering the relatively abundant TK content in the tea plantations, potassium-solubilizing bacteria should be prioritized over blind potassium fertilizer application. Meanwhile, it is particularly noteworthy that AN and SOM are at extremely high levels. Sustained excess of AN and SOM may lead to over-proliferation of dominant microorganisms, inhibition of other functional microbial communities, and disruption of ecological balance. Therefore, optimizing nutrient input methods during fertilization is recommended.

AB  - Synopsis At the level of the whole muscle, contractile patterns during activity are a critical and necessary source of variation in function. Understanding if a muscle is actively lengthening, shorting, or remaining isometric has implications for how it is working to power a given behavior. When feeding, the muscles associated with the tongue, jaws, pharynx, and hyoid act together to transport food through the oral cavity and into the esophagus. These muscles have highly coordinated firing patterns, yet also exhibit high levels of regional heterogeneity in both their timing of activity and their contractile characteristics when active. These high levels of variation make investigations into function challenging, especially in systems where muscles power multiple behaviors. We used infant pigs as a model system to systematically evaluate variation in muscle firing patterns in two muscles (mylohyoid and genioglossus) during two activities (sucking and swallowing). We also evaluated the contractile characteristics of mylohyoid during activity in the anterior and posterior regions of the muscle. We found that the posterior regions of both muscles had different patterns of activity during sucking versus swallowing, whereas the anterior regions of the muscles did not. Furthermore, the anterior portion of mylohyoid exhibited concentric contractions when active during sucking, whereas the posterior portion was isometric during sucking and swallowing. This difference suggests that the anterior portion of mylohyoid in infant pigs is functioning in concert with the tongue and jaws to generate suction, whereas the posterior portion is likely acting as a hyoid stabilizer during sucking and swallowing. Our results demonstrate the need to evaluate both the contractile characteristics and activity patterns of a muscle in order to understand its function, especially in cases where there is potential for variation in either factor within a single muscle.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the impact of long-term repeated applications of different animal waste types and mineral fertilizer on soil phosphorus (P) fractions and chemical nature of P species. A long-term field experiment was conducted for 13 years on a sandy Alfisol in Santa Maria, southern Brazil. The treatments consisted of pig slurry, dairy slurry, pig deep-litter, mineral fertilizer, and an unfertilized control. Soil samples were taken from the 0-4 cm layer in July 2017 and analyzed using sequential chemical P fractionation, P K-edge X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (P-XANES), and mu-fluororescence spectroscopies. The continuous application of pig slurry, dairy slurry, and mineral fertilizer resulted in P accumulation in soils beyond the levels required for adequate plant nutrition. Pig deep-litter promoted P accumulation in more labile fractions, above all in the inorganic P form, while pig slurry, cattle slurry and mineral fertilizer increased more stable P fractions. The P-XANES analysis showed the association of goethite-bound P (69-72%) regardless of the source added to soil, while the formation of secondary species such as Ca-P, P-kaolinite, and DNA varied among animal wastes. The relative proportion of organic P as DNA was higher in pig slurry. Pig deep-litter and mineral fertilizer promoted the accumulation of species of amorphous-Ca-P. The long-term application of different types of animal waste and mineral fertilizer led to the accumulation of P in soils, with each source promoting accumulation in different species.

AB  - The European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) is one of the most numerous and widespread ungulate species in Europe, which has complicated the assessment of its genetic diversity on a range-wide scale. In this study, we present the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR) genetic diversity and population structure of roe deer in Europe based on the analyses of 3010 samples, which were described as European roe deer individuals. Our analyses revealed two main diversity hotspots, namely Eastern and Central Europe. We proposed that these hotspots result from the Siberian roe deer (C.pygargus) mtDNA introgression and the secondary contact of mtDNA clades, respectively. Significantly lower values of genetic diversity (nucleotide and haplotype diversity) were recorded in the peripheral areas of the species' range, including the southernmost parts of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) refugial areas. Roe deer population in Europe consists of 2-3 genetic groups according to SAMOVA, and 15-16 clusters identified by GENELAND. The main driver of roe deer population structure in the eastern parts of the continent has been introgression of mtDNA of C. pygargus. Spatial genetic analyses revealed a complex structure of roe deer on a pan-European scale, which presumably results from post-glacial recolonization of the continent from various parts of a large LGM refugial area by different roe deer mtDNA clades and haplogroups.

AB  - Aim: How communities of organisms come together has long fascinated scientists, with renewed interest in using functional and evolutionary patterns to infer mechanisms of community assembly. Ecological theory predicts that biotic interactions could lead to either divergence in the event of niche partitioning or convergence through the exclusion of competitively inferior species, but most macroecological studies attribute the latter to environmental influences. Here, we investigated the relative importance of these two opposing mechanisms across broad spatial gradients. We hypothesised stronger signals of: (i) convergence at high latitude owing to ecological generalism and (ii) divergence at low latitudes owing to specialisation.<br /> Major Taxa Studied: Reef-associated bony fishes.<br /> Location: Global.Time Period2006-2019.<br /> Methods: We used a global dataset on marine reef fish assemblages comprising 2476 species at 3325 sites to disentangle the biotic drivers of community assembly across > 100 degrees of latitude. We then applied a framework to remove environmental influences before examining whether any signs of biotic interactions remained in the trait and phylogenetic diversity of local communities relative to the (environmentally constrained) regional species pool, drawing on six functional traits and a phylogeny of bony fishes.<br /> Results: Local fish assemblages were more functionally and phylogenetically similar to each other than expected based on the regional species pool at higher latitude reefs (i.e., show greater convergence). This pattern was evident after accounting for major sources of local environmental variation, suggesting exclusion of weak competitors. Functional convergence was mainly driven by traits related to resource acquisition, with high-latitude assemblages converging towards more energetic carnivorous and planktivorous diets.<br /> Main Conclusions: Our results suggest that biotic interactions drive greater trait and phylogenetic convergence from tropical to temperate zones. Likely mechanisms include increasing generalism and overlap in ecological strategies towards the poles, leading to the exclusion of weak competitors.

AB  - Escaping from predators is fundamental for the survival of any prey species. Australian fauna within the 'critical weight range' (CWR; 35 g-5.5 kg) are vulnerable to introduced eutherian predators. The absence of co-evolution between native marsupials and these novel predators may suggest that their antipredator behaviour towards the hunting strategies of these predators is inappropriate or ineffective. We quantified the escape behaviour of eight CWR marsupial taxa (three quadrupedal bandicoots and five bipedal macropods) to determine if differences in how they escape from predators indicate their ability to respond appropriately and effectively to introduced predators. Animals were filmed escaping through a runway and 20 measures relating to their gait, speed and path characteristics were recorded. These were reduced to four dimensions using multidimensional scaling (MDS): MDS1 linear speed versus agility, MDS2 acceleration style, MDS3 reactivity and MDS4 gait characteristics. We found a strong link between the phylogenetic relatedness of species and their use of linear speed or agility when fleeing (phylogenetic heritability, h(2) = 0.96). Bipedal macropod species used straight-line, fast escapes, which may be suited to escape pursuit predators. The quadrupedal bandicoots had an overall slower escape but were more likely to use sudden changes of direction, which can be successful if pursued by a larger, less mobile predator or where there is sufficient vegetation cover to obstruct pursuit. Repeated exposure increased linear speed (MDS1) and hastened the timing of acceleration (MDS2). The phylogenetic signal for escape speed/straightness suggests specific escape tactics may be constrained by morphology, although animals increased the intensity of their response after repeated exposure, suggesting training could enhance effective antipredator responses.

AB  - Climate change is driving worldwide shifts in the distribution of biodiversity, and fundamental changes to global avian migrations. Some arctic-nesting species may shorten their migration distance as warmer temperatures allow them to winter closer to their high-latitude breeding grounds. However, such decisions are not without risks, since this intensifies pressure on resources when they are used for greater periods of time. In this study, we used an individual-based model to predict how future changes in food abundance, winter ice coverage, and human disturbance could impact an Arctic/sub-Arctic breeding goose species, black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans, Lawrence 1846), and their primary food source, common eelgrass (Zostera marina L.), at the Izembek Lagoon complex in southwest Alaska. Brant use the site during fall and spring migrations, and increasingly, for the duration of winter. The model was validated by comparing predictions to empirical observations of proportion of geese surviving, proportion of geese emigrating, mean duration of stay, mean rate of mass gain/loss, percentage of time spent feeding, number of bird days, peak population numbers, and distribution across the complex. The model predicted that reductions >50% of the current decadal (2007-2015) mean of eelgrass biomass, which have been observed in some years, or increases in the number of brant, could lead to a reduction in the proportion of birds that successfully migrate to their breeding grounds from the site. The model also predicted that access to eelgrass in lagoons other than Izembek was critical for overwinter survival and spring migration of brant, if overall eelgrass biomass was 50% of the decadal mean biomass. Geese were typically predicted to be more vulnerable to environmental change during winter and spring, when eelgrass biomass is lower, and thermoregulatory costs for the geese are higher than in fall. We discuss the consequences of these predictions for goose population trends in the face of natural and human drivers of change.

AB  - Simple Summary
   Yak adipose tissue may have evolved a unique energy metabolism manner that accommodates the organism's seasonal growth rhythms. Rare reports have shown that miRNAs regulate lipid metabolism in domestic yaks. In the present study, miR-2400 is a novel bovine miRNA; gain- and loss- function of bta-miR-2400 were performed in Yak preadipocytes, and it was revealed that bta-miR-2400 regulates lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in yak preadipocytes by directly targeting small ubiquitin like modifier 1 (SUMO1) to promote cell proliferation and inhibit differentiation. These findings will undoubtedly facilitate future studies of miRNA regulation in lipid metabolism in high-altitude animals.
   Yak adipose tissue may have evolved a unique energy metabolism manner to accommodate the organism's seasonal growth rhythms. MiRNAs regulate multiple biological processes including systemic metabolism and energy homeostasis through post-transcriptional regulations. Rare reports have shown that miRNAs regulate lipid metabolism in domestic yaks. Therefore, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms of bta-miR-2400 in modulating yak preadipocytes proliferation and differentiation. We found that bta-miR-2400 was highly expressed in adipose tissue. Overexpression of bta-miR-2400 in yak preadipocytes significantly enhanced cell proliferation, increased the number of EdU fluorescence-stained cells, and promoted the expression of proliferation marker genes (CDK2, CDK4 and PCNA). Besides, overexpression of bta-miR-2400 repressed the expression of adipogenesis-related marker genes, and the content of cellular triglyceride was substantially reduced. Conversely, inhibition of bta-miR-2400 showed opposite effects compared to those of bta-miR-2400 overexpression in yak preadipocytes. Further, luciferase reporter assays revealed that SUMO1 is a target gene of bta-miR-2400, with bta-miR-2400 being able to down-regulate SUMO1 mRNA and protein expression. In conclusion, bta-miR-2400 regulates lipid metabolism and energy homeostasis in yak preadipocytes by directly targeting SUMO1 to promote cell proliferation and inhibit differentiation.

AB  - Peninsular bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) are found exclusively in Southern California and Baja Mexico. They are federally endangered due to multiple threats, including introduced infectious disease. From 1981 to 2017, we conducted surveillance for 16 pathogens and estimated population sizes, adult survival, and lamb survival. We used mixed effects regression models to assess disease patterns at the individual and population levels. Pathogen infection/exposure prevalence varied both spatially and temporally. Our findings indicate that the primary predictor of individual pathogen infection/exposure was the region in which an animal was captured, implying that transmission is driven by local ecological or behavioral factors. Higher Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae seropositivity was associated with lower lamb survival, consistent with lambs having high rates of pneumonia-associated mortality, which may be slowing population recovery. There was no association between M. ovipneumoniae and adult survival. Adult survival was positively associated with population size and parainfluenza-3 virus seroprevalence in the same year, and orf virus seroprevalence in the previous year. Peninsular bighorn sheep are recovering from small population sizes in a habitat of environmental extremes, compounded by infectious disease. Our research can help inform future pathogen surveillance and population monitoring for the long-term conservation of this population.

AB  - The capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris, is a rodent that inhabits the wetlands of South America. Despite being widely distributed and having the nuclear genomes available, there has been a lack of information regarding the mitochondrial genome. To address this, we conducted the assembly and annotation of the capybara's mitochondrial genome and reconstructed the phylogeny of Parvorder Caviomorpha. The assembly was conducted under the de novo method with GetOrganelle, while the annotation was performed with MitoZ. Analysis of relative codon synonymous usage was conducted in the mitochondrial genomes of the capybara and two other Caviidae species: Cavia porcellus and Cavia aperea. The phylogenetic inference was conducted under the Maximum Likelihood method, using the 13 protein-coding genes, including the capybara as well as other 42 Caviomorpha mitochondrial genomes. The resulting capybara mitochondrial genome consisted of 16,681 bp, 37 genes (22 tRNAs, 2 rRNAs, and 13 protein-coding genes) and a control region. The number of genes and their arrangement corresponds to the pattern observed in most mammalian species. The capybara was recovered as a sister group of Cavia. Caviidae was reconstructed as a monophyletic group that is closely related to Cuniculidae. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the mitochondrial evolution and evolutionary relationships of the capybara.

AB  - Mammals host a diversity of parasites including lice. Using cophylogenetics and phylogenetic comparative methods, the authors show that the main lineages of placental mammal lice had a single common ancestor and find that all parasitic lice had an avian ancestral host.
   Mammals host a wide diversity of parasites. Lice, comprising more than 5,000 species, are one group of ectoparasites whose major lineages have a somewhat patchwork distribution across the major groups of mammals. Here we explored patterns in the diversification of mammalian lice by reconstructing a higher-level phylogeny of these lice, leveraging whole genome sequence reads to assemble single-copy orthologue genes across the genome. The evolutionary tree of lice indicated that three of the major lineages of placental mammal lice had a single common ancestor. Comparisons of this parasite phylogeny with that for their mammalian hosts indicated that the common ancestor of elephants, elephant shrews and hyraxes (that is, Afrotheria) was the ancestral host of this group of lice. Other groups of placental mammals obtained their lice via host-switching out of these Afrotherian ancestors. In addition, reconstructions of the ancestral host group (bird versus mammal) for all parasitic lice supported an avian ancestral host, indicating that the ancestor of Afrotheria acquired these parasites via host-switching from an ancient avian host. These results shed new light on the long-standing question of why the major groups of parasitic lice are not uniformly distributed across mammals and reveal the origins of mammalian lice.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems, though ecologically beneficial, remain underrepresented in the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy and are seldom studied in Mediterranean contexts. The current study assesses both the environmental and economic aspects of five typical silvopastoral systems in central Greece, encompassing cattle, sheep, and goat farming. A Life Cycle Assessment approach was implemented to quantify greenhouse gas emissions using economic allocation, distributing impacts between milk and meat outputs. Enteric fermentation was the major emission source, accounting for up to 65.14% of total emissions in beef-based systems, while feeding and soil emissions were more prominent in mixed and small ruminant systems. Total farm-level emissions ranged from 60,609 to 273,579 kg CO2eq per year. Economically, only beef-integrated systems achieved an average annual profitability above EUR 20,000 per farm, based on financial data averaged over the last five years (2020-2024) from selected case studies in central Greece, while the remaining systems fell below the national poverty threshold for an average household, underscoring concerns about their economic viability. The findings underline the dual challenges of economic viability and policy neglect, stressing the need for targeted support if these multifunctional systems are to add value to EU climate goals and rural sustainability.

AB  - Pyrolysis is a useful alternative to current waste management practices. Manure biochars can be used as C-rich soil amendments, reducing the risk of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions derived from unpyrolyzed manure decomposition. In this study, two manure biochars and their feedstock were used as soil treatments to evaluate the impact of pyrolysis on CO2 and N2O emissions, C stability, and global warming potential (GWP) for one year under field conditions. The experiment included five treatments: unamended soil (control), pig manure (PM), pig manure biochar (PMB), dairy manure (DM), and dairy manure biochar (DMB). The amendments were applied at a 1% w/w, adding approximately 0.5 kg C m(-2). All amendments increased soil CO2 emissions; however, C mineralization was lower in pyrolyzed manures than in their corresponding feedstocks. CO2-C emissions were 8.35%, and 63% of the C from biochar and manure treatments, respectively. Biochars reduced soil N2O emissions, producing a negative N2O emission factor (N2O Ef), whereas manure treatments induced N2O fluxes for 105 days, with an N2O Ef of 0.27% after one year. Soil C stock variations were 16.4 and 6.58 t CO2-eq avoided ha(-1) in treatments of biochars and manures, respectively. The mitigation potential of unpyrolyzed manure was affected by the high CO2 and N2O fluxes, whereas the biochar treatments reduced the GWP due to the changes in soil C stock with a low impact on soil emissions. Manure was more stable after pyrolysis, indicating that manure biochars are more favorable as soil amendments for environmental purposes. This could reduce the C footprint of pig and dairy farms, promoting the enhancement of soil C stocks.

AB  - Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic zoonosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii which infects warm-blooded species worldwide. Humans can be infected through ingestion of tissue cysts from raw or undercooked meat, including game meat. A nationwide large-scale cross-sectional study was conducted to assess exposure to T. gondii in seven wild ruminant species in Spain. A total of 2,040 serum samples from 77 sampling sites randomly distributed in the five bioregions (BRs) covering mainland Spain were tested for antibodies against T. gondii using the modified agglutination test. The overall seroprevalence was 22.0% (449/2,040). Seroprevalence by species in decreasing order was as follows: 39.6% (141/356) in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), 37.1% (138/372) in fallow deer (Dama dama), 16.6% (92/553) in red deer (Cervus elaphus), 14.0% (26/186) in Southern chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica), 11.5% (24/209) in mouflon (Ovis aries musimon), 7.8% (27/346) in Iberian wild goat (Capra pyrenaica) and 5.6% (1/18) in Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia). Seropositivity was detected in 74.0% (57/77) of the sampling sites. Results indicate widespread but not homogeneous exposure to T. gondii in wild ruminant populations in Spain during the last two decades and highlight differences related to animal species and spatial distribution of these species in this country; this implies potential consequences of T. gondii for animal health, conservation and public health.

AB  - The native Konza tallgrass prairie is maintained by two key natural processes, periodic fire and ungulate grazing. As a potential crucial feedback mechanism, how fire and grazing influence plant root traits and soil properties in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem remains less known. Here, we investigated the effects of long-term fire and grazing regimes on soil physical properties and root traits at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, near Manhattan, KS, USA. Soil cores were collected under control (unburned and ungrazed), fire (annually burned), grazing (annually grazed), and fire + grazing (annually burned and grazed) treatments. Soil water retention, total root volume, specific root length, specific root area, and root biomass were measured. We found that both fire and grazing significantly reduced soil water retention, increased soil bulk density and soil microporosity (<50 mu m), and reduced macroporosity (>50 mu m) compared to the unburned and ungrazed treatment. Fire and grazing also significantly reduced litter accumulation by 79 % (burned), 57 % (grazed), and 77 % (burned and grazed). Fire increased specific root area by 15 %. Grazing and fire + grazing significantly decreased specific root length by 40 % and 29 %, and specific root area by 33 % and 24 %, respectively. Litter production was positively related to soil volumetric water content and soil pore volume of 300-50 mu m, but negatively related to soil bulk density and soil pore volume of less 50 mu m. Soil volumetric water content was positively correlated to specific root lengths, and soil bulk density was negatively related to specific root length and specific root area. There was a significant negative relationship between root diameter and soil volumetric water content under burned and grazed treatment. The SEM model showed that fire, grazing, and fire + grazing regimes were associated with dead root biomass (R-2 = 0.38) and root length density (R-2 = 0.40) indirectly through soil bulk density and litter accumulation. Our findings suggested that the annual fire + grazing regime seriously leads to the degradation of tallgrass prairie by influencing soil physical properties, reducing root trait functions and root biomass, and altering the relationship between root diameter and soil volumetric water content.

In the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), a shallow subtropical estuary, one harmful bloom was co-dominated by an unresolved prochlorophyte in the Family Prochlorothricaceae, which reached densities of > 10(6) cells ml(-1) engendering the term "Superbloom." Experiments were conducted to evaluate grazing rates and the potential for top-down control by an abundant herbivorous copepod, Parvocalanus crassirostris, on the prochlorophyte. Those grazing rates were lower than the rates on a palatable alternative algal food, Isochrysis galbana, when both algal species were presented in monocultures with identical densities. Grazing on the prochlorophyte decreased or ceased at densities over 4.8 x 10(5) cells ml(-1). When the prochlorophyte and the palatable alternative each comprised half of the total density, both species were consumed, but grazing on I. galbana was reduced compared to the grazing rates in a monoculture of this species, especially at higher cell densities. Copepod mortality was observed in treatments with high concentrations of the prochlorophyte, and these treatments contained mucilage. Experiments simulating viscosities produced by prochlorophyte mucilage yielded results consistent with the original grazing experiments (i.e., copepods showed lower grazing rates and higher mortality rates in higher viscosity treatments). Results reveal potential limitations of top-down controls by this grazer on prochlorophyte blooms and HABs that produce mucilage.

AB  - Organisms are not just passive recipients of environmental pressures but can shape the environment they experience. Yet, the mechanisms and evolutionary implications of such niche construction remain poorly understood. Here, we studied these effects in the gazelle dung beetle (Digitonthophagus gazella). Larvae of this species develop in an underground brood chamber (a 'brood ball') composed of dung, which serves as the sole source of food for a single larva. Throughout its development, the larva extensively modifies its environment by constantly eating, regurgitating and shaping particle sizes within the brood ball. Previous research suggests that these larval manipulations increase environmental quality and nutrient availability. However, how larval modifications affect larval growth and how these modifications differ between species remain poorly understood. We studied the impact of larval environmental modifications by transplanting eggs into previously modified or unmodified environments, whilst controlling for the confounding effect of maternally derived microbes. Additionally, we also studied how D. gazella larvae grow in an environment that was modified by a different species (Onthophagus binodis) to investigate species-specific differences of niche construction. Counter to expectations, we found that larval modifications by conspecifics did not confer a fitness benefit to D. gazella. However, surprisingly, individuals developing in a brood ball modified by a heterospecific individual emerged significantly quicker. These findings provide mixed support that environmental modifications by a larva enhance its growth. Our research adds to the growing literature on the complex interactions between organisms and their environment and how those interactions feed back on organismal development and performance.

AB  - Wildlife disease outbreaks can lead to population declines, which are usually attributed to increased direct or indirect mortality. Alternatively, behavior associated with sickness can lead to social isolation, potentially decreasing fitness of affected individuals. A useful case study to examine this dynamic is chronic wasting disease (CWD), a neurological disease of cervids, known to affect behavior and movement. In this study, we monitored scraping, a White-tailed Deer (Odocoileus virginianus; WTD) breeding season behavior, in an area of high CWD prevalence to determine if this reproductive behavior is affected by CWD. At 107 scrape sites, we detected 3,063 scrape interactions and 218 unique bucks. Bucks engaged with scrapes most often, performing 73% of interactions-compared to 23% by does, and 4% by fawns. Twenty-one bucks captured on camera traps at scrape sites were harvested through recreational hunting, 13 testing CWD-positive and 8 CWD not-detected. We found no significant effect of CWD status on specific scraping behaviors. There may, however, have been population-level effects, with shifts toward greater proportions of scraping by yearling bucks and during daylight hours compared to findings from past studies.
   Chronic wasting disease could affect reproduction due to its neurological effects on behavior. In studying scraping behavior in White-tailed Deer, we found no effects on behaviors of an individual, but evidence of population-level changes in reproductive behavior.

AB  - The continuing loss and degradation of their natural habitats forces some wildlife species to increasingly extend their habitats into farmlands, thereby intensifying conflicts with people as resources diminish. Despite massive expansion in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations in recent decades, little is known about the diversity and distribution of wild mammals in rubber-dominated landscapes or the associated human-wildlife conflicts. We assessed the presence and diversity of mammalian wildlife and damage occurrence in such rubber landscapes in southern Thailand, in and around Tai Rom Yen National Park. We interviewed 180 farmers about wildlife visits to their farms and the resulting damage. We conducted 50 transect walks within and adjacent to a natural forest and deployed camera traps at the boundary between the plantations and the forest, as well as deeper into the forest, to assess wildlife presence. A total of 35 mammal species were recorded inside the forest. More than 70% of these were also present at the forest boundary, but species presence and diversity were far lower in the farmland. Elephants (Elephas maximus) were responsible for 90% of wildlife damage incidents within the rubber plantations, with 86% of these cases affecting young plants that had not yet been tapped. Although almost half of the survey respondents reported elephants visiting their farms, less than half of them reported damage. These results suggest that rubber-dominated landscapes surrounding protected areas have the potential to facilitate coexistence between people and certain wildlife species, particularly if young plants are better protected and plantation management is made more wildlife friendly.

AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are key for biodiversity conservation and natural resource management, contributing to ecosystem services. However, fixed MPA boundaries present challenges for species with large geographic ranges, such as marine mammals. It is essential to evaluate the role of international MPA networks in protecting species like the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) and the Southern right whale (Eubalaena australis), whose distribution spans the southern coasts of Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. MPA networks can benefit from manager interactions through information exchange, knowledge sharing, and joint management strategies, addressing socio-environmental issues more effectively. In this study, we used graph theory and complex network analysis to investigate the structure of interactions among 27 MPAs based on interviews with managers across the three countries. Our findings reveal that interactions are limited to within-country networks, with no transboundary cooperation for the conservation of O. flavescens and E. australis. The networks showed low density, with geographic and hierarchical proximity influencing interaction likelihood. Management networks were generally broader than species-specific biological networks. Although our study is limited by its reliance on self-reported data and the absence of direct geospatial validation, the findings underscore critical governance gaps and emphasize the urgent need for enhanced international collaboration in the conservation of marine megafauna in the South Atlantic. Strengthening both national and transnational networks of MPAs is essential to ensure the effective protection of migratory marine species.

AB  - Prey selection is a fundamental aspect of ecology that drives evolution and community structure, yet the impact of intraspecific variation on the selection for prey size remains largely unaccounted for in ecological theory. Here, we explored puma (Puma concolor) prey selection across six study sites in North and South America. Our results highlighted the strong influence of season and prey availability on puma prey selection, and the smaller influence of puma age. Pumas in all sites selected smaller prey in warmer seasons following the ungulate birth pulse. Our top models included interaction terms between sex and age, suggesting that males more than females select larger prey as they age, which may reflect experiential learning. When accounting for variable sampling across pumas in our six sites, male and female pumas killed prey of equivalent size, even though males are larger than females, challenging assumptions about this species. Nevertheless, pumas in different study sites selected prey of different sizes, emphasizing that the optimal prey size for pumas is likely context-dependent and affected by prey availability. The mean prey weight across all sites averaged 1.18 times mean puma weight, which was less than predicted as the optimal prey size by energetics and ecological theory (optimal prey = 1.45 puma weight). Our results help refine our understanding of optimal prey for pumas and other solitary carnivores, as well as corroborate recent research emphasizing that carnivore prey selection is impacted not just by energetics but by the effects of diverse ecology.
   Season, prey availability, and age influence the size of prey selected by pumas across six sites in North and South America. The optimal prey size for pumas appears context-dependent, although evidence suggests it is smaller than predicted by ecological theory. Males and females killed similar-sized prey, even though males are much larger, and males more than females killed larger prey as they aged.image

AB  - The thermal environment is important in unit production because the perception of thermal stress can reduce fertility, and productive performance, therefore its management is necessary. The use of non-invasive methods, such as infrared thermography and real-time ultrasonography, are widely used to evaluate indicators in animal production, without the need to slaughter the animals. Thus, we aimed to assess the effect of the thermal environment on the physiological parameters and carcass characteristics of Dorper sheep with positive and negative residual feed intake (RFI) using infrared thermography and real-time ultrasonography techniques. Twenty uncastrated male Dorper sheep (17.8 +/- 2.4 kg) were confined for 40 days for RFI classification. Sheep were separated into positive RFI (n = 10) and negative RFI (n = 10). The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, with 2 thermal environments (full sun or shade) and two feed efficiency groups (positive RFI or negative RFI), with 5 replications. The sheep remained in confinement for 60 days. The animals were slaughtered at the end of the experiment and the carcasses dissected for tissue separation. Rectal temperature (RT) and respiratory rate (RR) were measured at two times (14:00 h and 18:00 h) for periods of 5 days. The RR was determined by indirect auscultation of heart sounds at the level of the laryngotracheal region. The RT was measured introduced a digital clinical thermometer into the animal's rectum. Surface temperature (ST) was obtained using a thermographic infrared camera, collecting the temperatures of the eyeball and skin surface in the regions of the head, ribs, rump, flank and shin. Sheep confined in full sun showed higher RR (P = 0.0001), ST ribs (P = 0.0020), ST rumb (P = 0.0055), ST flank (P = 0.0001) and heat tolerance coefficient (HTC) (P = 0.0010). For sheep confined in full sun, a strong correlation was observed between the RR and the mean ST (MST; r = 0.6826; P = 0.0236) and between the final loin eye area (LEAf) with the real LEA (LEAr) (r = 0.9263; P = 0.0001) and slaughter body weight (SBW) (r = 0.7532; P = 0.0325). For negative RFI sheep, a positive correlation was observed between the RR and the ST rump (r = 0.7343; P = 0.0025) and ST ribs (r = 0.6560; P = 0.0178) and the MST (r = 0.7435; P = 0.0001), between the MST and the LEAr (r = 0.6837; P = 0.0025) and the final LEA (r = 0.6771; P = 0.0144), and between the final LEA and LEAr (r = 0.9942; P = 0.0001), BW (r = 0.8415; P = 0.0277) and MST (r = 0.6771; P = 0.0045). Positive RFI sheep confined to shade showed a high correlation between final LEA and LEAr (r = 0.9372; P = 0.0001). The use of shading in confined Dorper sheep, regardless of the RFI classification, reduces the effects of heat stress on physiological parameters.

This study developed a county-level emission inventory of particles and gases pollution based on field measured emission factors and detailed activity data for the QTP in 2019. The results revealed that the total emissions of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), eight ions, fifty-one polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in gaseous and particulate phases, 108 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO, and CO2 were 41.1, 23.1, 2.36, 3.15, 1.13, 6.55, 135, and 4963 Gg, respectively. Gonghe, Qilian, Nyima, and Gangcha Counties in northeast of Qinghai and northwestern Tibet were the major contributors of all pollutants contributed (accounting for 11.9%-14.6% of the total emission) due to their higher livestock numbers. Sheep dung burning contributed a little more (average of 67.1%) than yak dung burning (32.9%) due to the high EFs and consumptions. For temporal distribution, the heating season contributed majority of the total emissions (70%-82%). Although with much less population, the QTP showed even higher emission densities than those in plain areas due to less oxygen and poor combustion technology. Compared with existing emission inventories, the uncertainties of all pollutant emission inventories were considerably reduced (42.7-163%), with EC as an exception because of its high coefficients of variation of EFs than the other pollutants. The developed emission inventory can help formulate targeted air pollution control measures for the QTP region by providing detailed information on the spatiotemporal distribution of multitype air pollutants. Meanwhile, the relative high resolution and accuracy inventory could serve a better basis for atmospheric modeling such as pollution transportation and source apportionment in both regional and global scales.

AB  - Spatial epidemiology tools play a critical role in effectively allocating resources to curb the spread of animal diseases. This study focuses on classical scrapie (CS), an animal prion disease identified in Portugal, which infects small ruminant flocks and has been shown to be experimentally transmissible to wild cervids. Utilising remote sensing technologies and semi-automatic classification models, we aimed to evaluate the risk of interspecies prion transmission from domestic small ruminants to wild cervids (hosts). To achieve this, we gathered data related to hosts and infected small ruminant flocks. Furthermore, we collected and processed freely available, medium-resolution satellite imagery to derive vegetative and biophysical spectral indices capable of representing the primary habitat features. By employing a pixel-based species distribution model, we integrated the compiled geographical distribution data and spectral data with five supervised classification algorithms (random forest, classification tree analysis, artificial neural network, generalised linear model, and generalised additive model). The consensus map allowed accurate predictions of spatialised regions exhibiting spectral characteristics similar to where CS and its hosts were initially identified. By overlapping suitable territories for disease and host occurrence, we created a spatially explicit tool that assesses the risk of prion spill-over from domestic small ruminants to wild cervids. The described methodology is highly replicable and freely accessible, thus emphasising its practical utility. This study underscores the substantial contribution of model-based spatial analysis to disease monitoring and lays the groundwork for defining populations at risk and implementing targeted control and prevention strategies, thus safeguarding both animal and public health.

AB  - 1. In forest fragments, microclimatic conditions differ between interior and forest edges and also vary with geographical orientation. These microclimatic variations could affect plant-insect food webs and the ecological processes in which they are involved.
   2. We evaluated the effects of microclimatic conditions, and the direct and indirect effects caused by changes in plant resources and leafminer abundance on leafminer herbivory and parasitism in the interior, and north and south-facing edges of Chaco Serrano forest fragments in central Argentina.
   3. In the interior, and north and south-facing edges of six forest fragments, we recorded: microclimatic variables, plant resource characteristics, leaf-mining larvae availability, and leafminer herbivory and parasitism at plant community level and in three species (Croton lachnostachyus, Cestrum parqui, and Solanum argentinum).
   4. Herbivory was higher in north-facing edges compared to south-facing edges, while parasitism was generally greater in edges than in the interior. Temperature fluctuations positively affected plant community herbivory (through changes in leafminer abundance) but negatively affected S. argentinum herbivory via changes in foliar area and leaf-mining larvae availability. Lower humidity levels directly favoured parasitism at plant community level, whereas higher thermal variations enhanced the parasitism of S. argentinum leafminers. Greater solar radiation favoured parasitism of C. lachnostachyus leafminers.
   5. Our results highlighted idiosyncrasy of each studied system (plant community and focal plant species), which responded differently to microclimate, and showed that mechanisms triggering herbivory and parasitism were different. The interior, and north and south-facing edges of these forest fragments may function as differential micro-refuges for herbivores and parasitoids under global warming context.

AB  - Simple Summary Diaphorina citri is a crucial natural vector of the Huanglongbing pathogen, which has devastated the citrus industry. The host plant is a critical factor that affects insect biology and its symbiont abundance. However, little is known about how host plants affect the bacterial community located in D. citri. In this work, the guts of five different host-plant-feeding populations (i.e., Citrus reticulata cv. Shatangju, Citrus poonensis cv. Ponkan, Murraya paniculata (orange jasmine), Citrus limon (lemon), and Citrus sinensis (navel orange)) were analyzed for bacterial communities by next-generation sequencing. The dominant phylum was Proteobacteria. The most common and abundant bacterial genera in D. citri were Wolbachia, Escherichia-Shigella, and Candidatus Profftella, but their relative abundance varied among the different host plant groups. There were obvious differences in the gut microbiota among the different hosts, and the gut microbe diversity was the highest in the ponkan-feeding population, while the lowest was in the Shatangju-feeding population. Overall, our findings indicate that the host plant can significantly affect the gut microbial community of D. citri. This result can provide new insights into the co-adaptation of D. citri and its symbionts. Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) can cause severe damage to citrus plants, as it transmits Candidatus Liberibacter spp., a causative agent of Huanglongbing disease. Symbiotic bacteria play vital roles in the ecology and biology of herbivore hosts, thereby affecting host growth and adaptation. In our research, the effects of Rutaceous plants (i.e., Citrus reticulata cv. Shatangju, Citrus poonensis cv. Ponkan, Murraya paniculata (orange jasmine), Citrus limon (lemon), and Citrus sinensis (navel orange)) on the gut microbiota (GM) and microbial diversity of D. citri adults were investigated by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. It was found that Proteobacteria dominated the GM communities. The gut microbe diversity was the highest in the ponkan-feeding population, and the lowest in the Shatangju-feeding population. The NMDS analysis revealed that there were obvious differences in the GM communities among the different hosts. PICRUSt function prediction indicated significant differences in host function, and those pathways were crucial for maintaining population reproduction, growth, development, and adaptation to environmental stress in D. citri. Our study sheds new light on the interactions between symbionts, herbivores, and host plants and expands our knowledge on host adaptation related to GM in D. citri.

AB  - Roads are not the only determining factor for wildlife movement across the landscape, but due to the extensive distribution of the road network their impact can be dramatic. Although it has been well documented that roads decrease habitat connectivity for wildlife due to animal-vehicle collisions, habitat fragmentation, and avoidance behavior, approaches for identifying connectivity across the landscape often do not fully examine the barrier effect of roads. Here, we explored the extent of the impact of roadways on wildlife connectivity by using Omniscape to model connectivity including and without the barrier effect of roads, then evaluating the difference between these two models. We created these connectivity models for three organisms that represent different taxa, movement types, and habitat requirements: northern red-legged frog, Pacific-slope flycatcher, and Columbian black-tailed deer. We found that roads had a strong impact on connectivity for all three species. Change in flow was most pronounced on the roads, especially where they ran through permeable habitat for a species. Roads also influenced connectivity well beyond the footprint of the roadway, affecting flows intersecting the roads and diffusely around them. The extent and nature of this impact depended on the species, road density, and surrounding habitat. The different effects across species highlight the importance of considering different taxa simultaneously while planning. Moreover, the ability to assess modeled wildlife habitat connectivity in the absence of existing widespread linear infrastructure allows for critical evaluation of where mitigation activities, such as wildlife crossing structures and fencing, may be most beneficial. Hence, this novel approach has practical application for increasing connectivity for wildlife across roads.

AB  - This paper reports the first benchmarking of smallholder tilapia farming practices in rural northern Zambia, measuring fish growth, feed utilization and water quality parameters, using a participatory action research approach. The effects of three different feeding regimes that are currently used in smallholder farming systems in northern Zambia on the growth of the native tilapia, Oreochromis macrochir, were tested with 15 farmers (40% female), each having three ponds (one pond per feed treatment per farmer = 45 in total), over eight months in 2016-2017. The three feed treatments included: (1) formulated feed only comprising maize and soybean; (2) goat manure only; and (3) formulated feed and manure together. Three hundred (300) O. macrochir mixed-sex fingerlings, 0.5 +/- 0.1 g average weight, were stocked in each pond. Water quality (pH, dissolved oxygen, and water temperature and transparency) was measured monthly, as was fish growth in each pond by randomly sampling thirty (30) fish and taking individual weights and lengths. Results showed that the water quality parameters were broadly similar in the different feed treatments over the eight-month experiment period, except for the water transparency values that were higher in the feed only treatment when compared to the other two treatments at months four through eight. Means for survival rate, weight gain, specific growth rate, total amount of fish harvested, and yield were all higher for the feed and manure together treatment than the other two feed treatments at the end of the experiment. A linear mixed-effects regression analysis that controlled for several fixed effects and included pond as a random effect found that the feed and manure together treatment increased fish growth by 10.8 +/- 3.7 g at month eight compared to the manure only treatment. The analysis also found a negative effect on fish growth (-9.4 +/- 3.8 g) in ponds that used the feed only treatment. The pond effect accounted for 10.1% of the total variance in the data at month eight. Future research and development efforts in Zambia should examine more closely the factors that influence fish growth and that make up the pond effect to determine which innovations and better management practices could help smallholder farmers increase the productivity of their ponds.

AB  - Urbanisation has a wide range of impacts on biodiversity, but its effects on parasitic arthropods, particularly those of bats, remain poorly studied. Ectoparasites of the large-footed myotis (Myotis macropus) in eastern Australia were sampled from 10 roost sites across an urban gradient. In total, 265 bats were examined and 447 ectoparasites were collected, comprising three species of Hippoboscoidea: Basilia hamsmithi (Nycteribiidae), Penicillidia setosala (Nycteribiidae), Brachytarsina amboinensis (Streblidae), and an acarine, Spinturnix novaehollandiae (Mesostigmata, Spinturnicidae). Degree of urbanisation was found to have a significant effect on the abundance of the batfly B. hamsmithi but had no significant effect on the abundance of the wing mite S. novaehollandiae. We hypothesise that this is due to differences in the life history of these two species and the advantage components of these differences confer in exploiting variations in host roost habits. The prevalence of the batfly B. hamsmithi was high in urban sites but comparatively low in suburban and non-urban sites. Mass, sex, and body condition were found to have no significant impact on either the parasite load or the chance of infestation. Both P. setosala and B. amboinensis were recorded from M. macropus for the first time, though only in small numbers. They were associated with mixed-species roosts in a suburban site and are evidence of parasite spillover between sympatric bat species.

AB  - Oak hybridization have important effects on the structure of herbivorous insect communities and associated natural enemies. We tested the effects of hybridization between Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa on insect gallers trophic networks and their parasitoids. We characterized the genotypes of 35 individuals of Q. magnoliifolia, 30 of Q. resinosa, and 57 hybrids using eight nuclear microsatellite markers. We collected 6,798 galls from the oak hybrid complex distributed in 33 gall morphospecies on Q. magnoliifolia, 28 on Q. resinosa, and 42 on hybrid oaks. Galler-parasitoid networks were realized by 21 gall morphospecies and 21 parasitoid species for Q. magnoliifolia; 16 gall morphospecies and 30 parasitoid species for Q. resinosa; and 25 gall morphospecies and 23 parasitoid species for hybrids. Plant-galler networks were different among three oak groups, having the hybrid network higher values of diversity of interactions, nestedness and modularity and lower values of specialization than Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa networks. Hybrid network of gallers and parasitoids had higher diversity of interactions, connectance and generality and lower modularity than Q. magnoliifolia and Q. resinosa networks. Hybrids are more vulnerable to insect galler incidence having low pressure by parasitoids, which allow more gall incidence in hybrid plants. Our study corroborated that hybridization generates changes in oak genetic composition influencing insect gallers trophic networks and their parasitoids. Our findings are also consistent with the rule of genetic similarity which suggest a relationship between plant genetics and the associated arthropod community, where genetically similar plants support similar arthropod communities.

AB  - Due to the development of urbanization and industrialization, a large amount of cultivated land resources has been occupied, while new reclamation land could expand the supply of usable land for food security. Organic fertilizers, such as crop residues, biosolids, sheep manure, mushroom residue, and biogas liquid, have been considered as an effective amendment in immature soil to improve its quality. Recently, two kinds of commercial organic fertilizers, pig manure and mushroom residue organic fertilizer (PMMR-OF), and sheep manure organic fertilizer (SM-OF), have been more regularly applied in agriculture production. However, the information available on effect of the two kinds of fertilizers on plant growth and rhizosphere soil properties in immature field is very limited. In order to evaluate PMMR-OF and SM-OF on immature soil, the soil quality and microbial community structure of corn rhizosphere soil samples under the two kinds of organic fertilizers at different concentrations was investigated. The results revealed a significant difference between commercial organic fertilizers (especially SM-OF) and chemical compound fertilizers (CCF) in soil properties and microbial community structure. Indeed, compared with the control based on16S and ITS amplicon sequencing of soil microflora, SM-OF caused a 10.79-19.52%, 4.33-4.39%,and 14.58-29.29% increase in Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Ascomycota, but a 5.82-20.58%, 0.53-24.06%, 10.87-16.79%, 2.69-10.50%, 44.90-59.24%, 8.88-10.98%, and 2.31-21.98% reduction in Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Chytridiomycota, respectively. CCF caused a 24.11%, 23.28%, 38.87%, 19.88%, 18.28%, and 13.89% reduction in Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, but a 22.77%, 41.28%, 7.88%, and 19.39% increase in Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Mortierellomycota, respectively. Furthermore, redundancy discriminant analysis of microbial communities and soil properties of PMMR-OF, SM-OF, CCF, and the control treatments indicated that the main variables of bacterial and fungal communities included organic matter content, available P, and available K. Overall, the results of this study revealed significant changes under different fertilizer conditions (PMMR-OF, SM-OF, CCF, under different concentrations) in microbiota and chemical properties of corn soil. Commercial organic fertilizers, particularly SM-OF, can be used as a good amendment for the new reclamation land.

AB  - After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident in 2011, the wild boar (Sus scrofa) population within the Fukushima Evacuation Zone (FEZ) increased substantially in size and distribution. This growing population and their potential dispersal from the FEZ, where they are exposed to high levels of radionuclides, into the surrounding landscape underscores the need to better understand boar movement patterns in order to establish policies for managing shipping restrictions for boar meat and develop management strategies. In this study, we quantified the genetic population structure of boar in and around Fukushima prefecture using sequence data of the mitochondrial DNA control region and MIG-seq analysis using 348 boar samples to clarify boar dispersal patterns. Among boar samples, seven Asian haplotypes and one European haplotype were detected. The European haplotype originated from hybridization between domestic pigs and native boar in the evacuation zone after the accident and was detected in 15 samples across a broad geographic area. Our MIG-seq analysis revealed genetic structure of boar was significantly different between boar inhabiting the eastern (including FEZ. i.e., East clade) and western (i.e., West clade) regions in Fukushima prefecture. In addition, we investigated the relationships between boar dispersal and Cesium (Cs) -137 activity concentrations in boar muscle using MIG-seq genetic data in Nihonmatsu city, located in the central -northern region of Fukushima. High Cs -137 activity concentrations, exceeding 1000 Bq/kg, in boar muscle had a significantly high probability of belonging to the East clade within localized regions. Thus, our results provide evidence of the spatial scale of dispersal of individuals or offspring of boar from the FEZ. Results of this research also indicate that dispersal of individuals between areas with different Cs -137 contamination levels is one of the biggest factors contributing to variation in Cs -137 activity concentration in boar muscle within localized regions.

AB  - The impacts of contaminants on wildlife are dose dependent, and thus being able to track or predict exposure following contamination events is important for monitoring ecosystem health. However, the ability to track exposure in free -ranging wildlife is often severely limited. Consequently, researchers have predominantly relied on simple methods for estimating contaminant exposures in wildlife with little regard for spatial contaminant heterogeneity or an animal's use of diverse habitats. We evaluated the influence sampling scale (i.e., how finely contaminant distribution and organism's spatial use of the landscape is mapped) has on (1) realism and (2) conservativeness of exposure estimates. To do this, we monitored the actual exposure of wild boar (Sus scrofa) in Fukushima, Japan to radioactive contamination using GPS-coupled contaminant monitors placed on individual animals. We compared empirical exposures to estimates generated by combining varying amounts of information about an individual boar's location and/or movement, with the distribution of contamination on the landscape. We found that the most realistic exposure estimates were produced when finer -scale contaminant distribution surveys (e.g., airborne surveys) were combined with more accurate estimates of an individual's space use (e.g., home ranges or core areas). Importantly, estimates of exposure based on single point surveys at a trap site (a simple method commonly used in the literature), did not correlate with actual exposure rates, suggesting doseeffects studies using this method may result in spurious conclusions. These results suggest that researchers seeking realistic estimates of exposure, such as in dose -effect studies, should ensure they have adequately accounted for fine -scale contaminant distribution patterns and areas of higher use by study organisms. However, conservative estimates of exposure (i.e., intentionally over -predicting exposure as is done in initial tiers of ecological risk analyses) were not as scale sensitive and could be achieved with a single known location and coarse contaminant distribution maps.

AB  - We studied the seasonal variation of adaptive humoral immunity (AHI) in northern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys rutilus Pallas, 1779, RBV) and gray-sided vole (C. rufocanus Sundevall, 1846, GSV) in Tomsk region of Western Siberia. Immunoresponsiveness (IR) to sheep red blood cells was assessed by the number of antibody-producing cells in the spleen. The use of a generalized linear model to analyze the effects of species, sex, year of research, and season of withdrawal of individuals from nature on IR showed a significant effect of species identity, season of animal capture, and the interaction of species with season. The RBV demonstrated higher immune responses during a year, and both species had higher IR in winter. Suppression of IR in spring was greater, started earlier, and lasted longer (March-May) in GSV. In RBV, immunosuppression was restricted to April. The significant negative within year correlations of IR with body mass and masses of reproductive organs in GSV indicated a trade-off between AHI and growth and reproduction processes. A probable explanation for the difference between species in the seasonal variation of AHI may be related to the difference in tropho-energetic requirements of each vole species. GSV is a predominantly herbivorous rodent and its thermoregulation seems less efficient than of RBV. The deeper spring immunosuppression in GSV may explain in part its higher mortality during the season of colds.

AB  - Onchocercosis is a parasitic disease caused by over 30 Onchocerca spp. (Nematoda: Filarioidea) and predomi-nantly affecting ungulates. Four Onchocerca spp. have been described in the European red deer (Cervus elaphus). Onchocerca flexuosa and Onchocerca jakutensis form subcutaneous nodules in the back region. The other two species, Onchocerca skrjabini and the lesser-known Onchocerca garmsi , are found freely in the subcutaneous tissue of carpal and tarsal joints, and the sternal region, respectively. The presence of Onchocerca spp. in eight red deer shot in the hunting season during September 2020 in the Grisons region, Switzerland, was investigated by analysing nodules and free worms in the subcutaneous tissue. The obtained worms were morphologically and genetically identified as O. jakutensis , O. flexuosa and O. skrjabini. The latter two are first reports from Switzerland, and morphological redescriptions of these two species are presented. Onchocerca skrjabini and O. jakutensis are newly described from the sternal region of deer. One female of O. jakutensis was found free in the subcutaneous tissue of the sternal region, an atypical presentation for this species. Phylogenetic analyses were based on four mitochondrial and one nuclear loci, revealing that O. jakutensis belongs to a clade which so far only included non-cervid Onchocerca spp. Analysis of sequences from this study and GenBank entries revealed two distinct subpopulations of O. skrjabini: one from European red deer and another from Japanese serow and sika deer. Morphological identification can be challenging, also because worm location in the host is less strictly determined than previously described. Genetic identification is straightforward for O. flexuosa , O. jakutensis and O. skrjabini for which complete data of five loci are now available whereas genetic data of O. garmsi is still lacking.

AB  - Although classic ecological models often have assumed functional equivalence among individuals in a population, ecologists now recognize that individual variation can modulate ecological processes across levels of organization. Nevertheless, current models disproportionately emphasize variation among cohorts, and considerable uncertainty remains over the mechanisms that generate within-cohort variation and the downstream consequences for population and community dynamics. State-dependent life-history theory provides a useful framework for predicting the causes and consequences of within-cohort variation. Behavioral or physiological adjustments made by individuals in response to their underlying state (e.g., energy reserves or disease status) can influence fitness and, by extension, population performance. For iteroparous animals, resource allocation by maternal females often is state dependent; however, the population-level consequences of this strategy and the mechanisms that govern them remain largely unresolved. To explore individual variation in reproductive effort and its associated outcomes, we developed and empirically parameterized a state-dependent, individual-based model of maternal resource allocation for a long-lived, iteroparous mammal, the North American elk (Cervus canadensis). Females were allowed to adjust their investment in gestation versus lactation in response to their nutritional condition in spring. We tested the prediction that females in poor condition could increase fitness by delaying parturition and increasing investment in gestation, giving birth to correspondingly larger neonates that had a greater chance of surviving their first month of life (when mortality is generally highest) and subsequently reducing investment in lactation to help rebuild somatic reserves. We predicted that population growth would be faster when resource allocation was state dependent than when gestation length was decoupled from female condition and adjustment of reproductive investment was largely post-natal. Our results supported this prediction: state-dependent resource allocation by maternal females increased population growth by an average of 4%, leading to larger population sizes after 30 years. Population growth was consistent across a range of winter severities, suggesting that state-dependent resource allocation also could help buffer populations against climatic variation. Our results reveal a potentially general mechanism underpinning intraspecific variation in life-history strategies and suggest that such variation at the individual level can influence performance outcomes at the population level.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are a class of emerging contaminants that significantly threaten public health. In this work, the profiles of ARGs and microbial communities in the soil, sediment, migratory bird, and local deer fecal samples collected from the Arctic were characterized using a metagenomic approach. The results retrieved the baseline profiles of ARGs and identified the role of migratory birds in disseminating ARGs in the Arctic. A total of 26 ARG types and 718 subtypes were determined, and 131 core ARGs were identified. All the samples were dominated by multidrug resistance genes, and some genes resistant to antibiotics commonly used in anthropogenic were also detected. Characterization of ARGs in bird fecal samples was significantly distinct from other media, with higher abundance, richness, and unique ARGs detected. Proteobacteria was the most predominant phylum in soil and fecal samples, while Thaumarchaeota was prevalent in sediment samples. Firmicutes harbored the majority of ARGs in all samples. The results of FEAST indicated that migratory birds were crucial allochthonous ARG sources in the Arctic. These significant findings shed light on the global spread of ARGs and should facilitate efforts to map baseline levels of ARGs before the era of antibiotics.

AB  - The increasing worldwide interest in renewable energy and carbon storage has led to the development of relatively fast solutions to obtain wood biomass. The cultivation of fast-growing tree species in short-rotation crops, such as hybrid poplar clones, is one such solution, at least in temperate areas. Sometimes these monocultures are affected by disturbing factors, including severe insect defoliation, with strong destructive effects. The impact of defoliation on the growth and productivity of poplar crops is often estimated in the context of artificial defoliation. There have been few studies in which the effect of defoliation was calculated after natural defoliation. Among defoliating insect species, Clostera anastomosis L. is one of the most important defoliators of young poplars. This species developed severe defoliation in a 4-year-old poplar clone AF8 crop, from the northeastern part of Romania, in the spring and summer of 2017. The study aimed to assess the impact of defoliation both on the growth and mortality of defoliated trees and the productivity of the affected crop. To reach this goal, the height and radial growth of 150 trees with different defoliation rates (50 non-defoliated, 50 partially defoliated, and 50 completely defoliated) were measured and the defoliation symptoms and mortality were also evaluated for 4780 poplars (10% of the analyzed population). The defoliation caused a significant decrease in the annual height growth (28.6% of the partially defoliated trees and 38.5% of the completely defoliated trees) and a severe decrease in the radial growth, between 82.2% and 90.4%, respectively, depending on the defoliation rate. These strong decreases led to a significant decline in tree-level biomass accumulation, approximately 74.8% for partially defoliated trees and 83.1% for completely defoliated trees, for the year of defoliation. As a result, the loss in total biomass (for the four years of the rotation) was between 28.1% and 34.6%, respectively, depending on the defoliation rate. Therefore, the total biomass loss was 5 t center dot ha(-1), representing approximately 70% of the forecasted production for 2017 only (approximately 7 t center dot ha(-1)).

AB  - Volatile anesthetics elicit neurodevelopmental toxicity in rodents and primates and lead to more exaggerated anxiety-like behavior in response to future stress. Anxiety and fear are closely correlated and maladaptive fearassociated learning is regarded as the core mechanism underlying anxiety-related disorders. However, little is known about the interaction between early-life anesthetic exposure and future stress and the accompanying effect on fear-associated learning. In the present study, we evaluated the alterations in fear-associated learning (fear acquisition and extinction) occurring in mice receiving repeated neonatal isoflurane exposure and chronic variable stress (CVS) successively through a series of fear conditioning, fear reinforcing, and fear extinction paradigms. The corticosterone (CORT) response during CVS and the immunohistochemical levels of AFosB and cFos expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) after the extinction retrieval test were also investigated. The results showed that neonatal isoflurane exposure could increase CORT levels following the first diurnal CVS procedure, but not after completion of the whole CVS paradigm. Neonatal isoflurane exposure exerted a repressive effect on fear acquisition, in contrast to that seen with CVS. Neonatal isoflurane exposure and CVS both exerted suppressive effects on fear extinction and there was a significant synergy between them. Furthermore, neonatal isoflurane exposure facilitated CVS-mediated AFosB accumulation in the BLA and the hippocampal DG, which may have been responsible for c-Fos expression deficits and fear extinction impairment. Collectively, these findings contribute to the understanding of the interaction between early-life anesthetic exposure and future stress, as well as the accompanying behavioral alterations.

AB  - The paper aims to examine the relationship between leverage and firm growth and the impact of fiscal policy on this relationship using a panel data quantile regression approach. Employing a sample of gazelles from emerging Europe for the 2006-2014 period, we find that debt overhang negatively affects firm growth only for the lower growth quantiles. In addition, we found that the negative effect is higher for the gazelles located in countries with lower corporate income effective tax rates. However, for the higher growth quantiles, the impact of debt on firm growth is positive and statistically significant. Our results reconcile the mixed results of the previous studies and have practical implications for financing strategies in emerging markets.

AB  - Giant clams are highly conspicuous marine bivalves in the tropical oceans because of their large shells and colourful outer mantle tissues. This makes them an appropriate iconic species for both trained and untrained citizen science surveys. In Singapore, because of good public awareness of giant clams, they are often reported by citizen scientists, who document marine species using photography. Furthermore, these opportunistic records are captured in a comprehensive public blog (Wild Shores of Singapore; https://wildshores.blogspot.com) with specific details of the field surveys. This study presents the first feasible effort in establishing a long-term dataset based on citizen science observations to report giant clam species-level population status and trends over time. Between 2011 and 2020, citizen scientists covered 8.53 km2 of intertidal reef areas and consistently recorded only two giant clam species (Tridacna squamosa and T. crocea) annually. Despite the more comprehensive coverage and sampling of reef areas, the citizen scientists did not encounter the other native species: Hippopus hippopus, T. gigas and T. maxima. Also, the respective densities of T. squamosa and T. crocea were 0.00120 and 0.00034 individuals per 100 m2, which makes them the smallest known giant clam populations in the Indo-Pacific region. Regardless, the sampling efforts of citizen scientists were generally similar across the years, but future surveys could adapt different survey protocols for the respective giant clam species. Findings from this study also support the marine conservation efforts in Singapore, such as using active intervention measures to protect their giant clams. Additionally, lessons learnt from these citizen science observations can be harnessed to encourage monitoring of giant clams throughout the Indo-Pacific region.

AB  - The alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) is a critically endangered species in China whose wild populations have precipitously declined due to habitat degradation and poaching. In response, China established the world's first captive breeding facility for this species in 1990. Despite over three decades of closed breeding, the genetic consequences of long-term captivity remain unclear. Here, we present the first comprehensive assessment of mitochondrial genetic diversity in a captive population of 409 individuals, using three mitochondrial markers (D-loop, Cytb, and COI) and comparative data from wild conspecifics. Our results reveal a pronounced reduction in genetic diversity in the captive population compared to wild populations. Nucleotide diversity (pi) and haplotype diversity (Hd) were consistently lower across all markers in captivity, with D-loop Hd = 0.639 and pi = 0.01073. Further combined sequence analysis revealed a single dominant haplotype (Hap4) representing 56.99% of individuals, indicative of severe haplotype loss and homogenization. Although some haplotypes are shared with wild populations, captive populations exhibit strong genetic differentiation from wild populations, with the captive populations retaining only a limited fraction of the species' maternal lineages. This pronounced genetic erosion driven by strong founder effects and genetic drift raises concerns about the viability and reintroduction success of this species. These findings highlight the inherent limitations of closed captive populations in preserving evolutionary potential and adaptive capacity. Our study emphasizes the urgent need for evidence-based genetic management, including founder augmentation and population exchange, to mitigate inbreeding and maintain genetic diversity.

AB  - Large carrion is inhabited by highly variable and interactive communities of insects. Positive interactions in carrion insect communities have been recently the focus in carrion ecology. In contrast, competition between carrion insects is rather undervalued. Here we provide evidence that blow flies (Calliphoridae) and Necrodes beetles (Silphidae), dominant decomposers of large carcasses in terrestrial habitats, compete over carrion. By reanalyzing the results from 90 pig carcasses, we demonstrated that the contribution of the flies and the beetles to the decay was negatively related. The greater part of the large carrion pool was monopolized by blow flies, whereas Necrodes beetles abundantly colonized carcasses, on which blow flies were less effective as decomposers. In behavioral assays, we found that adult beetles killed 4 times more frequently feeding than postfeeding third instar larvae of the flies, with the large decrease in the killing frequency after the larvae reached the age of early third instar. Therefore, adult Necrodes beetles preferentially killed the larvae that were before or in their peak feeding. The study provides evidence that the interaction between blow flies and Necrodes beetles is a combination of indirect exploitative effects of the flies and direct interference effects of the beetles (the mixed competition).

AB  - The increasing number of wolves (Canis lupus) in Central Europe has increased wolf-livestock conflicts. Several studies have analysed the impact of herding styles and the possible influencing factors. However, short analysis periods and focusing on specific influencing factors can lead to ambiguous or contradictory results. This study used long-term data from 2000 to 2019 in the federal state of Saxony (Germany) to evaluate a broad range of potential influencing factors, thereby identifying critical factors that considerably impact the likelihood of livestock attacks or the extent of livestock damage due to wolves. Generalised linear models were used for modelling. Our analyses showed that small livestock were more at risk of wolf attacks when (1) the percentage of woodland in comparison to agricultural land was low, (2) wolf territories were in proximity, and (3) the abundance of red deer was low. In addition, wolf attacks were associated with more livestock damage when (1) sika and red deer were abundant, (2) livestock were held in small herds, and the number of farms was low, (3) protective measures were missing, and (4) packs held juvenile wolves. The information on fencing style, independent of the occurrence of wolf attacks, would significantly improve future research and may help minimise conflicts between wolves, livestock, and humans.

AB  - In bioarchaeology, the biometry of archaeozoological remains is an important component of studies on domestic species and size has been used for multiple purposes from identifying domestication, to track environmental changes or evolution of husbandry practices. The establishment of the Roman Empire has been accompanied by social, political and economic transformations that also reflect in farming practices and animal husbandry. In southern France, biometric variation has already been partially perceived during Roman times, particularly for cattle, but lack chronological accuracy and statistical validation.
   This paper presents a diachronic analysis of linear measurements of post-cranial bones belonging to the domestic triad (sheep, goat, cattle and suids) in western Gallia Narbonensis (France), between the Roman conquest and Late Antiquity, i.e. from 200 BCE to 400 AD. Biometric data from 64 archaeological sites, excavated and studied over more than 30 years of preventive archaeology, were analysed using a Log Size Index (LSI) approach using time as a continuous variable. The analysis of 5533 measurements first analysed per bone and variable, then separating length, breadth and depth dimensions, revealed different trends, highly influenced by the number of measurements, reflecting allometric differences but also cases of asynchronous evolution. However, these allometries within species are small when compared to interspecies differences. Overall, the size of the four taxa increased from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD. Cattle and pig sizes then decreased from the 2nd century AD and only from the 4th century onwards for goats, while sheep size tends to increase during the 3rd 4th centuries. If the Roman conquest influences the size of the domestic animals, this does not affect the four species in the same way. This potentially reflects differentiated agropastoral strategies for each of the species in the western part of Gallia Narbonensis during the Roman period. This study, which provides a diachronic and cross-species study framework, should be seen as a first step for a more in-depth understanding of micro-regional and socio-economic variation in domestic species morphologies.

AB  - Partial migration, whereby a proportion of a population migrates between distinct seasonal ranges, is common throughout the animal kingdom. However, studies linking existing theoretical models of migration probability, with empirical data are lacking. The competitive release hypothesis for partial migration predicts that due to density-dependent habitat selection, the proportion of migrants increases as the relative quality and size of the seasonal range increases, but decreases with increasing migration cost and population density. To test this prediction, we developed a quantitative framework to predict the proportion of migrants, using empirical data from 545 individually GPS-marked moose Alces alces from across Fennoscandia, spanning latitudes of 56 degrees to 68 degrees N. Moose contracted their ranges to common and spatially limited winter areas (typically at lower elevation), but expanded them during summer due to an increase in suitable habitat (at highland ranges). As predicted from our model, a better and larger highland range relative to the lowland range corresponded to a higher proportion of migrants in an area. Quantitative predictions coupling the balance of habitat availability of seasonal ranges with the probability of migrating in a large herbivore is a necessary step towards an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms underlying migration at the population level.

AB  - The bioavailability of essential and non-essential elements in vegetation is expected to influence the performance of free-ranging terrestrial herbivores. However, attempts to relate the use of geochemical landscapes by animal populations directly to reproductive output are currently lacking. Here we measured concentrations of 14 essential and non-essential elements in soil and vegetation samples collected in the Zackenberg valley, northeast Greenland, and linked these to environmental conditions to spatially predict and map geochemical landscapes. We then used long-term (1996-2021) survey data of muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) to quantify annual variation in the relative use of essential and non-essential elements in vegetated sites and their relationship to calf recruitment the following year. Results showed that the relative use of the geochemical landscape by muskoxen varied substantially between years and differed among elements. Selection for vegetated sites with higher levels of the essential elements N, Cu, Se, and Mo was positively linked to annual calf recruitment. In contrast, selection for vegetated sites with higher concentrations of the non-essential elements As and Pb was negatively correlated to annual calf recruitment. Based on the concentrations measured in our study, we found no apparent associations between annual calf recruitment and levels of C, Mn, Co, Zn, Cd, Ba, Hg, and C:N ratio in the vegetation. We conclude that the spatial distribution and access to essential and non-essential elements are important drivers of reproductive output in muskoxen, which may also apply to other wildlife populations. The value of geochemical landscapes to assess habitat-performance relationships is likely to increase under future environmental change.

AB  - Marine natural products have emerged as an important source for drug development, notably in the field of anticancer therapy. Still, the limited effectiveness of current therapies for central nervous system tumors indicates the need to identify new therapeutic targets and also novel pharmacological agents. In this context, proteasome inhibitors are appearing as a promising new treatment for these diseases. Herein, cytotoxic extracts produced by four marine bacteria recovered from the Brazilian endemic ascidian Euherdmania sp. were screened to evaluate their potential as proteasome inhibitors. The extract from marine Streptomyces sp. BRA-346 was selected for further investigation due to the potent proteasome inhibitory activity it displayed. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to an enriched fraction (proteasome inhibition IC50 = 45 ng/mL), in which the presence of dihydroeponemycin (DHE), known for its proteasome inhibitory effect, and related compounds were annotated by mass spectrometry and further confirmed by comparison with DHE standard. Both DHE and the epoxyketone-containing fraction were evaluated in glioma cell lines, displaying high cytotoxicity in HOG and T98G cells (GI(50) of 1.6 and 1.7 ng/mL for DHE, and 17.6 and 28.2 ng/mL for the BRA-346 fraction, respectively). Additional studies showed that the epoxyketone-containing fraction (at GI(50) levels) led to an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and up-regulation of genes related to ER-stress response, suggesting treated cells are under proteasome inhibition. DHE induced similar effects in treated cells but at concentrations 25 times its GI(50), suggesting that the other epoxyketone compounds in the bacteria extract derived fraction may contribute to enhance proteasome inhibition and further cellular effects in glioma cells. These findings revealed the molecular pathways modulated by this class of compounds in glioma cells and, moreover, reinforced the potential of this marine bacteria in producing a cocktail of structurally-related compounds that affect the viability of glioma cells.

AB  - Closely related plant species often share similar leaf traits, experience the same level of insect herbivore damage, and support identical herbivore communities. The sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and black maple (Acer nigrum) provide an ideal system to test hypotheses about drivers of insect herbivory in long-lived forest trees since they are closely related yet differ in leaf physical traits. We tested whether variations in foliar traits such as thickness, toughness, specific leaf area (SLA), and trichome density influence insect herbivore damage, community composition, and feeding behavior on these two closely related trees. Field surveys in two nature reserves over 3 years assessed 10 insect herbivore damage types and measured leaf traits. Results showed consistent differences in leaf traits, with black maples having thicker and tougher leaves with lower SLA and higher trichome density. However, these traits did not significantly correlate with total herbivore damage. The maple species had no significant differences in total herbivore damage or abundance. Laboratory bioassays with two common moth caterpillars revealed no significant differences in preference or survival rate on foliage from either tree species. These findings suggest that while foliar traits differ, they do not offer better defense against insect herbivory in black maples.

AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition in livestock is crucial for meat quality, affecting the meat's taste and tenderness. However, there has been little research on the miRNA transcriptome of yak in relation to intramuscular fat deposition in yak. In this study, RNA sequencing in the longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle samples was conducted to uncover the miRNAs expression profiles of yak at two ages: 3 months (calf) and 3 years (adult). A total of 1030 known miRNAs and 279 novel miRNAs were identified, of which 40 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE-miRNAs) were screened. We then obtained target genes of 40 DE-miRNAs and established enrichment analyses using Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes (KEGG). We found target genes were involved in four significantly enriched pathways, and the MAPK signaling pathways were the key pathways. Moreover, we constructed a miRNA-mRNA regulatory network to visualize the functions of miRNAs related to IMF deposition in the yak. miR-122, miR-375, and miR-378 may play a key role in IMF deposition in the yak, and RORC, STAT3, ACACA, FTO, and FOXO1 were the core target genes. We randomly selected six miRNAs from DE-miRNAs to validate the sequencing results using RT-qPCR. This study revealed miRNAs expression profiles in yak IMF development between calf and adult and provided a miRNA database for further studies on the molecular mechanisms of IMF deposition in the yak.

AB  - The microbiome and the prevalence of the pathogenic bacterium Coxiella burnetii in ticks associated with white rhinoceros, Ceratotherium simum, is unknown. Targeted Illumina 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial microbiome diversity found within 40 Amblyomma hebraeum and 40 Dermacentor rhinocerinus ticks collected from 40 white rhinoceros individuals in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Specific emphasis was also given to further investigate the prevalence of the pathogenic C. burnetti in these tick species. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria dominated both tick microbiomes, followed by Actinobacteria and Firmicutes; Coxiella was the most abundant genus within A. hebraeum and Rickettsia within D. rhinocerinus. While alpha diversity did not differ significantly between the two tick species, beta diversity revealed significant species-specific differences in bacterial community composition. Additionally, there was no correlation between sampling region and microbiome diversity or composition for either tick species. Twenty-five Coxiella amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified, forming three distinct monophyletic Coxiella clades and a fourth single ASV lineage. The Coxiella clades showed a correlation to tick species identity with D. rhinocerinus harboring significantly greater Coxiella diversity than A. hebraeum-potentially indicative of different coevolutionary pathways between the bacteria and their respective hosts. PCR of the IS1111 transposase gene for 238 ticks detected a 66.1% (56.7-74.4%) prevalence for C. burnetii in D. rhinocerinus compared to 55.8% in A. hebraeum (46.5-64.8%). These findings support a notion that each tick species is characterized by its own microbiome community composition and that both A. hebraeum and D. rhinocerinus may act as reservoirs and potential vectors of C. burnetii to white rhinoceros.

AB  - This study documents and assesses the ecosystem services (ES) associated with bamboo species in Lohit District, Arunachal Pradesh, northeast India. Conducted between March 2021 and February 2022, the research employed a multistage random sampling method, selecting 10 respondents from each of 10 villages. Data were gathered through in-depth personal interviews with a semi-structured questionnaire to evaluate the socioeconomic status and perceptions of ecosystem services and disservices of bamboo among indigenous communities. The present study recorded seven bamboo species, viz., Bambusa tulda, Bambusa vulgaris, Dendrocalamus hamiltonii, Dendrocalamus giganteus, Bambusa bambos, Cephalostachyum sp. and Bambusa pallida. A total of 18 ecosystem services associated with these bamboo species were recorded, including provisioning services (10), regulatory services (6) and cultural services (2). Of all the ecosystem services, provisioning services were recorded as the most regularly used by the villagers in their day-to-day life. Some disservices of bamboo were perceived by the respondents, including reductions in crop yield, competition with NTFPs, reductions in aesthetic views, difficulties in accessing the forest, and attracting wild elephants. Despite these disservices, bamboo has a significant potential to enhance human well-being and improve the socio-economic conditions of the region. By serving as a sustainable alternative to concrete and steel, bamboo offers a wide range of ecosystem services, from provisioning to supporting, making it a valuable resource for sustainable development.

AB  - Megafauna, such as southern elephant seals (SESs) (Mirounga leonina, Linn.), forage in diverse, seemingly lim-itless habitats. In pelagic settings, their behaviour is more likely to be limited by physiological ability and prey distribution, than physical barriers. For elephant seals, their rapid growth in body size corresponds to changing physiological abilities. These changes are most pronounced for male elephant seals. While most studies have compared male and female SESs in terms of changing body size and physiological ability, few studies have compared the influence of changing body size on behaviour of male SESs from the same population using long term satellite tracking data. We describe age-related differences in movement and diving behaviour for male SESs from Marion Island. We analysed satellite tracking data collected from 23 male SESs seals fitted with Sea Mammal Research Unit Satellite Relay Data Loggers at Marion Island between 2005 and 2011. Each dive was assigned a behavioural mode, either 'searching' or 'transit', using state-space modelling. We used mixed-effects models to quantify the influence of age and behavioural mode on dive duration, surface duration, dive depth and number of daily dives. Younger seals travelled significantly further from Marion Island and spent most of their dives in transit mode, whereas older seals stayed closer to the island but were in searching mode for most of their tracks. When searching, older seals dived more frequently, displayed longer dive and surface durations, and reached greater depths than younger seals. These differences in diving behaviour seem to reflect changing physiological ability. For male SESs, changes in physiological ability necessitate behavioural plasticity, which may be the key to survival and future breeding success. Robust males are more likely to breed and must therefore, maintain their body size by adapting to local oceanic conditions.

AB  - Applying arginine-phosphate (AP) to tree seedlings at planting is a novel silvicultural practice in Northern Europe to improve the success of forest regeneration. We present three case-studies of the potential advantages of adding AP at planting on the establishment and damage susceptibility of seedlings in pure and mixed plantings of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) over two years in the field. Location of study sites were in southern (S), northeastern (NE) and northwestern (NW) Sweden. The main agents of damage were pine weevil (Hylobius abietis L.) on conifers at the south site, browsing of birch at all sites and browsing/other top damage to conifers at the north sites. The effect of adding AP varied between the sites. It was positive for survival of pine at site S, despite considerable damage by pine weevil. However, at the S site more of the surviving spruce and birch were browsed when treated with AP. At the NE site AP-treatment had positive effects on conifer growth. At the NW site adding AP positively affected survival and growth of all three species, and AP-treated seedlings of all species were less browsed than untreated seedlings. AP treatment presents a potential tool to improve the success of forest regeneration, especially when establishing pine stands in south Sweden.

AB  - Studies of Rancho La Brea predators have yielded disparate dietary interpretations when analyzing bone collagen vs. enamel carbonate-requiring a better understanding of the relationship between stable carbon isotopes in these tissues. Stable carbon isotope spacing between collagen and carbonate (Delta(ca-co)) has also been used as a proxy for inferring the trophic level of mammals, with higher Delta(ca-co) values indicative of high carbohydrate consumption. To clarify the stable isotope ecology of carnivorans, past and present, we analyzed bone collagen (carbon and nitrogen) and enamel carbonate (carbon) of extinct and extant North American felids and canids, including dire wolves, sabertooth cats, coyotes, and pumas, supplementing these with data from African wild dogs and African lions. Our results reveal that Delta(ca-co) values are positively related to enamel carbonate values in secondary consumers and are less predictive of trophic level. Results indicate that the foraging habitat and diet of prey affects Delta(ca-co) in carnivores, like herbivores. Average Delta(ca-co) values in Pleistocene canids (8.7+/-1 parts per thousand) and felids (7.0+/-0.7 parts per thousand) overlap with previously documented extant herbivore Delta(ca-co) values suggesting that trophic level estimates may be relative to herbivore Delta(ca-co) values in each ecosystem and not directly comparable between disparate ecosystems. Physiological differences between felids and canids, ontogenetic dietary differences, and diagenesis at Rancho La Brea do not appear to be primary drivers of Delta(ca-co) offsets. Environmental influences affecting protein and fat consumption in prey and subsequently by predators, and nutrient routing to tissues may instead be driving Delta(ca-co) offsets in extant and extinct mammals.

AB  - The present study was conducted in the isolated desert town of Oranjemund in the far south of Namibia. It is an extremely arid region where no livestock husbandry is practiced and only animals adapted to the desert can be found. However, in and around the city, artificial irrigation maintains lush green patches of grass that attract wild animals, in particular oryx antelopes (Oryx gazella). In 2015 four oryx antelopes were euthanised due to poor conditions and a post-mortem examination was conducted. Two were found positive for cystic echinococcosis and 16 cysts were collected for molecular analyses. In addition, faecal samples from black-backed jackals (n=5) and domestic dogs (n=9), which were regularly observed to feed on oryx carcasses, were collected and taeniid eggs isolated. Parasite species identification of the cysts and eggs was done by amplifying and sequencing the mitochondrial nad1 gene. Both oryx antelopes were found infected with E. ortleppi and one co-infected with E. canadensis G6/7. Both Echinococcus species were able to develop fertile cysts in oryx, making oryx antelopes competent hosts for these parasites. Therefore, the analysis of faecal samples was of high interest and although the numbers were quite small, taeniid eggs were found in three out of five faecal samples of jackals and in all nine dog samples. However, species determination was only successful with two jackal and one dog sample. All three were positive for E. canadensis G6/7. The absence of E. ortleppi may be due to the low number of faecal samples examined. In our small study, we discovered a rather unique lifecycle of Echinococcus spp. between jackals and domestic dogs as definitive hosts and oryx antelopes as intermediate hosts. Here, the presence of E. canadensis G6/7 is of particular concern, as it is the second most important causative agent of CE in humans.

AB  - Fish microbiome science is progressing fast, but it is biased toward farmed or laboratory fish species against natural fish populations, which remain considerably underinvestigated. We analyzed the midgut bacterial microbiota of 45 specimens of 12 fish species collected from the Gyaros Island marine protected area (Aegean Sea, Greece). The species belong to seven taxonomic families and are either herbivores or omnivores. Mucosa midgut bacterial diversity was assessed by amplicon metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene region. A total of 854 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. In each fish species, between 2 and 18 OTUs dominated with cumulative relative abundance >= 70%. Most of the dominating bacterial taxa have been reported to occur both in wild and farmed fish populations. The midgut bacterial communities were different among the 12 fish species, except for Pagrus pagrus and Pagellus erythrinus, which belong to the Sparidae family. No differentiation of the midgut bacterial microbiota was found based on feeding habits, i.e., omnivorous vs. carnivorous. Comparing wild and farmed P. pagrus midgut bacterial microbiota revealed considerable variation between them. Our results expand the gut microbiota of wild fish and support the host species effect as the more likely factor shaping intestinal bacterial microbiota.

AB  - Biological invasions are a growing challenge in a highly interconnected and globalized world, leading to the loss of native biodiversity. Indigenous peoples' lands (IPLs) play a vital role in biodiversity conservation through activities such as land stewardship and management practices. Similar to protected areas, they are also often remote, with fewer connections to international trade networks. The extent to which IPLs are threatened by the spread of invasive species is still unknown. Here we provide a global study detailing the distribution and drivers of alien species on IPL. On average, IPLs host 30% (in absolute numbers: 11 +/- 3.5) fewer alien species relative to other lands, after controlling for sampling intensities. Alien species numbers remained consistently lower on IPLs even after accounting for potentially confounding factors such as differences in accessibility and ecological integrity. The difference may result from land management practices of Indigenous peoples. In the relatively small number of cases where IPLs host disproportionately higher numbers of alien species than other lands, the most likely reason is high alien species propagule pressure arising from proximity to large urban areas. Overall, our results highlight the importance of IPLs in protecting nature in the face of increasing biological invasions.
   Indigenous peoples' lands (IPLs) are important reservoirs of biodiversity; however, the extent to which these lands are affected by the growing number of biological invasions worldwide is still unknown. This study evaluates whether IPLs harbour fewer alien species compared with other lands globally.

AB  - Recent studies suggest climate-related delays in the timing of leaf coloration and abscission in maple trees but lack baseline data prior to the late 20th century. To better understand how autumn foliar phenology and late-season damage risks have changed for this genus over the past century, we evaluated 2,972 digitized herbaria specimens of red and sugar maple collected between 1826 and 2016 for the presence of leaves, autumn leaf coloration, and pathogen or herbivore damage. We found that the onset (first appearance) of colored leaves has shifted 0.26 days later each year, leading to a delay of more than a month in autumn phenology since 1880. We find that these shifts are related to precipitation regimes in both the fall and summer seasons and that more severe droughts are associated with higher probabilities of colored leaves. Moreover, we found that the probability of both herbivory and pathogen damage has increased significantly over the study period. In particular, we find a strong association between increasing summer drought conditions and increased probability of herbivory. Furthermore, the presence of foliar damage increased the probability of leaf coloration on herbaria specimens. However, the end-of-season abscission date (last appearance of leaves) was strongly associated with herbivory and climate in a contrary direction: Increasing yearly drought, higher fall temperatures, and the presence of herbivory were associated with earlier abscission. In fact, the last leaf dates for specimens with herbivory were nearly 2 weeks earlier than specimens without herbivore damage. Our study documents significant changes in maple senescence over the last 150 years and suggests that incorporating herbivory into models may improve our ability to predict forest responses to climate shifts.

AB  - The grazing impact on epiphytic lichens by a non-native gastropod species is documented and quantified for the first time in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador using a unique combination of a multiple-choice feeding design with lichen transplant techniques under controlled laboratory conditions. The feeding experiment included three arboreal lichen species sewn onto a mesh and attached to red maple sticks inside a terrarium where four Cepaea nemoralis snails were introduced and allowed to graze over a five-day period. The three lichen species used in the feeding trials included the green-algal Platismatia glauca, the cephalolichen Lobaria pulmonaria, and the cyanolichen Lobarina scrobiculata. The trials also included two sets of L. pulmonaria from different regions of the island of Newfoundland. The levels of grazing and preference by the snails was very high. Herbivory was high for all lichen species but was highest for Platismatia glauca, for which 70% of thalli were consumed after only 24 hours. Our results show that C. nemoralis is probably affecting the distribution and abundance of epiphytic lichens in the forests of Newfoundland and Labrador. Furthermore, our observations of intense herbivory on reproductive structures challenges the universal application of the optimal defence theory in lichens.

AB  - Antibiotics usage in animal production is considered a primary driver of the occurrence, supply and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment. Pig farms and fish ponds are important breeding systems in food animal production. In this study, we compared and analyzed broad ARGs profiles, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and bacterial communities in a representative pig farm and neighboring fish ponds around Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China. The factors influencing the distribution of ARGs were also explored. The results showed widespread detection of ARGs (from 57 to 110) among 283 targeted ARGs in the collected water samples. The differences in the number and relative abundance of ARGs observed from the pig farm and neighboring fish ponds revealed that ARG contamination was more serious on the pig farm than in the fish ponds and that the water treatment plant on the pig farm was not very effective. Based on the variance partition analysis (VPA), MGEs, bacterial communities and water quality indicators (WIs) codrive the relative abundance of ARGs. Based on network analysis, we found that total phosphorus and Tp614 were the most important WIs and MGEs affecting ARG abundance, respectively. Our findings provide fundamental data on farms in lakeside districts and provide insights into establishing standards for the discharge of aquaculture wastewater.

AB  - Volunteers play a key role in the conservation of many threatened species, yet volunteer motivations for participating in conservation and strategies used for attracting and retaining volunteers remain little studied. Iconic and charismatic megafauna species, such as marine turtles, attract the attention of conservation volunteers worldwide, making this species an ideal case study to explore volunteer motivations. We developed a novel values-based framework that examines the motivations and values of people volunteering with turtles in Queensland, Australia by harmonizing insights from Values Belief Norm (VBN) theory and intrinsic, instrumental, and relational values. We found that although motivations for these volunteers are multi-faceted, common factors underpinning volunteering decisions included values alignment with the organization, social influence, the ability to learn, and optimism. Awareness of these characteristics can assist organizations with designing more effective voluntary programs and further scholarly understanding of drivers of pro-environmental behaviors among a key group of environmental stakeholders.

AB  - Cycads are highly threatened with extinction worldwide, mostly because of habitat destruction and degradation. Habitat fragmentation is a major threat for these species, but few studies are available about the population biology of cycads in fragmented landscapes. In this paper, I describe the demography of a rainforest cycad in different habitat types within fragmented forests in the Darien region of Colombia. I sampled demes across interior to edge habitats in forest fragments differing in the level of anthropogenic degradation and estimated population density, size distribution, and the population growth rate using integral projection models (IPM) for each habitat. Overall, populations of this cycad appear to be near stable population size in the forest fragments, but demes vary in their population dynamics across habitats within the forests. Edge habitats had higher canopy openness and higher levels of herbivory than interior habitats. Plant density was higher (because of a higher number of seedlings), and there was a higher proportion of seedlings compared to adults in demes from edge habitats. Furthermore, a gradient of higher adult growth, fecundity, and seedling survival in demes from edge to interior resulted in edge habitats demes having the largest population growth rate. Further exploration of the long-term dynamics of these populations requires extensive demographic census and replication; nevertheless, this study suggests that demographic parameters can vary across habitats within forest fragments and between fragments, which might be important for the long-term persistence of these cycad populations in anthropogenic landscapes.

AB  - Deer keds, such as Lipoptena cervi Linnaeus (Diptera: Hippoboscidae), are blood-feeding flies from which several human and animal pathogens have been detected, including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato Johnson (Spirochaetales: Borreliaceae), the causative agent of Lyme disease. Cervids (Artiodactyla: Cervidae), which are the primary hosts of deer keds, are not natural reservoirs of B. burgdorferi sl, and it has been suggested that deer keds may acquire bacterial pathogens via co-feeding near infected ticks. We screened L. cervi (n = 306) and Ixodes scapularis Say (Ixodida: Ixodidae) (n = 315) collected from 38 whitetailed deer in Pennsylvania for the family Anaplasmataceae, Bartonella spp. (Hyphomicrobiales: Bartonellaceae), Borrelia spp., and Rickettsia spp. (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae). Limited similarity in the bacterial DNA detected between these ectoparasites per host suggested that co-feeding may not be a mechanism by which deer keds acquire these bacteria. The feeding biology and life history of deer keds may impact the observed results, as could the season when specimens were collected. We separately screened L. cervi (n = 410), L. mazamae Rondani (n = 13), L. depressa Say (n = 10), and Neolipoptena ferrisi Bequaert (n = 14) collections from locations within the United States and Canada for the same pathogens. These results highlight the need to further study deer ked-host and deer ked-tick relationships.

AB  - The presence of edible and inedible prey species in a food web can influence the strength that nutrients (bottom-up) or herbivores (top-down) have on primary production. In boreal peatlands, wetter more nutrient-rich conditions associated with ongoing climate change are expanding consumer access to aquatic habitat and promoting sources of primary production (i.e., algae) that are susceptible to trophic regulation. Here, we used an in situ mesocosm experiment to evaluate the consequences of enhanced nutrient availability and food-web manipulation (herbivore and predator exclusion) on algal assemblage structure in an Alaskan fen. Owing to the potential for herbivores to selectively consume edible algae (small cells) in favor of more resistant forms, we predicted that the proportion of less-edible algae (large cells) would determine the strength of top-down or bottom-up effects. Consistent with these expectations, we observed an increase in algal-cell size in the presence of herbivores (2-tiered food web) that was absent in the presence of a trophic cascade (3-tiered food web), suggesting that predators indirectly prevented morphological changes in the algal assemblage by limiting herbivory. Increases in algal-cell size with herbivory were driven by a greater proportion of filamentous green algae and nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, whose size and morphological characteristics mechanically minimize consumption. While consumer-driven shifts in algal assemblage structure were significant, they did not prevent top-down regulation of biofilm development by herbivores. Our findings show that increasing wet periods in northern peatlands will provide new avenues for trophic regulation of algal production, including directly through consumption and indirectly via a trophic cascade.

AB  - The antibiotic-nanoparticle combinatorial effects on gut microbiome diversity, abundance, and antibiotic resistance remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the potential impacts of biodegradable nanocarriers after one biocompatible dose that could promote sustainable treatment against enteropathogens. Enrofloxacin (Enro), a common antibiotic used in livestock, was loaded into biodegradable synthetic poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and plant-based lignin (LIGNIN) nanoparticles. Anaerobic bioreactors containing fresh slurry collected from pig intestines were used to simulate the anaerobic gut microenvironment. Bioreactors were inoculated with empty NPs with concentrations identical to loaded nanoparticles and free Enro, PLGA (Enro) (PE), and LIGNIN(Enro) (LE) that present antimicrobial activity and non-cytotoxicity to pig intestinal cells. Slurry aliquots from the bioreactors were collected for RNA extraction after 24, 48, and 72 hours of exposure to the drug and nanocarriers for microbial 16S rRNA metatranscriptomics and resistome analysis. Our results showed that PLGA and PE microbial communities were similar over all periods despite containing Enro. The impact of LIGNIN on the microbial community was minimal since it was similar to the control. However, loaded LE significantly reduced the microbial diversity but maintained essential estimated metabolic functions. Free enrofloxacin affected the microbial community the most by decreasing the core gut microbiome diversity. Our results indicate that NP encapsulation of antibiotics delayed the increase in antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) expression between 24 and 72 hours compared to free Enro. These results demonstrate that the antibiotic treatment conveyed by NPs slows the rate of expression of ARG and reduces the adverse antibiotic effects on the gut microbial community.
   The antibiotic-nanoparticle combinatorial treatment delays the rise in antibiotic resistance genes and minimizes adverse impacts on the gut microbiome compared to free antibiotics.

AB  - The sea urchin, Mesocentrotus nudus, is widely distributed in North West Pacific regions. It has a substantial impact on macroalgal communities as a generalist herbivore. This study examined various aspects of its feeding ecology, including algal preference, foraging behaviors, and possible effects of past feeding history on its algal preference. We used six common algal species (Ulva australis, Undaria pinnatifida, Sargassum confusum, Dictyopteris divaricata, Grateloupia elliptica, and Grateloupia angusta) from the east coast of Korea as food choice in a series of indoor aquarium experiments. The first choice of starved M. nudus was exclusively U. pinnatifida, followed by G. elliptica and S. confusum. Unlike large urchins, small urchins equally preferred U. pinnatifida and G. elliptica. On the other hand, Undaria-fed urchins preferred to feed only G. elliptica, although its preference slightly differed over time. We then grouped sea urchins into three categories (starved, Undaria-fed, mixed species-fed) to observe 12-days feeding preference as well as early foraging movements. Foraging behaviors of the three groups were distinctively different, although they could not completely reflect the actual consumption. For example, U. australis was highly attractive, but rarely eaten. Undaria-fed urchins seemed to stay with only S. confusum and U. australis. This study demonstrates that M. nudus shows high flexibility in food preference depending on past feeding history and body size. Its foraging behaviors are also affected by past feeding conditions, exhibiting active chemoreceptive movements.

AB  - Urban environments are high risk areas for large carnivores, where anthropogenic disturbances can reduce fitness and increase mortality risk.(1) When catastrophic events like large wildfires occur, trade-offs between acquiring resources and avoiding risks of the urban environment are intensified. This landscape context could lead to an increase in risk-taking behavior by carnivores if burned areas do not allow them to meet their energetic needs, potentially leading to human-wildlife conflict.(2,3 )We studied mountain lion behavior using GPS location and accelerometer data from 17 individuals tracked before and after a large wildfire (the 2018 Woolsey Fire) within a highly urbanized area (Los Angeles, California, USA). After the wildfire, mountain lions avoided burned areas and increased behaviors associated with anthropogenic risk, including more frequent road and freeway crossings (mean crossings increased from 3 to 5 per month) and greater activity during the daytime (means from increased 10% to 16% of daytime active), a time when they are most likely to encounter humans. Mountain lions also increased their amount of space used, distance traveled (mean dis-tances increased from 250 to 390 km per month), and intrasexual overlap, potentially putting them at risk of intraspecific conflict. Joint pressures from urbanization and severe wildfire, alongside resulting risk-taking, could thus increase mortality and extinction risk for populations already suffering from low genetic diversity, necessitating increased connectivity in fire-prone areas.

AB  - Plants form the foundation of most terrestrial ecosystems; therefore, plant chemistry can have important and far-reaching consequences for many ecological interactions and processes. Despite this, few studies have explicitly explored the spatial variation in plant chemistry. We mapped the distribution of volatile emissions of the mountain subspecies of sagebrush in 25 meadows north of Lake Tahoe. This plant exhibits several distinct volatile emission profiles (chemotypes) that are part of the system involved in stimulating induced defenses to different herbivores and pathogens. Sites varied in the volatile chemotypes that were present although three chemotypes were most common. Transitions between the chemotypes were gradual in most cases but abrupt in others. The three common volatile chemotypes sorted out along an elevational gradient. This chemotypic pattern sets the stage for other interactions such as those that result in different abundances of herbivores.

AB  - Simple Summary Charismatic Sumatran mammals (i.e., the elephant, orangutan, and tiger) play a pivotal role in maintaining ecosystem balance. Nevertheless, these species have encountered multifaceted threats due to habitat disturbances, leading to their potential extinction. Thus, understanding current species ranges, together with investigating the most essential factors for the species, are crucial for developing conservation strategies. We predicted the potential range of three charismatic mammals in Sumatra Island using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on ensemble machine learning algorithms. This study also comprehensively describes how land ownerships can shape the existence of these three species. Finally, we provide recommendations based on our findings for species conservation planning and management options. Tropical Rainforest Heritage sites of Sumatra are some of the most irreplaceable landscapes in the world for biodiversity conservation. These landscapes harbor many endangered Asiatic mammals all suffering multifaceted threats due to anthropogenic activities. Three charismatic mammals in Sumatra: Elephas maximus sumatranus, Pongo abelii, and Panthera tigris sumatrae are protected and listed as Critically Endangered (CR) within the IUCN Red List. Nevertheless, their current geographic distribution remains unclear, and the impact of environmental factors on these species are mostly unknown. This study predicts the potential range of those species on the island of Sumatra using anthropogenic, biophysical, topographic, and climatic parameters based on the ensemble machine learning algorithms. We also investigated the effects of habitat loss from current land use, ecosystem availability, and importance of Indonesian protected areas. Our predictive model had relatively excellent performance (Sorensen: 0.81-0.94) and can enhance knowledge on the current species distributions. The most critical environmental predictors for the distribution of the three species are conservation status and temperature seasonality. This study revealed that more than half of the species distributions occurred in non-protected areas, with proportional coverage being 83%, 72%, and 54% for E.m. sumatranus, P. abelii, and P.t. sumatrae, respectively. Our study further provides reliable information on places where conservation efforts must be prioritized, both inside and outside of the protected area networks, to safeguard the ongoing survival of these Indonesian large charismatic mammals.

AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. sinensis Rousi (Abbrev. H. rhamnoides) stands as a vital botanical asset in ameliorating the ecological landscape of the arid regions in Northwest China, where its rhizospheric microorganisms serve as linchpins in its growth and developmental dynamics. This study aimed to explore the community structure characteristics and origin differences of root endophytic fungi in H. rhamnoides. Samples were collected from 25 areas where H. rhamnoides is naturally distributed along an altitude gradient in the northwest region. Then, endophytic fungi from different regions were analyzed by using high-throughput sequencing technology to compare the structural characteristics of endophytic fungi and examine their association with environmental factors. FUNGuild was employed to analyze the community structure and functions of endophytic fungi, and the results showed that each region had its own dominant endophytic fungal flora, demonstrating the differences in origin of endophytic fungi, and the specific endophytic flora acquired from the original soil in the growing season of H. rhamnoides will help us construct the microecological community structure. Furthermore, the study identified and assessed the diversity of fungi, elucidating the species structure and highlighting dominant species. The RDA analysis revealed that available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (AK), and total nitrogen (TN) exhibit significant correlations with the composition and diversity of root-associated fungi. In conclusion, the fungal community structure is similar within the same region, while significant differences exist in the taxonomic structure and biodiversity among different regions. These findings shed light on the intricate interplay and mechanisms governing the ecological restoration of H. rhamnoides, offering a valuable framework for advancing green ecology initiatives and harnessing the potential of root-associated microorganisms in this species.

AB  - China is home to a small but expanding population of wild Asian elephants (Elephas maximus). Both research interest and conservation efforts have increased in recent years, but these have been fragmented. Here we present the results from a collaborative, multisectorial, multi-stakeholder exercise to identify priorities for Chinese elephant research and conservation. We first compiled a comprehensive list of issues, categorized under nine research and nine conservation themes, through an on-line survey of stakeholders. These issues were subsequently consolidated, timelined (as short-, mid-, or long-term issues), and ranked by their perceived priority in a two-day workshop attended by 44 people representing 28 organizations. The initial list of 656 issues (337 research and 319 conservation) was consolidated into a list of 251 (121 research and 130 conservation) issues. After priority ranking, we retained the top-three issues within each theme (making a total of 55 priority issues, due to a tie), which are then discussed in detail in this paper. Most (87%, n = 55) priority issues were classified as short-term, suggesting that the exercise might have succeeded in identifying the current priorities, but not emerging issues that might require attention in future. Some issues appeared in various forms in different themes. Among research questions, participants highlighted the importance of understanding the carrying capacity of the current elephant range habitats, elephant movement patterns and expected range changes, the drivers of human-elephant conflict (HEC), improvements to the current HEC financial compensation mechanism, and ways of engaging local communities in HEC mitigation. Regarding elephant conservation, recurrent issues included effectively engaging communities, improving HEC early-warning systems and financial compensation mechanisms, establishing a new national park within elephant range, and creating mechanisms for communication and collaboration among elephant research and conservation stakeholders in China.

AB  - The southern king crab, Lithodes santolla, is a well-known predator/scavenger species during its adult phase but its feeding strategy in early stages is less studied. This information is important to understand their role in ecosystems and to improve fishery management (i.e., stock enhancement). Based on stomach contents and stable isotope analysis, we determined variation in the composition of diet and niche overlap in vagile and cryptic phase collected within and outside a kelp forest, Macrocystis pyrifera, of Aguila Bay at the Magellan Strait in Patagonia, Chile. Results of juvenile stomach content analysis showed 60% dissimilarity between cryptic and vagile juvenile phases. Algae dominated the volumetric contribution in cryptic juveniles while crustacean dominated the diet in vagile phase. Exoskeleton of other king crabs occurred in 43% of juveniles with crustaceans in their stomach. This fact confirms cannibalistic behavior in the wild in this species, which is consistent with findings in massive laboratory cultures. There was no evidence of isotopic niche shift between cryptic and vagile juvenile phases. Overlapping isotopic niches of different-sized juveniles suggest that they exploit similar food resources. However, vagile individuals occupy a higher trophic position than cryptic individuals, which could suggest a switch in dietary preference, from detritivorous/herbivory within kelp forests to omnivory outside of kelp forests, and an increase in the level of cannibalism in vagile juveniles.

AB  - Large herbivores have been described as agents of change in terrestrial habitats. Their effect on aquatic ecosystems are, however, underexplored. We raise the question of whether elephants and hippopotamus have the potential to significantly alter limnological properties and, indirectly, primary and secondary productivity within small and shallow freshwaters in arid and semi-arid African landscapes. In this note we discuss hypothetical means by which elephants and hippopotamus alter shallow freshwater bodies. We further assimilate this with known ways by which these mega-herbivores alter aquatic environments giving an overview of their potential functional role in structuring aquatic habitats.

AB  - The recognition of animals as sentient beings has raised societal awareness of the welfare of farmed animals. This has been instrumental in increasing the legislative pressure towards welfare- conscious farming practices and, more lately, greater consumer demand for ethically sourced products. Besides, improved animal welfare is a key driver for enhanced performance, particularly in breeding boars, as welfare conditions strongly influence reproductive outcomes. The stressors associated with confinement impact testicular physiology and semen quality and the efforts to improve the welfare of breeding boars have so far focused on mitigating the negative consequences associated with stressors. The Five Freedoms framework and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)'s 'welfare consequences' approach prioritise the alleviation of suffering. In breeding boars, key welfare negative consequences include movement restriction, isolation stress, inability to engage in exploratory behaviours, locomotory disorders, and prolonged hunger. The negative consequences, which can be mitigated by improved housing and management practices, should be tackled in any commitment to improve the welfare of breeding boars. Animal welfare science, however, has recently shifted towards cultivating positive welfare experiences and a life worth living, beyond just alleviating suffering. The Five Domain Model systematically evaluates animal welfare, considering both negative and positive aspects. Encouraging positive welfare states involves facilitating species-specific behaviours, such as exploration and play, and fostering positive human-animal interactions. In breeding boars, strategies promoting positive welfare include providing enriching environments, encouraging exploration, and cultivating positive interactions with caretakers. Thus, for an overall welfare improvement of breeding boars, not only should the absence of suffering be guaranteed, but also the promotion of positive experiences that make their lifes worth living.

AB  - Eccrinales are protists of the class Mesomycetozoea exclusively found in the digestive tract of marine, freshwater and terrestrial arthropods. Isopods are the only terrestrial crustaceans from which eccrinids have been reported. Among brachyuran crabs, eccrinids were exclusively reported in grapsid and ocypodid crabs, with a percentage of occurrence ranging from 5% to 100% in the respective species. The eccrinid Enteromyces callianassae Lichtwardt, 1961 has been found in the guts of various decapod crustacean species in marine habitats and intertidal mud or sand flats in Chile, France, Japan and the USA. Semi-terrestrial species of Leptuca and Minuca were the most terrestrial crabs in which E. callianassae has been observed. Here we report the presence of E. callianassae in stomachs of the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis. These are the first observations of protists in gecarcinid crabs, which are regarded as the most terrestrial brachyuran crabs. The presence of E. callianassae in 11% of 74 examined stomachs from males and females of G. lateralis from three locations in Costa Rica suggests that the occurence of E. callianassae in these crabs is a relatively widespread phenomenon. Considering that these highly terrestrial crabs are important herbivores on island and continental landscapes, the presence of eccrinids in the stomachs of these crabs may have important implications for the carbon cycling in coastal ecosystems.

AB  - Although dietary studies have provided important insights into the causes and ramifications of diet variation for the southern elephant seal (SES) (Mirounga leonina), adult males are comparatively underrepresented within that literature. Individual males can vary morphologically as well as behaviourally, leading to differences in their life history trajectories and outcomes. Therefore, to improve our understanding of the male diet, we sought to determine the degree of dietary variation between as well as within individuals from the West Antarctic Peninsula. Secondly, we investigated whether individual morphological traits, seasonality, and year influenced their dietary variation. Whiskers were sampled from 31 adult male seals and used to measure the bulk stable isotope nitrogen (delta 15N). We sequentially segmented each whisker to create a time series of datapoints for each individual, allowing us to compare delta 15N variation within each seal as well as assess variation between the seals. We then investigated the relationships between male dietary variation and body length, girth, season, and year. We found that adult male SESs maintained an extremely specialised diet. Variation between individuals was strongly correlated with their body size, with larger seals feeding higher up the trophic web. Interestingly, seasonality and year both influenced variation within the seals' diets, but only year was seen to influence the variability between seals. We discuss the possible causes and ramifications of dietary specialisation for the SES and highlight the need for combined tracking and stable isotope investigations to improve our understanding of the ontogeny of the seals' dietary specialisation.

AB  - Camera trap surveys are useful to understand animal species population trends, distribution, habitat preference, behavior, community dynamics, periods of activity, and species associations with environmental conditions. This information is ecologically important, because many species play important roles in local ecosystems as predators, herbivores, seed dispersers, and disease vectors. Additionally, many of the larger wildlife species detected by camera traps are economically important through hunting, trapping, or ecotourism. Here we present a data set of camera-trap surveys from 6,043 locations across all 100 counties of North Carolina, USA from 2009 to 2019. These data come from 26 survey initiatives and contain 215,108 records of 36 mammal species and three species of terrestrial birds. This large data set increases the geographical distribution data for these 39 mammal and bird species by >500% over what is available for North Carolina in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These data can be used to conduct inquiries about species, populations, communities, or ecosystems, and to produce useful information on wildlife behavior, distribution, and interactions. There are no copyright restrictions. Please cite this paper when using the data for publication.

AB  - Rodents play a key role in forest regeneration by dispersing seeds and interspecific differences in seed preferences could have important consequences for forest growth. The White-footed Mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and Deer Mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus gracilis) are 2 closely related species that can exploit Red Oak (Quercus rubra) acorns but may display different preference levels due to the high tannin concentration present in these acorns. Here we investigated how White-footed Mice and Deer Mice differ in their ability to exploit Red Oak acorns. We conducted a cafeteria-style experiment where we offered mice (n = 61) acorns of Red Oak and Bur Oak (Q. macrocarpa; control seed with lower tannin levels) and video-recorded their preference and the acorn fate (consumed or cached). Using mixed-effects models, we found that both mouse species selected and consumed Bur Oak acorns at a high rate; however, White-footed Mice were 6.67 times more likely to select and consume Red Oak acorns than Deer Mice. Furthermore, White-footed Mice tended to cache Red Oak acorns near the surface where there is a higher chance of germination, while they usually consumed Bur Oak acorns. Our results suggest that Red Oaks have a better strategy for avoiding predation than Bur Oaks (i.e., high tannin levels leading to caching), and the strong interaction between the White-footed Mouse and Red Oak might be an important mechanism behind the current range expansion of both species in response to climate change.
   We investigated how Peromyscus leucopus and Peromyscus maniculatus differ in their ability to exploit Red Oak acorns. We found that only P. leucopus was willing to interact with Red Oak acorns indicating that these species have different foraging preferences.

AB  - The study aims to analyze the dynamics of the Eurasian lynx in the mountain taiga, and to search for the factors affecting the numbers of this predator. The study was conducted in the Southern Urals (Russia) from 2008 to 2019. The dynamics of lynx and its main prey numbers Capreolus pygargus, , Lepus timidus and L. europaeus, , Tetrao urogallus and Bonasa bonasia is based on the data obtained during the complex winter census (CWC). Annual CWCs were performed in Chelyabinsk Oblast with total area of 23.445.5 km2. 2 . The hypotheses on the influence of snow depth on the number of lynx and the relationship between the dynamics of the predator and prey abundances were tested using regression method. The relationship between the number of lynx and snow depth were obtained using Spearman's coefficient. The number of lynxes varied from 51 to 281 individuals, population density- from 0.09 lynx/100 km(2) to 0.48 lynx/100 km(2). The lowest abundances were recorded in 2013 and 2016. In the winters of 2013 and 2016, the snow depth was 2.0-2.5 times greater than on average for long-term observations. However, no significant decrease in the number of the Siberian roe deer was observed in these years, while the number of lynxes decreased by 2 times compared to the previous years. No significant correlation was found between the abundance of lynxes and the Siberian roe deer, r = 0.25 +/- 0.3. A negative relationship was found between the amount of precipitation and the winter number of lynxes (r =-0.717 +/- 0.22; p < 0.05). The amount of snow cover in the Southern Ural Mountains is an important factor affecting the distribution of ungulates. The snow depth may determine the lynx presence both directly and through the changes in the number of its main prey.

AB  - Drug-resistant parasites threaten livestock production. Breeding more resistant hosts could be a sustainable control strategy. Environmental variation linked to animal management practices or to parasite species turnover across farms may however alter the expression of genetic potential. We created sheep lines with high or low resistance to Haemonchus contortus and achieved significant divergence on both phenotypic and genetic scales. We exposed both lines to chronic stress or to the infection by another parasite Trichostrongylus colubriformis, to test for genotype-by-environment and genotype-by-parasite species interactions respectively. Between-line divergence remained significant following chronic stress exposure although between-family variation was found. Significant genotype-by-parasite interaction was found although H. contortus-resistant lambs remained more resistant against T. colubriformis. Growth curves were not altered by the selection process although resistant lambs were lighter after the second round of divergence, before any infection took place. Breeding for resistance is a sustainable strategy but allowance needs to be made for environmental perturbations and worm species.

AB  - Simple Summary Regulatory SNPs (rSNPs) are SNPs located within promoter regions that have a high potential to alter gene expression by changing the binding affinity of transcription factors to their binding sites. Such rSNPs are gaining importance in the life sciences due to their causality for specific traits and diseases. In this study, we present agReg-SNPdb, the first database comprising rSNP data of seven agricultural and domestic animal species: cattle, pig, chicken, sheep, horse, goat, and dog, and made it usable via a web interface. Transcription factors (TFs) govern transcriptional gene regulation by specifically binding to short DNA motifs, known as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs), in regulatory regions, such as promoters. Today, it is well known that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TFBSs can dramatically affect the level of gene expression, since they can cause a change in the binding affinity of TFs. Such SNPs, referred to as regulatory SNPs (rSNPs), have gained attention in the life sciences due to their causality for specific traits or diseases. In this study, we present agReg-SNPdb, a database comprising rSNP data of seven agricultural and domestic animal species: cattle, pig, chicken, sheep, horse, goat, and dog. To identify the rSNPs, we constructed a bioinformatics pipeline and identified a total of 10,623,512 rSNPs, which are located within TFBSs and affect the binding affinity of putative TFs. Altogether, we implemented the first systematic analysis of SNPs in promoter regions and their impact on the binding affinity of TFs for livestock and made it usable via a web interface.

AB  - In the Burwash area of north-central Ontario, Canada, expansion of the Trans-Canada highway from 2 to 4 lanes was accompanied by installation of a range of wildlife collision-mitigation infrastructure (e.g., exclusion fencing, underpasses). To assess the overall effectiveness of these measures, we monitored the spatial distribution and mortality rates of elk (Cervus canadensis) prior to and following highway expansion, distinguished by season (winter, snowfree) and corridor-type (highway, railway). We measured herd-level risk by the proportion of positions falling within 200-m railway and highway buffer zones using Bayesian methods. Spatial analysis confirmed that there was a distinct northward shift in the winter distribution of elk following construction, situating the elk past the north end of the exclusion fence. This increased the herd's exposure to highway traffic by 3.6 times (proportion of points before = 0.0041 +/- 0.002 [SE], after = 0.0147 +/- 0.003, P = 0.005), and resulted in a more than 2-fold increase in elk road mortality from 0.6 elk/yr/20 km during 8 years prior to implementation to 1.5 elk/yr/20 km during 8 years after implementation. Exposure to railways remained unchanged and consistently higher than highway exposure regardless of season (e.g., post-mitigation, winter proportion of points = 0.0453 +/- 0.005), matched by consistently high mortality counts (proportion of points before = 6.4 elk/yr/20 km, after = 6.6 elk/yr/20 km). Our results demonstrate that while wildlife-vehicle collision mitigation is generally beneficial to wildlife and humans, failure to account for the local characteristics of wildlife populations can lead to suboptimal mitigation designs that reduce their effectiveness and lead to unintended wildlife impacts.

AB  - Sublethal biomass loss has been found to have a variety of effects on marine macroalgae, from decreasing reproductive output to increasing individual survival and frond density. The ability of an individual to recover and persist through herbivore and wave damage is facilitated by the location of several meristematic growth regions throughout an individual. In kelps (Order Laminariales), meristems are found basally at the holdfast, at the base of each blade, and/or apically on each frond. In the intertidal kelp Egregia menziesii, fronds are thought to have an intercalary meristem at a transition zone between the main frond's midrib and a small terminal lamina. This study examined the effect of removing the terminal blade and transition zone on the elongation of the frond and found no significant difference in growth, contrary to expectations. Elongation occurred in the 30 cm of midrib at the apical end of fronds and was not isolated at the base of the terminal lamina as was previously thought. These results indicate the presence of a diffuse meristematic growth region that has not been reported in other kelps and may be an advantage for this intertidal species.

AB  - The crevalle jack Caranx hippos (Carangidae: Caranginae) is a commercially important carangid, especially along the Brazilian Northeastern coast. However, little is known about its population structure and genetic diversity, which is crucial information for species conservation. Using mitochondrial [barcode region COI and control region] and nuclear (first intron S7) data, we investigated the genetic structure and demographic history of C. hippos along the Brazilian Northeastern coast, and included the COI public database to provide a latitudinal approach. Both mitochondrial markers revealed two coexistent lineages along the Brazilian Northeastern coast, while the nuclear DNA did not recover any signals of structure. This mitonuclear discordance can be explained by both male dispersal and demographic history, which seem to be closely related to the Pleistocene period. Over the glacial cycles, the lineages may have used different refuges, regaining contact during the interglacial cycles. This hypothesis of previous allopatry is reinforced by the profound genetic distance found. The latitudinal approach reveals a deep differentiation between the Carolina and both Brazilian and Caribbean Provinces, with high and significant FST pairwise values, such that the tropical-temperate climate transition may be acting as a gene flow barrier between them. Thus, we suggest two preliminary stocks for C. hippos in the Atlantic: (1) Carolina and (2) Brazilian and Caribbean Provinces.

AB  - The laminarialean kelp Saccharina latissima is a common macroalga along rocky shorelines that is also frequently used in aquaculture. This study examined how ocean acidification may alter the growth of S. latissima as well as grazing on S. latissima by the gastropod Lacuna vincta. Under elevated nutrients, S. latissima experienced significantly enhanced growth at pCO(2) levels >= 1200 mu atm compared to ambient pCO(2) (similar to 400 mu atm). Elevated pCO(2) (>= 830 mu atm) also significantly reduced herbivory of L. vincta grazing on S. latissima relative to ambient pCO(2). There was no difference in grazing of S. latissima previously grown under elevated or ambient pCO(2), suggesting lowered herbivory was due to harm to the gastropods rather than alteration of the biochemical composition of the kelp. Decreased herbivory was specifically elicited when L. vincta were exposed to elevated pCO(2) in the absence of food for >= 18 h prior to grazing, with reduced grazing persisting 72 h. Elevated growth of S. latissima and reduced grazing by L. vincta at 1200 mu atm pCO(2) combined to increase net growth rates of S. latissima more than 4-fold relative to ambient pCO(2). L. vincta consumed 70% of daily production by S. latissima under ambient pCO(2) but only 38 and 9% at 800 and 1200 mu atm, respectively. Collectively, decreased grazing by L. vincta coupled with enhanced growth of S. latissima under elevated pCO(2) demonstrates that increased CO2 associated with climate change and/or coastal processes will dually benefit commercially and ecologically important kelps by both promoting growth and reducing grazing pressure.

The impact of animal-derived biochar on As mobilization under fluctuating redox conditions in paddy soils has not been studied. Consequently, we investigated the effects of pig carcass-derived biochar (PB) on As (im)mobilization in a contaminated paddy soil under controlled redox potential (Eh) using a biogeochemical microcosm setup. The addition of PB decreased the concentration of dissolved As at Eh = +100 and +200 mV by 38.7% and 35.4%, respectively (compared to the control), because of the co-precipitation of As with Fe-Mn oxides and the complexation between As and aromatic organic molecules. However, under reducing conditions (Eh = -300 mV), PB increased the dissolved As by 13.5% through promoting reduction and decomposition of As-bearing Fe minerals (e.g., ferrihydrite-As, Fe-humic-As). Under oxidizing conditions (Eh = +250 mV), PB increased the dissolved As by 317.6%, due to the associated increase of pH. We conclude that As mobilization in PB-treated paddy soils is highly affected by Eh. PB can be used to reduce the environmental risk of As under moderately reducing conditions, but it may increase the risk under highly reducing and oxidizing conditions in paddy soils.

AB  - The use of agricultural practices such as fertilization and intercropping can improve the production of forage cacti. The objective of this study was to evaluate the agronomic characteristics of forage cactus intercropped with leguminous trees and fertilized with different sources of manure in the tropical semiarid region of Brazil. The research was carried out at the Agricultural and Livestock Research Enterprise of Pernambuco State during the period from March 2011 to September 2013. The following cultivation systems were used: (i) Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Kunth + forage cactus cv. IPA-Sertania [Opuntia cochenillifera (L.) Mill]; (ii) Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit + forage cactus; and (iii) forage cactus in monoculture. All of these systems were fertilized with different sources of manure (cattle, goat, sheep, and broiler litter). The goat and sheep manure (16.6 and 16.5 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)) provided the least production of cactus in the different cropping systems. Cattle manure provided greater production of forage and wood from legumes (1.4 and 4.3 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)) and cactus (20.9 Mg DM ha(-1) year(-1)). Gliricidia produced more forage and wood than Leucaena. Total production of the forage cactus-Gliricidia system produced 4.7 and 3.8 Mg DM ha(-1) of biomass and wood in two years, respectively. The production and morphological characteristics of the cactus increased at further distance from the trees (3 m), and the opposite effect was observed for the concentrations of N, p, and K. Thus, cropping systems using forage cactus and tree legumes fertilized with manure represent an option for tropical semiarid regions.

AB  - In an era of coral reef decline, coral restoration is receiving increasing attention, with many recent developments in culture and transplant techniques. However, how the ecological processes operating on coral reefs influence the success of restoration efforts remains largely unexplored, particularly during the first months after outplanting which are considered crucial for colony survival. Herbivory is a key process well-known to maintain a coral-dominated state, and in the Caribbean Sea, the long-spine urchin Diadema antillarum is thought to aid coral success by removing algae from seafloor substrate that might otherwise outcompete coral outplants. In this study, we conducted a three-month manipulative experiment in southeastern Dominican Republic to test the effect of Diadema antillarum density on percent living tissue and growth rate of outplanted fragments of the critically endangered coral species Acropora cervicornis. Increasing herbivore density had no significant effect on coral survival or growth but did increase the percent of living tissue when urchin abundance was 3x ambient levels. The greatest growth and survival outcomes were instead related to the initial size of the outplanted coral and were reduced through predation by the fireworm Hermodice carunculata. Our results highlight the potential importance of considering ecological processes like herbivory and predation to maximize the success of ecological restoration.

AB  - Ancient environmental DNA (aeDNA) from lake sediments has yielded remarkable insights for the reconstruction of past ecosystems, including suggestions of late survival of extinct species. However, translocation and lateral inflow of DNA in sediments can potentially distort the stratigraphic signal of the DNA. Using three different approaches on two short lake sediment cores of the Yamal peninsula, West Siberia, with ages spanning only the past hundreds of years, we detect DNA and identified mitochondrial genomes of multiple mammoth and woolly rhinoceros individuals-both species that have been extinct for thousands of years on the mainland. The occurrence of clearly identifiable aeDNA of extinct Pleistocene megafauna (e.g. >400 K reads in one core) throughout these two short subsurface cores, along with specificities of sedimentology and dating, confirm that processes acting on regional scales, such as extensive permafrost thawing, can influence the aeDNA record and should be accounted for in aeDNA paleoecology.

AB  - To what extent particular plant defences against herbivorous insects are constitutive or inducible will depend on the costs and benefits in their neighbourhood. Some defensive chemicals in leaves are thought to be costly and hard to produce rapidly, while others, including volatile organic compounds that attract natural enemies, might be cheaper and can be released rapidly. When surrounding tree species are more closely related, trees can face an increased abundance of both specialist herbivores and their parasitoids, potentially increasing the benefits of constitutive and inducible defences. To test if oaks (Quercus robur) respond more to herbivore attacks with volatile emission than with changes in leaf phenolic chemistry and carbon to nitrogen ratio (C: N), and whether oaks respond to the neighbouring tree species, we performed an experiment in a forest in Poland. Oak saplings were placed in neighbourhoods dominated by oak, beech, or pine trees, and half of them were treated with the phytohormone methyl jasmonate (elicitor of anti-herbivore responses). Oaks responded to the treatment by emitting a different volatile blend within 24 h, while leaf phenolic chemistry and C: N remained largely unaffected after 16 days and multiple treatments. Leaf phenolics were subtly affected by the neighbouring trees with elevated flavan-3-ols concentrations in pine-dominated plots. Our results suggest that these oaks rely on phenols as a constitutive defence and when attacked emit volatiles to attract natural enemies. Further studies might determine if the small effect of the neighbourhood on leaf phenolics is a response to different levels of shading, or if oaks use volatile cues to assess the composition of their neighbourhood.

AB  - The structure of ecological communities is rapidly changing across the globe due to climate-mediated shifts in species distributions, with novel ecosystem states emerging as new species become dominant. While it is clear that such changes restructure habitat properties and their associated assemblages, how new nutritional resources and consumers may affect the ecosystem trophic structure and energetic dynamics remains poorly resolved.
   Here, we investigate how the reconfiguration of tropicalized reefs-that is, temperate ecosystems receiving an influx of tropical species-affects the availability of nutritional resources and energy flow through herbivore-based trophic pathways. To do so, we quantified changes in algal and detrital resources along a tropicalization gradient in eastern Australia. We also estimated energy flow towards herbivorous fishes by quantifying their standing biomass (kg/ha), productivity (kg ha(-1) day(-1)), and biomass turnover (% day(-1)), using an individual-level modelling approach that combines estimates of fish growth rates and mortality.
   Along the gradient, tropicalized reefs had relatively higher amounts of palatable algal turfs and detrital particulates compared to non-tropicalized sites. Feeding intensity by herbivorous fishes was also c. 400 times higher on tropicalized reefs, with tropical turf-cropping surgeon fishes being responsible for >98% of the feeding rates.
   Turf-driven trophic pathways underpinned virtual all (>99%) of the biomass produced by tropical fishes, which contributed up to 63% of the total herbivorous fish standing biomass and 86% of the productivity despite only representing 35% of the abundance. Turfs also fuelled most of the secondary productivity of tropical fishes on tropicalized reefs across Australia's western tropical-temperate transition zone, although their overall productivity was similar to 5 times lower. This is possibly due to turfs there containing elevated sediment loads, which dilute the nutritional quality of turf-based resources, as well as other differences in the biogeographical context.
   We propose that algal turfs are central drivers of ecosystem energetic shifts on temperate reefs as they become tropicalized because they support novel algal UWA and detrital trophic pathways that enhance secondary productivity and biomass turnover. Our results also suggest that turf characteristics such as organic content or sediment load may emerge as increasingly important drivers of energy flow in temperate locations where turfs dominate benthic cover.

AB  - Interpreting and responding to environmental cues from different modalities has survival value. In fish, the role of multimodal perception has been studied in regard to both foraging and risk assessment, with modalities including vision, olfaction, and mechanoreception via lateral lines. We studied reef fish boldness by placing novel objects that obstructed vision, lateral line use, or both into a coral reef environment with native algal samples inside, and then quantifying exploration as a function of obstruction type and as a function of functional diet groups (herbivores, omnivores, carnivores). Fish were more neophobic with more sensory obstructions, displaying longer latencies to visitation across all novel objects. Fish were also less likely to pass by objects that blocked multiple perceptual modalities. Across diets, there is early evidence that different functional groups respond differently to novelty. However, this conclusion requires further study. Overall, our findings provide key insights into perceptual ecology. In turn, this knowledge can be applied to understanding the effects of novel anthropogenic modifications in the marine environment. Such modifications may include positive activities like the construction of substrates to restore coral reefs, coral transplantation to restore reefs, as well as the negative consequences of construction and pollution.

AB  - Monitoring wildlife populations in vast, remote landscapes poses significant challenges for conservation and management, particularly when studying elusive species that range across inaccessible terrain. Traditional survey methods often prove impractical or insufficient in such environments, necessitating innovative technological solutions. This study evaluates the effectiveness of deep learning for automated Bactrian camel detection in drone imagery across the complex desert terrain of the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Using YOLOv8 and a dataset of 1479 high-resolution drone-captured images of Bactrian camels, we developed and validated an automated detection system. Our model demonstrated strong detection performance with high precision and recall values across different environmental conditions. Scale-aware analysis revealed distinct performance patterns between medium- and small-scale detections, informing optimal drone flight parameters. The system maintained consistent processing efficiency across various batch sizes while preserving detection quality. These findings advance conservation monitoring capabilities for Bactrian camels and other wildlife in remote ecosystems, providing wildlife managers with an efficient tool to track population dynamics and inform conservation strategies in expansive, difficult-to-access habitats.

AB  - The Brazilian Intertropical Region (BIR) abounds with tank (natural reservoir) deposits, a primary source of late Quaternary megafauna remains. However, most of these important deposits lack comprehensive taphonomic analysis. In this study, we conducted a taphonomic analysis of Quaternary vertebrates from a specific tank deposit located at Fazenda Charco (Poco Redondo, Sergipe State), Brazil. We aimed to: (i) reconstruct the biostratinomic processes that influenced the deposition of vertebrate remains; (ii) interpret some fossildiagenetic features; and (iii) compare our findings with other tank deposits to highlight the main preservation patterns among these deposits. Additionally, we discuss the paleoenvironmental and paleoecological aspects of this vertebrate assemblage. The paleocommunity comprised eighteen individuals, including megamammals and reptiles, with a total of eleven taxa identified in the tank deposit, indicating a highly diversified assemblage. Eremotherium laurillardi and Toxodontinae indeterminate accounted for more than one individual each. Despite the high diversity, taphonomic features suggest the dominance of E. laurillardi in the assemblage and the preservation of bones transported from moderately distant locations to the tank deposit. Furthermore, Fazenda Charco exhibits a complex tank deposit characterized by various taphonomic signatures, including abrasion, trample marks, weathering, fragmentation, staining colors and bioerosions. These findings indicate that the bones underwent reworking events and were exposed to environmental conditions before their final burial. By integrating our taphonomic results with available isotopic, pollen, and speleothem data, we infer that a dry forest, resembling the extant Caatinga biome, prevailed during the past 42,000 years. This suggests a predominantly arid environment with a mosaic of phytophysiognomy dominated by herbs and shrubs. The further integration of taphonomic and paleoecological analyses of fossils from tank deposits will contribute to a more refined reconstruction of the paleoenvironmental scenario and the ecological interactions that occurred during the late Quaternary.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The puma (Puma concolor) is widely distributed in the alpine highlands of the Andes, but its diet has rarely been described in ecosystems above 4300 m. We collected and examined 21 puma scats from the Salinas y Aguada Blanca National Reserve (RNSAB) between 2013 and 2015. We identified 10 species of prey, in addition to unidentified birds and small rodents. Small and medium animals were the most frequent prey, although wild camelids contributed the greatest proportion of biomass. We also recorded the presence of mesopredators and domestic dogs in puma scats. Our results suggest that the puma could play a key role in the configuration of trophic networks in the RNSAB, and that this can contribute considerably to the ecosystem balance.

AB  - Background. Fire modulates herbivore dynamics in open ecosystems. While extensive work demonstrates the interaction between fire and vertebrate grazers, less research describes how grasshopper herbivory dynamics respond to fire. Aim. We examined how fire increased grass crude protein content and increased the density of and offtake by grasshoppers relative to unburned mixed-grass prairie. Methods. We deployed grasshopper exclusion cages to determine grasshopper offtake of aboveground plant biomass, counted grasshopper abundance throughout the study period, and measured crude protein content of aboveground grass biomass. Key results. Offtake and density were higher in burned versus unburned plots. Burned plot grasshopper density increased over time, with greater rates of increase in recently burned plots, while density remained constant in unburned locations. Conclusions. We present a potential mechanism by which fire interacts with grasshoppers in open ecosystems. It is likely that greater grasshopper offtake and density in recently-burned plots is at least partially attributable to higher crude protein content, as grass in these plots has a much higher proportion of recent growth after fire removed senesced material.

AB  - Eruptive population dynamics of forest insect species regularly attract the interest of ecologists but also often evoke debates among stakeholders concerning impacts that outbreaks or pest control activities have on forest commu-nities including insectivorous birds. Lymantria dispar is the most serious native defoliator in mixed oak-broadleaf forests in Central Europe. To investigate the treatment effects of L. dispar density, aerial application of the insec-ticide Mimic (tebufenozide) and nest box accessibility for L. dispar caterpillars on nest box success of cavity nesting birds, we deployed 352 nest boxes in a full factorial experimental design with 11 replicates. L. dispar density was predicted by egg mass counts made in the year before the study. The accessibility of nest boxes for L. dispar cat-erpillars was manipulated in all study sites by placing nest boxes on trunks for easy access to caterpillars and on branches for more difficult access. Successful nest boxes (binary metric that combines failed breeding attempt and empty nest box) and nest productivity (number of fledged chicks in successful boxes) were monitored in the peak year of a L. dispar outbreak, during which half of the plots were treated with Mimic, as well as in the following year when L. dispar populations had widely collapsed, and no further treatments were applied. L. dispar and non-target caterpillar biomass was sampled by canopy fogging to quantify prey abundance. Caterpillar biomass was signifi-cantly reduced by Mimic in the treatment year and remained low in the post-treatment year. Despite the reduction of caterpillars, our zero-inflation model found no effect of any tested variables on nest box success of the early brood. However, in the late broods the number of successful nest boxes was reduced in Mimic treated plots in the first year by 42%, while unaffected by initial L. dispar density. The number of successful nest boxes in the second year was lower in areas with initially high L. dispar densities and there was a marginal carry-over effect of insec-ticide treatment. L. dispar caterpillars entered nest boxes on the trunk in higher numbers than boxes on the branch, but nest box position had no effect on nest box success of birds.We conclude that despite its strong negative impact on caterpillar prey, aerial application of Mimic targeting L. dispar caused an increase in the number of failed boxes in late broods in sprayed plots, particularly in the year of application and to some extent in the year after. We presume this delayed effect of Mimic only on late broods to be caused by Mimic-induced caterpillar shortages during first broods leading to an increased parental effort and a subsequent reduced number of second broods. The generally limited impact of Mimic might be explained by the overall extensive availability of alternate prey in oak forests in May during first broods and the ability of tits to increase their parental effort in times of caterpillar shortage. In unsprayed sites, L. dispar densities can create legacies of impact in following years, but caterpillars do not directly affect birds nest box success despite entering cavities.

AB  - Premise Leaf economic spectrum (LES) theory has historically been employed to inform vegetation models of ecosystem processes, but largely neglects intraspecific variation and biotic interactions. We attempt to integrate across environment-plant trait-herbivore interactions within a species at a range-wide scale.
   Methods We measured traits in 53 populations spanning the range of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) and used a common garden to determine the role of environment in driving patterns of intraspecific variation. We used a feeding trial to determine the role of plant traits in monarch (Danaus plexippus) larval development.
   Results Trait-trait relationships largely followed interspecific patterns in LES theory and persisted in a common garden when individual traits change. Common milkweed showed intraspecific variation and biogeographic clines in traits. Clines did not persist in a common garden. Larvae ate more and grew larger when fed plants with more nitrogen. A longitudinal environmental gradient in precipitation corresponded to a resource gradient in plant nitrogen, which produces a gradient in larval performance.
   Conclusions Biogeographic patterns in common milkweed traits can sometimes be predicted from LES, are largely driven by environmental conditions, and have consequences for monarch larval performance. Changes to nutrient dynamics of landscapes with common milkweed could potentially influence monarch population dynamics. We show how biogeographic trends in intraspecific variation can influence key ecological interactions, especially in common species with large distributions.

AB  - Acanthurus nigrofuscus (Acanthuridae), a common fish on the coral reefs of the Ryukyu Islands, southern Japan, is considered to be important for maintaining the health of coral reef ecosystems. However, the life history of the species in Japan is largely unknown. In this study, age, growth and maturation of A. nigrofuscus was determined from 395 specimens [44.7-174.5 mm fork length (FL)] collected between September 2020 and March 2022 on the Miyagi coast, located on the west coast of Okinawa-jima Island, central Ryukyu Islands. Mean gonadosomatic indices were high in September 2020 and from May to August 2021 for both sexes, with histological observations of the gonads revealing that individuals with developed oocytes (migratory nucleus and hydrated stages) occurred from May to September. Postovulatory follicles were observed in individuals collected in September 2020 and from May to August 2021. The length (age) at 50% maturity was 104.1 mm FL (1.0 yr) for females and 93.9 mm FL (0.5 yr) for males, the age range being 0-25 yr (n = 193) for females and 0-20 yr (n = 170) for males, with von Bertalanffy growth functions of Lt = 148.6 {1 - exp [-0.51 (t + 1.55)]} for females, Lt = 156.0 {1 - exp [-0.38 (t + 2.01)]} for males, and Lt = 151.8 {1 - exp [-0.40 (t + 2.11)]} for both sexes combined. Similar to other species of Acanthridae, A. nigrofuscus has a long-lived biphasic growth trajectory, with rapid initial growth and a long lifespan after reaching asymptotic size.

AB  - Seagrasses provide a wide range of ecosystem services and are prioritized in conservation planning. Management of this dynamic community requires describing seagrass responses to repeated grazing by dependent herbivores. Using two experimental randomized block designs in Humboldt Bay, California, we tested responses of eelgrass (Zostera marina) to separate and combined effects of simulated Brant Goose (Branta bernicla) grazing (clipping to a uniform height) and fecal pellet addition, and then to medium (MED) and severe (SEV) intensities of simulated Brant flock visitation. In Experiment 1, clipping with fecal addition (FC) stimulated more clonal addition of shoots than controls or clipping and fecal addition alone (standardized beta = 0.26 relative to control). The FC treatment also had the largest positive, delayed effect (beta = 0.135) on density of flowering shoots. In Experiment 2, the MED intensity treatment had positive effects on shoot density (beta = 0.149), rates of leaf extension (beta = 0.16), and leaf productivity (beta = 0.20). These MED treatment responses resulted in the highest measures of above-ground (beta = 0.099) and below-ground (beta = 0.32) biomass. Whole shoot (beta(MED) = 0.33, beta(SEV) = -0.36) and landscape (beta(MED) = 0.34, beta(SEV) = -0.23) levels of productivity for the MED treatment reflected the parabolic shape predicted by the compensatory regrowth hypothesis, likely because light and nutrient resources were available to the eelgrass and meristems that were not damaged. Meristem injury in the SEV treatment likely explained why productivity was low, but the high SEV resource levels allowed these plants to recover to control levels in approximately eight to 10 weeks after the last treatment applications. The MED level of shoot and landscape productivity would optimize low intertidal accessibility for Brant to the most nutritiously valuable leaves. Brant grazing and detrital pathways of carbon flow are likely linked with Brant-induced productivity contributing to the detrital pathway when Brant are present and after the birds leave the estuary. The effect of Brant grazing on eelgrass sexual reproduction may increase long-term resilience of estuarine ecosystems.

AB  - Melatonin, a hormone synthesized in various tissues, plays a crucial role in modulating sperm characteristics, yet its protective function on boar sperm remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the expression and localization of melatonin-related proteins (AANAT, ASMT, MT1, MT2, and NQO2) in pig tissues, assess the impact of melatonin on pig sperm motility parameters and quality, and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results revealed widespread expression of AANAT, ASMT, MT1, MT2, and NQO2 proteins in pig tissues, particularly in the testis. Specific localization patterns were observed in Leydig cells, reproductive epithelium, and columnar epithelium cells in the testis and cauda epididymis. Additionally, melatonin membrane receptors MT1 and MT2 were detected in boar sperm. Melatonin treatment significantly enhanced boar sperm motility parameters and quality, particularly with 10 nM melatonin treatment. Inhibition of the MT1 receptor, but not the MT2 receptor, resulted in decreased sperm motility, highlighting the pivotal role of the MT1 receptor in mediating melatonin ' s effects on boar sperm. Metabolomic analysis revealed significant alterations in sperm metabolites following melatonin supplementation, particularly in amino acid metabolism. Overall, our findings provide comprehensive insights into melatonin ' s mechanisms in improving boar sperm quality, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for enhancing male fertility.

AB  - Here, we describe the morphology of the setal types of the feeding apparatus (mandible, maxillule, maxilla, first to third maxillipeds and the cheliped) of three species of sesarmid crabs, Aratus pisonii, Armases angustipes and Sesarma rectum, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The setal types previously identified encompass pappose, plumose, plumodenticulate, serrated, simple, and cuspidate, each with its own distinct subtypes. Three different types of setae are described and named here: capitate, cluster serrated, and scopa setae. The three species' mouthparts are very similar, but Aratus pisonii has some marked differences, being the only species to have capitate setae on the first maxilliped, base and coxa of the maxilla and maxillule, and mandibular palp, plumodenticulate setae in the mandibular palp and tufts of cluster serrated setae in the chelipeds. Because it is considered the most herbivorous species among those studied, such differences possibly relate to the feeding habits.

AB  - We present a compilation of published telemetric results, complemented by the addition of new results where necessary, to justify the expansion of the marine protected areas in the Eastern Pacific. In addition, we furnish evidence that fishing effort by commercial vessels, carrying position-monitoring, satellite-communicating radio beacons, has diminished within their boundaries. Researchers have described the movement ecology of nine species of sharks at these insular sites: the Galapagos archipelago off Ecuador, Malpelo Island off Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and the Revillagigedo archipelago off Mexico. Mainly two telemetric techniques have been utilized: (1) placing coded ultrasonic beacons on individuals and detecting their presence with autonomous receivers deployed along the coasts of the islands and (2) outfitting individuals with SPOT and PSAT tags: the former enabling the ARGOS satellite to detect surface-swimming individuals, the latter releasing from individuals and rising to the surface to transmit geolocation based-positions to the same satellite. This information has enabled Mexico to create the Revillagigedo National Park, Colombia to increase the size of the Malpelo Fauna and Flora Sanctuary, and Costa Rica to create a protective corridor between Cocos and the Las Gemelas seamounts. Satellite tracking of sharks outside the current boundaries of the Galapagos Marine Reserve supports the need to increase its size in the future. Hence, telemetric studies have played and continue to serve an essential role in providing a well-supported rationale for research managers to match the size of their marine reserves to the spatial ecologies of the species within them.

FX  - We would like to express our appreciation to Galo Quezada and Washington Tapia, who provided the permit (Klimley PC-37-11) to conduct tagging studies in the Galapagos National Sanctuary. Eduardo Espinosa and Harry Reyes are thanked for overseeing for the Parque National Galapagos the research that was completed in the Galapagos archipelago. Many researchers helped in both the tagging and analysis of the resulting detection data, particularly Frida Lara-Lizardi, Robert Rubin, German Soler, George Shillinger, and Todd Steiner. Alex Antoniou of Fins Attached and Chris Fischer of OCEARCH provided ship time and funds for the purchase of acoustic and satellite tags as well as autonomous receivers. Scott Henderson of Conservation International was an early proponent of protecting sharks in the ETP. His input led to the first grant from 2001 to 2003 given by the Committee for Research and Exploration at the National Geographic Society, entitled "Tracking hammerhead sharks for creation of marine reserves" (principal investigator: senior author). That was followed by grants to the same investigator in 2007-2008, 2007-2008, 2009, and 2012. Additional funding for the tagging studies was provided by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation in 2004-2005, the Whitley Fund for Nature from 2005 to 2015, the World Wildlife Fund in 2007-2008, the International Community Foundation in 2009-2010, Conservation International in 2010-2011, and the Galapagos Conservancy in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. This work was completed under the auspice of two Animal Care Protocols obtained by the senior author at the University of California, Davis: (1) 12140 - "Tracking hammerhead sharks for creation of marine reserves" and (2) 16022 - "Tracking sharks in the open ocean." The acoustic tag detections and satellite tracks presented in this article for (1) the Revillagigedos Islands are present in a database maintained by Pelagios Kakunja, (2) the detections at Cocos Island are in a database kept by Centro de Rescate de Especies Marinas Amenazadas (CREMA) and the Ocean Tracking Network (OTN), (3) files of acoustic detections and satellite tracks for Malpelo Island are present in a database maintained by Fundacion Malpelo y Otros Ecosistemas Marinos, and (4) the acoustic detections for the Galapagos archipelago are present in the database of OTN and satellite tracks for the Galapagos archipelago are under curatorship of ARH at the Universidad San Francisco de Quito.

AB  - Evaluating the mechanisms that drive plant invasions in grassland ecosystems can provide insight into subtle, yet critical, drivers of ecosystem function. Common hypotheses for invader success are that (1) an invader's physiology may allow better use of resources and competitively exclude resident natives; (2) the lack of invader-specific herbivores and diseases may result in increased growth and competitive advantage over natives; (3) invaders may bring pathogens or herbivores that negatively impact native plants directly; (4) the invader may be able to establish earlier or later than natives, giving it a priority effect or phenological niche separation; (5) the invader may produce more seeds, and propagule pressure may allow it to eventually dominate; and (6) once the invader occurs on a site, its plant detritus or litter can offer a legacy effect advantage. Yet, a widely neglected aspect of invasion is that invaders may prime the conditions in places other than where they are currently established, giving them a pioneer effect advantage. These pioneer effects can come from plant materials that move from invaded to uninvaded areas through three pathways-pollen, litter, seeds, and their associated microbiomes-each of which can favor the invader directly or indirectly. In turn, unsuccessful cohorts of seedlings can change the biotic community through root exudates as well as any biotic load they bring with them, along with taking up nutrients and potentially subverting the litter decay cycle. When seedlings of invaders occur at times when the native species have evolved not to germinate, site priming impacts may increase or accelerate. We propose that monitoring of uninvaded areas adjacent to invaded areas is needed to assess the emerging significance of pioneer effects and site priming in advancing plant invasions, especially in grassland systems worldwide.

AB  - Context: In recent years, the focus on sustainable meat production in large-scale pig farming has increased. An essential element is acquiring and evaluating digital data on ecological, outdoor pig housing environments and individuals. Objective: Some of the precision farming Internet of Things (IoT) tools that can be used in pasture-based, extensive pig production include those that have been proven in pasture-based ruminants and have been used in confined pig production for many years. These include Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) technology, in which passive RFID tags attached to pigs' ears capture signals from a reader equipped with an antenna. The reader can also be used to collect weather parameters. Methods: In our on-farm research, which lasted 7 months and covered three seasons, we used RFID technology to investigate the effects of ambient temperature, humidity, air pressure, and hour of day on the appearance of breeding sows kept on pasture at the wallowing site. Results and conclusion: We found that all three weather parameters and hour-of-day had a significant effect (p < 0.001) on the appearance of sows at the wallow. We calculated the THI (Temperature Humidity Index) and found days in summer and early autumn when there was a risk of heat stress. This is essential information for the pig farmer because heat stress has a strong negative effect on sow fertility. Our on-farm study found that RFID technology is suitable for detecting the presence of pigs in the pasture. However, the limitations of the technology, both in terms of the housing environment and the species specificity of the pigs, need to be taken into account. Significance: In pasture-based pig production systems, the meat production process is performed under extensive conditions of natural animal-environment interaction. The negative impact on the natural environment is much lower, but animal welfare is higher than in intensive pig farming. It is also a profit-oriented activity, where the production of traceable and reliable animal products is a social and economic requirement. Collecting information from trusted sources using precision livestock farming (PLF) techniques is also feasible in this type of farming, providing significant added value for pig farmers and consumers.

AB  - Animal husbandry is one of man's oldest occupations. It began with the domestication of animals and developed continuously, in parallel with the evolution of human society. The selection and improvement of goats in Romania was not a clearly defined objective until around 1980. In recent years, with the increasing economic value given to goats, breeding programs are becoming established. In Romania, a few goat genetic studies using microsatellites and mtDNA have been carried out; however, a systematic characterization of the country's goat genomic resources remains missing. In this study, we analyzed the genetic variability of Carpatina goats from four distinct geographical areas (northern, north-eastern, eastern and southern Romania), using the Illumina OvineSNP60 (RefSeq ARS1) high-density chip for 67 goats. Heterozygosity values, inbreeding coefficients and effective population size across all autosomes were calculated for those populations that inhabit high- and low-altitude and high- and low-temperature environments. Diversity, as measured by expected heterozygosity (HE), ranged from 0.413 in the group from a low-temperature environment to 0.420 in the group from a high-temperature environment. Within studied groups, the HT (high temperature) goats were the only group with a positive but low average inbreeding coefficient value, which was 0.009. After quality control (QC) analysis, 46,965 SNPs remained for analysis (MAF < 0.01). LD was calculated for each chromosome separately. The Ne has been declining since the time of domestication, having recently reached 123, 125, 185 and 92 for the HA (high altitude), LA (low altitude), HT (high temperature) and LT (low temperature) group, respectively. Our study revealed a low impact of inbreeding in the Carpatina population, and the Ne trend also indicated a steep decline in the last hundred years. These results will contribute to the genetic improvement of the Carpatina breed.

AB  - Xenophyophores dominate the abyssal megafauna across many areas of the Pacific Ocean. These giant agglutinated foraminifera have been studied mainly in the tropics, including within the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), from where the majority of recently described taxa have originated. Here, we describe three new species, one of them assigned to a new genus, from an area further north (30-32.5 degrees N) near the Japanese Archipelago. Specimens were collected in pushcores during dives of the manned submersible Shinkai 6500 and preserved in the cores after removal of fragments for genetic analyses, allowing them to be examined in life position using X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT). The three species have basically plate-like tests composed largely of mineral grains. Two, both from 32.5 degrees N, are assigned to the genus Psammina. They are closely related to each other and to P. tenuis from the western CCZ. In Psammina yokosukae sp. nov., the test comprises curved plates, whereas in Psammina contorta sp. nov., it comprises a confusing array of contorted plates and other poorly defined structures. The third new species, Laminarena variabilis gen. et sp. nov., is genetically distinct from the others. In typical specimens from 30 degrees N, the plates are large, curved or sinuous, relatively thin, and marked by a distinct surface pattern of concentric zones, traversed by closely spaced, radial ridges that correspond to internal partitions. A form from 32.5 degrees N is shown to be conspecific with the 30 degrees N specimens based on molecular evidence but is morphologically more complex, comprising elongate bar-and plate-like elements, some with fan-like terminations. A fourth taxon, resembling a bumpy pebble and occupied by bubble-like internal compartments, is described informally. These new taxa enhance our knowledge of Pacific xenophyophores, as well as our understanding of the morphological diversity of xenophyophores in general.

AB  - We surveyed occurrence and activity of large- and medium-sized mammals on six commercial mini-rotation short-rotation coppice (SRC) plantations in northern Germany by camera trapping in different seasons (winter, late summer). In total, eleven species (6-9 per site) were detected. This corresponds to the majority of mammal species occurring in the study region. Roe deer, wild boar and red fox were found across all sites. All other species were detected on fewer sites and some in only one of the seasons. Roe deer was the most active species both in terms of visit frequency (days with detection) and use intensity (detection numbers). With few exceptions on individual sites, all other species showed significantly lower activity. Number of detected species and activity of most of the species did not differ between seasons. Furthermore, there were no differences between near-edge and central areas of the crops with regard to the activity of the occurring species. Activity of individual species on different sites, however, differed considerably in some cases. Our results show that a wide range of mammal species are basically able to include SRC into their habitat utilisation. However, the sporadic use by most species indicates a rather limited current habitat value of the surveyed plantations. Options to increase the habitat value of SRC for mammals are suggested, but their effectiveness needs to be tested in future studies. Since the spatial and temporal scope of our study was limited and only SRC of a uniform age-class were considered, our results are not immediately applicable to other landscapes, seasons or types and management phases of SRC. Therefore, further research is required that considers these aspects as well as species-specific patterns of habitat selection in comparison to other habitat types.

AB  - Biting flies can strongly influence the behaviour of their hosts, for example, there is evidence that some species may avoid harassment by reducing their locomotory activity. We tested the hypothesis that potential hosts can reduce their attraction to deer flies by remaining stationary-that reducing locomotory movement reduces exposure to new deer flies compared to remaining still. During early summer in central Ontario, Canada, we conducted 20-min trials where a human host either walked or sat quietly; tabanids were captured and counted each minute using a hat outfitted with a sticky trap. During 10 trials in each treatment, we captured a total of 868 deer flies, all in the genus Chrysops; the total capture while walking was nearly five-fold greater than while sitting. During trials, the change in catch rate also differed with host activity. While the host was sitting, the mean rate of capture declined rapidly (-16% per min) to nearly zero by 20 min. In contrast, while the host was walking, this decline was much more gradual (-5% per min); after 20 min, the catch rate remained nearly constant, at roughly half the initial rate. These results are consistent with the hypothesis.

AB  - As a kind of livestock manure, chicken manure (CM) was rich in organic matter and microorganisms. However, a large amount of foul gas discharged by its random stacking not only threatened the environment, but also caused harm to human health. In view of the serious carbon loss and the unclear action mechanism of microbial community on carbon metabolism during CM composting, the effect of adding regulators on the sequestration of organic carbon was explored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the regulation mechanism of adding tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) regulators on the core carbon metabolism pathway during CM composting. The results showed that the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and malonic acid (MA) slowed down organic carbon degradation, resulting in lower carbon loss rate, which were 64.99% (CK), 62.35% (MA), and 61.26% (ATP) in each treatment. By comparing the abundance and structure of the carbon-related bacterial communities in different treatments, it was found that adding ATP and MA not only reduced the bacterial community abundance, but also tended to be similar in bacterial community composition. Moreover, the microbial specificity related to carbon metabolism pathway was enhanced, while the related gene expression and gene abundance were weakened. The regulation of TCA cycle metabolism pathway was confirmed to be the main way to improve organic carbon content. These findings revealed the positive effects of ATP and MA on carbon fixation from the perspective of gene metabolism.

AB  - Reconciling conservation goals with sustainable resource use requires adaptive management strategies. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates global trade for species listed on Appendix II, partly by requiring member countries (parties) to ensure exports do not damage wild populations (called making positive "nondetriment findings" [NDFs]). Unfortunately, when parties find NDFs difficult, they often suspend legal trade, imposing economic costs and driving trade underground. To make it easier for parties to examine the detrimental nature of exports, we devised a spatial approach and applied it to seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) in Tamil Nadu, India, as an example. Our approach involves mapping answers to 5 key questions on species distribution (QA), pressures (QB), management measures (QC), management implementation (QD), and species' population status (QE). We gathered data from fisher interviews and published literature. Seahorse abundance was greatest in southern Palk Bay and the northern Gulf of Mannar, primarily in seagrasses and coral reefs (QA). Fishing pressure was highest in Palk Bay, primarily from bottom trawlers and dragnetters operating in shallow seahorse habitats near the coastline (QB). Management measures including a marine protected area (MPA), bottom trawl exclusion zone, and closed season were theoretically in place (QC), but their implementation was poor (QD). Fishers reported seahorse catches in 85% of the area covered by the MPA and the exclusion zone; bottom trawlers were responsible for most violations. Seahorses were also captured in Sri Lankan waters, where bottom trawling is banned. Fisher reports indicated declining seahorse catches and reduced body sizes (QE), highlighting unsustainable exploitation. Our results highlight the need for better implementation of existing management measures before a positive NDF can be made and suggest mitigation beyond bans. Such pragmatic spatial analyses can help regulate exports at sustainable levels, supporting CITES implementation for its vast range of species.

AB  - Copepods are considered relevant live feed for fish larval marine aquaculture. They promote fish larval survival and growth rate and reduce deformities when used as food source. The cyclopoid copepod Apocyplops royi are among others used in extensive Taiwanese aquaculture. However, knowledge on its performance in intensive cultures is limited. This study investigates parameters that are relevant prerequisites before initiating intensive tank cultures with A. royi. We found that the biochemical profile of A. royi is promising and relevant when used as live feed with a C:N ratio of 4.7 and a fatty acid ratio (DHA/EPA 3.2 +/- 0.7) that fulfil the minimum quantitatively dietary requirement of essential FAs for marine fish larvae and early juveniles. The size range of nauplii (78 - 245 mu m) is evaluated to be a feasible size for small mouthed first feeding marine fish larvae. The copepod exhibits similar specific growth rates as other cyclopoids (10% DW d(-1)). Further, we tested A. royi populations relative composition (nauplii, copepodites, males, females and ovigerous females) as an effect of culture densities and found no change within the test range (300 to 3800 ind. L-1). To evaluate the recruitment into the population we conducted an experiment with densities from a few hundred to 10,000 ind. L-1. We observed no density limitation on the female ovigerous rate = ((ovigerous females) / copepodites + adults) x 100) similar to 6%) even at very high densities. We demonstrated, that A. royi is a promising candidate for intensive copepod cultures and a relevant live feed for marine larval fish culture.

AB  - Shadow competition is the interception of moving prey by a predator closer to its arrival source, preventing its availability to predators downstream. Shadow competition is likely common in nature, and unlike some other competition types, has a strong spatial component (with the exception of competition for space, which clearly also has a spatial component). We used an individual-based spatially-explicit simulation model to examine whether shadow competition takes place and which factors affect it in four scenarios considering ambush predators and active prey. First, when prey capture is uncertain ('the ricochet effect'). Here, the strength of shadow competition increases when it is harder to capture prey after the first unsuccessful capture attempt, whereas shadow competition is moderated if capture success is higher in successive attempts. Second, shadow competition becomes stronger when predators can capture prey arriving only from certain directions. Third, when prey tend to move along a barrier after encountering it. Here, predators located along this barrier may be more successful than those at random positions, but shadow competition in this scenario drastically decreases the capture success of predators in central positions along a barrier (i.e. having more than a single neighbor). Finally, in three-level systems of plants in clusters, herbivores searching for plants, and predators ambushing herbivores inside plant patches, predators with ambush locations in the periphery of plant patches are more successful than those at the patch center, especially at high predator densities. Our simulation indicates that shadow competition is plausibly relevant in various scenarios of ambush predators and prey, and that it varies based on the habitat structure and capture probability of prey by predators as well as the change in capture probability with successive encounters.

AB  - The Pantanal is the world's largest and most biodiverse continental sheet-flow wetland. Recently, vast tracts of the Pantanal have succumbed to the occurrence of fires, raising serious concerns over the future integrity of the biodiversity and ecosystem services of this biome, including revenues from ecotourism. These wildfires degrade the baseline of natural ecosystems and the ecotourism economy across the region. Local residents ("Pantaneiros") anecdotally state that extensive cattle herbivory can solve the contemporary flammability problem of the Pantanal by controlling vegetation biomass, thereby preventing or reducing both fuel loads and fires across the region. Here, we examine the covariation between the presence and density of cattle and the incidence of fires across the Brazilian Pantanal. Variables assessed included bovine cattle density, SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index), GPP (Gross Primary Productivity)/biomass estimate, and fire foci along a 19-year time series (2001 to 2019). Our findings show that fire foci across the Pantanal biome are related to climatic variables, such as lower annual precipitation and higher annual drought indices (SPI) rather than to cattle stocking rates. Therefore, the notion of "cattle firefighting", a popular concept often discussed in some academic circles, cannot be validated because cattle numbers are unrelated to aboveground phytomass. Gross primary productivity further invalidated the "cattle herbivory" hypothesis because GPP was found to be strongly correlated with cattle density but not with the spatial distribution of fires. Fires throughout the Pantanal are currently aggravated by the presence of livestock and result from a combination of extreme weather events and outdated agricultural practices.

AB  - Bat fleas (Insecta: Siphonaptera: Ischnopsyllidae) are highly host-specific ectoparasites distributed worldwide (except Antarctica). The identification of flea species and the detection of flea-borne pathogens plays a significant role not only in veterinary and public health, but also in providing insights into the ecology, behaviour, and geographical distribution of fleas and flea-associated pathogens. The present study aimed to conduct a morphological and molecular identification of fleas collected from Lithuanian bats, as well as to screen for the presence of vector-borne pathogens. A total of 58 flea specimens were collected from bats in Lithuania. Based on morphological analysis, seven flea species were identified (Ischnopsyllus variabilis, I. octactenus, I. simplex, I. elongatus, I. hexactenus, Nycteridopsylla pentactena, and N. eusarca) and screened for the presence of Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Rickettsia spp., and Mycoplasma spp. Molecular analysis of fleas' COI and 18S rRNA genes showed that the flea species collected from bats are closely genetically related. Bartonella DNA was detected in bat fleas (41.4%). No DNA of Anaplasma, Borrelia, Babesia, Rickettsia, and Mycoplasma was amplified in the tested samples. The Wolbachia sp. was accidentally found in I. elongatus. The phylogenetic analysis of four Bartonella genes (16S-23S rRNA ITS, gltA, rpoB, and groEL) revealed specificity to bats or bats' ectoparasites. This is the first report about bat flea species and the pathogens in bat fleas in Lithuania. New host records for bat fleas were also reported. This study extends the knowledge about bat fleas and their role as vectors of different pathogens.

AB  - To understand home range characteristics and distribution of the released female milu (Pere David's deer, Elaphurus davidianus) population at Dongting Lake, China, we estimated home range size using the 95% minimum convex polygon method. A maximum flooded time index was calculated and the overlay analysis with seasonal home range data was employed. The results showed: (1) in seasons, the home range size of winter was the largest while it was the smallest in summer. It was also found that home range of dry and wet periods in 2017 was larger than in 2016 for the same period; (2) The milu population lived together in the released area. They even moved to outside of Dongting Lake in summer and moved back in autumn with the water level change. The milu population separated into several groups during the movement process; (3) By combining home range and the maximum flooded time index map, the milu population habitat covered various types of land use and active area when water source was included. While managing the two types of land use these should be connected by vegetation and should not be too far apart. In general, the home range distribution and size changed with the changing periods i.e. dry period and wet period. Available space, food resources, and shelter were influenced by water level variation in Dongting Lake, and water level may be the main factor affecting the distribution and home range size of milu population, indirectly utilizing the habitat.

AB  - Natural systems show heterogeneous patchy distributions of vegetation over large landscapes. Reaction- diffusion systems can demonstrate such heterogeneity of species distributions. Here, we analyse a reaction- diffusion model of plant-herbivore interactions in two-dimensional space to illustrate non -homogeneous distributions of plants and herbivores. The non -spatial system shows bottom -up control, where herbivore density is low under low and high primary productivity but increased at intermediate productivity. In addition, the non -spatial system provides bistability between a dense vegetation state devoid of herbivores and a coexisting state of plants and herbivores. In the spatiotemporal model, we give analytical conditions of occurring diffusion -driven (Turing) instability, where a novel point in our model is the relative dispersal of herbivores, which represents the movement of herbivores from a higher to a lower vegetation state in addition to the self -diffusion of both species. It is shown that heterogeneity in the population distribution does not occur if the relative dispersal of herbivores is low, but it appears in the opposite case. Due to bistability in the underlying non -spatial system, the spatiotemporal model produces initial value -dependent patterns. The two initial values make different patterns despite having the same primary productivity and relative dispersal rate. As productivity increases with a given relative herbivore dispersal, pattern transition occurs from a blend of stripes and spots of low vegetation state to a predominantly low -density vegetation state with smaller patches of densely vegetated states with one initial value. On the contrary, a discernible change in vegetation patterns from cold spots in the dense vegetation to hot stripes in the primarily low -vegetated state is noticed under the other initial population value. Furthermore, the population distributions of plants and herbivores in the entire domain after a long period are heterogeneous for both initial values, provided the relative herbivore dispersal is substantial. We estimated mean population densities to observe species fitness in the whole domain under variable productivity. When productivity is high, the mean population density of plants may go up or down, depending on the herbivore's relative dispersal rate. In contrast to the bottom -up control dynamics of the non -spatial system, the system exhibits a top -down control under high relative dispersal, where the herbivore regulates vegetation growth under high productivity. On the other hand, herbivores are extinct under high productivity if the relative dispersal is low.

AB  - Fish gut microbiota were potentially influenced by habitat changes. However, the fish gut has been shown to have a filtering effect on habitat microorganisms. Here, we hypothesized that the filtering of fish gut microbiota could counteract the effect of dam construction on the gut microbiota composition. To test this hypothesis, we collected water and Rhinogobio cylindricus individuals from four sampling sites located upstream of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and analyzed the microbiota composition in the water samples (n = 48) and R. cylindricus gut samples (n = 89) by high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 6,772,720 (49,435.91 +/- 3762.80) high-quality sequences were obtained from 137 samples. The microbiota in the water environment was significantly more diverse than that in the gut of R. cylindricus. The beta-diversity of microbiota in the water was significantly lower than that in the gut of R. cylindricus. The water microbiota composition varied greatly according to the distribution of the sampling sites upstream of the TGD, but the gut microbiota of R. cylindricus did not show the same pattern. Rather, the gut microbiota of R. cylindricus were not significantly affected by the TGD. This consistency in the internal tract of R. cylindricus is presumedly a result of a filtering effect on the water microorganisms. Our study furthers our understanding of the stabilization mechanism of the gut microbiota composition of fish and the impact of dams on river ecosystems.

AB  - Mountaintop removal coal mining impairs down-stream ecosystems through the delivery of nutrients, ions, and heavy-metals. Here, we show that this mining also impacts ecosystems downwind, and that the suite of environmental contaminants released includes polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs). We recovered a sediment core from Window Mountain Lake, located along the eastern slopes of Canada's Rocky Mountains. The sediment core records a similar to 30-fold increase in PAC concentrations, and a compositional profile that matches closely with coal mined in the Elk Valley, British Columbia, on the other side of the continental divide. Selenium concentrations have also increased, paralleling a rise in the Elk River, which drains the coal mines. The source of these contaminants is fugitive coal dust, emitted during mining and carried atmospherically from Pacific to Atlantic drainage basins. Atmospheric PAC emissions will increase as mines expand unless mitigation measures are implemented, and our results likely apply at similar mountaintop removal coal operations around the world.

AB  - Soybean plants that express various insecticidal proteins of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis have been widely adopted globally in many crop systems. This technology effectively controls the main defoliating pest species in most countries and reduces insecticide spray requirements. However, widespread use of Bt crops also generates high selection pressure against pest populations, leading to resistance concerns. Refuge areas are established to delay this phenomenon, but little is known about their other ecological functions. We evaluated the role of non-Bt soybean refuge areas regarding the abundance and richness of predator species in Bt soybean and non-Bt fields. For 2 years, herbivore and predatory arthropods were sampled in 28 soybean fields (RR/Bt) and their non-Bt soybean refuge areas (RR/noBt) in Uruguay, throughout the whole crop cycle. Landscape crop diversity (1 km radius) was characterized by its richness and evenness. Arthropod abundance and richness were analyzed using general linear mixed models. The abundance and richness of predators (Araneae, Coccinellidae, Heteroptera and Chrysopidae) found in Bt soybean were positively associated with the values recorded in refuge areas, independently of the diversity of the surrounding landscape. This relationship was not affected by changes in the distance between sampling points (within 800 m). The abundance of stink bugs and leaf-feeding caterpillars in Bt soybean was positively associated with refuge area values. Our results reinforce the importance of refuge areas, not only due to their role in resistance management, but also as preservation areas of beneficial fauna within a landscape approach to Integrated Pest Management in agroecosystems.

AB  - The continental margins of the Arctic Ocean basin contain methane seeps, where transient fluxes of seafloor methane are released due to the thermal dissociation of gas hydrates. An increase in shallow methane seeps identified over the past decade, potentially due to enhanced warming of the Arctic Ocean bottom water and associated destabilization of hydrate structure. Biological communities associated with methane release east of Svalbard in the Barents Sea (Storbanken Crater site, 76 degrees 46.7 ' N, 35 degrees 43.5 ' E, depths between 120 m-300 m depths) were investigated using towed camera imagery and ship-based platforms during a 2017 CAGE17-2 cruise on the RV Helmer Hanssen. We analyzed relationships among methane flux data, seafloor habitat characteristics, and biological community structure (i.e., presence and distribution of megafauna and expression of microbial mats) from a total of 14 surveys (6827 images and 40 multicore sediment cores) within the Storbanken Crater area and compared it to 2015 data. Unlike seep expressions at deeper sites (similar to 1200 m) in the Norwegian margin region, no seep-endemic, chemosynthetic-associated megafaunal species were observed at the shallow surveyed sites and all sites hosted similarly diverse communities of non-seep species, including commercially important fish and crustaceans. Methane concentrations did not markedly differ between the crater and non-crater sites. Rates of methane gas advection through sediments (in the form of flares) were relatively low and concentration of methane was even lower in porewater samples at the crater site. We present the first evidence of methane flare flux and intermittent microbial mat distribution with associated folliculinid ciliates, which suggests a long history of methane emissions and a transient seep environment in spatial and temporal flux. Together, this study presents a critical baseline on the temporal release of arctic methane and benthic biological communities to initiate temporal studies that identify future changes and predict the impact of climate change.

AB  - Heat stress negatively affects the welfare and production of sheep, particularly in warm climates. Less is known about heat stress and shade requirements of sheep in temperate climates. This study aimed to investigate behavioural and physiological responses of sheep with or without access to shade in summer in New Zealand, which has a predominantly temperate climate. Forty-eight mixed age Romney crossbreed ewes were managed in 4 groups in either shaded (2 m shade/sheep) or unshaded paddocks in a cross-over design (7 days/treatment). A blood sample was obtained before treatments commenced, at the cross-over, and after the second treatment (3 times/sheep) for analyses of red and white blood cells, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and Thyroxine (T). Lying behaviour was recorded continuously using HOBO accelerometers. Shade use, grazing, ruminating, lying, panting and drinking behaviour were recorded for 5 days/treatment using 10-min instantaneous scan sampling between 0900 and 1700 h. Individual respiration rates were obtained 2 times/h during the observation period. Weather was monitored using portable weather stations (mean air temperature was 19.8 degrees C, range: 18.3-23.3 degrees C). Sheep with access to shade were observed using the resource in 25.7% of observations and shade use increased with solar radiation. Unshaded sheep tended to spend more time grazing during the daytime, compared to when shaded (62.6 vs 57.7% of observations, SED=11.92, P=0.080). Both treatment groups were observed ruminating in similar percentage of observations (shaded: 25.5%, unshaded: 22.7% of observations, SED=6.22, P=0.227). Unshaded sheep spent 30.6% of the daytime observations lying down compared to 35.1% for shaded sheep (SED=6.05, P=0.055), however, lying times over 24 h were similar; shaded sheep spent, on average, 12.3 h lying down/24 h compared to 11.8 h for unshaded sheep (SED=0.36, P=0.258). Open mouth panting and tongue out were predominantly observed in unshaded sheep (open mouth: 0.61 vs 0.02%; tongue out: 0.25 vs 0.01% of observations for unshaded and shaded sheep, respectively), however, there were too few observations of these behaviours to be statistically analysed. Unshaded sheep had numerically higher respiration rates than unshaded sheep (130 vs 156 breaths/min, SED=28.5, P=0.410). Average respiration rate was >200 breaths/min on 3 and 7 days for shaded and unshaded animals, respectively. Only sheep without shade had daily average respiration rates >= 300 breaths/min. No physiological effects of warm weather were detected (P >= 0.193). Our results suggest that the welfare of sheep in a temperate climate was improved by providing shade, even in mild summer conditions.

AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), including perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its alternative 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (F53B), are widely used in industries, leading to their presence in aquatic environments and potential adverse effects on marine organisms, particularly during early development. This study investigates the effects of PFOS and F53B on larval development and metamorphosis in Mytilus coruscus. Exposure to 4.7 and 39.2 mu g/L PFOS and 1.2, 7.5, and 91.8 mu g/L F53B significantly reduced larval metamorphosis compared to controls. PFOS and F53B exposure disrupted the normal degeneration of the larval velum and velum retractor muscles, essential for metamorphosis. Lower concentrations (1.2 and 7.5 mu g/L) of F53B had a stronger inhibitory effect than 91.8 mu g/L, suggesting F53B may act as an endocrine disruptor. Transcriptomic analysis revealed 801 differentially expressed genes in PFOS-exposed larvae and 2496 DEGs in F53B-exposed larvae, affecting pathways related to neural communication, cellular processes, and developmental signaling (e.g., Hedgehog, PI3K-AKT, Hippo, and MAPK). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed the down-regulation of genes related to growth and development in both treatment groups, indicating suppressed growth and development. Our findings suggest that PFOS and F53B impacted larval metamorphosis and potentially altered the developmental trajectories of M. coruscus under environmental contamination scenarios. This study highlights the significant ecological implications of PFOS and F53B exposure on marine bivalve development, demonstrating their capacity to disrupt larval metamorphosis, thereby underscoring the potential risks these persistent pollutants pose to marine ecosystems and the early life stages of aquatic organisms.

AB  - The wild boar (Sus scrofa) population in the southern Russian Far East declined by 90-95% because of an African swine fever (ASF) epizootic that began in 2019. The loss of this primary prey species for Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), at a time when other main prey species were low in abundance and intensive habitat degradation and poaching were occurring, could affect population dynamics of tigers at the northern edge of their range. We assessed the impact of the ASF epizootic on the northernmost Amur tiger subpopulation by comparing population parameters before and after the ASF event. We assessed the number, types, and spatial distribution of conflicts between tigers and humans, timing of births, cub survival rates, tiger physical condition, behavior, and mortality. The average annual number of human-tiger conflicts increased more than 11-fold after the arrival of ASF, with attacks on domestic animals being the predominant conflict. Tiger mortality and human-mediated removal of tigers due to conflicts increased 3.3-fold after ASF, and the total area in which conflicts occurred also increased. There was an increase in the proportion of emaciated individuals within the tiger population, particularly among young animals and males, and the proportion of individuals that preyed upon domestic animals also increased, a behavioral shift that expanded food resources for tigers but also heightened risks for both tigers and humans. To mitigate effects of the ASF outbreak and support the recovery of this Amur tiger population, we recommend a temporary ban on hunting of their primary prey species, additional protections for the wildlife sanctuaries within their range, and a large-scale population survey.

AB  - Along with the woody plant expansion that is predicted to continue at the expense of the grassy layer is the increasing societal demand for animal protein and livestock products. Unless concerted efforts by land users, ecologists, and animal scientists are made to increase the utilization of trees and shrubs as forage, it will be impossible to meet future demand for meat and meat products. We conducted two short-term pen experiments to determine the effects of (1) supplementation with polyethylene glycol (PEG-a polymer purported to bind and neutralize the negative effects of tannins), a high-protein source (soybean meal), and a high-energy source (yellow maize grain) and (2) diet mixing (single-species vs. multispecies diets) on the intake of condensed tannin-rich woody plants (i.e., Searsia lancea, S. pyroides, and Euclea crispa) by goats. While all three forage species were used in the diet mixing experiment (Exp. 2), only E. crispa was used in the supplementation experiment (Exp. 1). Supplementing goats with energy- and protein-rich sources significantly increased the intake of E. crispa (p < 0.05), 713.4 g +/- 13.5 and 760 g +/- 28.9, respectively, whereas those on the control diet maintained their intake at 540.32 g +/- 11.2. Although PEG tended to increase the consumption of E. crispa by goats, the observed increase was not significant (p > 0.05) from that observed in other treatments. In the diet mixing experiment, goats offered a combination of all three forage species attained substantially higher dry matter intakes compared to the goats offered these species individually (p < 0.05). While longer-term field experiments are needed in the African savannas, we postulate from the current results that management strategies that provide animals with (1) a variety of species in the diet vs. monocultures and (2) a combination of nutrient-rich and tannin-rich species may improve the ability of goats to consume chemically defended woody plants.

AB  - Producer reliance on drought subsidies instead of proactive planning and timely destocking in low rainfall years has prompted Queensland government investment in promoting business and drought resilience. GrazingFutures (AU$6 million budget, 2016-2022) is an extension project focussed on enhancing business management skills of extensive livestock producers in western Queensland, Australia. The region's rangelands are in productivity decline, span 1 million km2 and are managed by graziers operating more than 2400 livestock businesses (beef, sheep and goats). The Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries delivers GrazingFutures as a component of the Drought and Climate Adaptation Program, in partnership with regional natural resource management groups and other public and private organisations. Project delivery emphasised upskilling multi-agency staff and livestock producers to promote practice change within three whole of business themes: (1) grazing land management; (2) animal production; and (3) peoplebusiness. Three independent surveys (2018, 2019, 2020) indicated positive practice change was occurring in grazing businesses as a consequence of the project. Graziers instigated management changes even under major environmental challenges including extended drought (2013-2020), an extreme flood event in 2019 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This paper details the rationale, progress against the objectives, challenges and future direction of the GrazingFutures extension project.

AB  - Nilgiri tea is a vital perennial beverage variety and is in high demand in global markets due to its quality and medicinal value. In recent years, the cultivation of tea plantations has decreased due to the extreme climate and prolonged practice of tea cultivation in the same area, decreasing its taste and quality. In this scenario, land suitability analysis is the best approach to evaluate the bio-physiochemical and ecological parameters of tea plantations. The present study aims to identify and delineate appropriate land best suited for the cultivation of tea within the Kallar watershed using the geographic information system (GIS) and multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) techniques. This study utilises various suitability criteria, such as soil (texture, hydrogen ion concentration, electrical conductivity, depth, base saturation, and drainability), climate (rainfall and temperature), topography (relief and slope), land use, and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), to evaluate the suitability of the land for growing tea plantations based on the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) guidelines for rainfed agriculture. The resultant layers were classified into five suitability classes, including high (S1), moderate (S2), and marginal (S3) classes, which occupied 16.7%, 7.08%, and 16.3% of the land, whereas the currently and permanently not suitable (N1 and N2) classes covered about 18.52% and 29.06% of the total geographic area. This study provides sufficient insights to decision-makers and farmers to support them in making more practical and scientific decisions regarding the cultivation of tea plantations that will result in the increased production of quality tea, and prevent and protect human life from harmful diseases.

AB  - Water plants are well adapted to the aquatic environment due to the high plasticity of the photosynthetic apparatus of floating and submerged leaves. A strong decrease or complete disappearance of Nymphaea alba L. populations and their simultaneous replacement by Nuphar lutea L. Smith populations were observed for the last decades in freshwater ecosystems previously described as typical habitats of both species. However, there is no information on which environmental factors and / or interspecies differences between Nu. lutea and Ny. alba induce succession in Nymphaeaceae populations and decline of Ny. alba in natural habitats. We conducted a two-year comparative study of photosynthetic apparatus in floating leaves (chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf anatomy, and chloroplast ultrastructure) of both plant species in water bodies significantly different in the degree of anthropogenic impact and abundance of Nymphaeaceae individuals. It was shown that shifting of parameters of water chemistry induced by increasing concentrations of nitrogen and inorganic phosphorus did not affect photosynthetic processes in both species and confirmed literature data on high tolerance of rooted floating-leaved macrophytes to eutrophication. Irrespective of the water eutrophication level, a more rapid decrease of effective quantum yield (phi(PSII)) of Nu. lutea floating leaves at irradiances above 500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) was observed. Active non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanisms and local extensions of granal thylakoids indicate well-developed photoprotective features of Nu. lutea. The higher value of phi(PSII )and diameter of grana in palisade parenchyma and a well-developed spongy parenchyma providing intensive gas exchange indicate better adap-tation of photosynthetic apparatus of Ny. alba to high irradiance. In addition, leaf costs and leaf dynamics of Nu. lutea and Ny. alba can impact the outcome of the competition between the two species.

AB  - Plant phenology is not only manifested in the seasonal timing of vegetative and reproductive processes but also has ontogenetic aspects. The adaptive basis of seasonal phenology has been considered mainly in terms of climatic drivers. However, some biotic factors as likely evolutionary influences on plants' phenology appear to have been under-researched. Several specific cases of putative biotic factors driving plant phenology are outlined, involving both herbivores and pathogens. These illustrate the diversity of likely interactions rather than any systematic coverage or review. Emphasis is on woody perennials, in which phenology is often most multifaceted and complicated by the ontogenetic aspect. The complete seasonal leaf fall that characterizes deciduous plants may be a very important defense against some pathogens. Whether biotic influences drive acquisition or long-term persistence of deciduousness is considered. In one case, of leaf rusts in poplars, countervailing influences of the rusts and climate suggest persistence. Often, however, biotic and environmental influences likely reinforce each other. The timing and duration of shoot flushing may in at least some cases contribute to defenses against herbivores, largely through brief periods of "predator satiation" when plant tissues have highest food value. Wide re-examination of plant phenology, accommodating the roles of biotic factors and their interplays with environments as additional adaptive drivers, is advocated toward developing and applying hypotheses that are observationally or experimentally testable.

AB  - Drones equipped with thermal infrared (TIR) cameras offer significant time and labor savings in estimating wild ungulate populations. However, accurately monitoring forest-dwelling ungulates remains challenging due to their elusive behavior and complex habitat. This study evaluated the feasibility of using TIR orthomosaic maps derived from drone surveys to estimate the population size of three Korean ungulate species: water deer Hydropotes inermis, roe deer Capreolus pygargus and long-tailed goral Naemorhedus caudatus in a semi-controlled environment. We generated 15 paired TIR and RGB orthomosaic maps from drone flights conducted in March and June 2024. Ungulate counts from TIR imagery were cross-verified using red, green and blue (RGB) maps. Two error metrics - counting error and detection error - were calculated using the maximum verified count per month as a proxy for the true population size. Regression analysis indicated that ground sample distance (GSD) was positively associated with counting error, while no clear relationship was found between GSD and detection error. These results suggest that environmental and behavioral factors may influence detection reliability more strongly than image resolution alone. In addition, we analyzed thermal body measurements to explore the potential for species identification. While TIR orthomosaic maps were generally effective for estimating body size, variation in posture - particularly lying positions - substantially affected measurement accuracy and limited their usefulness for distinguishing species. This study highlights both the capabilities and limitations of using TIR orthomosaic maps for ungulate monitoring and offers practical considerations for applying drone-based surveys in more complex natural settings.

AB  - Port Biological Baseline Surveys (PBBS) are standardized surveys of the indigenous and non-indigenous marine biodiversity within harbour activities. They provide a baseline for monitoring changes in the structure and function of harbour communities. This study conducted in 12 fishing and industrial harbours from January to December 2018 was the first initiative of a Port Baseline Survey aimed to assess the impact of biological invasions in harbours of the Gulf of Gabes (GG), Tunisia. A total of 174 macrobenthos species were recorded, belonging to eight phyla, with a dominance of crustaceans (32%), molluscs (31%) and polychaetes (20%). Among these species, 57 were non-indigenous species (NIS) for Tunisian waters, while 27 species were recorded for the first time in GG harbours, and three decapods (Dyspanopeus sayi, Hippolyte prideauxiana and Pilumnus minutus) and one amphipod (Hamimaera hamigera) were newly recorded from Tunisian waters. Two main categories of harbours are distinguished according to their macrobenthic communities and environmental conditions. The industrial harbours yield higher richness and abundance of NIS than the fishing harbours. The ALEX metric is used to evaluate the biological invasion status of the Gulf of Gabes harbours and shows that their status ranges from unaffected in fishing harbours to extremely affected in industrial harbours. Three biotic indices (AMBI, BO2A and BENTIX) are applied to assess the ecological status of harbours, which varies from moderate to good. ALEX and the other biotic indices are significantly correlated with harbour characteristics, maritime traffic and edaphic factors (organic matter and chemical contamination). The present study provides a data baseline for the implementation of environmental policies and management plans in the future.

AB  - Despite Orchidaceae is a key component of the epiphytic flora of tropical and subtropical forests, phenological studies of this group are rare, mainly due to technical difficulties in observing epiphytes, the reduced abundance of wild specimens, and to the evergreen characteristic of these plants. We monitored shoot and root production of translocated young plants of the epiphytic orchid Cattleya intermedia Graham at the edge and in the interior of a subtropical Atlantic Forest fragment, and investigated their relationship with temperature, luminosity, photoperiod, rainfall and air humidity. Individuals propagated in vitro were translocated in the spring and inspected monthly for 3 years for shoot and root production. Shoot production at the edge of the forest was positively related with photoperiod and luminosity. In the interior, this relationship was characterised by a 1-month time delay. The highest concentrations of plants with shoot production occurred in spring and summer in both environments. Interior plants were more likely to produce roots in spring and summer, while edge plants were more likely to produce roots in summer. Edge plants produced fewer roots when rainfall was high, while interior plants produced more roots when interior air humidity was high. The influence of light availability for translocated plants was demonstrated by the different responses of shoot growth at the edge and in the interior of the forest and by the relationship with the seasonal variation of this variable. Thus, light becomes a key factor for the establishment of translocated C. intermedia and must be considered in the choice of their habitats.

AB  - Phenotypic plasticity can play an important role in the ability of animals to tolerate environmental stress, but the nature and magnitude of plastic responses are often specific to the developmental timing of exposure. Here, we examine changes in gene expression in the diaphragm of highland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in response to hypoxia exposure at different stages of development. In highland deer mice, developmental plasticity in diaphragm function may mediate changes in several respiratory traits that influence aerobic metabolism and performance under hypoxia. We generated RNAseq data from diaphragm tissue of adult deer mice exposed to (1) life-long hypoxia (before conception to adulthood), (2) post-natal hypoxia (birth to adulthood), (3) adult hypoxia (6-8 weeks only during adulthood) or (4) normoxia. We found five suites of co-regulated genes that are differentially expressed in response to hypoxia, but the patterns of differential expression depend on the developmental timing of exposure. We also identified four transcriptional modules that are associated with important respiratory traits. Many of the genes in these transcriptional modules bear signatures of altitude-related selection, providing an indirect line of evidence that observed changes in gene expression may be adaptive in hypoxic environments. Our results demonstrate the importance of developmental stage in determining the phenotypic response to environmental stressors.

AB  - Simple Summary Monitoring and maintaining genetic diversity is essential for the conservation of most species, including fallow deer. Various markers can be tested to estimate genetic diversity. For this purpose, microsatellites consisting of four-base-pair repetitive units are highly recommended due to their polymorphisms and comparable and reliable detection during analyses. In this study, nearly one hundred tetrameric microsatellites were collected from nine other deer species, which were tested on twenty individuals from five Hungarian fallow deer populations. As a result, 14 polymorphic markers were selected for the investigation panel, which fills a gap in the field of experts dealing with fallow deer genetics. The fallow deer (Dama dama) represents significant game management value globally, and human activities are significantly impacting the species. Besides the positive effects, these activities can threaten its existence, health, and value. The aim of the authors was to develop a tetranucleotide microsatellite panel that could be clearly interpreted and used for genetic testing of fallow deer. Such a panel did not exist until now and could be particularly useful in the field of conservation genetics and forensics. A total of 99 tetrameric microsatellites, originally designed for related deer species, were tested on 20 fallow deer individuals from five Hungarian sampling areas. Original and newly designed primers were used to amplify the microsatellite regions using previously published or optimized PCR protocols. The lengths and sequences of specific amplicons were detected using capillary electrophoresis, and the rate of polymorphism was determined. Altogether, 80 markers provided PCR products of adequate quality and quantity. Among them, 15 markers proved to be polymorphic (2-5 alleles/locus), and 14 tetrameric markers were selected for further analysis. Statistical calculations showed that the selected polymorphic microsatellites can potentially enable key individualization in many areas of wildlife and population genetics, thus protecting the species.

AB  - The sexually dimorphic dynastine centaurus beetle, genus Augosoma (Coleoptera: Scarabeidae), is endemic to tropical Africa where two species are found (A. centaurus and A. hippocrates). These beetles are consumed by rural populations, cause damage in plantations and are targets of insect collectors and traders. We present information on size differences and analyzed intersexual niche divergence and seasonality of A. centaurus in seven study sites in three West African countries (Ivory Coast, Togo and Nigeria). We recorded 711 light-attracted and/or opportunistically encountered individuals, as well as another 97 beetles in standardized transect surveys. In the latter, we found the adult sex ratio was equal, but was significantly skewed towards females in light-attracted and/or opportunistically encountered individuals. In a sample of 298 adult beetles, males were significantly larger than females, with almost no size overlap between sexes. Beetle activity was highly seasonal with most animals observed in November, active from 19:00 h to 24:00 h. Differences in habitat use were not significant between sexes, with most individuals observed in secondary forest. Males were found higher on vegetation than females and beetles of both sexes were found on Pandanus and raffia palms. Beetles were larger in sites with more vegetation cover, and there was a significant effect of tree species on body size of both sexes. Study area or country had no effect on any of the studied parameters. Our study confirms that transect surveys without light trapping can be an effective tool for understanding large-sized tropical beetles of similar ecological characteristics.

AB  - Liquid hog manure (LHM) and solid cattle manure (SCM) are valuable soil amendments for the nutrients and organic matter they augment. However, desire to mitigate the N2O, CO2, and CH4 fluxes attendant with their use has led to the question of whether biochar co-applied with LHM and SCM could mitigate these greenhouse gas fluxes. A split-plot design was used at two agricultural field sites with contrasting soil types (Brown Chernozem and Black Vertisol) in Saskatchewan, Canada, to assess the effect of LHM and SCM (100 kg N ha(-1)), alone and in combination with two different biochars applied at 8 Mg C ha(-1); produced using either slow or fast pyrolysis of willow (Salix spp.) feedstock. Intact cores were collected from the plots and the N2O, CO2, and CH4 fluxes were measured during a 6-week (42 days) lab incubation. The impact of manure amendment on greenhouse gas fluxes, was more apparent with LHM than SCM; reflecting higher inorganic N content, narrower C:N, and more easily mineralizable carbon in LHM. Co-applying biochar with the manure sources reduced the manure-related N2O emissions 31.5 to 43.1% and increased CH4 consumption 94.1% to 2.1 x compared with manure alone. Regardless of soil type, neither biochar co-applied with the manures affected the net CO2 fluxes compared with manure alone. The N2O emissions were principally influenced by the impact of biochar addition on NO3-N supply and pH, while the net CO2 fluxes were controlled by the opposing effects of heterotrophic (i.e., CO2 production) and postulated autotrophic (i.e., CO2 consumption) respiration. The CH4 consumption was related to the NH4-N supply and its influence on autotrophic methanotrophy.

AB  - Livestock supplementation with forage trees is becoming a sustainable alternative to traditional grazing on the open pastures during the dry season in Benin. However, little is known about the feeding preferences of sheep and the digestibility of such native tree/shrub fodder. Such knowledge could improve their use on smallholder farms. Multiple-choice feeding preference tests were conducted on six tree fodders (Annona senegalensis, Blighia sapida, Cassia sieberiana, Gmelina arborea, Khaya senegalensis, and Mangifera indica) to determine the best choice to feed the local rams and ewe Djallonke sheep. The cafeteria test involved four rams and four ewes. In addition, an in vivo trial using metabolic cages was conducted to evaluate the voluntary intake of dried woody leaves and the dry matter digestibility of diets containing these dried leaves. Preferences varied significantly (p <= 0.05) according to the woody species. Based on relative intake values, sheep preferred, in decreasing order, the leaves of M. indica, B. sapida, K. senegalensis, G. arborea, A. senegalensis, and C. sieberiana. The apparent digestibility of dry matter was highest (p <= 0.01) in the G. arborea diet (86.8%); all diets presented a value higher than 70%. This study provided helpful information about better resource utilization to improve animal productivity. Further study could evaluate the growth performance of sheep supplemented with tree fodder.

AB  - Zoonotic tuberculosis is a neglected subject that has the potential to impede the effectiveness of the TB elimination program. The present study aimed to determine the genetic diversity and drug resistance in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from captive wild animals. A total of 67 tissue samples were collected from 33 animals, comprising 21 wild captive animals from various species and 12 slaughtered domestic buffaloes. These samples were subjected to the detection of Mycobacterial species by culture isolation, and further molecular identification by mPCR, Xpert-Ultra and TrueNat MTB/Rif assay; followed by drug susceptibility profiling by MTBDRplus and Spoligotyping of the isolates. Of the 67 samples from captive zoo animals, 44 samples were culture positive. Of these, 38 isolates were identified as Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) and remaining 6 were identified as non- tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). All NTM isolates were from different tissues of a Tigress which also had mixed infection with MTBC. All the 38 culture isolates were further subjected to phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (pDST) and genotyping. Twenty-eight (73.69%) of them, were pan-susceptible, 9 (23.68%) exhibited isoniazid mono-resistance, and 1 (2.63%) was rifampicin mono-resistant. On genotyping, 27 (71.05%) of the samples were classified as 'Orphan'. Ten (26.32%) isolates were identified as CAS1_DELHI, clustered within SIT number 375, while one sample (2.63%) remained unidentified. The drug resistance and genotyping patterns were similar to the human population. Our results show that M. tuberculosis was major cause of Zoonotic TB and should be considered as potential reverse zoonotic agent in India.

AB  - Protection of the environment from radiation fundamentally relies on dose assessments for non-human biota. Many of these dose assessments use measured or predicted concentrations of radionuclides in soil or water combined with Concentration Ratios (CRs) to estimate whole body concentrations in animals and plants, yet there is a paucity of CR data relative to the vast number of potential taxa and radioactive contaminants in the environment and their taxon-specific ecosystems. Because there are many taxa each having very different behaviors and biology, and there are many possible bioavailable radionuclides, CRs have the potential to vary by orders-of-magnitude, as often seen in published data. Given the diversity of taxa, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has selected 12 non-human biota as reference animals and plants (RAPs), while the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) uses the non-taxon specific categories of terrestrial, riparian, and aquatic animals. The question we examine here, in part, is: are these RAPs and categorizations sufficient to adequately protect all species given the broad diversity of animals in a region? To explore this question, we utilize an Allometric-Kinetic (A-K) model to calculate radionuclide-specific CRs for common animal classes, which are then further subcategorized into herbivores, omnivores, carnivores, and invertebrate detritivores. Comparisons in CRs among animal classes exhibited only small differences, but there was order of magnitude differences between herbivores, carnivores, and especially detritivores, for many radionuclides of interest. These findings suggest that the ICRP RAPs and the DOE categories are reasonable, but their accuracy could be improved by including sub-categories related to animal dietary ecology and biology. Finally, comparisons of A-K model predicted CR values to published CRs show order-of-magnitude variations, providing justification for additional studies of animal assimilation across radionuclides, environmental conditions, and animal classes.

AB  - Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC), the largest carbon (C) pool of a terrestrial ecosystem, is essential for mitigating climate change. Currently, the spatial patterns and drivers of SOC in the plantations of tea, a perennial leaf crop, remain unclear. Therefore, the present study surveyed SOC across the main tea-producing areas of China, which is the largest tea producer in the world. We analyzed the soil samples from tea plantations under different scenarios, such as provinces, regions [southwest China (SW), south China (SC), south Yangtze (SY), and north Yangtze (NY)], climatic zones (temperate, subtropical, and tropical), and cultivars [large-leaf (LL) and middle or small-leaf (ML) cultivars]. Preliminary analysis revealed that most tea-producing areas (45%) had SOC content ranging from 10 to 20 g kg-1. The highest SOC was recorded for Yunnan among the various provinces, the SW tea-producing area among the four regions, the tropical region among the different climatic zones, and the areas with LL cultivars compared to those with ML cultivars. Further Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated significant associations between SOC and soil variables and random forest modeling (RF) identified that total nitrogen (TN) and available aluminum [Ava(Al)] of soil explained the maximum differences in SOC. Besides, a large indirect effect of geography (latitude and altitude) on SOC was detected through partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) analysis. Thus, the study revealed a high spatial heterogeneity in SOC across the major tea-producing areas of China. The findings also serve as a basis for planning fertilization strategies and C sequestration policies for tea plantations.

AB  - Knowledge about the relationships between plant pathogens, arthropods, and their natural enemies is scarce. We studied the relationships between the plant fungal pathogen, Erysiphe alphitoides, the phytophagous mite Schizotetranychus garmani, and the predatory mite Euseius finlandicus in leaves of pedunculate oak. In June, July and August 2016, in 30 trees located in three forests near Belgrade, Serbia, the presence of E. alphitoides, S. garmani and E. finlandicus was assessed. The occurrence of E. alphitoides was high where the population of S. garmani was high. However, the presence of the leaf pathogen E. alphitoides was not related to the amount of the predatory mite E. finlandicus. The relationships between powdery mildew and the two mite species were stable across time and space, and the presence of one mite was not influenced by the presence of the other mite.
   Food webs on forest trees include plant pathogens, arthropods, and their natural enemies. To increase the understanding of the impact of a plant pathogen on herbivore-natural enemy interactions, we studied the powdery mildew fungus Erysiphe alphitoides, the phytophagous mite Schizotetranychus garmani, and the predatory and mycophagous mite Euseius finlandicus in pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) leaves. In June, July and August of 2016, we assessed the severity of powdery mildew, mite population density and adult female mite size in 30 trees in three forests near Belgrade, Serbia. In August, the infection severity of E. alphitoides related positively to the population density of S. garmani and negatively to the body size of S. garmani females. Throughout the vegetative season, the infection severity of E. alphitoides related positively to the population density of E. finlandicus but not to its body size. The effect of E. alphitoides on the population density and adult size of S. garmani was not mediated by the population density of E. finlandicus, and vice versa. Interactions were consistent in all forests and varied with the summer month. Our findings indicate that E. alphitoides can influence the average body size and population densities of prey and predatory mites studied, irrespective of predator-prey relationships.

AB  - As climate-related impacts threaten marine biodiversity globally, it is important to adjust conservation efforts to mitigate the effects of climate change. Translating scientific knowledge into practical management, however, is often complicated due to resource, economic and policy constraints, generating a knowledge-action gap. To develop potential solutions for marine turtle conservation, we explored the perceptions of key actors across 18 countries in the Mediterranean. These actors evaluated their perceived relative importance of 19 adaptation and mitigation measures that could safeguard marine turtles from climate change. Of importance, despite differences in expertise, experience and focal country, the perceptions of researchers and management practitioners largely converged with respect to prioritizing adaptation and mitigation measures. Climate change was considered to have the greatest impacts on offspring sex ratios and suitable nesting sites. The most viable adaptation/miti-gation measures were considered to be reducing other pressures that act in parallel to climate change. Ecological effectiveness represented a key determinant for implementing proposed measures, followed by practical appli-cability, financial cost, and societal cost. This convergence in opinions across actors likely reflects long-standing initiatives in the Mediterranean region towards supporting knowledge exchange in marine turtle conservation. Our results provide important guidance on how to prioritize measures that incorporate climate change in decision-making processes related to the current and future management and protection of marine turtles at the ocean-basin scale, and could be used to guide decisions in other regions globally. Importantly, this study dem-onstrates a successful example of how interactive processes can be used to fill the knowledge-action gap between research and management.

AB  - Greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes from livestock grazed pasture soils are highly variable in both space and time but the quantitative importance of the factors regulating this variation remain poorly understood. Our aim was to explore this variability on contrasting extensively (low input) and intensively managed sheep-grazed 'case-study' pastures. We quantified (through standard and spatially-informed regressions) the statistical relationships between GHG fluxes (nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) and a range of soil, field and management characteristics. Fluxes of these three GHGs at two study sites were highly variable, but spatial structure (i.e. autocorrelation) was only observed in the variability of N2O fluxes across the intensive site and CO2 fluxes across the extensive site. The regression analyses identified significant GHG predictor variables for the extensive site as: NO3- (p < 0.001) and vegetation-type (p < 0.01) for N2O (R-2 = 0.57; p = 0.000); NH4+ (p < 0.05), slope (p < 0.05) and elevation (p < 0.01) for CO2 (R-2 = 0.34; p = 0.000); and NO3- (p < 0.01), NH4+ (p < 0.05) and soil moisture (p < 0.05) for CH4 (R-2 = 0.25; p = 0.005). Significant GHG predictor variables for the intensive site were soil moisture (p < 0.01) and bulk density (p < 0.01) for N2O (R-2 = 0.27; p = 0.005); soil moisture (p < 0.001) for CO2 (R-2 = 0.31; p = 0.001); while none were found for CH4 (R-2 = 0.10; p = 0.655). Key factors driving GHG variation were both site- and GHG-specific, with fluxes controlled by local conditions leading to differences in limiting factors (possibly even at the within-site scale). Our statistical analyses suggest a larger range of driving variables (e.g. air and soil temperature or other soil chemical properties such as total extractable N) may be required to more fully capture the observed variability in the GHG processes considered here, and that it may also be fruitful for future analyses to consider non-linear, non-stationary and interacting relationships across space- and time-scales. Adequacies of each site's sample design also played a key interpretive role in the GHG processes, requiring further evaluation through additional sampling campaigns.

AB  - Fish species characteristics and supply of food resources in Amazonian floodplain forests probably shape the trophic structure and composition of the fish community; however, this dynamic has rarely been studied in the context of trophic networks. In this study, we hypothesized that the main forces that structure the trophic web of the fish community present in two blackwater forests are the supply of resources of allochthonous origin and species characteristics, such as body size and abundance of individuals. Interactions assembly was explored and analyzed, and we tested whether fish body size, number of individuals, trophic category, and use of different food resources affect the structure of the trophic network. Out of 771 fish individuals, 30 species consumed food divided into eight categories: animal remains, plant remains, fish, flowers, invertebrates (terrestrial and aquatic), leaves, fruit pulp, and seeds. We found a network that is modular and highly specialized. Conversely, the network is structured by low connectance and nestedness. The supply of compositional items from riparian vegetation provided a multifunctional network formed by different layers represented mainly by herbivorous and frugivorous guilds. Our results also show that food web centrality is influenced by fish size and abundance. Overall, we suggest that the seasonal food supply of flooded forests and the size and abundance of fish species shape the structure of Amazonian food webs. We reinforce the importance of lateral connectivity in low productivity environments, such as blackwater floodplain forests. We provide insights into the coexistence of fish communities and their functional role.

Neste estudo, levantamos a hip & oacute;tese de que as principais for & ccedil;as que estruturam a teia tr & oacute;fica das comunidades de peixes em duas florestas de & aacute;guas pretas s & atilde;o o suprimento de recursos al & oacute;ctones e as caracter & iacute;sticas das esp & eacute;cies, como tamanho corporal e abund & acirc;ncia de indiv & iacute;duos. A rede de intera & ccedil;& otilde;es foi explorada e analisada, e testamos se o tamanho corporal dos peixes, o n & uacute;mero de indiv & iacute;duos, a categoria tr & oacute;fica e o uso de diferentes recursos alimentares afetam a estrutura da teia tr & oacute;fica. Dos 771 indiv & iacute;duos de peixes, 30 esp & eacute;cies consumiram alimentos divididos em oito categorias: restos de animais, restos de plantas, peixes, flores, invertebrados (terrestres e aqu & aacute;ticos), folhas, polpa de frutas e sementes. Encontramos uma rede que & eacute; modular e altamente especializada. Por outro lado, a rede & eacute; estruturada por baixa conectividade e aninhamento. O fornecimento de recursos provenientes da vegeta & ccedil;& atilde;o rip & aacute;ria forneceu uma rede multifuncional formada por diferentes camadas representadas principalmente por guildas de herb & iacute;voros e frug & iacute;voros. Nossos resultados tamb & eacute;m mostram que a centralidade da teia alimentar & eacute; influenciada pelo tamanho e abund & acirc;ncia dos peixes. No geral, sugerimos que o fornecimento sazonal de recursos de florestas inundadas e o tamanho e abund & acirc;ncia de esp & eacute;cies de peixes moldam a estrutura das teias alimentares amaz & ocirc;nicas. Refor & ccedil;amos a import & acirc;ncia da conectividade lateral em ambientes de baixa produtividade, como florestas de v & aacute;rzea de & aacute;guas pretas. Fornecemos informa & ccedil;& otilde;es sobre a coexist & ecirc;ncia de comunidades de peixes e seu papel funcional.

AB  - Accurate estimates of population size are central to the management and conservation of wild ungulates. Counting animals from vantage points of baited sites is a method that is traditionally used in Europe to obtain abundance estimates of wild ungulates, but its reliability in forested landscapes is contested. We assessed the accuracy of vantage point counts (VPCs) for estimating population size in red deer (Cervus elaphus) at De Hoge Veluwe National Park, a fenced, partially forested game reserve in the Netherlands. We compared estimates from duplicated VPCs for 1977-2010 with population sizes reconstructed from cohort analyses of age-specific mortality records, including and excluding supplementation with vehicular direct counts (VDCs) and field knowledge on herd composition and herd size from game wardens. Estimates from VPCs supplemented with VDCs matched the reconstructed population size well for 2001-2010. In addition, estimates based on =;1 VPC site/11 km(2) provided representative estimates of the reconstructed population size in that period. Simultaneous VPCs at multiple baited sites can yield precise population estimates for red deer in forests.

AB  - Context Invasive wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are the most abundant, widespread, and economically significant large vertebrate established in the Hawaiian Islands. Owing to their generalist diet and rooting behavior, wild pigs alter soils and watersheds, negatively affecting native biota.Aims Lethal removal of wild pigs by trapping is often the most effective and practical management action to reduce their impacts, but terrain and access are challenging.Methods We compared the effectiveness and efficiency of three trap designs (i.e. corral, box, and passive net traps) on a fenced population of wild pigs in a remote montane forest setting on the Island of Hawai'i, where use of cellular-activated 'smart' traps was not possible.Key results During three high-intensity removal efforts between 30 November 2021 and 8 May 2022, we trapped and euthanized 435 wild pigs through 162 trapping events. Although each trap type effectively captured wild pigs, passive net traps captured more wild pigs per capture event than did corral and box traps. Specifically, when using passive net traps, we captured approximately four wild pigs per capture event, which was two to three times more than with corral traps and box traps respectively. Passive net traps were more effective and efficient than were box traps, although they performed similarly to corral traps.Conclusions All trap types we tested successfully captured wild pigs, but passive net traps typically captured more wild pigs per event than did traditional corral and box traps. Net traps were a valuable addition to remote trapping strategies.Implications In remote and rugged settings where smart trapping technology cannot be used, we recommend incorporating passive net traps into a trapping program to optimize removal of wild pigs.

AB  - Species interactions exert important influences on biodiversity and ecosystem stability. In complex natural communities, species interactions have gone beyond pairwise mechanisms, as interactions between two species can be regulated by one or more other species (higher-order species interactions). However, few studies consider higher-order interactions among organisms that are indirectly contacted, particularly under high soil nutrient conditions. Here, we performed a common garden experiment to investigate how natural herbivory (aboveground weevil) and simulated herbivory (leaf clipping) affect plant (Triadica sebifera) interactions with soil antagonists (root-knot nematodes) and mutualists (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; AMF) under nitrogen and phosphorus addition. We also tested the effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, and herbivory-stimuli on T. sebifera leaf extrafloral nectary (EFN) production. We found that T. sebifera can compensate for biomass loss caused by clipping or weevil feeding, moreover, high nitrogen availability caused plant biomass to outpace herbivorystimuli. Plant-antagonist (root-knot nematodes) interactions were not affected by clipping or weevil feeding under ambient nitrogen condition but were reduced by clipping or weevil feeding under high nitrogen supply, however, we did not find the same pattern under phosphorus addition. Aboveground herbivory-stimuli did not affect plant-mutualist (AMF) interactions, whether fertilized or not. In addition, nitrogen addition stimulated plants to secrete more EFN against clipping but did not increase EFN production against weevil feeding. Clipping and weevil feeding exhibited consistent effects on both plant-antagonist (root-knot nematodes) interactions and plant-mutualist (AMF) interactions. These results suggest that aboveground antagonists mainly mitigate belowground plant-antagonist interactions but not affect plant-mutualist interactions, and higher-order species interactions depend on nitrogen addition but not phosphorus addition.

AB  - Payment-for-results mechanisms have the potential to increase funding for Critically Endangered species such as the black rhino (Diceros bicornis). Developing such financial mechanisms requires an understanding of the efficacy of conservation interventions, the potential conservation return on investment and an ability to rigorously measure the impact of interventions, such as change in abundance of live or poached animals. However, imperfect detection must be considered to derive robust estimates of these measures. Managing black rhino is often done at the metapopulation level (in distinct management units) where ecological and observational processes can differ substantially between populations.
   We developed a multi-state capture-mark-resight model to estimate the abundance of live rhino and carcasses from annual historical observations. We used age, sex and management units as covariates. We used 25 years of monitoring data from two sections with contrasting rhino densities in Tsavo West National Park, Kenya as a test case. The model presented can be used to estimate abundances of rhino from historical data and provides a mechanism to measure changes across multiple management sections. We foresee this model being used as the basis for impact measurement of a rhino impact financing mechanism. The model can easily be modified for use in other species managed in a metapopulation framework.

AB  - Across the range of African elephants Loxodonta spp., negative interactions with people are prevalent, and the impact of the resulting economic losses on farmers calls for solutions. The use of beehive fences, a mitigation method with ecological and socio-economic benefits, is gaining momentum in African savannah landscapes. We assessed the diurnal and nocturnal defensive behaviours of African honeybees Apis mellifera adansonii in response to visual and physical disturbances in the Campo-Ma'an conservation area, Cameroon. We examined six bee colonies, assessing their activity level, aggressive behaviour and ability to defend themselves when disturbed at different times of day. We found that activity levels varied between colonies and that colonies were more active during the day and inactive at night. The defensive perimeter around the hives also varied between the colonies and was generally greater during morning and evening periods. Bee colonies did not defend their hives around midday and at night. In response to a threat, bees were more likely to fly out from the hive during daytime than at night, with variation amongst colonies. Overall, as elephant intrusions occur mostly at night, beehive fences alone may not be an adequate mitigation method against crop damage caused by forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis. We suggest combining beehive fences with other mitigation methods to improve crop protection.

AB  - The upper Gulf of California, Mexico is a marine protected area (MPA), considered important for the conservation and protection of species. The present study assessed the resource-consumer interactions of two ray species (Rhinoptera steindachneri and Hypanus dipterurus), to know the importance of shellfish in the food-web dynamics of two predators present in this MPA. A total of 33 prey species for R. steindachneri and 48 prey species for H. dipterurus were recorded. The bivalve Tellina subtrigona (%IRI = 99.5) was the most important species in the diet of R. steindachneri; whereas the gastropod Mitrella dorma (%IRI = 32.7) was the primary prey of H. dipterurus. The ray R. steindachneri had a lower Shannon's index of diversity (H' = 0.49) than H. dipterurus (H' = 1.41). Based on Amundsen's graphical method, R. steindachneri have a specialist feeding strategy; whereas H. dipterurus presented a mixed strategy that includes both specialist and generalist organisms. However, the trophic specialization evidenced by these rays may reflect the grouping behavior of their prey, which tend to form large aggregations. Both ray species are secondary consumers (TLR.steindachneri = 3.10 and TLH.dipterurus = 3.12) of shellfish. Nevertheless, there is a low similarity in the prey species composition between them (ANOSIM: R = 0.47), indicating that these two ray species have different diets, and therefore, each ray species has specific resource-consumer interactions. This information allows to understand the importance of shellfish in the food-web dynamics in the ecosystem and MPA effectiveness in the upper Gulf of California for species at risk, like ray species.

AB  - Caloptilia fraxinella Ely (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), the ash leaf-cone roller, is an aesthetic pest of horticultural ash trees (Oleaceae, Genus Fraxinus) in prairie communities across Canada. Because pesticide use is undesirable in urban centers, biological control of C. fraxinella is a preferred approach. The native parasitoid wasp, Apanteles polychrosidis Vierek (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), has shifted hosts and is the primary parasitoid of C. fraxinella in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and has potential as a biological control agent. Here, in an effort to increase parasitism of C. fraxinella, lures releasing methyl salicylate (MeSA) and two green leaf volatiles (GLVs), [(Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl-acetate], at both low and high release rates, were tested to enhance attraction and retention of A. polychrosidis in infested ash trees. Attraction of A. polychrosidis to baited trees was measured by capture on yellow sticky cards positioned in the tree canopy, and wasp activity was assessed by the parasitism rate of C. fraxinella. More male and female A. polychrosidis were captured on yellow sticky traps positioned in trees baited with the low dose of both MeSA + GLVs than to unbaited, infested ash trees. The increased attraction of wasps did not correlate with an increase in parasitism of C. fraxinella. The high release rate lures did not enhance attraction of A. polychrosidis to infested ash trees. Parasitism rate, however, was negatively correlated with host density in both field experiments. There was no evidence of close-range attraction to lures in an olfactometer assay. Synthetic HIPVs attract A. polychrosidis to ash trees infested with C. fraxinella, but the effect of wasp attraction on parasitism rate requires further research if HIPVs are to be used to enhance biological control in this system.

AB  - Despite the importance of pastoralism, as an alternative or adjunct to farming in China's long history, a clear understanding of the spreading routes and mechanisms of pastoralism in China is lacking. Fungal spores can be a useful addition to zooarchaeological evidence and have been widely used to explore the origins and development of pastoralism in different regions of the globe. The northern Loess Plateau is one of the most important areas for the emergence and development of pastoralism in early China. The aim of this paper was to take the fungal spores in the Baihemiao (BHM) core that we extracted from a site in the Yulin region, combine them with the zooarchaeological records to explore their relationship with climate and environmental changes, and reconstruct the evolution of animal husbandry in the northern Loess Plateau since the mid-Holocene. The results indicate that the climatic conditions in the northern Loess Plateau during the first period of 6-4.2 ka were relatively humid, the number of domesticated herbivores was small, animal husbandry was not developed, and the spores of coprophilous fungi in the sediments mainly originated from wild herbivores. Fungal spores as well as zooarchaeological evidence reveal that cattle and sheep grazing developed rapidly in the region during the second period, c. 4.2-3 ka. We suggest that the arid climatic conditions during this period facilitated the development of pastoral activities in the northern Loess Plateau. However, this pastoral economy gradually weakened after 1.2 ka.

AB  - Indonesia is home to significant populations of globally vulnerable reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) in at least four key regions: Berau, Nusa Penida, Komodo, and Raja Ampat. Despite detailed population studies in each of these regions, little is known about their horizontal movement patterns. Our study used satellite telemetry to investigate reef manta rays' habitat use and home ranges. A total of 33 manta rays were tagged with SPLASH10F-321A satellite tags across the four regions: Berau (n = 5), Nusa Penida (n = 8), Komodo (n = 6), and Raja Ampat (n = 14), yielding usable data from 25 tags. The rays were tracked for 7 to 118 days (mean +/- SD = 50 +/- 30) from July 2014 to July 2022. The results showed localized movements, strong residency near tagging sites, and high site fidelity as evidenced by area-restricted search (ARS) behaviors and frequent revisitations. Most manta rays showed restricted home ranges in each region, with no connectivity between regions. Across 25 individuals, the home range (95% utilization distributions) varied significantly, ranging from 19 to 48,294 km2 (mean +/- SD = 4667 +/- 10,354). These findings offer important insights into the spatial movement patterns of reef manta rays in Indonesia, allowing the formulation of more effective management strategies.

AB  - Conservation conflicts or human-wildlife conflicts present one of the foremost challenges to wildlife conservation globally. The challenges of reconciling human safety and food security with the conservation of large-bodied wildlife are further compounded in the developing nations with a high spatial overlap of wildlife with people. Therefore, conservation models are required to offset losses faced by affected communities while at the same time ensuring the long-term conservation of wildlife species in shared spaces. Ex-gratia payment is one such widely used conflict mitigation instrument that aims to reduce losses and increase tolerance toward damage-causing wildlife species. However, the efficacy of such programs is rarely investigated and the complex interplay of local beliefs, traditions, and community dynamics are rarely incorporated in the compensation programs. This paper aimed to study an ex-gratia payment program for crop losses in India using ecological, economic, and social lenses. In this study, we used 119 interview surveys across 30 villages. Linear models and thematic analysis were used to understand the sources of crop losses, the propensity to claim ex-gratia payments, and the reasons for claiming or not claiming. We find that even though wildlife is the major cause of crop loss in the region, especially to elephants, the majority of the respondents (53%) did not claim compensation for the losses. The reasons varied from procedural failures to a negative evaluation of the process or the agency involved but the most recurrent reason for not claiming was a deep religious belief in certain communities on the elephant God, "Mahakal." Our work indicates that the cultural reverence toward the species is enabling the acceptance of losses. We propose that such complex cultural beliefs and local traditions should be considered when designing schemes that aim to garner conservation support toward damage-causing wildlife species.

AB  - Abalone, herbivorous marine mollusks of significant economic and ecological importance, exhibit considerable morphological plasticity. This poses a challenge for accurate species identification, which in turn could undermine the assessment of impacts from harvesting. The present study employed an integrative approach combining geometric morphometrics and DNA barcoding to address potential taxonomic ambiguities in abalone populations from Sabah, Malaysia. Especially in this megadiverse region, it could be expected that multiple species may co-occur. Morphometric analysis of 135 specimens, using 14 shell landmarks, confirmed that all individuals clustered within the Haliotis asinina group when compared with data from Haliotis glabra. This was supported by genetic analyses, which demonstrated 99% sequence similarity among novel CO1 sequences and previously published DNA barcodes from H. asinina. Despite overlapping morphological traits between H. asinina and similar congeners, the integrative approach conclusively identified all specimens as H. asinina. Although there are some limits to shell-based taxonomy, quantitative approaches to both morphological and genetic data can resolve species boundaries. These results underscore the importance of employing integrative methods in biodiversity assessments and conservation strategies for tropical abalone species.

AB  - Temperature and precipitation are two major factors determining arthropod population densities, but the effects from these climate variables are seldom evaluated in the same study system and in combination with inter- and intraspecific density dependence. In this study, I used a 19 year time series on plant variables (shoot height and flowering incidence) and insect density in order to understand direct and indirect effects of climatic fluctuations on insect population densities. The study system includes two closely related leaf beetle species (Galerucella spp.) and a flower feeding weevil Nanophyes marmoratus attacking the plant purple loosestrife Lythrum salicaria. Results suggest that both intraspecific density dependence and weather variables affected Galerucella population densities, with interactive effects of rain and temperature on insect densities that depended on the timing relative to insect life cycles. In spring, high temperatures increased Galerucella densities only when combined with high rain, as low rain implies a high drought risk. Low temperatures are only beneficial if combined with little rain, as high rain cause chilly and wet conditions that are bad for insects. In summer, interactive effects of rain and temperature are different because high temperatures and little rain cause drought that induce wilting in plants, thus reducing food availability for the leaf feeding larvae. In contrast, the density of the flower feeding weevil was less affected by temperature and precipitation directly, and more indirectly interspecific density dependent effects through reduced resource availability caused by previous Galerucella damage.

AB  - A record of environmental change is stored in alluvial fans and wetlands. Our research focuses on the Spring Creek Site in the San Luis Valley of Colorado, where megafaunal remains were found in alluvial fan sediments underlying layered paleowetland peats. We identified mammoth, horse, bison, beaver, and wolf faunal elements ranging in age from 35,910 to 17,080 cal yr BP. Faunal remains were redistributed and buried during a post-glacial, Late-Pleistocene flood that we bracketed to between 17,080 and 13,371 cal yr BP. Fluvial geomorphology provides clues to predict locations of additional faunal elements buried in the flood deposits. Flood deposits are capped by three layers of peat. Evaporite silt peats represent a playa 13,371 cal yr BP; downwind lunette dunes support this interpretation. High percent organic matter woody peats represent boggy conditions 13,261 cal yr BP. Organic silts represent a further rising of the water table and marsh conditions where windblown silts were trapped and layered with organics between 10,260 and 9,647 cal yr BP. These water table fluctuations indicate environmental changes across the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary. Pollen data suggest high biomass wetland conditions during formation of the woody peats and increased fire frequency through the Early Holocene.

AB  - Functional traits determine the fitness of organisms and mirror their ecological functions. Although trait-based approaches provide ecological insights, it is underexploited for marine zooplankton, particularly with respect to seasonal variation. Here, based on four major functional traits, including body length, feeding type, trophic group, and reproduction mode, we quantified the seasonal variations of mesozooplankton functional groups in the South Yellow Sea (SYS) in the spring, summer, and autumn of 2018. Strong seasonal dynamics were identified for all traits but patterns varied among traits. Small zooplankton (47.7-88.6%), omnivores-herbivores (81.3-97.6%), and free spawners (54.8-92.5%) dominated in three seasons, while ambush feeders and current feeders dominated in spring (45.7%), and autumn (73.4%), respectively. Cluster analysis of the functional traits showed that the mesozooplankton in the SYS can be classified into eight functional groups. The biogeographic and seasonal variations of functional groups can be partially explained by environmental drivers. Group 1, represented by omnivores-herbivores, was the most dominant functional group, the abundance of which peaked in spring and was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration, indicating its close association with phytoplankton dynamics. The contribution of giant, active ambush carnivores, passive ambush carnivore jellyfish, current omnivores-detritivores, and parthenogenetic cladocerans increased with sea surface temperature. The proportion of giant, active ambush carnivores and active ambush omnivore-carnivore copepods decreased with salinity in autumn. This study presents a new perspective for understanding the dynamics of zooplankton and paves the way for further research on the functional diversity of zooplankton in the SYS.

AB  - Deer hunting is a major forest-based recreation activity in the US South. However, the recent discovery of chronic wasting disease (CWD) threatens deer hunting in the region. Stakeholders are interested in understanding how hunters perceive the risk and change their hunting behavior. This study found a significant change in hunters' concerns after the first deer season since the discovery of CWD in Tennessee, USA. Results also showed that hunters' short- and long-term intentions to hunt deer in the region were positively related to previous experience of hunting in CWD-affected areas, beliefs in the effectiveness of herd reduction to control CWD, concerns regarding potential decline in deer quality and changes in hunting regulations due to CWD, and trust in wildlife agency action. Hunters who hunt on public land and were concerned with deer and human health risk were less likely to hunt in the CWD region. These results are useful in understanding hunter behavior in response to wildlife disease and identifying variables that may help project immediate as well as long-term change in hunting demand in affected regions.

AB  - Very little is known about the reproductive behaviours of whale sharks (Rhincodon typus). Here, we describe field observations of courtship behaviour by a whale shark at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia. We witnessed and recorded following and biting behaviours by a sexually mature male of a smaller female. Following and biting are common events during courtship and copulation of other species of elasmobranchs. Our observations are consistent with earlier reports of courting behaviours in whale sharks provided by fishers, the pilot of a light plane and observations of courtship by a sexually mature male towards females held in aquaria.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts are a growing problem in Northern Hemisphere where wild ungulates are one of the taxonomic groups most frequently involved. To mitigate these conflicts, it is essential to develop preventive actions able to avoid encounters between wildlife and human (activities). We here employed photo-trapping to evaluate the behaviour of red deer (Cervus elaphus) when confronted with dissuasive portable deterrents that function on the basis of changing patterns of light and ultrasound. This was done by following a before/after experimental design, with two phases: (i) a test phase, with active deterrents, and (ii) a control phase, without deterrents. When deterrents were activated they achieved a 48.96% reduction in the frequency of use by red deer (up to 66.64% when it was assessed on a thinner Sect. 10 m wide from the line of deterrents) and produced a reduction of 67.71% in the frequency of deterrent-line crossings. However, a habituation effect was detected since the use by red deer of the treatment area increased as time since treatment. These results indicate that these portable devices are effective as regards dissuading deer, mainly on short time scales. The deterrents tested here could be suitable for use at focal points for short periods or in combination with other methods to improve their effectiveness in vulnerability points. This device could potentially be used to mitigate conflicts caused by wildlife species and in response to relevant and timely situations, such as vehicle collisions and damage to crops, among others.

Extensive literature suggests that adult male guinea pigs are highly aggressive in the presence of females, but data are lacking regarding the compatibility of cohoused adult males in the absence of females. Most studies that use adult males do not report housing densities. We used serial wound scoring and observations of behavior to determine whether unfamiliar adult male guinea pigs will develop stable, prosocial isosexual pairs. Wound scoring was performed before and 24 h after pairing. Serial behavioral observations assessed affiliative and agonistic behaviors at 0.5, 2, 24, and 48 h after pairing. Wound scoring and behavioral observations continued weekly for 1 mo and monthly thereafter. Wound scores were significantly higher at 24 h after pairing as compared with baseline and all other time points. Wounding was rare after week 2, indicating reduced aggression. Furthermore, affiliative behaviors significantly increased over time while agonistic behaviors were rare. Together, these data suggest that unfamiliar adult male guinea pigs establish stable prosocial pairs after an acclimation period. As was done in the present study, providing ample space, separate shelters for each animal, and the absence of female guinea pigs will likely facilitate successful pairing. We recommend consideration of a social housing program for adult male guinea pigs to provide companionship and enrich their housing environment.

AB  - Reservoirs and their morphological characteristics are expected to alter the continuity of matter, energy, and nutrient transfer, which can modify resource availability, food supply, and fish trophic structure. We studied 29 reservoirs in Southern Brazil to verify the main factors related to the structure of their fish trophic guilds. We tested the hypothesis that environmental and morphological variables influence the organization of fish trophic guilds more than spatial variables (i.e., hydrological distance between the reservoirs). Additionally, we tested which variables linked to environmental, morphological, and spatial characteristics are most associated with the predominance of herbivores, omnivores, detritivores, insectivores, invertivores, and piscivores fishes. To assess the influence of these predictors, we used variance partitioning with distance-based redundancy analysis. Contrary to our assumptions, the structure of fish trophic guilds revealed that the spatial features were the most important predictors. Still, associations between and with the other predictors also revealed significant explanations. Trophic guilds that showed spatial segregation were herbivores and omnivores which can be associated with the evolutionary processes from the locality of each reservoir in distinct ecoregions. Overall, environmental and morphological characteristics like concentration of total nitrogen, age, size, and water retention time are associated with a greater or lesser abundance of herbivores, detritivores, omnivores, and piscivores. Our findings have important implications for the management of reservoirs by helping to guide policies and actions involving fishing stocks.

AB  - Occupancy models are commonly used in statistical ecology to model binary detection/non-detection data. These hierarchical models make a distinction between detection/non-detection and presence/absence by treating true occupancy as a latent process. In this paper, we propose a multi-species, multi-season occupancy model to jointly model detection/non-detection data on multiple species. Existing literature has shown that models that account for various sources of dependence in the latent occupancy process improve estimation, especially in the single-survey setting. However, the detection process in the model has not received much attention, even though detectability of a species is expected to relate to the detectability of other species and to detectability in previous time periods. In this work, we propose a model to capture this phenomenon by incorporating a multivariate temporal random effect in the detection process. We perform a simulation study to show that the proposed model yields more accurate inference than models that only use covariates to quantify detection. We apply our model to detection/non-detection data on three species-Thomson's gazelle, zebra, and wildebeest-in Serengeti National Park of Tanzania, Africa.

AB  - In the literature, roads are often considered to be barriers for large vertebrates. In central Africa, the creation of roads and skid trails by logging operations leads to changes in the structure of forest landscapes that could in-fluence wildlife movements. To assess the use of logging roads by six emblematic species of the central African forests, we conducted a camera trap (CT) survey on three types of tracks (secondary roads, skid trails, and elephant paths as control) in a logging concession of south-eastern Cameroon. The relative abundance indices (RAI) of each species derived from the CT data were used in a mixed linear model to test the effects of four factors (type of track; time: day vs. night; gregariousness: alone vs. group; and time after logging: less than one year vs. between one and two years). The results showed no preference for any type of track for gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) and chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). In contrast, significantly higher RAI on secondary roads were observed for buffalos (Syncerus caffer), forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis), and bongos (Tragelaphus eurycerus). For the last two, the difference was only significant if they were detected in the most recently logged areas, at night (for elephants), or alone (for bongos). We could not test for leopard (Panthera pardus) as we captured only two events. Although none of the species appear to avoid roads and skid trails, nor do they perceive them as a barrier, further studies should be conducted to increase sampling efforts over time and space to consider seasonality, vegetation growth after logging, geographical variability, and other anthropogenic influence. However, these first results reveal the importance of closing roads after logging to limit encounters between wildlife and humans and highlight the relevance of characterizing roads (type of road, width, surfacing, and canopy structure over the road) when studying their impact on wildlife.

AB  - Maintenance of sufficient habitat for large terrestrial mammals in increasingly human-dominated landscapes is challenging. Wild Asian elephants in China were historically widespread, but now comprise 293 individuals confined to three prefectures in southwestern Yunnan Province. Effective legal protection has permitted population growth of Chinese elephants, but it is not known why elephants are confined to the southwestern portion of Yunnan, nor has there been a comprehensive assessment of the extent, quality and carrying capacity of habitat within their potential range. We used multiscale multivariable species-distribution modelling to evaluate the effects of topography, land use, transport infrastructure and settlements on habitat suitability for elephants throughout Yunnan during 2012-2021, using data from literature records, field surveys and camera traps. Elephant distribution was strongly influenced by the presence of forest measured at coarse (32-km) scales, with forest fragmentation and percentage cover together accounting for 64% of total variability, whereas settlements and infrastructure had a relatively minor effect (1.7%). Almost 17,430 km2 of habitat, mostly along the border with Myanmar and Lao PDR, was predicted to be highly suitable for elephants, and a smaller amount in two prefectures that currently lack elephants. We estimate that Yunnan could support an additional 810 (range 300-1469) elephants, more than twice the current population. However, 90% of habitat predicted to be suitable was outside currently protected areas. By making conservative predictions about the potential for restoration or enhancement of habitat, we project that Yunnan could sustain a further 305 elephants, bringing the total population to 1408. Our results have relevance for planning of a proposed national park for elephants in the province.

AB  - Xishuangbanna, located in southern Yunnan, China, is a vital tropical rainforest reserve supporting rich biodiversity, including the endangered Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). Increasing human activities, such as urbanization and agricultural expansion, have degraded habitats and intensified human-elephant conflicts, adding to the challenges of conservation. This study integrates habitat quality assessment and conflict risk analysis using the InVEST model across 2128 villages, considering land use and habitat threats like cropland and roads. The model reveals significant overlap between high-conflict zones and low-quality habitats near key reserves, underscoring the need for targeted conservation strategies. We propose establishing Ecological Source Areas (ESAs) to protect high-quality habitats and Ecological Restoration Zones (ERZs) to improve ecological conditions in low-quality, high-conflict zones. ESAs are essential for providing continuous ecosystem services and ensuring ecological security, while ERZs focus resources on areas with high conflict risk that urgently need restoration. Additionally, we recommend creating ecological corridors to connect fragmented habitats, enhance connectivity, support herd interactions, and reduce conflicts by expanding elephants' safe roaming range. This integrated framework emphasizes habitat protection, ecological restoration, and conflict mitigation while accounting for human dynamics to support sustainable conservation. Reducing overlap between human and elephant activities remains a key objective. Future research should refine these models with more detailed data and extend their application to other regions, focusing on adaptive management and monitoring to address evolving ecological and human dynamics.

AB  - The family Rhinopomatidae comprises six species of mouse-tailed bats within the genus Rhinopoma, inhabiting arid regions of the Old World from western Africa to Myanmar. While their phylogenetic relationships have been explored through morphology and molecular analyses, many populations still remain insufficiently studied using molecular approaches. This study aims to analyse samples representing all species and populations within the family, employing one mitochondrial and four nuclear genetic markers. These sequences were used to construct phylogenetic trees, estimate divergence times and evaluate biogeographic patterns. Our results revealed the presence of five major genetic lineages within Rhinopoma. Notably, the morphologically distinct East African R. macinnesi was genetically embedded within R. cystops, suggesting synonymisation of the former name and expanding the distribution range of R. cystops southward into eastern Africa. The study also identified greater mitochondrial diversity compared to nuclear markers, uncovering nine mitochondrial lineages across the family, including three polytypic species: R. cystops, R. hardwickii and R. muscatellum. Divergence time estimation placed the family's origin at approximately 45 million years ago. Initial diversification into current species occurred 9.5 million years ago, likely originating in the Arabian Peninsula or Iran, regions that still host the highest diversity of Rhinopoma. This study provides the most comprehensive molecular phylogeny of Rhinopomatidae to date, reducing the recognised species count to five and offering new insights into the evolutionary history and biogeography of this desert-adapted bat family.

AB  - Current theory predicts that the intensity of biotic interactions, particularly herbivory, decreases with increasing latitude and elevation. However, recent studies have revealed substantial variation in both the latitudinal and elevational patterns of herbivory. This variation is often attributed to differences in study design and the type of data collected by different researchers. Here, we used a similar sampling protocol along elevational gradients in six mountain ranges, located at different latitudes within temperate Eurasia, to uncover the sources of variation in elevational patterns in insect herbivory on woody plant leaves. We discovered a considerable variation in elevational patterns among different mountain ranges; nevertheless, herbivory generally decreased with increasing elevation at both the community-wide and individual plant species levels. This decrease was mostly due to openly living defoliators, whereas no significant association was detected between herbivory and elevation among insects living within plant tissues (i.e., miners and gallers). The elevational decrease in herbivory was significant for deciduous plants but not for evergreen plants, and for tall plants but not for low-stature plants. The community-wide herbivory increased with increases in both specific leaf area and leaf size. The strength of the negative correlation between herbivory and elevation increased from lower to higher latitudes. We conclude that despite the predicted overall decrease with elevation, elevational gradients in herbivory demonstrate considerable variation, and this variation is mostly associated with herbivore feeding habits, some plant traits, and latitude of the mountain range.

AB  - Human population and economic growth have resulted in roads transecting much of the North American landscape and this has negatively affected wildlife populations by fragmenting habitat, impeding movement between populations and increasing the chance of wildlife-vehicle collisions. A common conservation tool to counteract these effects is the incorporation of road mitigation structures (RMS, i.e., jumpouts and overpasses/underpasses/fencing) into highway systems. However, gaps remain in our knowledge on RMS efficacy due to a lack of long-term multispecies studies that can assess temporal and species-specific variation in use. We investigate the efficacy of the Alberta Environment and Parks and Alberta Transportation RMS on the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) in the Bow Valley by analyzing annual reported wildlife-vehicle collisions over a 23-year period and wildlife use of the underpasses over a ten-year period. We found that the incorporation of multiple underpasses and jumpouts, along with fencing, reduced the number of reported wildlife-vehicle collisions on the TCH. We also found that wildlife use of the RMS exhibited variation with regards to month and location. Overall, our results add to the research supporting RMS effectiveness and suggest that incorporating additional similar infrastructure has the potential to further reduce wildlife-vehicle collisions on the TCH.

AB  - Non-native plants typically benefit from enemy release following their naturalization in non-native habitats. However, over time, herbivorous insects specializing on such plants may invade from the native range and thereby diminish the benefits of enemy release that these plants may experience. In this study, we compare rates of invasion spread across Europe of three North American insect folivores: the Lepidoptera leaf miners Macrosaccus robiniella and Parectopa robiniella, and the gall midge Obolodiplosis robiniae, that specialize on Robinia pseudoacacia. This tree species is one of the most widespread non-native trees in Europe. We find that spread rates vary among the three species and that some of this variation can be explained by differences in their life history traits. We also report that geographical variation in spread rates are influenced by distribution of Robinia pseudoacacia, human population and temperature, though Robinia pseudoacacia occurrence had the greatest influence. The importance of host tree occurrence on invasion speed can be explained by the general importance of hosts on the population growth and spread of invading species.

AB  - Water, forages, and soil contamination with potentially toxic metals (PTMs) through anthropogenic activities has become a significant environmental concern. It is crucial to find out the level of PTMs in water, soil, and forages near industrial areas. The PTMs enter the body of living organisms through these sources and have become a potential risk for humans and animals. Therefore, the present study aims at the health risk assessment of PTMs and their accumulation in soil, water, and forages of three tehsils (Kallar Kahar, Choa Saidan Shah, and Chakwal) in district Chakwal. Samples of wastewater, soil, and forages were collected from various sites of district Chakwal. PTMs detected in the present study were cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and nickel (Ni), and their levels were measured through atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAs GF95 graphite furnace auto sampler). Pollution load index (PLI), bio concentration factor (BCF), soil enrichment factors (EF), daily intake value (DIM), and health risk index (HRI) in sheep, cow, and buffalo were also analyzed. The results revealed that the mean concentration (mg/L) of Cd (0.72-0.91 mg/L), Cr (1.84-2.23 mg/L), Pb (0.95-3.22 mg/L), Co (0.74-2.93 mg/L), Cu (0.84-1.96 mg/L), and Ni (1.39-4.39 mg/L) in wastewater samples was higher than permissible limits set by WHO, NEQS, WWF, USEPA, and Pakistan in all three tehsils of district Chakwal. Similarly, in soil samples, concentrations of Cd (1.21-1.95 mg/kg), Cr (38.1-56.4 mg/kg), and Ni (28.3-55.9 mg/kg) were higher than their respective threshold values. The mean concentration of PTMs in forage samples (Parthenium hysterophorus, Mentha spicata, Justicia adhatoda, Calotropis procera, Xanthium strumarium, Amaranthaceae sp.) showed that maximum values of Cd (5.35-7.55 mg/kg), Cr (5.47-7.51 mg/kg), Pb (30-36 mg/kg), and Ni (12.6-57.5 mg/kg) were beyond their safe limit set for forages. PLI, BCF, and EF were > 1.0 for almost all the PTMs. The DIM and HRI for sheep were less than < 1.0 but for cows and buffalo were > 1.0. The current study showed that soil, water, and forages near coal mines area are contaminated with PTMs which enter the food chain and pose significant harm to humans and animals. In order to prevent their dangerous concentration in the food chain, regular assessment of PTMs present in soil, forages, irrigating water, and food is recommended.

AB  - Recreational hunting, especially big game trophy hunting, has a significant impact on large areas and requires specific wildlife management strategies. However, because the pursuit of maximum hunter satisfaction can jeopardize species conservation, it is crucial to identify the factors that determine recreational trophy hunter satisfaction. We investigated these factors in southern Spain by attending 21 dog-driven Iberian red deer hunts over seven hunting seasons. We collected geographic and biometric data from 556 hunted specimens and conducted 159 face-to-face surveys with hunters. Based on partial least squares path models, our findings indicate that overall satisfaction is positively related to the dimensions of achievement, appreciation, and service. Contextual variables, including hunter experience, hunting scenarios, and individual and group hunting bags, showed varying effects on these satisfaction dimensions. Management decisions significantly influenced multiple dimensions of hunter satisfaction, with potential implications for conservation in our study system and broader considerations for natural game management versus canned hunting practices.

AB  - Elasmobranchs are crucial for comparative studies of evolution, as they belong to the most ancient vertebrate lineages that survived numerous extinction events and persist until today. The immunoglobulin new antigen receptor (IgNAR) found in sharks and heavy-chain-only antibody (HCAb) found in camelidae are products of convergent evolution. Although it was previously believed that IgNAR emerged 220 million years ago, before the divergence of sharks and skates, there is limited evidence to support this. In this study, we provide data supporting the existence of IgNAR in the ocellate spot skate (Okamejei kenojei) mononuclear cell transcriptome and peripheral blood serum. Additionally, we characterize the germline gene configuration of the ocellate spot skate IgNAR V domain. The ocellate spot skate IgNAR structure prediction and VNAR crystal structure exhibit high similarity to their shark counterparts. These data strongly suggest that IgNAR in both sharks and skates share a common ancestor. Sequencing of the ocellate spot skate VNAR repertoire provided crucial data for further understanding of the IgNAR generation. Notably, we discovered that approximately 99% of the ocellate spot skate VNARs belonged to type IV. This represents an exceptionally high proportion of type IV within the VNAR repertoire, which has not been documented in previously studied elasmobranchs. This unique characteristic of the ocellate spot skate VNAR adds essential structural diversity to the naive VNAR library from elasmobranchs and could potentially benefit the development of pharmaceutical drugs.

AB  - Seedlings in regenerating layer are frequently attacked by herbivorous insects, while the combined effects of defoliation and shading are not fully understood. In the present study, two Leguminosae species (Robinia pseudoacacia and Amorpha fruticosa) were selected to study their responses to combined light and defoliation treatments. In a greenhouse experiment, light treatments (L+, 88% vs L-, 8% full sunlight) and defoliation treatments (CK, without defoliation vs DE, defoliation 50% of the upper crown) were applied at the same time. The seedlings' physiological and growth traits were determined at 1, 10, 30, and 70 days after the combined treatment. Our results showed that the effects of defoliation on growth and carbon allocation under high light treatments in both species were mainly concentrated in the early stage (days 1-10). R. pseudoacacia can achieve growth recovery within 10 days after defoliation, while A. fruticosa needs 30 days. Seedlings increased SLA and total chlorophyll concentration to improve light capture efficiency under low light treatments in both species, at the expense of reduced leaf thickness and leaf lignin concentration. The negative effects of defoliation treatment on plant growth and non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) concentration in low light treatment were significantly higher than that in high light treatment after recovery for 70 days in R. pseudoacacia, suggesting sufficient production of carbohydrate would be crucial for seedling growth after defoliation. Plant growth was more sensitive to defoliation and low light stress than photosynthesis, resulting in NSCs accumulating during the early period of treatment. These results illustrated that although seedlings could adjust their resource allocation strategy and carbon dynamics in response to combined defoliation and light treatments, individuals grown in low light conditions will be more suppressed by defoliation. Our results indicate that we should pay more attention to understory seedlings' regeneration under the pressure of herbivorous insects.

AB  - Using a pre-post chronic wasting disease (CWD) natural experiment, we compared deer hunters' perceived trust in the North Dakota Game and Fish (NDGF) Department and perceived CWD risks to wildlife and humans before and after the discovery of the disease in the state. We obtained data from 2 mail surveys. One study was conducted in 2004 (n = 855, response rate = 43%) when CWD had not been detected in North Dakota; the second was conducted in 2021 (n = 3,242, response rate = 29%) after the disease was known to exist in the state. We hypothesized that when compared to the 2021 hunters, the 2004 hunters would (1) be more trusting of the NDGF's management of CWD, (2) perceive more risk to deer, and (3) perceive more risk to humans. All 3 hypotheses were supported. Hunters expressed greater trust in NDGF information regarding CWD (Cohen's d = 0.173, P < 0.001), higher levels of risk to deer (d = 0.433, P < 0.001), and higher levels of risk to humans in 2004 than in 2021 (d = 0.730, P < 0.001).

The motivation for bystanders to engage in such third-party behaviour is considered by several different theoretical approaches; one such model argues that bystanders intervene to prevent subordinates from gaining a winner effect, thereby becoming a threat to the individual's dominant status within the group. This study investigates the role of contestant morphology as a motivating factor in initiating third-party behaviour. We investigated whether two correlates of resource-holding potential, prerut body weight and antler weight, were associated with third-party behaviour in rutting male fallow deer, Dama dama. In addition, we examined whether a third factor, reproductive effort (weight loss during the rut) was associated with third-party behaviour. There was a positive relationship between antler weight and the number of times individual males experienced third-party behaviour during contests. This relationship was not evident for either prerut weight or weight loss. An analysis of third -party behaviour showed that as the difference in both prerut and antler weight between the competing males declined, there was an increase in the probability that the dyad would experience third-party behaviour. However, there was no such association between the difference in weight loss between contestants and third-party behaviour. Thus, dyads of males closely matched in terms of individual quality were likely to experience third-party behaviour. We show for the first time that morphological traits associated with resource-holding potential are important cues used by rivals as a basis for engaging in third-party behaviour.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - A primary means of conserving a species or a habitat in a human-dominated landscape is through promoting coexistence with humans while minimizing conflict. For this, we should understand how wildlife is impacted by direct and indirect human activities. Such information is rare in areas with high human densities. To investigate how animals respond to altered ecological conditions in human-dominated landscapes, we focused on a wild herbivore of conservation concern in the Krishnasaar Conservation Area (KrCA) in Nepal. Here, blackbuck Antilope cervicapra, a generalist grazer, lives in refugia located with a growing human population. We studied the impacts of humans on habitat use and behavior of blackbuck. We laid 250 x 250 m grid cells in the entire KrCA and carried out indirect sign surveys with three replications for habitat use assessment. We observed herds of blackbuck for 89 h in different habitat types using scan sampling methods. Our habitat-use survey showed that habitats under intensive human use were hardly used by blackbuck, even when high-quality forage was available. Habitat openness was the major predictor of habitat use inside the core area, where levels of human activities were low. We also found a positive correlation between habitat use by blackbuck and livestock. Blackbuck were substantially more vigilant when they were in forest than in grassland, again indicating an influence of risk. Overall, blackbuck appear to be sensitive to the risk associated with both natural and anthropogenic factors. Our findings have direct implications for managing human-wildlife interactions in this landscape, specifically regarding strategies for livestock grazing in habitats highly used by blackbuck and concerning predictions of how changing land use will impact the long-term persistence of blackbuck. Our work suggests that wild herbivores may be able to persist in landscapes with high human densities so long as there are refuges where human activities are relatively low.

AB  - Willows (Salix SPP.) are increasingly being grown as a source of biomass which can be harnessed for energy production at a commercial scale as one example of a Short Rotation Coppice (SRC) crop. What is less widely understood is the role of the plants in reducing nutrient loads when planted as a nature-based solution to mitigate diffuse pollution from agricultural lands. Strategically planted woodland and forest can play a major role in Nature Based Solutions (NBS) approaches. SRC willows were planted in a 22-ha grassland micro-catchment located on a research farm in Northern Ireland, which is regularly grazed by cattle and sheep. The microcatchment comprises a small ditch with upstream and downstream monitoring points where a pair of autosamplers were used to collect water samples for nutrient analysis. It was possible to reconstruct a timeseries of hourly discharge in the ungauged micro-catchment using the SHETRAN hydrological model. Subsequently, the modelled flows were used to estimate daily phosphorus (P) loads at both upstream and downstream monitoring points from the measured P concentrations. The nearly four years (June 2018-April 2022) of monitoring data allowed P loads to be calculated for pre-planting, juvenile trees and mature trees phases. A baseline scenario was run without any changes to the model; this evaluated the changes in P loads from the catchment. A further PostWillows scenario "P-W" modified some model parameters and evapotranspiration to represent the land use change due to the willow plantation. The results from the baseline were evaluated and showed that (i) there was a statistically significant reduction in particulate P (PP) and total P (TP) concentrations at the outlet of the microcatchment; (ii) a statistically significant reduction in PP and TP loads, indicating that the willows were reducing PP export (losses) probably by trapping fine sediment in the ditch. Results from the P-W scenario showed a smaller than expected decrease in discharge from the model results. The overall export of TP from the microcatchment could be further decreased by additional planting of SRC willows, but the export of soluble forms of P did not decrease by a significant amount post-planting which is a recommendation for further study in mitigation programmes. The use of SRC willows in riparian buffer strips (RBS) which are a common form of NBS, has shown promising results in terms of trapping particulate forms of P. The layout of the RBS should also be carefully designed in terms of maximising the buffer strip width, here the areas planted was optimised to make best use of unproductive farmland. If the RBS can be designed to maximise the interception of runoff flowing downhill from agricultural fields then the removal rate should be even higher.

AB  - On the basis of long-term, high-quality in situ observations on phenological and meteorological data, we parameterised and examined the performances of four single-phase and two two-phase models for the prediction of the leaf unfolding and flowering dates of horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.). Amongst models, those combining the effects of temperature and photoperiod showed the best phenophase prediction, suggesting the influence of photoperiod on the leaf unfolding and flowering of A. hippocastanum. The obtained coefficients showed that the effect of photoperiod was greater on leaf unfolding than on flowering. Comprehensive assessment revealed that the single-phase BCdoy model demonstrated the best fitting for both phenophases. This model also showed sufficiently high accuracy and the transferability of results in time and space. The proposed models can be used to predict the spring phenophases of A. hippocastanum in European and Asian countries, where this ornamental tree species is widely used in urban landscaping, and to optimise control methods against Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimi & cacute; (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae). For C. ohridella, the first flying out of adults after overwintering begins at the onset of horse chestnut leaf unfolding and mass flight occurs during the full flowering period.

AB  - The transposition of Directive 2014/95/EU to Spain through Law 11/2018 of December 28 requires companies to publish information on the impact of their environmental, social, and governance activities (ESG information) in management reports or in a "non-financial statement." This study aims to assess the readiness of IBEX35 companies to submit ESG reports through their communication and web transparency and to determine whether such ESG information is related to these companies' financial indicators. The study is pioneering in the analysis of the transparency of non-financial information on the websites of companies listed on the main Spanish stock market index (IBEX 35). It uses exploratory and descriptive analysis to determine whether the companies with the best economic efficiency indicators are also the most transparent in non-financial indicators (ESG) and to what extent these relationships explain the dependency between the two. The findings reveal that IBEX35 companies need to improve their web transparency by presenting solid non-financial reports with ESG sustainability parameters. The results show that companies with economic profitability in Return on Assets that use their debt levels wisely disclose higher levels of ESG information. In other words, financial performance and indebtedness contribute to improving levels of ESG disclosure on the IBEX35. Companies must also improve accessibility to ESG information, update it, and classify it in accordance with current regulations.

AB  - Monitoring widely distributed species on a budget presents challenges for the spatio-temporal allocation of survey effort. When there are multiple discrete units to monitor, survey alternatives such as model-based estimates can be useful to fill information gaps but may not reliably reflect biological complexity and change. The spatio-temporal allocation of survey effort that minimizes uncertainty for the greatest number of units within a budget can help to ensure monitoring is optimized. We used aerial survey-based population estimates of moose (Alces alces) across 30 Wildlife Management Units (WMUs) in Ontario, Canada to parameterize simulated populations and test the performance of different monitoring scenarios in capturing WMU-specific annual variation and trends. Firstly, we tested scenarios that prioritized conducting a survey for a unit based on one of three management criteria: population state, population uncertainty or number of years between surveys. Also incorporated in the decision framework were WMU-specific costs and annual budget constraints. Secondly, we tested how using model-based estimates to fill information gaps improved population and trend estimates. Lastly, we assessed how the utility (based on minimizing population uncertainty) of using a model-based estimate rather than conducting a survey was impacted by population density, severity of environmental stressors and years since the last survey. Interval-based monitoring that minimized the number of years between surveys captured accurate trends for the highest number of WMUs, but annual variation was poorly captured regardless of management criteria prioritized. Using model-based estimates to fill information gaps improved trend estimation. Further, the utility of conducting a survey increased with time since the last survey and was greater for populations with low densities when the severity of environmental stressors was high, while being greater for populations with high densities when environmental severity was low. Overall, the utility of aerial survey monitoring was strongly associated with WMU-specific monitoring precision and the predictive power of model-based estimates. If long-term trends are evident, then there is greater value in using alternatives such as model-based predictions to replace surveys, but model-based estimates may be a poor substitute when there is strong annual variation and when using a simple model.

AB  - Understanding the influence of the sheep breed and roughage source on the composition of rumen bacteria and methanogens is essential for optimizing roughage efficiency. The experiment employed a 2 x 2 factorial design. Twenty-four Dumont and Mongolian sheep (initial body weight of 18.94 +/- 1.01 kg) were randomly assigned by breed to two dietary treatment groups (AH: alfalfa hay; CS: corn straw); the experiment lasted 90 days. The results showed that sheep fed alfalfa hay diets had a higher feed intake and weight gain, and Dumont sheep had a higher feed intake than Mongolian sheep (p < 0.05). The diversity and composition of ruminal bacteria and methanogens differed between Dumont and Mongolian sheep fed either AH or CS diets. The taxonomic analysis revealed a distinct clustering pattern based on the roughage source, but not on the breed. When fed a corn straw diet, the bacterial Chao1 index of Dumont sheep increased (p < 0.05), while the diversity and richness of methanogens in Mongolian sheep increased (p < 0.05). Additionally, we have identified unique biomarkers for the rumen bacteria and methanogens of Dumont and Mongolian sheep in response to different roughage sources. The results suggest that the differences in the microbiota of the sheep were associated with the roughage source and breed. The higher growth performance of Dumont sheep might be attributed to the increase in bacterial diversity and the decrease in methanogenic bacteria diversity.

AB  - Since their domestication about 10 500 years ago, sheep and goats have been central to human subsistence economies. Despite shared traits and frequent co-herding, these species are biologically distinct, with their uses reflecting diverse cultural practices. Advances in geometric morphometrics enable detailed analyses of their phenotypic evolution, shaped by natural and artificial selection, genetic drift and gene flow. These evolutionary mechanisms are often challenging to disentangle in archaeozoology, but patterns of morphometric variation can reveal evolutionary parallels and divergences. This study investigates the morphometric evolution of sheep and goat teeth in the northwestern Mediterranean basin over 8000 years. Dental remains, which preserve well in archaeological contexts, provide rich data for evolutionary studies, including species-level identifications. Using two-dimensional geometric morphometrics, third lower molars from 1602 sheep and 635 goats, spanning archaeological and modern specimens, were analysed. Molar size, shape and variance were compared across six chrono-cultural phases, tracing diachronic morphological changes. Distinct patterns emerge: sheep exhibit greater variability likely reflecting selective breeding for diverse purposes. Goats, in contrast, show greater uniformity. These findings underscore unique evolutionary trajectories for sheep and goats, offering new perspectives on their biocultural evolution within the dynamic environmental and anthropic contexts that shaped their current diversity.This article is part of the theme issue 'Unravelling domestication: multi-disciplinary perspectives on human and non-human relationships in the past, present and future'.

AB  - Some introduced species cause severe damage, although the majority have little impact. Robust predictions of which species are most likely to cause substantial impacts could focus efforts to mitigate those impacts or prevent certain invasions entirely. Introduced herbivorous insects can reduce crop yield, fundamentally alter natural and managed forest ecosystems, and are unique among invasive species in that they require certain host plants to succeed. Recent studies have demonstrated that understanding the evolutionary history of introduced herbivores and their host plants can provide robust predictions of impact. Specifically, divergence times between hosts in the native and introduced ranges of a nonnative insect can be used to predict the potential impact of the insect should it establish in a novel ecosystem. However, divergence time estimates vary among published phylogenetic datasets, making it crucial to understand if and how the choice of phylogeny affects prediction of impact. Here, we tested the robustness of impact prediction to variation in host phylogeny by using insects that feed on conifers and predicting the likelihood of high impact using four different published phylogenies. Our analyses ranked 62 insects that are not established in North America and 47 North American conifer species according to overall risk and vulnerability, respectively. We found that results were robust to the choice of phylogeny. Although published vascular plant phylogenies continue to be refined, our analysis indicates that those differences are not substantial enough to alter the predictions of invader impact. Our results can assist in focusing biosecurity programs for conifer pests and can be more generally applied to nonnative insects and their potential hosts by prioritizing surveillance for those insects most likely to be damaging invaders.

AB  - C, N and P play an important indicator role in explaining the material cycles and elemental balances of living and non-living systems. In order to control karst rocky desertification, China has established a large number of artificial grasslands for the development of herbivorous animal husbandry, which has played an important role in ecological restoration and economic development. However, the effects of different use patterns on the ecological stoichiometry of the carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) of the grassland plant-soil-microorganism are not clear. In this study, the effects of grazing grassland (GG), mowing grassland (MG) and enclosed grassland (EG) on C, N and P and their ecological stoichiometry in the artificial grassland plant-soil-microbe were investigated in the karst desertification control area in Southern China. The results showed that (1) the C content was EG > GG > MG. The N content was GG > EG > MG, while the P content was MG > GG > EG. C:N, C:P and N:P were shown as EG > GG > MG. The plant N:P was more than 20, indicating a P deficiency and limitation, especially in EG. (2) The content of C and P in soil was EG > GG > MG. The N content was GG > EG > MG. The soil C:N showed EG > MG > GG, while C:P and N:P were shown as MG > GG > EG. The soil N:P ratios were all less than 14, indicating that all of them had an obvious N limitation. (3) Soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was GG > MG > EG. Soil microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) was GG > EG > MG. Soil microbial biomass phosphorus (MBP) showed EG > GG > MG. MBC:MBN was MG > EG > GG. MBC:MBP was MG > EG > GG. MBN:MBP was GG > MG > EG. The MBN:MBP in GG and MG was greater than 9.6, which is P-limited, while the MBN:MBP in EG is less than 8.9, which is N-limited. (4) Plant C and N were significantly correlated with soil C and N, but plant P was significantly negatively correlated with soil P, while MBP was significantly positively correlated with soil TP. Soil microorganisms had the tendency to assimilate available P in GG and MG treatments, but the potential of releasing P from mineralized soil organic matter was higher in EG treatment. The results showed that the chemical properties and stoichiometric characteristics of the plant-soil-microorganism were significantly changed by different grassland-use methods, which provided scientific guidance for the management of C, N and P elements and the further optimization of soil microbial environment for artificial grassland in the karst rocky desertification area.

AB  - The distribution of plant traits is related to abiotic and biotic factors, but it is unknown whether different types of plant traits respond similarly to these factors. We simultaneously studied seed, fruit and leaf traits and their associations with abiotic and biotic factors for tree communities in the tropical mountains of southern Ecuador. We measured seed, fruit, and leaf traits on 18-33 fleshy-fruited plant species and recorded the abundance for these species on nine 1-ha forest plots located at 1000, 2000, and 3000 m a.s.l. On the same plots, we recorded abiotic (soil C/N ratio, mean temperature, and annual rainfall) and biotic factors (avian fruit removal and foliar herbivory) potentially relevant for the measured traits. We conducted principal component and RLQ analyses to test for trait-environment covariation, controlling for phylogenetic relatedness and spatial autocorrelation. We identified a trade-off between (i) seed number and seed size and between (ii) the production of few costly (nitrogen-rich) vs. many cheap (carbon-rich) fruits. Likewise, leaf trait variation was primarily associated with (i) the leaf economics spectrum and (ii) leaf size. Controlling for phylogenetic and spatial covariation, seed, fruit and leaf traits were associated with abiotic and, to a lesser extent, with biotic factors. Fruit and leaf traits linked to production costs were mainly related to soil C/N ratios, whereas traits associated with the size of seeds, fruits, and leaves were related to rainfall. Our study suggests that associations between seed, fruit and leaf traits and the abiotic environment follow similar principles in tropical tree communities.

AB  - The present study was carried out to determine the seminal microbiota of boars and their correlation with sperm quality. A total of 17 ejaculates were collected from 17 Duroc boars and were classified according to sperm quality into two groups: low-quality (n = 8) and high-quality (n = 9). Each ejaculate was subjected to (i) semen evaluation, (ii) bacterial culture and MALDI-TOF identification, and (iii) 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. No difference in the total bacterial count, alpha diversity, and beta diversity between the high-quality group and the low-quality group was detected (p > 0.05). While Globicatella sanguinis was negatively correlated with sperm quality (p < 0.05), Delftia acidovorans was positively correlated with sperm quality (p < 0.05). Lactobacillales (25.2%; LB) and Enterobacterales (10.3%; EB) were the most dominant bacteria and negatively correlated: EB = 507.3 - 0.5 x LB, R-2 = 0.24, p < 0.001. Moreover, the abundance of Escherichia-shigella was negatively correlated with LB (r = -0.754, p < 0.001) and positively correlated with Proteus (r = 0.533, p < 0.05). Alysiella was positively correlated with Lactobacillus (r = 0.485, p < 0.05), Prevotella (r = 0.622, p < 0.01), and Staphylococcus (r = 0.489, p < 0.05). In conclusion, seminal microbiota is significantly associated with boar semen qualities. The distributions of the most dominant bacterial genera, the differences in the abundance of small subset microbes, and their correlation appear to have far more impact than the overall seminal bacterial content (e.g., total bacterial count, alpha diversity, and beta diversity) on sperm quality.

AB  - We recorded the occurrence of Duranta erecta L. in the Aeolian Islands (Sicily, Italy), where it currently behaves as a casual alien. At the global scale, however, this woody species has shown highly invasive behaviour in different island ecosystems. On the basis of this evidence, we have investigated which ecological and biological traits may have allowed its establishment and spread, and could trigger its further expansion in the Aeolian Islands in the near future. Several factors seem to have favoured its success on a global scale, such as the wide edaphic and climatic range, the tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance, and the production of toxic metabolites that protect it from herbivore browsing and from competition with other plants. The study of the organisms that perform pollination and seed dispersal is probably the key to understanding the local naturalization of this plant, introduced about three centuries ago in Europe and the Mediterranean, and is here discussed in detail for the first time.

AB  - Investigating the long-term fluctuations of the feeding ecology of megaherbivores such as sirenians is important, as any changes could be indicative of shifts in resource availability. The Indian River Lagoon (IRL), eastern Florida, USA, is a critical habitat for the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris). However, the IRL has experienced a substantial decline in seagrass due to the persistence of several harmful algal blooms. Using microhistological analysis, we examined the diet of manatees over a discontinuous sampling period spanning over 38 years using stomach contents collected from carcasses recovered in the IRL. Samples collected between 2013-2015 (post-seagrass die-off, n = 90) were compared to archived stomach samples collected between 1977-1989 (pre-seagrass die-off, n = 103). Samples analyzed from 1977-1989 contained primarily seagrasses (61.7%), followed by algae (28.4%) and vascular plants (1.7%). In contrast, stomach samples from the postseagrass die-off primarily contained algae (49.5%), followed by seagrasses (34%) and vascular plants (2.7%). Between 1977-1989 and 2013-2015, manatees in the IRL experienced a 44.9% decline in seagrass consumption, and a 74.3% increase in algal consumption. This dietary shift was not influenced by body length, a proxy of age, or sex. Our results indicate that the dietary shift experienced by manatees is due to the decline of available seagrass forage in the IRL, and highlight the dietary plasticity of manatees in the face of changes in resource availability. However, the individual health and population-level consequences of this dietary shift are unknown. An increase in mortality due to undetermined causes in this region since 2012 can be associated with deteriorating body conditions of manatees in the IRL, possibly resulting from a lack of seagrass diet. Future research should further investigate behavioral changes affecting manatees in relation to seagrass decline in the IRL, including the energetic costs of this dietary change.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) are a prolific invasive species throughout many regions of the world that cause extensive economic and environmental damage. Trapping is a common strategy for reducing their populations with baits (i.e., food) and attractants (e.g., scents) used to lure wild pigs into traps. However, there is little information on which scent attractants may attract wild pigs more readily and rapidly across regions and seasons. We examined 60 scent attractants for wild pigs that could be used to increase trapping success across three seasons (winter, spring, and fall) and in two geographic regions, including a warm and semi-arid rangeland (South Texas, USA) and a warm and moist mixture of upland and bottomland forests (South Carolina, USA). We found little evidence that most scents attracted wild pigs. Only strawberry extract and creosote bush oil increased the probabilities of visitation, and only in Texas during the fall season. No other scents attractants performed better than the control (i.e., no scent) in both study locations. More wild pigs visited sites during the fall season regardless of scent attractant used. The location of a site mattered more than which attractant was used, and a post hoc analysis revealed that distances to roads and water flowlines (i.e., permanent or ephemeral drainages, streams, and rivers) increased the probabilities of visitation during some seasons. We conclude there was no panacea scent that was more effective than controls in attracting wild pigs across regions and seasons. Placement of sites and seasonality were more important for attracting wild pigs, suggesting the location of traps or bait sites may be more important than the specific attractants used for management activities. Future research should include monitoring move-ments of wild pigs relative to scent attractants and evaluation of baits (e.g., food-rewards) for drawing wild pigs to sites.

AB  - The increasing global emergence of zoonoses warrants improved awareness of activities that predispose vulnerable communities to greater risk of disease. Zoonotic disease outbreaks regularly occur within Myanmar and at its borders partly due to insufficient knowledge of behavioral risks, hindering participatory surveillance and reporting. This study employed a behavioral surveillance strategy among high-risk populations to understand the behavioral risks for zoonotic disease transmission in an effort to identify risk factors for pathogen spillover. To explore behavioral mechanisms of spillover in Myanmar, we aimed to: (1) evaluate the details around animal contact and types of interaction, (2) assess the association between self-reported unusual symptoms (i.e., any illness or sickness that is not known or recognized in the community or diagnosed by medical providers) and animal contact activities and (3) identify the potential risk factors including behavioral practices of self-reported illness. Participants were enrolled at two community sites: Hpa-An and Hmawbi in Southern Myanmar. A behavioral questionnaire was administered to understand participants' animal exposures, behaviors and self-reported illnesses. From these responses, associations between (1) animal contact activities and self-reported unusual illnesses, and (2) potential risk factors and self-reported unusual illness were tested. Contact with poultry seemed to be very frequent (91.1%) and many participants reported raising, handling and having poultry in their houses as well as slaughtering or being scratched/bitten by them, followed by contact with rodents (57.8%) and swine (17.9%). Compared to participants who did not have any unusual symptoms, participants who had unusual symptoms in the past year were more likely to have sold dead animals (OR = 13.6, 95% CI 6.8-27.2), slaughtered (OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.7-3.3), raised (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.3-5.0) or handled animals (OR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.2-3.6), and had eaten sick (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 3.0-6.4) and/or dead animals (OR = 6.0, 95% CI 4.1-8.8) in the same year. Odds of having reported unusual symptoms was higher among those involved in animal production business (OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.9-6.2) and animal-involved livelihoods (OR = 3.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.2) compared to other livelihoods. The results suggest that there is a high level of interaction between humans, livestock and wild animals in communities we investigated in Myanmar. The study highlights the specific high-risk behaviors as they relate to animal contact and demographic risk factors for zoonotic spillover. Our findings contribute to human behavioral data needed to develop targeted interventions to prevent zoonotic disease transmission at human-animal interfaces.

AB  - The majority of our understanding of the effects of climate change on coral reef fishes are currently based on studies of small-bodied species such as damselfishes. By contrast, we know little about the potential impacts of ocean warming on larger species of herbivorous and detritivorous reef fish, despite them being a critical functional group and an essential source of food protein for millions of people. In addition, we know little of the role of habitat in determining species' thermal sensitivity and the legitimacy of extrapolating thermal performance across closely-related species from different habitat types. Here we test the effect of exposure to increased water temperature during juvenile development on key physiological and behavioral traits of two species of rabbitfish typically associated with different habitats: Siganus doliatus (reef-associated) and S. lineatus (estuarine). Wild-caught juveniles were reared for 14 weeks at temperatures representing present-day ambient conditions (28.0 degrees C), late-summer ambient conditions (30.0 degrees C), or those projected on reefs under future global warming scenarios (31.5 degrees C). We then measured the somatic (growth, condition, immune response) and behavioral (feeding rate, latency to feed and activity level) traits of individuals within each treatment to determine the sensitivity of each species to elevated water temperatures. Overall, both species showed comparatively robust levels of thermal tolerance, based on previously-documented responses of small-bodied reef fishes. However, two very different patterns emerged. The reef-associated S. doliatus showed a greater physiological response to temperature, with negative effects on hepatosomatic condition and immune function observed in individuals exposed to the 31.5 degrees C treatment. By contrast, there were no negative physiological effects of temperature observed in S. lineatus and instead we recorded behavioral changes, with individuals at 30 degrees C and 31.5 degrees C displaying altered feeding behavior (increased feeding rate and decreased latency to feed). These distinct responses observed between congeners are likely due to their evolutionary history and flag the potential inaccuracies that could arise from extrapolating effects of ocean warming across even closely-related species adapted to different habitats.

AB  - The genetic diversity of Brucella strains has not been fully understood. To investigate this, the genetic characteristics of 64 isolates of Brucella melitensis from sheep and goats' milk were studied using random fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and multiple locus variablenumber tandem repeat analysis (MLVA-16) methods developed in Orsay, France (MLVA16Orsay). The RFLP analysis revealed that all 64 isolates were of biovar one. The MLVA-typing showed that one sample was simultaneously infected with two strains of B. melitensis and the genotype of 65 isolate was analyzed. Four genotypes (47, 42, 43, and 63) were identified using MLVA-8 (panel 1), whereas six genotypes (138, 125, 116, 108, and two unknown genotypes) were identified using MLVA11 (panels 1 and 2A). From the review of MLVA-16 (panels 1, 2A, and 2B), panel 2B showed a very high discriminatory power. Two loci of Bruc04 and Bruc30 from this panel had diversity index values higher than 0.71 and the average diversity index was 0.619. So MLVA-16Orsay 34 showed the genotype indicating a low genetic homogeneity among the isolates. The findings of MLVA genotyping of the isolates suggest that strains of B. melitensis isolated from the milk of small ruminants in Iran are most closely related to the isolates from neighboring countries of the Eastern Mediterranean group. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to indicate the potential use of MLVA genotyping for simultaneous detection of specimen contamination using two different B. melitensis biovars.

AB  - Biochar (BC) has been proven effective in promoting the production of safety food in cadmium (Cd)-polluted soil and the impact can be further enhanced through interaction with compost (CM). However, there existed unclear impacts of biochar with varying particle sizes in conjunction with compost on microbiome composition, rhizosphere functions, and soil health. Hence, in this study, two bulk-biochar derived from wood chips and pig manure were fabricated into nano-biochar using a ball-milling method. Subsequently, in a field experiment, the rootassociated bacterial community and microbial functions of lettuce were evaluated in respond to Cdcontaminated soil remediated with nano/bulk-BCCM. The results showed that compared to bulk-BCCM, nanoBCCM significantly reduced the Cd concentration in the edible part of lettuce and the available Cd in the soil. Both nano-BCCM and bulk-BCCM strongly influenced the composition of bacterial communities in the four rootassociated niches, and enhanced rhizosphere functions involved in nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon cycling, as well as the relative abundance and biodiversity of keystone modules in rhizosphere soil. Furthermore, soil quality index analysis indicated that nano-BCCM exhibited greater potential than bulk-BCCM in maintaining soil health. The data revealed that nano-BCCM could regulate the Cd concentration in lettuce shoot by promoting microbial biodiversity of keystone modules in soil-root continuum and rhizosphere bacterial functions. These findings suggest that nano-biochar compost associations can be a superior strategy for enhancing microbial functions, maintaining soil health, and ensuring crop production safety in the Cd-contaminated soil compared to the mix of bulk-biochar and compost.

AB  - Context Gaining insights into seasonal aggregations of marine megafauna and how patterns vary among demographic groups is pivotal for evaluating anthropogenic risk exposure and modeling populations and ecosystem dynamics. In California, adult and subadult white sharks recurrently aggregate on the coast near pinniped colonies in fall and winter months, facilitating comprehensive long-term field studies.Aims In this study, we used over 15 years of passive acoustic telemetry data to compare the seasonal dynamics of coastal habitat use for white sharks tagged in central California among four demographic groups (adult females, adult males, subadult females, and subadult males).Methods Acoustic tags were deployed on 355 white sharks at coastal aggregation sites and monitored across a coastal array of underwater receivers from 2006 to 2022. The main aggregation sites of the Northeast Pacific (A & ntilde;o Nuevo, the Farallon Islands and Tomales) were continuously monitored, with an expansion of the acoustic network to the south in the latter years of the study.Key results White sharks were tracked for an average duration of 594 +/- 552 days (mean +/- s.d.), with total track durations ranging up to 3235 days. Notably, adult male sharks exhibited the highest residency to central California coastal aggregation sites and demonstrated earlier seasonal peak densities in late October. Adult female presence peaked in early December. Adult sharks displayed distinct seasonal gaps in detection where they have been shown with satellite tags to migrate offshore, with females displaying much longer average detection gaps than for males (averaging 1.5 years vs 0.7 years). In contrast, subadults exhibited higher coastal affinity with more consistent and widespread detections across a higher number of coastal sites throughout the year, often extending beyond the main aggregation areas outside of the peak aggregation season.Conclusions We hypothesize that the observed differences between demographic groups are attributed to sex- and size-specific foraging and reproductive strategies. The extended receiver network also showed expansive coastal movements and identified potential undescribed aggregation sites.Implications Insights from our extensive acoustic dataset represent a significant advancement in assessing the timing of anthropogenic interactions and modeling both ecosystem and population dynamics.

AB  - Manure amendment in croplands is common practice for soil carbon sequestration, and may also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Few studies focus on the effects of manure application on the net greenhouse gas emissions (NGHGE, the global warming impacts of soil carbon sequestration and CH4 and N2O emissions) in double-rice cropping fields. Herein, a field experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of pig manure application in combination with reduced chemical fertilizers on the NGHGE, soil properties, and yields in a double-rice paddy field in 2012-2015. Four treatments were included: 0 N (no nitrogen fertilizer); 1/2 N (chemical nitrogen fertilizer reduced by 50%); N (100% chemical nitrogen fertilizer); and 1/2 N + PM (pig manure complemented with chemical fertilizer application). The average annual CH4 emissions for 1/2 N + PM were 53%, 50%, and 32% higher than those for 0 N, 1/2 N, and N treatments, respectively (p < 0.05). The soil organic carbon sequestration rates (SOCSR) for 1/2 N + PM were 224%, 208%, and 192% higher than those for 0 N, 1/2 N, and N treatments, respectively (p < 0.05). The average annual N2O emissions from 1/2 N + PM were 51% lower than those from the N treatment. Compared to 0 N, 1/2 N and N treatments, the average NGHGE for 1/2 N + PM decreased by 41%, 41%, and 52%, and the average greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI, the yield-scaled NGHGE) from 1/2 N + PM reduced by 67%, 52%, and 53%, respectively. The decreases in NGHGE and GHGI were predominantly due to increased SOCSR (contributions of 187-308% and 81-325%, respectively) in 1/2 N + PM. The average soil nitrate, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, soil organic carbon contents, and pH value for 1/2 N + PM treatment were higher than those for the 1/2 N and N treatments (p < 0.05). Compared to 0 N and 1/2 N treatments, 1/2 N + PM treatment significantly increased the average rice yield. However, no significant difference in average yield was observed between the 1/2 N + PM and N treatments. Gross margin analysis showed that the economic profit for 1/2 N + PM was higher than that for the other three treatments. Thus, the combined application of reduced chemical fertilizers and pig manure is an effective and economic way to neutralize greenhouse gas emissions and increase soil fertility in double-rice cropping systems.

AB  - Mammals have been widely recognized as mobile link species that can vectorize resources across the landscape. In this study, we analyze the biodeposition of waste products egested by native herbivorous mammals of the Monte Desert to document for the first time the implications of the restoration of a native forest on this process. We compared a restored native woodland an adjacent grazing field in terms of the spatial distribution of waste products, the biodiversity of trophic items stored in fecal pellets, and the C:N ratio as a predictor of nutrients supplied to the soil. We found that fecal pellets of mammal species were intermingled and spatially distributed throughout the entire landscape, but they were more abundant in the restoration area, indicating the influence of land management types on the distribution process. The two mammal species presented different feeding strategies; however, the plant species consumed in the grazing field indicate decreased food options for native mammals, meaning a smaller amplitude of their trophic niches under this land management. The low C:N ratio and the high nitrogen pool provided by the pellets in the restoration area suggest a potential benefit to plant communities. However, the higher organic C jointly with the lower C:N ratio observed in fecal pellets of grazing field indicate a low decomposability which could promote the conservation of C in the soil.

AB  - Whether specialist pests can cause more damage to their host plants than generalist pests is a critical issue in both basic biology and nonnative species management. To date, there is no consensus on how we define "specialist vs. generalist" pests and how we should assess forest damage or impacts (volume loss vs. mortality). Here, we comparatively investigate whether nonnative generalist pests may cause more damage to US forests than nonnative specialist pests using two frameworks: (1) the "binary or dichotomous approach" through a largely arbitrary classification of specialist and generalist pests, and (2) the "specialist-generalist continuum". We measure damage or impact in two ways, one by the total host volume infested and the other by total host mortality. In the binary comparison, generalists infested more host tree volume per pest species than specialists, but the latter (mostly pathogens) caused higher mortality of host trees. The "specialist-generalist continuum" concept could reveal a different pattern regarding pest invasions and impacts when there is no clear separation between generalists and specialists in a community or region. Therefore, we suggest using the "continuum" approach to address related questions in future studies, thus offering new insights into pest invasions that have deeper implications for forest pest monitoring and management.

AB  - The information on ecological niches of the Marula tree, Sclerocarya birrea (A. Rich.) Horchst. subspecies are needed for sustainable management of this tree, considering its nutritional, eco-nomic, and ecological benefits. However, despite Tanzania being regarded as a global genetic center of diversity of S. birrea, information on the subspecies ecological niches is lacking. We aimed to model ecological niches of S. birrea subspecies in Tanzania under the current and future climates. Ecological niches under the current climate were modelled by using ecological niche models in MaxEnt using climatic, edaphic, and topographical variables, and subspecies occur-rence data. The Hadley Climate Center and National Center for Atmospheric Research's Earth System Models were used to predict ecological niches under the medium and high greenhouse gases emission scenarios for the years 2050 and 2080. Areas under the curves (AUCs) were used to assess the accuracy of the models. The results show that the models were robust, with AUCs of 0.85-0.95. Annual and seasonal precipitation, elevation, and soil cation exchange capacity are the key environmental factors that define the ecological niches of the S. birrea subspecies. Ecological niches of subsp. caffra, multifoliata, and birrea are currently found in 30, 22, and 21 regions, and occupy 184 814 km2, 139 918 km2, and 28 446 km2 of Tanzania's land area respectively, which will contract by 0.4-44% due to climate change. Currently, 31-51% of ecological niches are under Tanzania's protected areas network. The findings are important in guiding the development of conservation and domestication strategies for the S. birrea subspecies in Tanzania.

AB  - Estimating the nutritional value of herbage is a core aspect of livestock pasture management. Quantitative information related to significant findings is essential for assessing nutritional provision and preventing pasture degradation. Here, we developed a new Pasture Quality Index (PQI) that indicates the nutritional quality of pastures based on their nutritional value and the composition of plant functional groups of the vegetation. We applied the model on a regional scale using VEN & mu;S satellite data, collected more than 450 plant samples, and applied pasture quality parameters analysis. Pasture samples were collected from paddocks under two different grazing intensities in Israel in a semiarid and a Mediterranean grassland. Pasture quality was estimated five times over two years at mid- and peak vegetation growth stages. The PQI included: protein content, fiber content, dry matter digestibility and the proportion of unpalatable spiny thistles. A support vector machine regression model was used to train statistical models that relate ground truth PQI data to the reflectance values of the VEN & mu;S satellite. Large-scale forage quality maps at 5 m spatial resolution were created. Fine-resolution drone orthomosaics were used to enhance the satellite-based predictions accuracy, resulting in a model accuracy of R2 = 0.86. We observed that nutritional quality showed strong dependence on seasonality and the grazing regime, with higher quality observed during mid-growth compared to peak growth. Higher quality was also observed under grazing compared to ungrazed paddocks. The occurrence of unpalatable thistles in grazed paddocks significantly reduced the pasture quality at the Mediterranean grassland. To summarize, the PQI enables the integration of several quality indicators into an index that helps in detecting the effects of grazing management on rangelands. In addition, high accuracy was achieved in relating the overall PQI and high spatiotemporal resolution satellite imagery data. Our developed methodology enables site-specific, spatially explicit, frequent, and area-extensive pasture quality assessment that can aid in optimizing livestock management in various ecosystems.

AB  - Plant nutritional properties, physical defenses, and chemical defenses impact herbivore feeding decisions. While herbivores often prefer plants enriched with nitrogen, less is known about how phosphorus impacts plant-herbivore interactions. In this study, we investigated how seagrass-herbivore interactions vary along a natural gradient in phosphorus availability, using turtle grass Thalassia testudinum collected from 3 sites in Florida (USA) along the gradient (Weeki Wachee: low phosphorus and nitrogen; Homosassa: high phosphorus and nitrogen; Crystal River: high phosphorus and low nitrogen) and 2 common herbivores, variegated sea urchin Lytechinus variegatus and emerald parrotfish Nicholsina usta. T. testudinum plants from the phosphorus-poor site (Weeki Wachee) exhibited increased physical and chemical anti-herbivore defenses. Plants in Weeki Wachee had higher leaf fiber content, lower specific leaf area, and up to 2 times higher concentrations of phenolic acids and condensed tannins. Both L. variegatus and N. usta avoided consuming the plants from Weeki Wachee, preferring plants from sites with higher nutrient availability. However, feeding preferences varied between the 2 herbivore species, with L. variegatus often consuming similar amounts of the plants from the 2 phosphorus-rich sites (Homosassa and Crystal River) and N. usta preferring the plants from Homosassa, which had the highest concentrations of both phosphorus and nitrogen. These findings suggest that plants at the phosphorus-poor site invest more resources in anti-herbivore defenses, and this higher investment in defenses, along with lower leaf tissue phosphorus concentrations, deterred multiple herbivore species.

AB  - Historically, ferns have been described as underutilized by insects. However, studies have shown a diversity of insects interacting with ferns, although the evolutionary and ecological drivers of these interactions are still to be untangled. To fill these gaps, we compiled more than 100 yr of global data on insect-fern interactions from the literature comprising 374 fern and 649 insect species. With this database we assessed how fern trophic specialization, phylogenetic relationships and climate have shaped their interactions with insects. Our findings showed that interactions between ferns and insects can be explained by the phylogenetic relations among them. We observed that insect orders part of the Endopterygota clade tend to interact with similar fern species, which might be a result of the inheritance of Endopterygota ancestors probably due to phylogenetic niche conservationism. Under an ecological context, fern specialization increased with temperature, precipitation, and climatic stability. Our results show that climate might be one of the main factors explaining the spatial variation of insect-fern interactions, postulate also supported by the observed phylogenetic clustering of the studied ferns species. Our study highlights the intricate and multifaceted nature of insect-fern interactions, where evolutionary history and ecological factors converge to shape these relationships.

AB  - The present study is the first of its kind being reported from Pakistan for Punjab Urial (Ovis Vignei Punjabiensis) which was aimed towards assessing various components of its habitat (vegetation, food preference, land cover, and water) throughout the whole of its distribution range viz. Salt Range (Chakwal, Jehlum, Khushab, Kohat and Mianwali Districts) and Kala Chitta Range (Attock District). For assessment of vegetation in the whole study area (64 study sites), all dominant plant species of potential habitat were studied by quadrate method while the food of Punjab Urial was identified on predetermined line transects. Concurrently, a total of 180 water samples were obtained for various water quality attributes. A total of 74 families including 284 species were identified with Poaceae (21 %) as a majorly contributing family, followed by Asteracea (6 %), Solanaceae (3 %), and the remaining being within the range of 0.7 to 1 %. Within this vegetation, herbs, grasses, trees and shrubs were 56 %, 16 %, 16 % and 12 %, respectively. Overall, 51 % of food of Punjab Urial comprised of herbs while the rest of it was grasses, trees and shrubs being 19, 16 and 14 %, respectively. All the studied water quality attributes had a statistical difference (P <= 0.05) within districts of study with Kohat having least quality.

AB  - Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) supports a plethora of biodiversity with a unique assemblage of many charismatic and endemic species. We assessed the genetic diversity, demographic history, and habitat suitability of blue sheep (Pseudois nayaur) in the IHR through the analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) and Cytochrome b gene, and 14 ecological predictor variables. We observed high genetic divergence and designated them into two genetic lineage groups, i.e., the Himalayan blue sheep (P. n. nayaur) in the western part, and the Chinese blue sheep (P. n. szechuanensis) in the eastern part. They exhibited poor connectivity due to landscape resistance. The genetic distance value suggested substantial genetic differentiation between them. The habitat selection by blue sheep indicated the disparity between the residence preferences in the western and eastern Himalayas. In both the regions, the habitat suitability was mostly influenced by the minimum temperature of the coldest month. However, in the eastern Himalayas, precipitation seasonality emerged as a significant variable influencing habitat suitability. These findings provided strong support for the presumption that the habitats preferred by blue sheep in the western Himalayas are dryer, compared with the preferred habitats in the eastern region, which were moister. The identification of two separate lineages of P. nayaur in the IHR has significant conservation implications as it underlines the necessity for a unique management approach for each lineage. In order to preserve genetic integrity, conservation efforts must make sure that each population is maintained and monitored separately, as genetic divergence across the lineages that might indicate reproductive isolation. This study has potential conservation implications as it provides insights on the crucial ecological information of a relatively lesser-known ungulates species of Himalaya essential for effective conservation planning.

AB  - Herbivory is a core ecosystem function that is delivered heterogeneously across space. Disentangling the drivers of foraging patterns is key to understanding the functional impact of herbivores. Because intrinsic drivers of foraging like metabolism, nutritional requirements and movement costs scale allometrically, foraging movement patterns in terrestrial herbivores have been shown to also scale positively with body size. However, spatial patterns of herbivory can also be explained by orthogonal factors such as trophic position, competition and functional groupings. Here, we investigate body size and species traits as drivers of the spatial scaling of foraging patterns in herbivorous coral reef fishes. We quantified foraging patterns of 119 individuals from nine common herbivorous species using focal individual surveys. Body size, species identity, feeding substrata, social grouping and functional group were tested as predictors of three foraging metrics: foraging area, inter-foray distance and tortuosity. Our resulting model revealed that species identity overshadowed body size as a predictor in models for all foraging metrics. While foraging area was explained best by species only, the resulting tortuosity and mean inter-foray distance models included a small effect of body size that explained within-species variation. We do not find strong support for size-scaling of foraging patterns in our study species. These findings indicate that foraging allometry based on Optimal foraging theory cannot be generally applied to reef fish assemblages due to a diversity of foraging strategies, such as spatial partitioning and territoriality. Our work reveals the importance of behavioural ecology and taxonomic diversity in understanding herbivory, especially given the functional differences across species. With coral reefs under threat across the world, this is an important step to disentangling the spatial delivery of a core ecosystem function.

AB  - Rewilding attempts to increase biodiversity and restore natural ecosystem processes by reducing human influence. Today, there is growing interest in rewilding urban areas. Rewilding of the Detroit, Michigan, USA and Windsor, Ontario, Canada metropolitan area, and its shared natural resource called the Detroit River, has been delineated through the reintroduction of peregrine falcons and osprey, and a return of other sentinel species like bald eagles, lake sturgeon, lake whitefish, walleye, beaver, and river otter. Rewilding has helped showcase the value and benefits of environmental protection and restoration, ecosystem services, habitat rehabilitation and enhancement, and conservation, including social and economic benefits. Improved ecosystem health and rewilding have become a catalyst for re-establishing a reconnection between urban denizens and natural resources through greenways and water trails. The provision of compelling outdoor experiences in nature, in turn, can help foster a personal attachment to the particular place people call home that can help inspire a stewardship ethic.

AB  - All populations are affected by multiple environmental drivers, including climatic drivers such as temperature or precipitation and biotic drivers such as herbivory or mutualisms. The relative response of a population to each driver is critical to prioritizing threat mitigation for conservation and to understanding whether climatic or biotic drivers most strongly affect fitness. However, the importance of different drivers can vary dramatically across species and across populations of the same species. Theory suggests that the response to climatic versus biotic drivers can be affected by both the species' fundamental niche breadth and the latitude of the population at which the response is measured. However, we have few tests of how these two factors affect relative response to drivers separately, let alone tests of how niche breadth and latitude together influence responses. Here, we use a meta-analysis of published studies on population response to climatic and biotic drivers in terrestrial plants, combined with estimates of climatic niche breadth and position within climatic niche derived from herbarium records, to show that species' niche breadth is the primary determinant of response to climatic versus biotic drivers. Namely, we find that response to climatic drivers changes only minimally with increasing niche breadth, while response to biotic drivers increases with niche breadth. We see similar relationships when considering range size instead of niche breadth. Surprisingly, we find no effects of latitude on the relative effect of climatic versus biotic drivers. Our work suggests that populations of species with small and large ranges experience similar extirpation risks due to the negative impacts of climate change. By contrast, populations of species with large (but not small) ranges may be highly susceptible to changes in densities or distributions of interacting species.

AB  - This 22-year study examined the impact and dispersal of the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) and the elongate hemlock scale at 67 sites in southwest Virginia. A hemlock stand health index was based on percent foliage density, live crown ratio, live branches, live tips, new foliage, and live trees at each site. At the beginning of the study, hemlock health at all sites was good. After 22 years hemlock health had declined to a poor condition and mortality averaged 30%. Differences in health decline were found among the three physiographic mountain regions. Analysis of the variables measured indicated that hemlock stand health decline was positively correlated with the percentage of branches infested with HWA, hemlock diameter at breast height (dbh), and total tree basal area per hectare and negatively correlated with latitude. Crown density, the inverse of Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) canopy foliage transparency could be used as a standalone hemlock health measurement.

AB  - Serpula lacrymans causes structural damage in timber via cellulose and hemicellulose decomposition. Serpula lacrymans shares its habitat with bacteria and fungi, interactions that often result in stress and changed behaviour of the partners. A typical response to environmental stress is the production of bioactive metabolites and pig-ments. The diversity and function of these metabolites in inter-and intra-kingdom interactions, is largely elusive. Using dual culture approaches and secondary metabolite fingerprinting with high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) it was demonstrated that stress induces an unspecific vs. Similar metabolite patterns were identified when S. lacrymans was co-cultured with different bacteria and mycoparasitic fungi (Trichoderma spp.). By analysing the metabolites produced along the gradient from the contact zone to more remote parts of the mycelium, we show a systemic reaction of S. lacrymans and that direct contact with other microbes is not a necessity to induce secondary metabolites.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effect of environmental enrichment on the thermoregulatory and behavioral responses of goats raised in semi-arid conditions. 12 Saanen goats lactating, aged between 2 and 4 years, clinically healthy with a mean body weight of 31.4 +/- 1.65 kg and body condition score between 2.0 and 2.5 were used. The types of enriched environments used were: 1) without environmental enrichment (control); 2) classical music;3) PET plastic bottles with corn;4) suspended tires;5) logs of wood; and 6) all objects simultaneously. The air temperature, black globe tempeature and humidity index, and radiant heat load were higher (P < 0.05) during treatment with all objects simultaneously. The respiratory rate (RR) was higher (P = 0.001) in the control treatment compared to those with environmental enrichment. The rectal temperature (RT) was higher in the control and acoustic groups (P < 0.05), however it was lower with all objects. The coat surface temperature (CST) was higher (P < 0.01) in the control group and lower in the treatment with music, tires, logs of wood, PET bottles and all objects. The behaviors lying down, drinking water, urination, ruminating while standing, and defecating were similar (P > 0.05) between treatments. The first two discriminant functions were significant (F1 and F2: P < 0.001) and discriminated 93.40% of the data variation. A static pattern was observed in the classification of goats in their group of origin for thermoregulatory and behavioral responses when a single type of enrichment was used with the formation of two more groups: (i) goats which had access to all enrichments simultaneously; and (ii) the control group. The offer of the diversity of various objects for environmental enrichment positively contributed to the thermoregulatory and behavioral responses, thereby providing wellbeing to the animals.

AB  - Simple Summary This study explores the phylogenetic relationships among Korean native black goats, whose genetic resources are being preserved by the National Institute of Animal Science through the collection of purebred specimens. We analyzed the complete mitochondrial genomes of 282 native goats and 82 reference populations. The native population exhibits a haplotype diversity of 0.659 and includes 39 distinct haplotypes. Neighbor-joining tree and median-joining network analyses established that these goats form a unique clade (A') within Haplogroup A, suggesting a shared ancestry with diverse goat populations from around the world.Abstract This study explores the phylogeny of Korean native black goats through analysis of their complete mitochondrial DNA. The National Institute of Animal Science has gathered genetic material on purebred goats from isolated regions such as Tongyeong, Dangjin, and Jangsu, and is actively breeding them on a national level. These populations, however, are small and exhibit high inbreeding rates, highlighting the urgent need to preserve genetic diversity. The haplotype diversity within this native group is 0.659, with 39 haplotypes identified. By contrast, including international breeds in the analysis increases the overall haplotype diversity to 0.925 with 203 haplotypes identified, highlighting the limited genetic diversity among native black goats. For phylogenetic assessment, a neighbor-joining tree and median-joining network were constructed using identified haplogroups (A, B, C, D, G, and F) from prior studies. The results pinpoint the native black goats as closely related to, but distinct from, Haplogroup A with a bootstrap value of 98, establishing them as a separate clade (A'). This supports the notion of a shared ancestry with various global populations. This research provides essential data on the origins and evolutionary history of Korean native black goats, supporting conservation and breeding efforts aimed at enhancing genetic diversity.

AB  - Human wildlife conflict (HWC) represents a growing concern for the agro-pastoral community living near protected areas. We investigated the effects of crop damage by wild animals on the food security of local households and explored potential solutions. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews conducted with 250 households and 21 key informant interviews around the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nepal. Our results revealed that 96% of the respondents had experienced conflicts with wild animals, of which 66% reported rice as a major damaged crop. Annually, 320 kg of rice per household was damaged, which is equivalent to one-third of the annual consumption for each household in the study area. Wild elephants were the key contributors (62%) to this damage. To mitigate HWC, 59% respondents suggested construction of concrete walls around the affected areas. In addition, mobilization of the local community in conservation stewardship helps reduce HWC.

AB  - The horn shape and its sex dimorphism are compared in museum specimens of all geographical populations of the dama gazelle (Nanger dama). Departing from a putatively ancestral mor phology prevailing in the west(-central) Sahel zone, a forked cladogenesis is inferred producing the eastern horn type of the red-necked gazelles (N. d. ruficollis) in Sudan and the morphotype of the mhorr gazelles (N. d. mhorr) in the northwest Sahara. The mhorr-horn type is phylogenetically derived as an autapomorphic novelty evolved by a mechanism driven by female sexual mimicry of the male model. Insufficient museum series from the subspecifically vaguely defined populations in the Sahel belt preclude the recognition of one (or even more?) additional horn mor phologies in this intercalating region from Senegal to Niger, but any perhaps possible, further type(s), such as a potential horn morphotype in Damergou, Niger, would be weakly differentiated from the ruficollis-horns. Horn morphology suggests moderate subspecies-specific originalities in the fighting behaviours, differing in the intensity of ramming (N. d. mhorr) versus sparring (N. d. ruficollis). The slightly augmented surface area of the eastern morphotype could facilitate thermoregulation, by horn-mediated export of body heat, in the hyperthermic and hyper-arid desert biotope of N. d. ruficollis. Every morphotype is broadly sex-dimor phic, but this dimorphism is reduced in the mhorr gazelles. Andromimicry of female mhorr gazelles, mimicking the sexual phenotype characters of males, is proposed to explain both the diminished sex dimorphism of the horns in this subspecies, and its conspicuously gaudy display and shiny signal coat colours. While the horn ontogeny in female addra gazelles remains unstudied, female mhorr gazelles continued horn length growth during adulthood until old age, but males apparently did not or less so, further raising the complexity of horn shape evolution.

AB  - Length-weight relationships are useful for stock assessments and modeling alternative conservation and management strategies for both native and non-native fishes. We developed length-weight relationships for 18 native and non-native riverine fishes in the lower Red River catchment. Fishes were sampled in the summer and autumn seasons between May 2021 and March 2024 via electrofishing and gill nets. Measurements for each specimen consisted of total length (mm) and weight (g). We provide L-W relationships for 14 native fishes consisting of 5 families (Lepisosteidae, Catostomidae, Ictaluridae, Sciaenidae, and Polyodontidae) and 4 non-native species belonging to the family Cyprinidae. We collected 6,845 individuals ranging from 67 alligator gar to 1,848 smallmouth buffalo. All the L-W relationships were significant (p<0.05), and the majority (72% of species) of relationships between length and weight had r(2) values > 0.70. Our findings provide insight into the L-W relationships of riverine fishes and can be useful for modeling alternatives targeted at native fishes of recreational value and the removal efforts of non-native fishes.

AB  - Biofouling is a significant issue on marine aquaculture pens and is conservatively estimated to contribute to 15% of production costs. With a global increase in the demand for sustainable aquaculture products a search for sustainable non-toxic alternatives to chemical treatment and manual removal of biofouling organisms, such as biological control, are becoming more sought after. In the laboratory experiments Caribbean spider crabs (Maguimithrax spinosissimus) exhibited nocturnal patterns of activity. They consumed between 3.3 and 4.16% bodyweight (BW) of algae in 22-24 degrees C water, and between 5.61 and 8.55% BW in 26-28 degrees C water. Although this species is primarily herbivorous they also readily consumed whole fish (Lutjanus apodus). The spider crabs were placed on a heavily fouled, unoccupied SeaStation 3000 cage offshore of Eleuthera, The Bahamas, to determine their ability to remove fouling organisms. Large crabs (382 g - 1344 g) confined in mesh cages on the outside of the pen effectively removed between 40% (after two weeks), and 90% (after four weeks) of fouling organisms. Crabs were more effective at removing growth than manual scrubbing by a diver. Grazing by the crabs was nondiscriminatory, with no significant change in the proportional makeup of epibionts at the end of the trial. The survival rates of crabs inside the cage varied between 50% and 55% when not including escapees, and between 66% and 94% when including escapees during 3 to 6 month trials, with no significant decline in health status (blood protein levels). The Caribbean spider crab is a good candidate both economically and environmentally for controlling biofouling on aquaculture cages, could be used in multi-trophic aquaculture systems, and marketed as an environmentally friendly seafood.

AB  - Since 1990, the number of livestock in Mongolia has more than doubled. In large areas of Mongolia, grassland degradation is now a problem of national concern. A survey was done of 10 herders in two Soums (Altanbulag and Khashaat; heavily and moderately degraded, respectively) to measure the animals (sheep, goats, cattle and horse numbers, sex and weights) and grasslands (species and biomass) every 3 months from April 2017 to December 2018. Rainfall is mostly in summer and mean monthly temperatures vary from -20 to 20 degrees C. Throughout the study, the grassland herbage mass in summer was less than 0.5 t dry matter/ha, below that considered sustainable for the steppe. Herders had 200-1000 sheep equivalents (SE, 50 kg base weight), moved camps 2-4 times each year and stocking rates varied from 0.5-1 SE/ha. Female animals reached their mature weights by 4 years of age (sheep 50 kg, goats 40 kg, cattle 350 kg, horses 300 kg). Animals only grew over summer, but a significant part of that was compensatory gain in animals >1 year old. Over winter, sheep and goats lost 21-29% of their liveweight, cattle and horses 15-30%. The weaning rate was 43-48% across species. The male:female ratio (>2 years old) was sheep 63%, goats 72%, cattle 27% and horses 106%. All animals are managed in common mobs with no particular control of breeding. Areas where the efficiency of livestock production and grassland productivity could be improved are discussed.

AB  - Novel grazing management practices for livestock and bee health are becoming increasingly crucial in pasture-based farming systems. The effect of pasture type and spring closing dates on lamb liveweight gain, pasture production, botanical composition, bloom density and bee visitation was monitored over 2 years. Total annual dry matter yield (DMY) of diverse pastures in 2020/2021 was 8.8 t DM ha-1. This yield was greater than the DMY obtained from both simple (7.6 t DM ha-1) and legume pastures (6.6 t DM ha-1). In 2021/2022, the total annual DMY of simple (8.6 t DM ha-1) and diverse pastures (9.0 t DM ha-1) was similar. However, the legume pastures produced 27-30% less than simple and diverse pastures. In successive years, lambs grew faster in legume pastures (287, 215 g per head d-1) than diverse (207, 151 g per head d-1) and simple pastures (204, 132 g per head d-1). However, spring liveweight production (kg ha-1 day-1) from pastures did not differ due to the lower stocking density of legume pastures as compared to the other two pasture mixtures. Bloom density (flower/m2) and bee visitation (bees/min-1 m2) were 16 and 40 times greater with legume rather than simple pastures. Bloom density for diverse pastures was also relatively lower than for the legume pastures. Our findings indicated that the diversification of pastures greatly increased pasture productivity, while legume pastures provided the highest bee benefit without penalizing lamb liveweight production in spring.

AB  - Reading another animal's emotional state can enable receivers to anticipate their behavioural motivations, which is important in guiding interactions with that individual. For species living closely alongside humans, the emotional cues that we express can be almost as informative as those of conspecifics. Goats, Capra hircus, can discriminate differences in emotional valence present in another goat's calls, and we investigated whether this ability extends to human speech. We presented goats with a habituationdishabituation-rehabituation paradigm, where they experienced multiple playbacks of a familiar or unfamiliar human voice conveying a single emotional valence (e.g. angry; habituation phase), before the valence of the voice changed (e.g. happy; dishabituation phase) and then reversed again in line with the habituation phase (e.g. angry; rehabituation phase). Over the habituation phase, goats' behavioural responses decreased, showing evidence of having habituated to the playback stimuli presented. Following a change in emotional valence (dishabituation phase), although goats were overall less likely to respond, those that did looked for longer, suggesting they had perceived the shift in emotional content conveyed in human voice playbacks. We found no changes in physiological arousal (heart rate or heart rate variability) with shifts in playback valence. Domesticated goats may have developed a sensitivity to our cues over their long association with us, but the differences in individual behaviour towards the playback paradigm could highlight a role for learning and individual experience in particular in interspecific emotional communication.

AB  - The environmental conditions determining the distribution of the southern eagle ray Myliobatis tenuicaudatus are mostly unknown. We tracked 40 southern eagle rays using a network of 28 acoustic receivers deployed in Coffin Bay and a second array of 6 receivers deployed along the Fleurieu Peninsula, both in South Australia, to investigate the spatiotemporal changes in space use and residency and the influence of biotic (disc width, sex) and abiotic (water temperature, salinity, tides, moon illumination, time of day) factors. We also assessed the efficacy of a small sanctuary zone to reduce anthropogenic pressures. Tagged southern eagle rays in Coffin Bay were semi-permanent residents (residency index similar to 0.35), with a seasonal exodus from late autumn to spring, high residency from mid-spring to mid-autumn, and selection of Kellidie Bay (located within Coffin Bay). Most (67%) rays were detected in the Kellidie Bay Sanctuary Zone, but spent <15% of their time in Coffin Bay within the sanctuary. Individual variation in the amount of time spent in the Kellidie Bay Sanctuary Zone was high, ranging 0-42%. In contrast, tagged southern eagle rays along the Fleurieu Peninsula had high site fidelity throughout the year (residency index similar to 85%). Our study provides new information on space use and movement patterns of southern eagle rays, highlighting that intraspecific variation should be accounted for in future management considerations.

AB  - Compensatory growth represents the ability of plants to counteract the negative consequences of herbivore damage, contributing to the sustainable development of agriculture. Minor changes in compensatory growth due to environmental changes may significantly impact the structure and functionality of ecosystems, especially for agriculture in a semiarid region. However, there is a lack of systematic quantitative summaries and reviews on compensatory growth mechanisms, especially regarding how they might respond to global environmental changes (e.g. climate warming, drought, nutrient variation, and elevated CO2). This paper summarizes the types of physio-ecological responses of plant compensatory growth to defoliation and their characteristics through a systematic review of existing literature. The review shows that damaged plants that undergo variations in morphological and physiological traits, such as enhanced photosynthesis, increased branching, and altered biomass allocation, may mitigate injury or produce overcompensatory growth. Moderate disturbance and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus infection rates are beneficial for overcompensation. I further discuss how plant compensatory growth is affected by global change factors, concluding that adequate nutrients and water supply are crucial factors influencing overcompensation. This summary can advance our understanding of the response patterns and mechanisms underlying plant compensatory growth, which is vital for gaining insight into the regenerative capacity of plants and promoting sustainable agricultural development under global environmental changes.

AB  - Negative human-wildlife interactions are a growing problem, particularly for people living near protected areas and wildlife refuges. In Kenya, African savannah elephants Loxodonta africana threaten food security for subsistence farmers by crop foraging, which can jeopardize conservation efforts if farmers retaliate against elephants. To inform conservation and management, this study had three objectives: (1) to evaluate stakeholder participatory models of human-elephant conflict; (2) to note any novel or under-represented variables in the models; and (3) to deter-mine if there were indicators for assessing the success of mitigation programmes using a biocultural approach. We conducted participatory modelling sessions in six villages in rural Kenya using fuzzy cognitive mapping (n =206 participants). Farmers created group visual models with variables related to conflict with elephants. A total of 14 variables were common across all six villages, with the two highest centrality scores (a measure of importance to overall dynamics) associated with income and feelings of security. Most variables fell into two categories: environmental interactions, and policy and management. Multiple variables such as road infrastructure (drivers) and soil compaction (con-sequences) were identified as aspects of conflicts that are under-reported or absent in scientific literature, as well as potential socio-cultural indicators. The participatory method used is a tool for gaining more refined insights into inter-actions with elephants, with implications for other complex conservation issues or wildlife interactions. A more holistic view of the impacts of human-elephant interactions as demonstrated here can lead to sustainable, co-developed pro-grammes that benefit both farmer livelihoods and elephant conservation.

AB  - Sustainable use of land is central to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). However, implementation of policy targeting SDG delivery can be driven off track by external factors. There is a pressing need for rapid, adaptable modelling approaches to support policy development against a background of dynamic changes in environmental and political conditions. An example is the imminent departure of the UK from the EU (Brexit), which requires responsive inputs of robust evidence to inform decision making. We combine existing agri-economic modelling with well-tested environmental models, driven by farm survey and landscape data in an adaptive, participatory approach to assess potential agricultural sector responses to Brexit. We explore potential Brexit impacts on land use, environmental outcomes and agricultural jobs in Wales, UK, where agriculture is dominated by animal production on grassland systems. Three potential post-Brexit trade agreements scenarios are considered: EU Deal; No Deal; and Multilateral Free Trade Agreements. For each scenario potential changes in animal numbers in livestock systems in Wales are converted to predicted land use change at field and farm scale and combined with national data sources and models to explore consequences for the environment and jobs. Potential changes in grazing animal numbers range between -30% (sheep for No Deal and MFTA) and + 53% (No Deal dairy), affecting 3% (EU Deal) to 17% (No Deal) of agricultural land and creating potential losses of 700 (EU Deal) to 7000 (MFTA) full time jobs. Environmental outcomes are mixed, with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (-1% EU deal to -16% MFTA) and variable impacts on pollutant loads to water (N ranges + 3% for No Deal to -14% for MFTA) across all scenarios. Air pollution is most scenario dependent (+ 11% No Deal to -12% MFTA), and biodiversity showed a mixed response to each scenario. The findings of this study support Welsh government in developing programmes to manage the Brexit transition proactively, mitigating risks to the environment, rural communities and agricultural sector..

AB  - Spiders, abundant and diverse arthropods which occur in vegetation, have received little attention in studies investigating spider-plant interactions, especially in plants which have extrafloral nectaries (EFNs). This study examines whether spiders attracted to EFNs on the plant Heteropterys pteropetala (Malpighiaceae) function as biological protectors, mitigating leaf herbivory and positively impacting plant fitness, through manipulative experiments. Spiders are attracted to EFNs because, in addition to consuming the resource offered by these structures, they also consume the herbivores that are attracted by the nectar. At the same time, we documented the reproductive phenology of the plant studied and the abundance of spiders over time. Our results revealed that the plant's reproductive period begins in December with the emergence of flower buds and ends in April with the production of samarids, fruits which are morphologically adapted for wind dispersal, aligning with the peak abundance of spiders. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that spiders are attracted to plants that exude EFNs, resulting in a positive impact on reducing leaf area loss but with a neutral effect on protecting reproductive structures. By revealing the protective function of spiders' vegetative structures on plants, this research highlights the ecological importance of elucidating the dynamics between spiders and plants, contributing to a deeper understanding of ecosystems.

AB  - Rhinogobio ventralis is a rare fish found in the Yangtze River in China and has significant ecological and economic value. In this study, a bacterial strain (RV-JZ01) was isolated from the livers of diseased R. ventralis. This isolate was identified as Aeromonas veronii based on its morphology, biochemical features and 16S rDNA phylogenetic analysis. The artificial infection of healthy R. ventralis (16 +/- 2 cm) with RV-JZ01 resulted in the manifestation of clinical symptoms, in accordance with those of naturally infected fish. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) of RV-JZ01 for R. ventralis was 6.3 x 106 CFU/mL. Histopathological examination revealed various pathological changes in the diseased fish, including intestinal villus swelling and rupture, hepatocyte vacuolization, renal tubular cell nuclear enlargement and pyknosis, and myocardial fiber fracture and atrophy. RV-JZ01 infection significantly reduced the gut flora diversity of R. ventralis, with the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Fusobacteria increasing, and those of the Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes decreasing. The abundance of Lactobacillus and Streptococcus dramatically increased, and the abundance of Clostridium and Escherichia reduced in the intestinal microbiota of R. ventralis infected with RV-JZ01. Antibiotic sensitivity testing revealed that RV-JZ01 was highly susceptible to 12 antimicrobials, including erythromycin, cefalexin, norfloxacin, furazolidone, sulfonamides, enrofloxacin, doxycycline, piperacillin, florfenicol, gentamicin, and lincomycin. These results contribute to the understanding of pathological alterations in R. ventralis following A. veronii infection, offering valuable data to support the implementation of disease treatment.

AB  - Dental ecometric traits in large herbivores have been used to reconstruct palaeoenvironments, given the known relationships that these traits have to modern environments (such as the negative correlation between hypsodonty and precipitation). These techniques have largely focused on environments in North America and particularly both Eurasia and Africa, and consequently ecometric models have been trained on groups of herbivores that are most significant in those regions today (Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Primates and Proboscidea). The extent to which these relationships are persistent in communities with other dominant herbivores has never been tested. Because South America has been isolated for most of its history, fossil assemblages in the continent contain other clades, which likely have different trait-environment relationships due to their evolutionary history. Quantitative testing of these relationships and tailored regional models for South America, particularly those incorporating dietary information, will improve palaeoenvironmental reconstructions in the continent using mammal communities.

AB  - In semi-arid vineyard agroecosystems, highly vulnerable in the context of climate change, the soil organic matter (OM) content is crucial to the improvement of soil fertility and grape productivity. The impact of OM, from compost and animal manure, on soil properties (e.g., pH, oxidisable organic C, organic N, NH4+-N and NO3--N), grape yield and direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in vineyards was assessed. For this purpose, two wine grape varieties were chosen and managed differently: with a rain-fed non-trellising vineyard of Monastrell, a drip-irrigated trellising vineyard of Monastrell and a drip-irrigated trellising vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon. The studied fertiliser treatments were without organic amendments (C), sheep/goat manure (SGM) and distillery organic waste compost (DC). The SGM and DC treatments were applied at a rate of 4600 kg ha(-1) (fresh weight, FW) and 5000 kg ha(-1) FW, respectively. The use of organic amendments improved soil fertility and grape yield, especially in the drip-irrigated trellising vineyards. Increased CO2 emissions were coincident with higher grape yields and manure application (maximum CO2 emissions = 1518 mg C-CO2 m(-2) d(-1)). In contrast, N2O emissions, mainly produced through nitrification, were decreased in the plots showing higher grape production (minimum N2O emissions = -0.090 mg N2O-N m(-2) d(-1)). In all plots, the CH4 fluxes were negative during most of the experiment (-1.073-0.403 mg CH4-C m(-2) d(-1)), indicating that these ecosystems can represent a significant sink for atmospheric CH4. According to our results, the optimal vineyard management, considering soil properties, yield and GHG mitigation together, was the use of compost in a drip-irrigated trellising vineyard with the grape variety Monastrell.

AB  - The developmental environment can have an especially large impact on life history plasticity in animals, influencing body size, reproductive success, and longevity. This is because developmental processes interact with environmental factors to determine phenotypes such as body size, sexual investment, and metabolic rate, which in turn can influence longevity and senescence. We investigated how natural differences in the larval environment (discarded moose antlers) influenced development time, survival, and mating success of wild male antler flies, Protopiophila litigata Bonduriansky (Diptera: Piophilidae). Antlers become depleted of resources from year to year, as multiple generations of larvae feed within them. We collected larvae that grew inside nine different shed moose antlers, and we individually tracked them in the field as adults. Moose antlers that were more attractive to adult P. litigata also supported a greater number of larvae, suggesting they are of higher quality. Flies that developed in more attractive antlers completed metamorphosis more quickly but did not differ in body size, longevity, or lifetime mating success. This suggests that the observed differences in larval density may, in part, balance the variation in resource availability among antlers. Regardless of natal antler, large male P. litigata tended to live longer and have higher mating success, as found in previous studies of this species.

AB  - The USA is the largest consumer of legally, internationally-traded wildlife. A proportion of this trade consists of species listed in the Appendices of CITES, and recorded in the CITES Trade Database. Using this resource, we quantified wildlife entering the USA for 82 of the most frequently recorded wildlife products and a range of taxonomic groups during 1979-2014. We examined trends in legal trade and seizures of illegally traded items over time, and relationships between trade and four national measures of biodiversity. We found that: (1) there is an overall positive relationship between legal imports and seizures; (2) Asia was the main region exporting CITES-listed wildlife products to the USA; (3) bears, crocodilians and other mammals (i.e. other than Ursidae, Felidae, Cetacea, Proboscidea, Primates or Rhinocerotidae) increased in both reported legal trade and seizures over time; (4) legal trade in live specimens was reported to be primarily from captive-produced, artificially-propagated or ranched sources, whereas traded meat was primarily wild sourced; (5) both seizures and legally traded items of felids and elephants decreased over time; and (6) volumes of both legally traded and seized species were correlated with four attributes of exporting countries: species endemism, species richness, number of IUCN threatened species, and country size. The goal of our analysis was to inform CITES decision-making and species conservation efforts.

AB  - Large sharks shape ecosystems across their geographic ranges and have become a top research and conservation priority. Eastern North Pacific (ENP) white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) aggregations off the United States and Mexico are well described, but their population status is currently uncertain. Population assessments of ENP white sharks are complicated by migrations across international boundaries, vulnerability at aggregation sites, and undetermined mortality levels. While protective legislation exists both in the United States and Mexico, ongoing incidental and unreported catch may undermine assessments and management. Here, access to a clandestine artisanal fishery provides evidence for white shark abundance and mortality in the Gulf of California that has been underestimated by other methods (e.g., satellite telemetry, [by]catch data). Shark size estimates based on tooth measurements suggest abundance of both juvenile and mature sharks in the region, and updated population models indicate the potential for substantial impacts of this fishery on ENP population viability. The data here, fisher-provided information, and anecdotal evidence suggest potentially high abundance at two specific regions, making directed future research efforts feasible in the Gulf. These data demonstrate that cryptic life histories and geopolitical boundaries can still limit fundamental understanding of megafauna distribution, necessitating international cooperation for both research and management.

AB  - The aim of the research was to check whether the healing of bark-stripping wounds of the silver fir tree trunks reduces the share of wood-decomposing fungi, which may be the result of inter-species interactions. The study carried out in Gorce National Park in Polish Western Carpathians analyzed drill holes of sapwood from three types of wounds (fresh, healed and old) on fir trunks with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of 4.0-16.9 cm as a result of bark-stripping by red deer (Cervus elaphus). In the wood of fresh wounds Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl. and Arthrinium arundinis (Corda) Dyko & B. Sutton had the largest share in mycobiota. Phompsis spp. and the species Sydowia polyspora (Bref. & Tavel) E. Mull. and Epicoccum nigrum Link were also isolated. The dominants in old wounds were Eutypa spp., Phomopsis spp. and Cylindrobasidium evolvens (Fr.) Julich. Healed wounds were dominated by Trichoderma atroviride P. Karst, a fungus antagonistic to many fungal pathogens. Such properties are shared by A. arundinis, especially common in fresh wound wood. It seems that these fungi support the process of wounded tree regeneration (healing of wounds) and limit the activity of wood-decaying fungi in old age, which makes fir survival very high. Thus, even a strong red deer pressure cannot be considered the basic factor determining the dynamics of fir in this part of the Carpathians.

AB  - Simple Summary The Theaceae includes more than 300 species of great morphological diversity and has immense economic, cultural, and ornamental values. However, the evolutionary history of this family remains elusive. We integrated 91 genomes and transcriptome datasets of Theaceae and successfully resolved the phylogeny of Theaceae including relatives of cultivated tea plants from both extensive low-copy and multi-copy nuclear gene markers. Bayes-based molecular dating revealed that the ancestor of the tea family originated slightly earlier than the K-Pg boundary (Mass extinction events including the extinction of dinosaurs) with early diversification of three tribes associated with the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. Further speciation analysis suggested a sole significant diversification shift rate in the common ancestor of Camellia associated with the Mid-Miocene Climatic Optimum. Collectively, polyploidy events, and key morphological innovation characters, such as pericarp with seed coat hardening, could possibly contribute to the Theaceae species diversity. Tea is one of the three most popular nonalcoholic beverages globally and has extremely high economic and cultural value. Currently, the classification, taxonomy, and evolutionary history of the tea family are largely elusive, including phylogeny, divergence, speciation, and diversity. For understanding the evolutionary history and dynamics of species diversity in Theaceae, a robust phylogenetic framework based on 1785 low-copy and 79,103 multi-copy nuclear genes from 91 tea plant genomes and transcriptome datasets had been reconstructed. Our results maximumly supported that the tribes Stewartieae and Gordonieae are successive sister groups to the tribe Theeae from both coalescent and super matrix ML tree analyses. Moreover, in the most evolved tribe, Theeae, the monophyletic genera Pyrenaria, Apterosperma, and Polyspora are the successive sister groups of Camellia. We also yield a well-resolved relationship of Camellia, which contains the vast majority of Theaceae species richness. Molecular dating suggests that Theaceae originated in the late L-Cretaceous, with subsequent early radiation under the Early Eocene Climatic Optimal (EECO) for the three tribes. A diversification rate shift was detected in the common ancestors of Camellia with subsequent acceleration in speciation rate under the climate optimum in the early Miocene. These results provide a phylogenetic framework and new insights into factors that likely have contributed to the survival of Theaceae, especially a successful radiation event of genus Camellia members to subtropic/tropic regions. These novel findings will facilitate the efficient conservation and utilization of germplasm resources for breeding cultivated tea and oil-tea. Collectively, these results provide a foundation for further morphological and functional evolutionary analyses across Theaceae.

AB  - Climate change has been regarded as one of the major threats to endangered species, and offers a wide variety of challenges to current conservation strategies. Assessing species' vulnerability to climate change is a critical initial step for improving in-situ conservation planning. In this study, we used MaxEnt to predict the impacts of climate change on habitat suitability for wild camel (Camelus ferus) in the Kumtag Desert both during the current period and projected into the 2050 s. Our results showed that (i) suitable habitat for wild camel was predicted to decrease by 43.81% by the 2050 s; (ii) currently established nature reserves protected 57.86% of currently suitable habitat; (iii) 44.15% of currently suitable habitat was predicted to be vulnerable to future climate change, with a minor increase in newly suitable habitat by the 2050 s; (iv) climate refuge areas amounted to 21,601 km2 and were mainly located in the core area of the desert. Given these results, we propose conservation implications to mitigate the impacts of climate change on wild camel, including intergrating the suitable habitat into the planning of a proposed national park, constructing habitat corridors, restoring water sources, and implementing long-term monitoring.

AB  - Human milk is important for infant growth, and oligosaccharides are one of its main functional nutrients. To enable a systematic comparison of free oligosaccharide and glycoconjugate content in milk from different species, the phenol-sulfuric acid and resorcinol assays were combined to determine the content. Using real samples, the method revealed that human milk contained the highest amount of total, neutral (9.84 +/- 0.31 g/L), and sialylated (3.21 +/- 0.11 g/L) free oligosaccharides, followed by goat milk, with neutral (0.135 +/- 0.015 g/L) and sialylated (0.192 +/- 0.016 g/L) free oligosaccharides and at a distance by bovine and yak milk. The highest total glycoconjugate content was detected in yak milk (0.798 +/- 0.011 g/L), followed by human, bovine, and goat milk. These findings suggest that goat milk is the best source of free oligosaccharides in infant formula and functional dairy products and yak milk is the best source of glycoconjugates.

AB  - The uneven distribution of pig production may create pollution hotspots and severe environmental costs at the local level; however, there is little information available about the socioeconomic driving forces behind the spatial distribution of pig production and its potential environmental costs. Here, we collected time series data (1990, 2012 and 2017) of pig production and multiple socioeconomic indicators from 2333 counties in China to remedy this knowledge gap. Our results indicate that, the poverty level, pork self-sufficiency rate, feed avail-ability per head and environmental pollution risk were all played negligible roles in determining the spatial distribution of pig production at the county level in China between 1990 and 2017. The spatial distribution of pig production was more impacted by the so-called subsidy policy for export of pig to domestic market (hereinafter called pig subsidy policy), which aimed to subsidize counties exporting large amounts of pigs to other counties. In 2017, approximately 181 million head of pig was exported to domestic market from subsidized counties, and these counties received a subsidy amount of US$ 450 million. However, the total environmental cost, considering the human health, ecosystem and climate change damages of nitrogen losses of the pigs exported to domestic market, was US$ 4.5 billion, 10 times of the subsidy. If all the subsidies were fully designated to reduce ammonia emissions from the industrial pig production, the total cost could be reduced by US$ 1.6 billion; however, this was not enough to cover all the damage. Overall, the spatial distribution of pig production was strongly impacted by the pig subsidy policy in China. Applying $400 million of pig subsidy to ammonia emissions reduction could reduce external environmental costs by 31 % and deliver $1.3 billion in socioeconomic benefits. The total subsidy needs to be increased and used smartly in the future to reduce nitrogen losses from the production chain.

AB  - The illegal wildlife trade (IWT) is one of the largest global crime economies, directly threatening species and their habitats, and biodiversity, and indirectly the global climate, and countries' economies. Syndicates operating within the IWT are often involved in trafficking of humans, weapons, and drugs. IWT takes place in large scale through international ports, with wildlife being smuggled inside shipping containers. Current methods to combat IWT and screen these shipping containers, such as X-ray scans, are expensive and time-consuming. Scent-detection animals present an innovative approach to combatting IWT, as animals may be better suited to distinguish between organic materials and less susceptible to visual concealment methods. Previous scent-detection work has largely focused on conservation dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Here, we present a series of proof-of-principle studies training African giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) to detect illegally trafficked wildlife. As initial proof-of-principle within a controlled laboratory environment, we trained rats (n=11) to detect the scent of pangolin scales (Manis spp.) and a threatened African hardwood (Dalbergia melanoxylon). In subsequent experiments, we trained these rats (n=10) to detect rhinoceros horn (family Rhinocerotidae), and elephant tusks (Loxodonta spp.). At the conclusion of these studies, rats (n=7) accurately identified all four target species (although ivory samples may have been cross-contaminated, and results should be interpreted with caution) while correctly rejecting non-target items commonly used by traffickers to conceal the presence of illicit material. Rats detected the presence of wildlife targets even when these were concealed in mixtures among non-target items. These results provide the foundation to train rats for scent-detection of illegally trafficked wildlife to combat IWT. The unique attributes of rats could allow them to complement existing screening technologies in the fight against IWT. Rats have low training and maintenance costs, flexibly work with multiple handlers, have a long lifespan, and a sophisticated sense of smell. Their small size also offers unique capabilities for the screening of shipping containers, such as being able to navigate densely packed areas or be lifted to assess contents of sealed containers by screening ventilation systems. Future directions include assessing operational feasibility of deploying rats at ports.

AB  - Simple Summary Boar taint is an off-odor and off-flavor affecting pork meat caused by the accumulation of three main compounds in the adipose tissue of uncastrated male pigs: androstenone, skatole, and indole. Boar taint occurrence is associated with sexual maturity onset; thus, strategies for reducing boar taint compound concentrations might lead to impaired male sexual behavior. This study investigated the relationships between boar taint compound concentrations and sexual behavior traits (sexual arousal, salivation, mounting performance, interest in the dummy sow, penis unsheathing, and overall libido) scored during training with the dummy sow in 391 young boars. Overall, our results suggest that a weak relationship between boar taint compounds and sexual behavior traits exists. The maximization of libido performances was observed at high levels of androstenone, intermediate or low levels of skatole, and intermediate to high levels of indole, but the relationship between BT compounds and sexual behavior appears to be weak. Strategies to control boar taint (BT) in meat relies on the reduction of skatole, indole, and androstenone concentration. This might have unfavorable effects on the libido of breeding boars. The association between BT compound concentration in backfat and libido was investigated in 391 commercial breeding boars. Six sexual behavior traits (SBT; sexual arousal, salivation, mounting performance, interest in the dummy sow, penis unsheathing, and overall libido score) were scored during the training of the boars with the dummy sow. Variation in SBT was analyzed by proportional-odds cumulative logistic models. Overall, indole, skatole, and androstenone concentrations were weakly associated with libido. Farm of origin, age at training or body weight, and BT compound levels were poor predictors of boar performance (the area under the ROC curve ranged from 0.60 to 0.69). This indicates that BT compound concentrations were weakly associated with libido, even though the probability of observing good SBT scores increased with high levels of androstenone, intermediate or low levels of skatole, and intermediate to high levels of indole. Hence, practices aiming at reducing androstenone, and controlling the concentrations of skatole and indole to intermediate levels are not expected to impair the libido of young boars.

AB  - Explorations in the past 20 years in the Plio-Pleistocene Zanda Basin (3,800-4,500 m above sea level) along the northern slopes of the Himalaya Mountains have substantially enriched our understanding of the paleoenvironments of the Tibetan Plateau and associated biologic evolution. Many elements of the mammalian fauna recovered are either new to science or shed new light about their special adaptations in this high elevation basin. Here we describe a new species of twisted-horned antelope, Gazellospira tsaparangensis, with a heteronymous spiral. Its small size and primitive morphology, such as relatively short horncore with less twisting, thin frontal bones, a lack of frontal and horncore sinuses, small size of supraorbital foramina, and lack of an anterior keel, helps to place it at the base of genus Gazellospira, substantially more stem-ward than the type species G. torticornis from the Plio-Pleistocene of Europe and western Asia. With an estimated age of 3.62 Ma, this also places G. tsaparangensis as one of the early occurrences in Eurasia, although some fragmentary records in Turkey may be slightly earlier. Considering this early appearance and primitive morphology, G. tsaparangensis once again may be a case of the 'out-of-Tibet' model of megafauna origin, with earlier progenitors adapted to cold environments in high Tibet before expanding their range to the rest of Eurasia.

AB  - Knowledge of the role of individual associations has provided an insightful understanding of the structures of animal societies, especially in highly social mammals such as primates. Yet, this is unbalanced towards marine mammals, particularly to beaked whales, due to their elusive nature. In addition, information on the fundamental drivers of the social structure of these deep-diving animals is still scarce. Here, the hypothesis of female defence polygyny was tested in Blainville's beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) and discussed within the context of marine and terrestrial organisms displaying similar patterns, by (i) estimating residency times to obtain information on the movements into and out of the area, (ii) analysing social networks to assess individual association metrics, (iii) measuring the strength of the associations to assess the existence of preferred or avoided relationships among individuals, and (iv) modelling different social structures to address temporal patterns in social relationships. Using a 9-year photographic dataset derived from the pelagic habitat, individual associations were inferred based on likelihood techniques. This approach allowed to infer on the species' social structure in relation to age class, sex, residency status, and spatio-temporal patterns, which can be a good practice to be applied for other taxa. Heterogeneity in capture probability and residency times was observed between age-sex classes, with adult females exhibiting long-term site fidelity. This suggests different habitat roles and spatial structuring within this social organisation. Strong and long dyadic associations occurred between adult females and immatures, contrarily to between males, and the best-fitting models of the temporal patterns suggested long-lasting and temporary associations. The present findings unravel a complex social structure stratified by age-sex class and influenced by female philopatry and defence polygyny, like an unimale group mating system, which varies from other beaked whales but is similar to some birds, pinnipeds, or non-human primates.

AB  - Polygynous males allocate substantial resources to sexual traits and behaviours to improve their chances of winning competitions for mates often at the cost of body maintenance. However, the degree to which males experience these trade-offs can be influenced by external conditions. Studies are needed that assess whether polygynous male resource allocation decisions about life history traits are density dependent. We tested for an influence of density on age-specific life history traits in male southern elephant seals, Mirounga leonina, using a 34-year data set collected at Marion Island. Specifically, we determine whether life history varied with density-related factors for survival, improved breeding success (measured as social status) and recruitment age. This was done by selecting linear models that tested biological hypotheses about density-dependent covariates related to competition intensity during breeding and natal conditions, while accounting for known intrinsic effects such as age and social status. Baseline mortalities were higher for males that had accumulated above average reproductive costs for their age than males with below average costs. This reproductive cost was determined by the number of females per harem relative to the population average. Thus, males likely allocated more resources to reproduction and less to body maintenance at all ages when defending and servicing relatively large harems, and this cost was compounding for males that dominated large harems at a young age. Males born in years with few pups were more likely to be dominant breeders and recruit at an earlier age than males born in years with many pups. Thus, breeding success and recruitment age likely depended on the population density experienced during early life, suggesting lasting effects of natal conditions in a long-lived animal. We show how density-dependent factors interact with intrinsic determinants of resource allocation to determine variation in polygynous male life history with long-term consequences.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - One of the most rational and successful ways to mitigate the effects of wildlife disease is to perform proactive management efforts that can either prevent disease prior to first exposure or detect and eradicate disease prior to its establishment. However, estimating the risk of wildlife disease in new locations is often challenged by a lack of tractable linkages between known or presumed disease hazards and comprehensive risk of introduction and spread. In this study, we present a low-cost approach that estimated comprehensive risk of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Michigan, United States, based on the localized knowledge of experts and the use of existing datasets. We controlled for sources of expert bias, avoided group conflict that may challenge qualitative risk assessments, and generated estimates of risk that aligned with known positives and can be used in targeted surveillance and mitigation efforts. We found that 97% of CWD detections fell within high risk counties, with only 3 out of 117 cases (3%) falling in counties at low risk. Furthermore, we found coherence between indirect expert-elicited risk estimates and direct hazard rankings, suggesting that an indirect approach maximized expert knowledge sharing while controlling for sources of potential bias. Lastly, our approach required limited time commitment from group participants and thus, represented a low-cost decision-making approach. Taken together, our study may provide an opportunity to mount proactive wildlife disease management in a way that has often been promoted but rarely accomplished.

AB  - In this study, the changes in sheep assets in Turkiye as a developing country were examined under the influence of global and national dynamics and crises. Future forecasts were made with the Box Jenkins method. Evaluating the post-1980 period, it is was derived that the factors affecting the country's economy negatively affected sheep production until 2010, then as a result of the agricultural policies put into practice, an increasing momentum was achieved in the sheep asset. As a result of the predictions made with the ARIMA (4,2,1) model, it is predicted that this acceleration will continue in the future. However, the governments' failure to give due importance to the agricultural sector in the 42-year period caused the country to not be able to use its current geopolitical advantage, and by 2021, the sheep stock remained at the 1980 level.

AB  - Canis lupus (hereinafter - wolf) is a top predator specialised on large ungulates. In a community of multiple ungulate species, carnivores may exhibit a preference for one. Due to the decreasing availability of preferred species, interactions between wolves and other ungulates can change. We conducted our research from 2014 to 2019, which included an abrupt decline in the population of the wolf's main prey, Sus scrofa, in the Kaluzhskie Zaseki State Nature Reserve, Russia. We ascertained the wolf diet (scats content analysis) and evaluated preferences using Jacobs' index. The proportion in the diet of two ungulate species, Capreolus capreolus and Alces alces, increased after the Sus scrofa population declined, but the main prey became a non-ungulate species, namely Castor fiber. Wolves did not hunt Bison bonasus, and changes in Sus scrofa populations did not affect interactions between them. The presence of this species in the wolf diet is negligible and related to scavenging. Wolves showed a strong preference for Sus scrofa after decreasing its abundance. Dynamic interactions estimated from camera-trap data, using the coefficient of sociality, partly confirmed with analysis of preferences but also depending on other factors. The coefficient of sociality showed attraction species hardly presented in the diet only in the peripheral part of the wolf home range, where ungulates more frequently encounter subadult wolves. The decreasing population of wolf's main prey influenced interactions with other ungulates to some extent since wolves increased the proportion of them in their diet to substitute Sus scrofa. In the absence of Sus scrofa, wolves tend to prefer middle- and small-sized prey.

AB  - Simple Summary: The lungs are key organs in mammals that shows adaptive changes in response to high altitude, and yaks (Bos grunniens) have adapted their lungs well to the hypoxic environment of Tibetan Plateau after a long period of evolution and natural selection. However, the long-term life of lowland cattle on the plateau can cause symptoms such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, wherein the abnormal proliferation of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells leads to the remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature, which is the main cause of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The underlying molecular mechanisms of lung adaptation to hypoxia in yaks remain largely unknown. In this study, we constructed stably transfected yak cell lines overexpressing PDK1 via lentiviral transfection, and we cultured yellow cattle and yak PASMCs, as well as PDK1-OEcon/OE, under normoxia and 10% O-2 to explore the effects of hypoxia on the PDK1 and TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathways in yak PASMCs. This will provide theoretical data at the cellular and molecular levels, along with basic information to further elucidate the mechanism of the PDK1-mediated TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway in yak PASMCs induced by hypoxia. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of hypoxia-induced phenotype, glucose metabolism, ROS levels, and the PDK1-mediated regulation of TGF-beta/Smad signaling in yellow cattles, yaks, and those overexpressing PDK1 PASMCs using growth curves, flow cytometry, scratch experiments, glucose and lactic acid assays, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting. The results showed that hypoxia significantly promoted proliferation, migration, antiapoptosis, ROS levels, glucose consumption, and lactate production in yellow cattle PASMCs (p < 0.05), and the cells were dedifferentiated from the contractile phenotype; conversely, hypoxia had no significant effect on yak PASMCs (p > 0.05). PDK1 overexpression significantly promoted proliferation, antiapoptosis, glucose consumption, and lactate production in yak PASMCs under normoxia and hypoxia (p < 0.05), decreased their migration levels under hypoxia (p < 0.05), and dedifferentiated the contractile phenotype of the cells. Overexpression of PDK1 in yak PASMCs is detrimental to their adaptation to hypoxic environments. Yak PASMCs adapted to the effects of hypoxia on lung tissue by downregulating the expression of genes related to the PDK1 and TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathways. Taken together, the regulation of PDK1-mediated TGF-beta/Smad signaling may be involved in the process of yaks' adaptation to the hypoxic environment of the plateau, reflecting the good adaptive ability of yaks. The present study provides basic information to further elucidate the mechanism of PDK1-mediated TGF-beta/Smad signaling induced by hypoxia in the lungs of yaks, as well as target genes for the treatment of plateau diseases in humans and animals.

AB  - Climate warming could challenge the ability of endotherms to thermoregulate and maintain normal body temperature (Tb), but the effects of warming summer temperatures on activity and thermoregulatory physiology in many small mammals remain poorly understood. We examined this issue in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), an active nocturnal species. Mice were exposed in the lab to simulated seasonal warming, in which an environmentally realistic diel cycle of ambient temperature (Ta) was gradually warmed from spring conditions to summer conditions (controls were maintained in spring conditions). Activity (voluntary wheel running) and Tb (implanted bio-loggers) were measured throughout, and indices of thermoregulatory physiology (thermoneutral zone, thermogenic capacity) were assessed after exposure. In control mice, activity was almost entirely restricted to the night-time, and Tb fluctuated-1.7 degrees C between daytime lows and night-time highs. Activity, body mass and food consumption were reduced and water consumption was increased in later stages of summer warming. This was accompanied by strong Tb dysregulation that culminated in a complete reversal of the diel pattern of Tb variation, with Tb reaching extreme highs (-40 degrees C) during daytime heat but extreme lows (-34 degrees C) at cooler night-time temperatures. Summer warming was also associated with reduced ability to generate body heat, as reflected by decreased thermogenic capacity and decreased mass and uncoupling protein (UCP1) content of brown adipose tissue. Our findings suggest that thermoregulatory trade-offs associated with daytime heat exposure can affect Tb and activity at cooler night-time temperatures, impacting the ability of nocturnal mammals to perform behaviours important for fitness in the wild.

AB  - The moose (Alces alces; mooz in Anishinaabemowin, Ojibwe language will follow scientific names) is a vital subsistence food source to Anishinabe people of the midwestern United States and has recently declined in Minnesota, USA, with poor calf survival as a contributing factor. Predation is the primary cause of moose calf mortality and we explored whether calf predation rates could be reduced through management of a single predator in a multi-predator system. Thus, we examined predation rates and causes of calf mortality before (2013-2015) and during (2016-2018) implementation of a spring black bear (Ursus americanus; makwa) harvest season, using baits to attract black bears, on the Grand Portage Indian Reservation, Minnesota, where black bears and gray wolves (Canis lupus; ma'iinganag) are the primary predators of moose calves. We validated our early study findings for the 5 years following the initial study with intermittent spring bear hunting seasons, from 2019-2023. The spring bear hunt was canceled because of a pandemic lockdown in 2020, resumed 2021, and was closed in 2022 and 2023. Black bear harvest prior to adding a spring bear hunting season was 0.038 bears harvested/km(2) from 2012-2015, whereas after initiating a spring hunting season (2016-2018) it was 17% higher at 0.046 bears/km(2). We observed significantly lower bear predation (by 68%) in association with spring bear management and no compensatory change in the level of wolf predation. The validation years strengthened our findings that spring bear hunting seasons reduce moose calf predation rates, with an overall 68% lower proportion of bear predation on moose calves in the years when spring bear hunts were held. Mean proportion of calf predation attributed to bears was 4.9 times higher (30% vs. 6%) in the years when a spring bear hunt was not held. Despite an increasing wolf density during the study period, we did not observe a compensatory increase in wolf predation during spring bear hunt years. The results of this work suggest that the addition of a spring bear hunt, during a time when moose calves are most vulnerable to bear predation, has the potential to increase moose calf survival even in the presence of wolves.

AB  - Simple Summary This work aims to analyze flocks' management practices and sheep breeders' perceptions of the impact of climate change to enhance the resilience of the sheep production systems in the Tunisian semi-arid region. The results revealed three main sheep production systems: the agro-pastoral rain-fed system (AGPRF), the agro-pastoral irrigated system (AGPI), and the agro-sylvo-pastoral system (AGSP). Each production system is characterized by specific management and productive parameters that are used by farmers to build resilience actions. However, farmers' climate change perceptions are mostly the same across the three sheep production systems: a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperatures and extreme events, which negatively influence feedstuff availability and costs.Abstract Global climate change inflicts unambiguous risks on agricultural systems and food security. Small ruminants are known for their ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. This paper aims to characterize sheep production systems in a vulnerable agricultural zone and the breeders' perceptions of climate change to apprehend challenges that they are confronting, and formulate resilience actions. The data analysis is based on 94 semi-structured surveys of sheep farmers carried out in the Tunisian semi-arid region. The PCA analysis results revealed three main sheep production systems. The agro-pastoral rain-fed system (AGPRF) is dominant (55%), with large farms and common pastures integrating cereals and fodder. The agro-pastoral irrigated system (AGPI: 20%) is characterized by small-area and forage irrigation (1.8 ha) and a smaller number of ewes but a greater use of animal feed supplementation. The agro-sylvo-pastoral system (AGSP: 25%) is a system where grazing is based on common lands and using tree sub-products, while the agricultural area is exclusively used to cultivate cereal crops. Sheep breeders' climate perceptions are summarized as unpredictable climate events, a decrease in precipitation, and an increase in temperature. Resilience actions principally consist of reducing flocks' numbers, using alternative local feed, fodder, and water resources, and building more shelters and planting more trees in the grazing areas. Nevertheless, cost-effectiveness should be considered in such vulnerable zones to insure the sheep production systems' sustainability.

AB  - Functional responses, the relationships between consumer foraging rate and resource (prey) density, provide key insights into consumer-resource interactions while also being a major driver of population dynamics and food web structure. We present a global database of 2598 standardized functional responses and parameters extracted from the published literature. We refit the functional responses with a Type II model using standardized methods and report the fitted parameters along with data on experimental conditions, consumer and resource taxonomy and type, as well as the habitat and dimensionality of the foraging interaction. The consumer and resource species covered here are taxonomically diverse, from protozoans filtering algae to wasps parasitizing moth larvae to wolves hunting moose. The FoRAGE (Functional Responses from Around the Globe in all Ecosystems) database (doi: 10.5063/DB807S) is a living data set that will be updated periodically as new functional responses are published. Data are released under a CC-By-NC-SA license, and credit should be given to this paper when referring to this specific version of the data release.

AB  - Dense branching and spines are common features of plant species in ecosystems with high mammalian herbivory pressure. While dense branching and spines can inhibit herbivory independently, when combined, they form a powerful defensive cage architecture. However, how cage architecture evolved under mammalian pressure has remained unexplored. Here we show how dense branching and spines emerged during the age of mammalian radiation in the Combretaceae family and diversified in herbivore-driven ecosystems in the tropics. Phylogenetic comparative methods revealed that modern plant architectural strategies defending against large mammals evolved via a stepwise process. First, dense branching emerged under intermediate herbivory pressure, followed by the acquisition of spines that supported higher speciation rates under high herbivory pressure. Our study highlights the adaptive value of dense branching as part of a herbivore defence strategy and identifies large mammal herbivory as a major selective force shaping the whole plant architecture of woody plants.
   This study explores the evolution of two traits, branching density and spine presence, in the globally distributed plant family Combretaceae. These traits were found to have appeared in a two-step process in response to mammalian herbivory pressure, revealing the importance of large mammals in the evolution of plant architecture diversity.

AB  - Most of the literature on the chronic wasting disease (CWD) has focused on the attitudes of deer hunters. Designing public policies to manage CWD requires an understanding of how other stakeholders (landowners, non-hunting public) perceive the risk and react. By surveying a sample of residents in Tennessee, this study compared the concerns, agency trust, and acceptability of management actions among resident groups segmented based on their proximity to CWD presence, hunter status, and land ownership status. Responses from seven CWD counties and four adjacent counties were generally similar, but notable differences were found between hunters and non-hunters and between landowners and non-landowners. Considering that the cooperation from all stakeholders will be critical for the success of a regional CWD management program, it may be important for wildlife agencies to recognize the heterogeneity in preferences and the sensitivity of proposed actions among stakeholders before implementation and enforcement.

KW  - METHODOLOGY
AB  - The distribution of many fishes that occupy large rivers is poorly known, in part due to the difficulties of sampling for them. This is especially true for small-bodied or rare species, such as the snail darter Percina tanasi, 44, 469-488; 1976). This federally listed (threatened) species has a limited distribution in the Tennessee River system in Alabama and Tennessee, where it is known from a few large tributaries or small rivers. In Alabama, P. tanasi was previously known from only one locality, but has recently been found in two additional, widely separated systems. These new records raise questions regarding the accuracy of our current understanding of the range for this species. Particularly, is P. tanasi present throughout the main stem Tennessee River, and is this species dispersing into new areas from source populations in the river? To clarify the distribution of P. tanasi in Alabama, 83 unique sites were surveyed using environmental DNA analysis. This cost-effective detection tool reduces the difficulty associated with empirically sampling large rivers for small fishes. Approximately 42% of sites sampled were positive for P. tanasi DNA. This study confirmed the known localities of P. tanasi in the Bear Creek, Elk River and Paint Rock River. Several new localities were also discovered throughout the main stem Tennessee River and in Shoal Creek, near Florence, Alabama. These findings can inform biologists about where to prioritize conservation efforts and further could lead to studies assessing movement and relatedness between populations in this system.

AB  - Helping behaviour is of special interest for prosociality because it appears to be motivated by the needs of others. We developed a novel paradigm to investigate helping in pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) and tested 75 individuals in eight groups in their home pens. Two identical compartments were attached to the pen, equipped with a window, and a door that could be opened from the outside by lifting a handle. Pigs in all groups spontaneously opened doors during a 5-day familiarization. During testing, each pig was isolated once from its group and placed in one of the two compartments, in a counter-balanced order. In 85% of cases, pigs released a trapped group member from the test compartment within 20 min (median latency = 2.2 min). Pigs were more likely and quicker to open a door to free the trapped pig than to open a door to an empty compartment. Pigs who spent more time looking at the window of the compartment containing the trapped pig were more likely to help. Distress signals by the trapped pig increased its probability of being helped. Responses are consistent with several criteria for identifying targeted helping, but results can also be explained by selfish motivations.

AB  - The research studies on herbarium specimens have unraveled the mysteries hidden in historical treasured specimens, which could not have been possible with the living plants. A plethora of research studies have been carried out on herbarium specimens. The specimens have been instrumental in advancing our comprehension of diverse scientific phenomena, including but not limited to climate change, the impact of the ozone hole, phenological variations, indicators of effective pollination, interactions in pollination processes, antibiotic activity, biodiversity assessments, and the development of evolving conservation strategies. Additionally, they have facilitated investigations into coevolution within plant-insect relationships, allowed for noninvasive anatomical studies, led to the discovery of phytochemicals with commercial significance, provided insights into the migration patterns of plant pathogens, aided our current understanding of the origin of invasive herbivores, and supported research in molecular systematics and evolution. Furthermore, herbarium specimens have been instrumental in addressing issues related to patent claims, among other scientific inquiries. The observations on the trend of research studies on herbarium specimens indicate that several new understandings are likely to emerge in times to come since the specimens are dynamically contributing to the enhancement of the knowledge base. The current review comprehensively covers the fascinating research studies on herbarium specimens, as evidenced by appropriate examples.

AB  - Wild mammals are often difficult to directly observe, especially in woodland and forest habitats with dense vegetation, so surveys of largely indirect signs of their activities (e.g. tracks and spoor) are often a more practical option for monitoring populations. This study compared two different approaches to surveying largely indirect indicators of activity by a range of wild mammals across a gradient of ecosystem integrity in southern Tanzania. Surveys of all such signs of wild mammal activity detected around all identifiable surface water bodies within a 2 km radius of 32 convenient camping locations with perennial surface water were complemented on alternative days with similar surveys along transects between each camp and the next camp that required similar time and effort. For most of the wild mammal species detected, radial surveys around water bodies proved more sensitive than those along transects between them, because the former approach samples distinct and convenient locations that attract most animal species. Transect surveys were found to be more sensitive for only sable (Hippotragus niger) and spotted hyaena (Crocuta crocuta), which are known to routinely commute considerable distances across their home ranges, and for greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) that seldom drink surface water.

AB  - The invasive plant Alliaria petiolata (garlic mustard) has spread throughout forest understory and edge communities in much of North America, but its persistence, density, and impacts have varied across sites and time. Surveying the literature since 2008, we evaluated both previously proposed and new mechanisms for garlic mustard's invasion success and note how they interact and vary across ecological contexts. We analyzed how and where garlic mustard has been studied and found a lack of multisite and longitudinal studies, as well as regions that may be under- or overstudied, leading to poor representation for understanding and predicting future invasion dynamics. Inconsistencies in how sampling units are scaled and defined can also hamper our understanding of invasive species. We present new conceptual models for garlic mustard invasion from a macrosystems perspective, emphasizing the importance of synergies and feedbacks among mechanisms across spatial and temporal scales to produce variable ecological contexts.

AB  - Sharks and rays are globally exploited, with their vulnerability to overfishing leading to many species being classified as endangered. In this study, we combined DNA barcoding and mini-barcoding approaches to enhance the detection of elasmobranch species in processed products. Over five years along the Brazilian coast a total of 122 samples were collected, including fresh fillets and fins, and cartilage capsules from distinct brands. By employing multiplex PCR and sequencing of both long and short fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit gene, we identified 21 species, from five orders and nine families of sharks and rays combined. Sixteen of these species are under some degree of threat, including five critically endangered species from families Rhinobatidae, Sphyrnidae, and Carcharhinidae, listed by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Many shark cartilage capsules lacked proper species labeling, with one sample containing a CITES-listed species, highlighting the urgent need for stricter law enforcement. Notably, this study expanded the use of mini-barcoding and Sanger sequencing, enabling the identification of seven species previously undetectable using this strategy. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a cost-efficient DNA-based approach for monitoring elasmobranchs in commercial products, making a novel contribution to conservation efforts aimed at safeguarding their threatened biodiversity.

AB  - The need to address wildlife conservation outside of protected areas has become more urgent than ever before to meet environmental and socio-economic goals. However, there is limited knowledge about how woody plants respond to herbivory within landscapes shared by wildlife and domestic herbivores in African savanna, thus management decisions might be based on inaccurate information and ultimately be ineffective. We compared woody vegetation dynamics between two adjacent ranches with different management objectives and subjected to varying levels of herbivory by both wildlife and domesticated mammals using 421 square plots of 400 m(2) nested on three transects, each 3 km long and purposively selected to minimize bio-physical differences. Both species and structural diversity were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the site with lower levels of herbivory. Conversely, the site with higher levels of herbivory recorded enhanced biomass production for a selection of palatable forage species, perhaps due to compensatory re-growth. This enhanced biomass however dampens as trees grow taller than the browsing zone. A higher intensity of herbivory seems to promote increases in browsing-tolerant Acacia mellifera as well as homogenization of the vegetation architecture and lower structural diversity. Conversely, low intensity of browsing modified by environmental factors seems to promote proliferation of encroaching unpalatable species which are increasingly becoming a major rangeland management challenge in the study region. Managing landscapes for the co-existence of both wildlife and livestock demands critical analysis of how vegetation responses to herbivory to ensure suitable ecological niches are maintained. To increase browse biomass for livestock within the landscape would demand that dominant palatable browse-tolerant species are suppressed within the browsing zone of majority of browsing livestock kept by promoting appropriate browsing intensity. On the other hand, if the management objective is to promote co-existence of both wildlife and livestock, then the strategy would be to promote structural diversity by varying livestock stocking rate. Given the movement of wildlife between properties, livestock stocking rates should be considered within a wider landscape than just individual private lands.

AB  - Sodium (Na) plays a critical role in the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. In Na-poor regions, plant consumers may experience Na deficiency and adapt by seeking supplementary Na resources. This can markedly impact animal behavior, space-use, and co-existence, with concomitant impacts on ecosystems. Many studies have noted that Na-seeking behaviors, such as soil consumption from mineral licks, are predominately observed for larger-bodied herbivores. However, the mechanisms that drive interspecific variation in Na deficiency and mineral lick use remain poorly understood. Here, we examine whether allometric scaling of Na requirements can explain variation in mineral lick use by herbivorous and omnivorous mammals. We 1) collated data from published literature to derive an allometric scaling of Na requirements in mammals, 2) compared predicted Na requirements to estimated Na intake of mammal communities in three globally distant sites: the Peruvian Amazon, Kalahari Desert, and Malaysian Borneo and 3) examined the relationship between predicted Na deficiency and mineral lick use utilizing camera-trap and mammal abundance data at each site. We found that minimum daily Na maintenance requirements in mammals scaled allometrically at a higher factor (BM0.91 (CI: 0.80-1.0)) than that of food and water Na intake (BM0.71-0.79), indicating that larger species may be more susceptible to Na limitation. This aligned with a positive association between mineral lick use and body mass (BM), as well as Na deficiency, by species at all sites, and increased artificial salt and mineral lick consumption by larger-bodied mammals in the Kalahari. Our results suggest that larger herbivores may be more sensitive to anthropogenic impacts to Na availability, which may alter their functional roles in ecosystems, particularly in Na-poor regions. Further research is needed to explore the consequences of changing Na availability on animals and ecosystems, as well as advance our understanding of Na physiology in mammals.

AB  - The past 100 years of empirical research in ecology have generated tremendous knowledge about the component interactions that structure ecological communities. Yet, we still lack the ability to reassemble these puzzle pieces to predict community responses to perturbations, a challenge that grows increasingly urgent given rapid global change. We summarize key advances in community ecology that have set the stage for modeling ecological systems and briefly review the evolution of ecological modeling efforts to identify critical hurdles to progress. We find that while Robert May demonstrated that quantitative models could theoretically predict community interactions nearly 50 years ago, in practice, we still lack the ability to predict ecological outcomes with reasonable accuracy for three reasons: (1) quantitative models require precise data for parameterization (often unavailable) and have restrictive assumptions that are rarely met; (2) estimating interaction strengths for all network components is extremely challenging; and (3) determining which species are essential to include in models is difficult (model structure uncertainty). We propose that fuzzy interaction webs (FIW), borrowed from the social sciences, hold the potential to overcome these modeling shortfalls by integrating quantitative and qualitative data (e.g., categorical data, natural history information, expert opinion) for generating reasonably accurate qualitative predictions sufficient for addressing many ecological questions. We outline recent advances developed for addressing model structure uncertainty, and we present a case study to illustrate how FIWs can be applied for estimating community interaction strengths and predicting complex ecological outcomes in a multitrophic (plants, herbivores, predators), multi-interaction-type (competition, predation, facilitation, omnivory) grassland ecosystem. We argue that incorporating FIWs into ecological modeling could significantly advance empirical and theoretical ecology.

AB  - Survival and recruitment of offspring are important drivers of population dynamics. Yet, studying wildlife shortly after parturition is logistically challenging and oftentimes cost-prohibitive. As a result, our ecological understanding of neonate survival is limited for many species and management decisions are often made without an adequate understanding of their implications. We developed a model to estimate the overall survival rate of neonates and the timing of mortality (i.e., shape of the survival curve) based on changes in the ratio of neonates to adult females observed in camera trap photographs. We evaluated the model with simulations and provided an example application using North American elk (Cervus canadensis) in Idaho. Our simulations suggested that estimates of the overall neonate survival rate and the shape of the survival curve are accurate when researchers provide unbiased estimates of adult female survival, birth rate (offspring per adult female), and the distribution of birth dates. When researchers can provide a priori values for just adult female survival and birth rate, estimates of the overall survival rate were accurate, but early neonate mortality was underestimated. Our estimate of neonate elk survival in Idaho was consistent with values generated by capture-based studies. Our ratio-based model provides an alternative to traditional methods for estimating neonate survival and does not rely on invasive or expensive capture and monitoring techniques. We believe this method could apply to a wide variety of species due to the ease of data collection and the relatively small number of critical model assumptions. A major benefit of our model is the ability to simultaneously monitor other species in the community, which will facilitate a better understanding of drivers of variation in neonate survival.

AB  - Pastures may act as carbon sources and sinks depending on grazing pressure and management practices. Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and its fractions were quantified under 3 different grazing intensities using 5, 10 and 15 sheep/ ha under sown, improved and natural pastures in the semi-arid tropics of India. Results revealed that after 3 years, improved pasture had significantly higher particulate organic carbon (POC-4.5 g/kg), SOC (-0.53 %), total organic carbon (TOC-7 g/kg) and SOC stock (-15 mg/ha) as compared with sown and natural pastures. Labile carbon (LC -185 mg/kg) and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC -378 mu g/g soil) were higher under natural pasture. A moderate grazing intensity of 10 sheep/ha resulted in significantly greater carbon fractions, TOC and SOC stock. SOC stock and its fractions were significantly higher in the topsoil layers as compared with the subsoil layers. These results indicate that improved pasture management practices with moderate grazing intensity can be recommended for improving SOC stock and its fractions in semi-arid tropical pastures.

AB  - An engineered seawall in need of repair along the Upper Niagara River in Buffalo, NY, was previously identified as a hydrodynamic barrier to the migration of a small but important prey fish, the emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), and its connection to the upstream environs of Lake Erie. This study proposed a novel unconfined fishway design to be incorporated into existing plans for rehabilitation of the seawall at Broderick Park. The proposed fishway was developed using a two-dimensional depth-averaged numerical model, it was explored by placing the target fish into a physical model, and the constructed demonstration project was assessed using field measurements and observations. The numerical model showed that modular baffles attached to the seawall reduced the nearshore flow velocities to about 0.4 to 0.6 m s-1, which was within the acceptable range of velocities for the upstream migration of the emerald shiners. The physical experiments demonstrated that most emerald shiners chose to swim toward, within, or close to the proposed fishway in the presence of higher flow velocities within the main channel region. The proposed fishway design was integrated into the seawall repair as part of a demonstration project supervised by the US Army Corps of Engineers-Buffalo District. Post-construction assessment of the installation showed that (1) the modular baffles reduced time-averaged flow velocities near the seawall and water surface, (2) while very few shiners were observed swimming along the pre-construction seawall, large numbers were observed swimming upstream within this reduced flow velocity corridor created by the baffles, and (3) the structural integrity of the installation proved to be durable and resilient to extremely harsh environmental conditions. This study explored a new approach to fishway design for the passage of relatively small fish in large rivers, and it effectively melded fishway requirements into seawall restoration in concert with the expectations of multiple stakeholders.

AB  - Dust and grit are ingested by herbivores in their natural habitats along with the plants that represent their selected diet. Among the functions of the rumen, a washing of ingesta from adhering dust and grit has recently been demonstrated. The putative consequence is a less strenuous wear on ruminant teeth by external abrasives during rumination. The same function should theoretically apply to camelids, but has not been investigated so far. We fed six llamas (Lama glama) a diet of grass hay and a lucerne-based pelleted food in which fine sand had been included at about 8% of ingredients, for ad libitum consumption for 6 weeks. Subsequently, animals were slaughtered and content of the different sections of the gastrointestinal tract was sampled for the analysis of dry matter (DM), total ash, and acid detergent insoluble ash (ADIA, a measure for silica). Additionally, two of the animals were subjected to whole-body computer tomography (CT) after death in the natural sternal resting position. No clinical problems or macroscopic changes in the faeces were observed during the experimental period. The results indicate an accumulation of ADIA in the C3 compartment of the stomach complex, in particular in the posterior portion that is the equivalent of the abomasum in ruminants. By contrast, contents of the C1, from which material is recruited for regurgitation and rumination, were depleted of ADIA, indicating that the contents had largely been washed free of sand. The washing effect is an unavoidable side effect of the flotation- and sedimentation-based sorting mechanisms in the ruminant and the camelid forestomachs. In theory, this should allow ruminants and camelids to live in similar habitats as nonruminant herbivores at lower degrees of hypsodonty.

AB  - We investigated the influence of seed-feeding beetles (Chrysomelidae, Bruchinae) and their parasitoids on the germination performance of two Fabaceae, Leucaena leucocephala and Senna multijuga. We collected 150 fruits per species in forest fragments in the city of Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil, between July and August 2020. Seeds were examined and separated into predated and non-predated categories. The predated category was divided into two subcategories: predated by Coleoptera (Bruchinae) (PCO) and predated in the presence of Coleoptera parasitoids (PARCO). The non-predated category was divided into artificially injured (AI), intact seeds without insect infestation (IS), and intact seeds with insect infestation (SIF). Seeds of S. multijuga and L. leucocephala germinated to 40% and 30%, respectively. PCO and PARCO seeds not only had a negative and restricting influence on S. multijuga germination (no germination) but also contributed to a large proportion of non-viable predated seeds (38%). PCO (7%) and PARCO (23%), on the other hand, improved L. leucocephala germination. This work represents one of the first attempt to evaluate the parasitoid effect on seeds germination. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the effect of herbivore predation and the presence of parasitoids on host plant seed germination, which can be critical to mother plant fitness depending on plant species. Further studies are necessary to determine the extend seed consumption by beetles and the presence of their parasitoids may facilitate or impair seed germination, and consequently plant fitness in other systems.

AB  - Main conclusionDomestication affected the abundances and diversity of maize root volatiles more than northward spread and modern breeding, and herbivore preference for roots was correlated with volatile diversity and herbivore resistance. Studies show that herbivore defenses in crops are mediated by domestication, spread, and breeding, among other human-driven processes. They also show that those processes affected chemical communication between crop plants and herbivores. We hypothesized that (i) preference of the herbivore (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera) larvae for embryonic roots of maize (Zea mays mays) would increase and (ii) root volatile diversity would decrease with the crop's domestication, northward spread to present-day USA, and modern breeding. We used Balsas teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis), Mexican and USA landrace maizes, and US inbred maize lines to test these hypotheses. We found that herbivore preference and volatile diversity increased with maize domestication and northward spread but decreased with modern breeding. Additionally, we found that the abundances of single volatiles did not consistently increase or decrease with maize domestication, spread, and breeding; rather, volatiles grouped per their abundances were differentially affected by those processes, and domestication had the greatest effects. Altogether, our results suggested that: the herbivore's preference for maize roots is correlated with volatile diversity and herbivore resistance; changes in abundances of individual volatiles are evident at the level of volatile groups; and maize domestication, but not spread and breeding, affected the abundances of some green leaf volatiles and sesquiterpenes/sesquiterpenoids. In part, we discussed our results in the context of herbivore defense evolution when resources for plant growth and defense vary across environments. We suggested that variability in relative abundance of volatiles may be associated with their local, functional relevance across wild and agricultural environments.

AB  - Kangaroo rats in the genus Dipodomys are found in a variety of habitat types inwestern North America, including deserts, arid and semiarid grasslands, and scrublands. ManyDipodomys species are experiencing strong population declines due to increasing habitat fragmentation, with two species listed as federally endangered in the United States. The precarious state of many Dipodomys populations, including those occupying extreme environments, make species of this genus valuable subjects for studying the impacts of habitat degradation and fragmentation on population genomic patterns and for characterizing the genomic bases of adaptation to harsh conditions. To facilitate exploration of such questions, we assembled and annotated a reference genome for the bannertailedkangaroorat (Dipodomys spectabilis) using PacBioHiFi sequencing reads, providing amore contiguous genomic resource than two previously assembled Dipodomys genomes. Using the HiFi data forD. spectabilis and publicly available sequencing data for two otherDipodomys species (Dipodomys ordii andDipodomys stephensi), wedemonstrate the utility of this newassembly for studies of congeners by conducting inference of historic effective population sizes (Ne) and linking these patterns to the species' current extinction risk statuses. The genome assembly presented here will serve as a valuable resource for population and conservation genomic studies of Dipodomys species, comparative genomic research within mammals and rodents, and investigations into genomic adaptation to extreme environments and changing landscapes.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a multidisciplinary approach to assess the ecological status of six moderate-sized French estuaries. For each estuary, we gathered geographical information, hydrobiological data, chemistry of pollutants and fish biology, including integration of proteomics and transcriptomics data. This integrative study covered the entire hydrological system studied, from the watershed to the estuary, and considered all the anthropogenic factors that can impact this environment.To reach this goal, European flounder (Platichthys flesus) were collected from six estuaries in September, which ensures a minimum residence time of five months within an estuary. Geographical metrics are used to characterize land use in each watershed. The concentrations of nitrite, nitrate, organic pollutants, and trace elements were measured in water, sediments and biota. All of these environmental parameters allowed to set up a typology of estuaries. Classical fish biomarkers, coupled with molecular data from transcriptomics and shotgun proteomics, highlighted the flounder's responses to stressors in its environment. We analysed the protein abundances and gene expression levels in the liver of fish from the different estuaries. We showed clear positive deregulation of proteins associated with xeno-biotic detoxification in a system characterized by a large population density and industrial activity, as well as in a pre-dominantly agricultural catchment area (mostly cultures of vegetables and pig breeding) mainly impacted by pesticides. Fish from the latter estuary also displayed strong deregulation of the urea cycle, most probably related to high nitrogen load. Proteomic and transcriptomic data also revealed a deregulation of proteins and genes related to the response to hypoxia, and a probable endocrine disruption in some estuaries. Coupling these data allowed the pre-cise identification of the main stressors interacting within each hydrosystem.

AB  - The ecology and life history of marine megafauna can answer the ecological importance of a region. This study assesses and monitors the abundance and home range of sea turtles, seabirds, marine mammals and the association with coastal miaohabitats in potentially impacted areas at the Rio Doce river mouth, Comboios, and Piraque-acu river mouth after the collapse of the Fundao dam. Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, or drones) were used for megafauna species identification, behavior, population data, habitat characterization, and monitoring of environmental protection areas. The species Sotalia guianensis and Pontoporia blainvillei were the most recorded cetaceans, and the main observed behavior was feeding. Guiana dolphin (S. guianensis) occurs in greater density in the Rio Doce river mouth region, resulting in more than 10 sightings/km(2), while franciscana (P. blainvillei) were the most concentrated Comboios area. The seabirds (all species) had up to 15 sightings/km(2) at the Rio Doce river mouth, the highest density among sampled areas. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) was the most frequently recorded, followed by the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea). The green turtle occurred at a higher concentration at the Piraque-Acu river mouth (above 6 sightings/km(2)). The sites dosest to Rio Doce river mouth and Comboios predominantly showed mud bottoms, while those at Piraque-Adi mouth were mostly reef structures. The estuarine areas showed greater importance for megafauna than marine areas. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ecosystems may suffer from the impact of invasive species. Thus, understanding the mechanisms contributing to successful invasions is fundamental for limiting the effects of invasive species. Most intuitive, the enemy release hypothesis predicts that invasive species might be more successful in the exotic range than resident sympatric species owing to the absence of coevolution with native enemies. Here, we test the enemy release hypothesis for the invasion of Europe by the North American spider Mermessus trilobatus. We compare the susceptibility of invasive Mermessus trilobatus and a native species with similar life history to a shared predator with which both species commonly co-occur in Europe. Contrary to our expectations, invasive Mermessus trilobatus were consumed three times more frequently by native predators than their native counterparts. Our study shows that invasive Mermessus trilobatus is more sensitive to a dominant native predator than local sympatric species. This suggests that the relation between the invasive spider and its native predator is dominated by prey naivete rather than enemy release. Further studies investigating evolutionary and ecological processes behind the invasion success of Mermessus trilobatus, including testing natural parasites and rapid reproduction, are needed to explain its invasion success in Europe.

AB  - Aransas-Wood Buffalo population of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) migrates approximately 4000 km through the central Great Plains biannually, between their breeding and wintering grounds. Whooping Cranes depend on stopover sites to provide secure resting locations and the caloric resources necessary to complete their migration, such as the USFWS-designated critical habitat area in the Central Platte River Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska. This area includes braided river habitat characterized by low-elevation and submerged sandbars, which provide impor-tant roosting and foraging opportunities for migrating Whooping Cranes. We used long-range photography, videography, and behavioral scan sampling to document forage items consumed by Whooping Cranes during an 11-day stopover in this area during the fall of 2019. We identified 3 adult-plumage Whooping Cranes and 1 colt consuming 16 individual vertebrates of at least 6 different species during the stopover. In total, we documented Whooping Cranes consuming 7 Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), 5 ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii), 1 sunfish (Centrarchidae), 1 carp/minnow rela-tive (Cypriniformes), 1 perch relative (Percidae), and 1 Leopard Frog relative (Lithobates sp.). We estimated prey item lengths using the average exposed culmen measurements for adult Whooping Cranes and approximated their nutritional value using log-transformed length-weight regression equations with taxon-specific intercepts and slopes from sec-ondary data sources. We estimated that aquatic vertebrate forage made up a significant portion of Whooping Crane daily energy requirements and provided substantial amounts of calcium, phosphorus, and protein not present at high levels in waste grains also consumed during migration. Additionally, we documented territorial behavior by adult Whooping Cranes during migration and evidence of adults teaching their colt to forage. Our study demonstrates the utility of photography and videography to natural history research and indicates that aquatic vertebrates may be a relatively regular part of Whooping Crane diet in the CPRV.

AB  - Improving the growth and health status of marine fish larvae to adapt to climate change, is crucial for com-mercial hatchery production in tropical regions. This study evaluated the effects of dietary essential fatty acids used for Artemia enrichment on growth, biochemical responses, skeletal morphology, and stress resistance of Asian sea bass larvae, reared at high temperatures of 30 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Starting 11 days after hatch, Asian sea bass larvae, were fed Artemia, enriched with a commercial emulsion of n-3 HUFA for 14 days, at four concentrations (0, 100, 300, and 500 ppm), at two rearing temperatures (30 degrees C and 34 degrees C). The results showed that enriching Artemia with n-3 HUFA significantly improved the final weight and specific growth rate of the larvae fed n-3 HUFA enrichment at 300 ppm, at 34 degrees C (P < 0.05). Moreover, n-3 HUFA enriched Artemia significantly increased the essential fatty acids of the larvae in parallel with the dose of enrichment. Fish fed unenriched HUFA Artemia resulted in significantly higher ratio of skeletal deformities and lower survival rate following an air exposure test than the larvae fed the n-3 HUFA enriched diets. Overall, the findings showed that n-3 HUFA-enriched Artemia diets had benefits on body weight, specific growth rate, and stress tolerance in Asian sea bass fed HUFA enriched diets, even at high temperatures.

AB  - The study of how different breeds adapt to heat stress and the further understanding of mechanisms underlying pigs thermotolerance is of utmost importance to attenuate the negative effects of heat stress on pigs welfare, physiology, and performance. Therefore, this study aimed at evaluating the effects of ambient temperature on performance and thermoregulatory responses of Piau purebred pigs. The Brazilian native pig breed Piau is a fat-type breed characterized by adaptability and resistance to diseases. To achieve our goal, Piau purebred pigs (65 kg initial BW) were allocated to one of the two constant ambient temperature conditions: thermoneutral (22 degrees C; n = 11) and heat stress (30 degrees C; n = 11). The experimental period lasted 15 days (days 1 to 15). Pigs were individually weighed at the beginning and end of the experimental period. Body and rectal temperatures, respiratory rate and blood indicators of stress and metabolism were measured throughout the experiment. Piau purebred pigs exposed to 30 degrees C had lower (p < 0.05) feed intake, body weight gain and final body weight than pigs at 22 degrees C. Feed conversion rate was not affected (p 0.05) by ambient temperature. Irrespective of ambient temperature, pigs had similar (p > 0.05) backfat thickness and loin eye area. Piau pigs at 30 degrees C had increased (p < 0.05) nape, dorsal, flank, and rectal temperatures and increased respiratory rate than their counterparts reared at 22 degrees C. In summary, our results show that Piau purebred pigs acclimation to 30 degrees C of ambient temperature is characterized by increased body skin temperature to optimize sensible heat loss to the environment; increased respiratory rate to promote latent heat loss; and by a concomitant reduced voluntary feed intake to reduce heat production associated with digestion and metabolic processes with negative effects on body weight gain.

AB  - Potato, a cool-weather crop, emits volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which attract the specialist herbivore, Phthorimaea operculella, but also this herbivore's parasitic wasp, Trichogramma chilonis, an important biocontrol agent. What happens to this trophic system when heat stress challenges this agro-ecosystem? We studied how high temperature (HT) pre-treatments influence potato's VOC emissions and their subsequent effects on the preferences of insects, as evaluated in oviposition assays and Y-tube olfactometers. HT pre-stressed plants were less attractive to P. operculella adult moths, which were repelled by HT VOCs, but increased the recruitment of the parasitoid, T. chilonis, which were attracted. VOC emissions, including the most abundant constituent, ss-caryophyllene, were enhanced by HT treatments; some constituents elicited stronger behavioural responses than others. Transcripts of many genes in the biosynthetic pathways of these VOCs were significantly enhanced by HT treatment, suggesting increases in de novo biosynthesis. HT increased the plant's stomatal apertures, and exogenous applications of the hormone, ABA, known to suppress stomatal apertures, reduced leaf volatile emissions and affected the HT-altered plant attractions to both insects. From these results, we infer that HT stress affects this plant-insect interaction through its influence on VOC emissions, potentially decreasing herbivore ovipositions while increasing ovipositions of the parasitoid.

AB  - To maintain species population stability and ensure the ecological safety of internationally important wetlands, it is essential to be able to simulate suitable habitat for dominant species. Here, we describe a suitable-habitat model for wintering geese in the Poyang lake region of China, based on the Maximum Entropy modeling. The spatiotemporal patterns of suitable habitats produced by the model are analyzed by using species occurrence data from satellite tracking and environmental variables derived from remote sensing data. The results show that the normalized difference vegetation index predictor-representing productivity and food availability-made a considerable contribution to model prediction power, while the contribution from terrain data is relatively low. Nearly one third of the area of the entire floodplain can provide suitable habitats for geese during wintering periods (25.50% for Bean goose Anser fabalis and 29.57% for Greater white fronted goose Anser albifrons). More than forty percent of the suitable habitats are located in the seasonally inundated sub-lakes, indicating that such sub-lakes play an indispensable role in maintaining goose habitats. In the sub-lakes, the area of suitable habitats for geese, per unit area, is 1.67-1.80 times than in the non-sub-lake areas of the floodplain. Therefore, the regulation of the sub-lakes during the dry season has important implications for the management of goose habitats.

AB  - Simple Summary Studying the dietary habits of animals helps us to understand the food composition requirements and nutrition strategy of these animals, as well as allows us to explore their resource utilization and relationship with their prey. Due to the difficulty in obtaining samples of the stomach contents of wild boars, there are few reports on the feeding habits of wild boars in karst areas. In this study, the stomach contents of 14 south China wild boars were analyzed by DNA metabarcoding. The results showed that there were 153 genera, 93 families, and 48 orders of plant food sources. Cissus, Dioscorea, Quercus, Actinidia, and Houttuynia were the core plants. The remaining foods were animal food sources, including invertebrates and vertebrates. It is noteworthy that wild boars in different regions also showed different foraging preferences in winter. This study revealed the foraging preference of wild boars under the special forest vegetation conditions in the mountainous area of southwest China, as well as the relationship between the food habits of wild boars and their habitats from the perspective of resource utilization, thus providing a key scientific basis for the prevention and control of wild boars, along with resource protection. Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are extremely common in southern China, but little study has been conducted regarding reporting the dietary habits of wild boars using high-throughput sequencing technology, especially in karst areas, due to the difficulty in obtaining stomach contents of wild boars. In our study, the stomach contents of 14 wild boars in southern China were analyzed by DNA metabarcoding. The results showed that there were 153 genera, 93 families, and 48 orders of plant food sources for wild boars. The main plant food component were Cissus, Dioscorea, Quercus, Actinidia, and Houttuynia. The most numerous taxa of animal food sources were Elaphodus, Amynthas, Chonaphe, Rattus, and Tanytarsus. It is noteworthy that Elaphodus cephalophus were detected in most of the stomach samples, accounting for a large portion of animal food sources. The results showed that there were significant differences in the diets of wild boars in different regions; however, no significant differences were noted between male and female wild boars. Our study revealed the dietary preference of wild boars under the special forest conditions in the mountainous area of southwest China, as well as the relationship between the dietary habits of wild boars and their habitats from the perspective of resource utilization, thus providing a key scientific basis for the prevention and control of wild boars, along with resource protection.

AB  - Identification of conserved genomic sequences and their utilisation as anchor points for clade detection and/or characterisation is a mainstay in ecological studies. For environmental DNA (eDNA) assays, effective processing of large genomic datasets is crucial for reliable species detection in biodiversity monitoring. While considerable focus has been on developing robust species-targeted assays, eDNA assays with broader taxonomic coverage (e.g., detecting any species within a taxonomic group such as fish), can significantly streamline environmental monitoring, especially when detecting individual species' DNA proves challenging. Designing such assays requires identifying conserved regions representing the target taxonomic group, a chiefly manual task that is often labor-intensive and error-prone, particularly when working with large sequence datasets. To address these challenges, we present unikseq2, an enhanced, alignment-free, k-mer-based tool for identifying unique and conserved sequences. It introduces a new functionality to identify sequence conservation among target species, enabling more informed marker selection for applications such as universal primer design. This automates sequence selection in large-scale mitochondrial genome datasets eliminating the need for manual inspection of computationally costly multiple sequence alignments. Herein, we demonstrate unikseq2's capabilities by developing and validating eDNA assays for various taxa, including Osteichthyes (bony fishes), the Salmonidae family (salmon and trout), Myotis bats and Cervus deer. Unikseq2-based eDNA assays allow for accurate detection across multiple taxonomic levels, from genus to class, enhancing the flexibility, scalability and reliability of eDNA tools in environmental monitoring. By leveraging genomic data from public repositories, unikseq2 supports efficient, reproducible assay design, making it an invaluable tool for a wide range of ecological and biodiversity research applications.

AB  - Artificial lighting, including light-emitting diode (LED) illumination, is increasingly being optimized in protected agricultural systems to maximize plant yield and quality. However, it may also cause other top-down and bottom-up effects in these relatively simple ecological communities that also include insect pests and their natural enemies. While some effects of LED lighting on insects have been demonstrated to date, it is not known how they influence biological control of insect pests in practice. To examine potential top-down and bottom-up impacts of LED illumination on greenhouse biological control with parasitoids, we studied the effects of artificially lengthened days on a tri-trophic system in cages and in a greenhouse. We grew plants under a 12-h photoperiod of white-supplemented light with 6 h of additional (1) white light or (2) red and blue light, or (3) with no additional light. We exposed the plants to the pest aphid Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) with or without its parasitoid wasp Aphidius matricariae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), or to no insects. The 18-h light treatments increased mean plant dry mass by 127% compared with the 12-h control without affecting the aphid's population density or the parasitoid's biological control efficacy, under relatively low light conditions. This suggests that insect communities in protected agriculture can be resilient to even drastic changes in their light environment, and that adjusting crop lighting in a manner that affects plant growth does not necessarily compromise biological control's effectiveness.

AB  - BackgroundPig brains serve as a valuable biomedical model for studying brain-related diseases due to their significant structural similarities to the human brain. Furthermore, the long-term domestication and artificial selection of domestic pigs have profoundly shaped their brains, making them an interesting subject for research. However, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing pig brain function and their impact on various phenotypes remains elusive due to the high degree of cellular heterogeneity present in the brain.ResultsIn this study, we profiled 71,798 cells from domestic pig and wild boar cerebral cortex and cerebellum, identifying nine cell types, and integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data to explore cell type-specific regulatory landscapes and oligodendrocyte developmental trajectory. Furthermore, comparative analysis of each cell type between domestic pigs and wild boars indicated that oligodendrocyte progenitor cells may potentially exhibit a faster evolutionary rate. Finally, cross-species analysis suggested that, compared to humans, the proportion of sequence-conserved and functionally conserved regulatory elements in each cell type appears to be higher in pigs than in mice. Studies on the enrichment of genetic variants associated with 15 human diseases and complex traits in conserved regulatory elements across cell types indicated that immune-related diseases were more enriched in pigs, whereas neurological diseases were somewhat more enriched in mice. However, the enrichment of Alzheimer's disease-associated variants in pigs but not in mice suggests that pigs could be a more suitable model for this condition.ConclusionsOur research offers preliminary insights into the heterogeneity of pig brains and suggests the potential underlying regulatory mechanisms. Additionally, we explore the possible impact of nervous system differences on phenotypic changes, which could lay the groundwork for further biomedical studies.

AB  - Background Soil microbial community diversities and compositions are sensitive indicators of soil quality, but little is known about the changes in community diversity and composition of fungi in soils after planting different tea varieties. Methods The differences in soil fungal community between the four tea varieties (Chuancha No.3 (CC3), Chuanmu No.217 (CM217), Chuannong Huangyazao (CN), and C. Sinensis 'Fuding Dabaicha' (FD)) were investigated by high-throughput sequencing. Results Results showed significant differences in soil fungal beta diversity, fungal community composition, and functional guilds in the soils planted with the four tea varieties, except alpha diversity. FD soil had the lowest number of phylum and class but the greatest relative abundance of Ascomycota; this occurred in conjunction with both a lower pH and soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) concentrations, but with a greater bulk density. A lower relative abundance of pathotroph-saprotroph-symbiotroph was detected in both CM217 and CN soils. A higher relative abundance of both saprotroph and saprotroph-symbiotroph was detected in both CM217 and CN soils; these fungal trophic modes had significantly positive correlations with soil pH, TN, and TP concentrations. CM217 and CN soils indicated the highest potential for maintaining the diversity of fungal communities and enhancing soil organic C and N accumulation. Conclusions Soil properties play important roles in explaining the differences in soil fungal community composition and functional guild within a tea plantation system. Over 15 years tea planting, the soils grown with CM217 and CN tea varieties showed better soil quality.

AB  - ContextAnimal-habitat relationships tend to manifest at specific spatial scales. Accurately identifying these scales and accounting for the variance in habitat selection across them is crucial for linking habitat selection patterns to the ecological processes giving rise to them. Although this fundamental issue has long been recognized, it has been seldom addressed empirically in habitat selection studies.ObjectivesIn this study, we investigated how spatial scale influences the outputs of habitat selection analyses. Furthermore, we examined whether the effect of spatial scale varies among individual animals and whether these effects could be predicted via intrinsic or extrinsic factors.MethodsWe used a dataset collected from 485 GPS-collared white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) across three study sites in Missouri, USA to model habitat selection at 65 spatial scales from 900 m(2) to 15 km(2) using integrated step selection functions. To investigate potential drivers of spatial scaling we used multiple linear regression to model how scale of effect, defined as the spatial scale at which model AIC was minimized, could be predicted by intrinsic (age, sex, and home range size) and extrinsic factors (study site, season, mean percentage forest in home range, mean distance to nearest road in home range).ResultsScale of effect varied substantially among individuals, and individual variation in scale of effect was predicted by home range size, study site, and proportion of forest within a home range. In contrast, other intrinsic and extrinsic factors had little to no relationship with scale of effect. Parameter coefficients for forest cover and distance to nearest road varied strongly with opposing directionality of responses across spatial scales, revealing that spatial scale may bias habitat selection analyses. Coefficients were both positive and negative at different scales for an average of 63.2%individuals, and no single spatial scale resulted in the scale of effect more than 9.0% of the time.ConclusionsOur study demonstrates that spatial scale can strongly influence model parameter coefficients, thereby raising questions about the conventional interpretation of habitat selection analyses. We discuss outstanding issues regarding the comparability of results across study sites and the future of multi-scale habitat selection analyses.

AB  - Haemaphysalis longicornis is a predominant tick species in East Asia and infests humans, cattle and wildlife. It is also a common vector for pathogen transmission. The microbial community in tick midguts not only affects the transmission of tick-borne pathogens but also indirectly affects the development, metabolism, reproduction, and other physiology of ticks. There have been rare reports on the effects of different types of hosts on the microbial composition of tick midguts. Here, we conducted a midgut microbiome of H. longicornis collected from tiger and deer by high-throughput sequencing and showed that the relative abundance of each bacterium varied greatly at different classification levels. Haemaphysalis longicornis is a common tick species that carries several pathogens. There are few reports on the influence of different hosts on the structure of midgut microflora in H. longicornis. In this study, midgut contents of fully engorged female H. longicornis were collected from the surface of tiger (Panthera tigris) and deer (Dama dama). The bacterial genomic DNA of each sample was extracted, and the V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA were sequenced using the Illumina NovaSeq sequencing. The diversity of the bacterial community of the fully engorged female H. longicornis on the surface of tiger was higher than that of deer. In total, 8 phyla and 73 genera of bacteria annotations were detected in the two groups. At the phylum level, the bacterial phyla common to the two groups were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteriota. At the genus level, there were 20 common bacterial genera, among which the relative abundances of Coxiella, Morganella, Diplorickettsia, and Acinetobacter were high. The Morganella species was further identified to be Morganella morganii. The alpha diversity index indicated that the bacterial diversity of the tiger group was higher than that of the deer group. Bacteroidota, Patescibacteria, Desulfobacterota, Verrucomicrobiota, and Cyanobacteria were solely detected in the tiger group. A total of 52 bacterial genera were unique in the tiger group, while one bacterial genus was unique in the deer group. This study indicates that there are differences in the structure of the gut bacteria of the same tick species among different hosts. Further culture-based methods are needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the tick microbiota parasitizing different hosts.

AB  - BackgroundWoolly rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis) is a typical indicator of cold-stage climate that was widely distributed in Northern Hemisphere during the Middle-Late Pleistocene. Although a plethora of fossils have been excavated from Northern China, their phylogenetic status, intraspecific diversity and phylogeographical structure are still vague.ResultsIn the present study, we generated four mitogenomes from Late Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros in Northern China and compared them with published data. Bayesian and network analyses indicate that the analyzed individuals contain at least four maternal haplogroups, and Chinese samples fall in three of them. One of our samples belongs to a previously unidentified early diverging clade (haplogroup D), which separated from other woolly rhinoceros around 0.57 Ma (95% CI: 0.76-0.41 Ma). The timing of this clade's origin coincides with the first occurrence of woolly rhinoceros, which are thought to have evolved in Europe. Our other three samples cluster in haplogroup C, previously only identified from one specimen from Wrangel Island (ND030) and initially considered to be an isolated clade. Herein, our findings suggest that ND030 is likely descended from a northward dispersal of the individuals carrying haplogroup C from Northern China. Additionally, Chinese woolly rhinoceros specimens exhibit higher nucleotide diversity than those from Siberia.ConclusionOur findings highlight Northern China as a possible refugium and a key evolution center of the Pleistocene woolly rhinoceros.

AB  - The globose scale (GS) (Sphaerolecanium prunastri Boyer de Fonscolombe) is a sucking insect that feeds on saps of wild apricot tree (Prunus armeniaca L.) in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of northwestern China. It feeds on branches of wild apricot leading to poor growth, leaf yellowing and leaf drop, and sometimes mortality. Since the initial infestation in 2018, all the main valleys of wild apricot trees have been affected, but there is little research on the host's physiological response to GS infestation. We measured the differences in growth between infested and non-infested wild apricots. The results showed that the diameter of shoot branches, the fresh weight, dry weight, length, width, area, and chlorophyll content of leaves, and the longitudinal diameter of fruit, were all significantly less for infested wild apricot trees than for un-infested wild apricot. The branch length of shoots, cross diameter, and weight of fruit also decreased, although the differences were not significant. Overall, GS infestation significantly reduced the growth of wild apricot trees.

AB  - Invasive plants often benefit from a change in eco-evolutionary context, escaping the herbivores, pathogens, and competing plants from their native range. Introduced into na & iuml;ve native communities, invasive plants can spread rapidly, threatening native plant diversity and ecosystem functioning. Increasingly, studies have shown that native species sometimes adapt in response to the selection pressures imposed by an invasive plant. While researchers have periodically suggested using adapted native species in the management of invasive plants, the idea generally has not found its way to the field. Here, we (1) compare the concept to the more established practices of assisted migration, classic biological control, and microbiome engineering; (2) discuss some of the hurdles to practical implementation; and (3) outline directions for further research that would help expose the role of native adaptations in shaping the trajectory of plant invasions.

AB  - Road networks continue to expand globally with predictable effects on ecological systems. Research into the effectiveness of road underpasses and overpasses for wildlife has been concentrated in North America and Europe. In Australia, most studies of underpasses have been of relatively short duration and without reference sites to give context to the measured rates of use. We studied 5-7 road underpasses at two locations in eastern Australia over 2-3years, comparing camera trap detections of animals in underpasses with those at nearby forest sites. Three species of large macropod (wallabies and kangaroos) were frequently detected in the underpasses, with some underpasses traversed 1-4 times per week, and in many cases exceeded detections in the forest. The lace monitor (Varanus varies) was detected in all underpasses, often once per week during spring and summer, and infrequently in the forest. At each location, a different small macropod species, including one regionally threatened, showed a higher probability of detection in one underpass compared with several of the forest sites. The vulnerable koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) was detected infrequently in underpasses and in the adjoining forest. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) had a high probability of detection in a single underpass. The "prey-trap hypothesis" postulates that predators will exhibit increased activity at underpasses as a consequence of prey being funneled. We found the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) had high activity in some underpasses. However, its activity coincided less than expected with the activity of the mammals most at risk to it. Our results provide no consistent support for the "prey-trap hypothesis." Instead, our study confirms the generic value of underpasses for a range of medium-large mammals as well as one large reptile. Habitat adjoining underpasses exert a strong influence on their use and require greater consideration to maximize underpass use.

AB  - Although the postdispersal functions of diaspore (fruit and its appendages) have been reported, little is known about their protective/defensive functions. In this context, diaspores with appendages (persistent inner tepals and/or fruit wings) that experienced predispersal herbivory by insects in natural populations of Rheum nanum were investigated, and the seed abortion percentage, seed and embryo masses, and germination of seeds from diaspores with different categories of insect herbivory were measured and compared. Predispersal insect herbivory of R. nanum diaspores was prevalent in the four investigated populations, but the percentage of diaspores with appendages (persistent inner tepals and and/or fruit wings) damaged by insects was significantly higher than that of diaspores with the pericarp damaged by insects. Seeds from diaspores with gnawed appendages experienced significantly less damage than those with gnawed pericarps. Importantly, we conclude that fruit appendages of R. nanum help to mechanically protect developing seeds from predispersal insect herbivory.

AB  - The effects of different substrates on zooplankton diversity and functional composition in integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems are insufficiently understood. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of the substrates geotextile blanket (GB) and bamboo (BAM), and water physical and chemical variables on zooplankton diversity and functional composition in IMTA ponds. A totally randomized designed experiment with three treatments (two substrates and no substrate) and four replicates (earthen ponds) were performed. All ponds were stocked with Nile tilapia and Amazon river prawn. Zooplankton were characterized based on body size, feeding type, trophic group, and habitat preference. Functional diversity indices (Functional Richness - FRic, Functional Evenness - FEve, Functional Dispersion - FDis, and Functional Divergence - FDiv) were calculated and modeled using generalized linear mixed models considering substrates and water parameters. Physical and chemical variables included dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, electrical conductivity, temperature, transparency, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), and chlorophyll a. Results indicated only FDis was higher in CON treatment than others. Substrates also affected trophic group distribution, with BAM promoting herbivores-detritivores organisms due to increased pond structural complexity. FRic was highest in ponds with neutral pH and low TSS; FEve was highest in high conductivity and low TP ponds; FDis was highest in ponds with high TSS and TP; and FDiv was highest in high conductivity ponds. Functional trait categories showed complex associations with electrical conductivity, which was identified as the key variable influencing zooplankton community structure.

AB  - Measures of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) have been adopted widely as an estimate of developmental instability. Arising from various sources of stress, developmental instability is associated with an organism's capacity to maintain fitness. The process of domestication has been framed as an environmental stress with human-specified parameters, suggesting that FA may manifest to a larger degree among domesticates compared to their wild relatives. This study used three-dimensional geometric morphometric landmark data to (a) quantify the amount of FA in the cranium of six domestic mammal species and their wild relatives and, (b) provide novel assessment of the commonalities and differences across domestic/wild pairs concerning the extent to which random variation arising from the developmental system assimilates into within-population variation. The majority of domestic mammals showed greater disparity for asymmetric shape, however, only two forms (Pig, Dog) showed significantly higher disparity as well as a higher degree of asymmetry compared to their wild counterparts (Wild Boar, Wolf). Contra to predictions, most domestic and wild forms did not show a statistically significant correspondence between symmetric shape variation and FA, however, a moderate correlation value was recorded for most pairs (r-partial least squares >0.5). Within pairs, domestic and wild forms showed similar correlation magnitudes for the relationship between the asymmetric and symmetric components. In domesticates, new variation may therefore retain a general, conserved pattern in the gross structuring of the cranium, whilst also being a source for response to selection on specific features.

AB  - Simple Summary There are few reports on local pig breeds in Guizhou province. In this work, the population structure, genetic diversity, and selection characteristics of three foreign pig breeds and seven Guizhou local pig breeds were studied. Principal component analysis, adjacent tree analysis, and ADMIXTURE analysis showed that Chinese and Western pig breeds had different ancestral sources. Jianhe White Xiang pig (JHBX) had a distant genetic relationship with the other six local pig breeds in Guizhou province and had unique genetic characteristics. The genetic diversity of the JHBX population was low, and the genetic diversity of the remaining six Chinese native pig populations was generally at a moderate level. In addition, we also screened the candidate genes that affect the coat color phenotype of pigs in Guizhou province through selection signals. Our findings will advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying these germplasm characteristics.Abstract The local pig breeds in Guizhou possess exceptional meat quality, robust adaptability, and resilience to harsh feeding conditions, making them ideal for producing high-quality pork. With over 10 local pig breeds in the region, we focused on 7 specific breeds: Baixi pigs (BX), Congjiang Xiang pigs (CJX), Guanling pigs (GL), Jianhe White Xiang pigs (JHBX), Jiangkou Luobo pigs (JKLB), Kele pigs (KL), and Qiandong Hua pigs (QDH). Unfortunately, these breeds face threats such as introduced species and inbreeding, resulting in a decline in population size and numbers. To better protect and utilize these breeds, we employed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers to investigate the population structure, genetic diversity, and selection characteristics of 283 pigs across these seven breeds. Our findings revealed distinct ancestral sources between Chinese and Western pig breeds, as demonstrated by principal component analysis, adjacent tree analysis, and ADMIXTURE analysis. Notably, JHBX exhibited a distant genetic relationship from the other six local pig breeds in Guizhou province, showcasing unique genetic characteristics. While the genetic diversity of the six Chinese native pig populations, excluding JHBX, was generally moderate in Guizhou province, the JHBX population displayed low genetic diversity. Therefore, it is imperative to intensify selection efforts to prevent inbreeding decline in JHBX while further enhancing the protection measures for the other six pig populations. Additionally, we identified candidate genes influencing the size disparity among pigs in Guizhou province through signal selection. Our study outcomes serve as a reference for developing effective conservation and utilization plans for pig breeds in Guizhou province and deepen our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying pig body size.

AB  - The global production of brewers' spent grains (BSG) is 37 million tons yearly. Composting represents an eco-friendly method to manage and valorize organic by-products in a circular economy model. This project aims to compare two BSG bin-composting mixtures (BSG and wheat straw with pig slurry solid fraction, MIX1, or sheep manure, MIX2) and approaches (manual turning, MT, and static composting, ST). The two mixtures' physicochemical characteristics and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were assessed during the process. The evolution of physicochemical properties is reported in detail. Headspace samples of GHG emissions were collected and analyzed with gas chromatography coupled with specific detectors. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were 34.3 +/- 0.03 and 31.0 +/- 0.06 g C kg(-1) fresh matter (FM) for MIX1-MT and MIX2-MT, and 28.8 +/- 0.01 and 31.2 +/- 0.02 g Ckg(-1) FM for MIX1-ST and MIX2-ST. Methane emissions were negligible (all conditions < 0.086 +/- 0.00 mg C kg(-1) FM). Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from composting are affected by the substrate, bulking material, pile dimension, and manure. Particularly, the total emissions of N2O, estimated as CO2 equivalents, were 45.8 +/- 0.2 and 63.0 +/- 0.4 g CO2 eq kg(-1) FM for MIX1-MT and MIX1-ST, respectively. In both composting approaches, MIX2 showed a low CO2 equivalent (1.8 +/- 0.02 and 9.9 +/- 0.05 g CO2 eq kg(-1) FM for MT and ST), likely due to incomplete decomposition. The bin-composting process represents a solution for recycling and reusing organic waste and livestock manure in small to medium-sized breweries. The solid fraction of the pig slurry resulted in the most suitable manure.

AB  - East Asia, being the evolutionary center of Coelodonta, offers a unique opportunity to explore the spatiotemporal paleoecologies of this genus. This study utilized bulk and serial stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses on the Coelodonta nihowanensis and other ungulates from the Longdan fauna as well as two modern goats in the Linxia Basin, aiming to explore the paleoecology of C. nihowanensis at the periphery of the Tibetan Plateau during the Early Pleistocene. The isotopic results of these mammals indicated that C-3 vegetation was possibly a major component of the local environment in the Linxia Basin, which was influenced by a seasonal summer monsoon. C. nihowanensis specimens in the Longdan fauna were possibly mixed feeders, as indicated by the wide distribution of their delta C-13 values and the intermediate delta O-18 values compared to other coexisting ungulates. Moreover, the comparison of the delta C-13 and delta O-18 values of similar taxa from the Linxia and Nihewan basins has revealed spatiotemporal differences in the paleoclimate and paleoenvironments of these two regions throughout the Early Pleistocene. This provides a holistic framework for understanding the paleoecology of the C. nihowanensis. The isotopic results of the C. nihowanensis in the Linxia and Nihewan basins suggested varied foraging ecologies across different sites and time spans during the Early Pleistocene. This underscores the adaptability of the C. nihowanensis to diverse environments from west to east in northern China. By scrutinizing the evolutionary ecological history of the woolly rhinoceroses from its ancestor, Coelodonta thibetana, to its final form, Coelodonta antiquitatis, this study sheds light on the ecological adaptation of this genus from the Pliocene to Late Pleistocene, spanning its migration from the Tibetan Plateau to northern Eurasia.

AB  - The consequences of the introduction of invasive plants for the diet of herbivorous insects have been little explored in nature where, potentially, abiotic and biotic factors operate. In this study, we examined the larval performance of two Neotropical Danaini butterflies when using either a native or an exotic Apocynaceae species as host plant in both field and laboratory experiments. Hosts greatly differ in their amount of latex exudation and other physicochemical traits, as well as in the amount of evolutionary time they have interacted with herbivores. First, herbivore performance on the hosts was investigated under laboratory conditions. Larvae of both Danaini species took more time to develop on the exotic host; larval survivorship did not vary between hosts. Second, first instar survivorship on both hosts was evaluated in two field sites, one site per host. To do so, in both sites half of the larvae were bagged (protected against both abiotic and biotic factors) while the remainder were nonbagged (exposed). The interaction between larval exposure with the use of the exotic host reduced larval survival. We concluded that the combined effects of host plant traits and abiotic factors reduced survival of herbivores in field conditions. Therefore, the performance of herbivores when using hosts of different origins should be considered together with the multiple ecological factors found in natural environments, as these factors can modify the result of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB  - Soil-borne pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc attacks several crops in Morocco. Studies were initiated to assess the potential of soil solarization, alone or combined with two organic amendments, namely compost and sheep manure, on the viability of S. rolfsii sclerotia. In the 4 and 6 weeks microplots experiment the highest soil temperature recorded was 59.3 degrees C in the solarized plots. Treatments from solarized plots with compost was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced germination and viability of sclerotia than other treatments, with a germination reduction rate of sclerotia (GRRS) of 100%, 93.4% and 53.6% at 5, 10 and 20 cm soil depth respectively. The field trial lasted 2 months and the germination rate of sclerotia (GRS) of plots solarized with compost, with sheep manure and those non-solarized/non-amended was 10.25%, 15.38% and 80.19% respectively. The results suggest that soil solarization combined with organic amendments proves to be effective in the control of S. rolfsii.

AB  - The seasonal use of caves by bats can be attributed to physiologically demanding activities like mating and reproduction in spring and torpor in winter. Cave use, however, varies within and across species and can depend on the physical and microclimatic conditions of the caves. Understanding the current patterns and predictors of cave use is therefore crucial to develop a reference for assessing the response of bats to future changes in climatic conditions. We quantified the diversity and abundance of bats in 41 caves that varied in structure and temperature across a seasonal (mid-winter, late-winter and early-spring) and an elevational (400-2700 m above sea level) gradient in the central Himalayas. Richness and abundance of bat species exhibited seasonal variation, with more species and individuals present in caves during early-spring (n = 15) compared to mid-winter (n = 9). Species richness declined linearly with elevation in mid-winter but remained relatively similar until 900 msl and then declined in late-winter and early-spring. Species such as Hipposideros armiger (20.14 +/- 1.60 degrees C in spring and 17.97 +/- 0.88 degrees C in mid-winter), Rhinolophus affinis (19.98 +/- 1.76 degrees C in spring and 16.18 +/- 3.09 degrees C in mid-winter) and Rhinolophus cf. pusillus (19.55 +/- 1.64 degrees C in spring and 15.43 +/- 2.87 degrees C in mid-winter) preferred warmer microclimates within caves during early-spring compared to mid-winter. The season- and species-specific cave use that we report here suggests that even minor fluctuations in cave temperatures could potentially alter the composition of bat communities inside caves. Prioritization assessment based on a bat cave vulnerability index indicates that different caves must be protected based on their specific usage patterns and the abundance of species they support at various times. Overall, we highlight the importance of studying cave-dwelling bats in climate-vulnerable areas such as the Himalayas where species richness is high to help understand and predict the responses of animals to climate change.

AB  - Overwintering is important for the survival of northern mammals, and northern ungulates deposit body fat. Researchers have interpreted fat deposition as an adaptation to food shortages during winter. However, it is likely that reproductive activities also affect fat deposition. We compared kidney fat indices (KFIs) of sika deer (Cervus nippon) between the northern and southern populations in Japan. In the northern population, the KFIs of adult males and females peaked during summer and autumn, respectively. In adult males, the KFIs abruptly declined during the rut (October), while in yearling males and fawns, they were low in summer. In the southern population, KFIs of adult males were high in summer but decreased in October. KFIs of adult females were low and increased in December-January. KFIs of fawns were low. These results suggest that most classes of the southern population did not deposit much fat during the summer except for adult males. The result that southern adult males displayed as much fat deposition as the northern males suggests that body fat was deposited not only for overwintering but also for reproductive activity of adult males.

AB  - Lions have long been perceived as Africa's, if not the world's, most fearsome terrestrial predator,(1-9 )the "king of beasts". Wildlife's fear of humans may, however, be far more powerful and all-prevailing(1,10) as recent global surveys show that humans kill prey at much higher rates than other predators,(10-12) due partly to technologies such as hunting with dogs or guns(.11,13-15 )We comprehensively experimentally tested whether wildlife's fear of humans exceeds even that of lions, by quantifying fear responses1 in the majority of carnivore and ungulate species (n = 19) inhabiting South Africa's Greater Kruger National Park (GKNP),(9,15-17 )using automated camera-speaker systems(9,18) at waterholes during the dry season that broadcast playbacks of humans, lions, hunting sounds (dogs, gunshots) or non-predator controls (birds).(9,19-22) Fear of humans significantly exceeded that of lions throughout the savanna mammal community. As a whole (n = 4,238 independent trials), wildlife were twice as likely to run (p < 0.001) and abandoned waterholes in 40% faster time (p < 0.001) in response to humans than to lions (or hunting sounds). Fully 95% of species ran more from humans than lions (significantly in giraffes, leopards, hyenas, zebras, kudu, warthog, and impala) or abandoned waterholes faster (significantly in rhinoceroses and elephants). Our results greatly strengthen the growing experimental evidence that wildlife worldwide fear the human "super predator"far more than other predators,(1,19-28) and the very substantial fear of humans demonstrated can be expected to cause considerable ecological impacts,(1,6,22-24,29-35) presenting challenges for tourism-dependent conservation,(1,36,37 )particularly in Africa,(38,39 )while providing new opportunities to protect some species.(1,22,40)

AB  - Intercropping, a well-established agroecological technique designed to bolster ecological stability, has been shown to have a significant impact on soil health. However, the specific effects of tea/Trachelospermum jasminoides intercropping on the physicochemical properties and functional microbial community structure in practical cultivation have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we utilized high-throughput sequencing technology on the 16S/ITS rDNA genes to assess the impact of tea intercropping with T. jasminoides on the composition, diversity, and potential functions of the soil microbial community in tea gardens. The results indicated that the tea/T. jasminoides intercropping system significantly increased pH levels, soil organic matter, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and enzyme activity, ultimately augmenting soil nutrient levels. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of the bacterial co-occurrence network and topological structure portrayed a more intricate and interconnected soil bacterial community in tea gardens. Remarkably, the abundance of beneficial genera, including Burkholderia, Mesorhizobium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma, underwent a substantial increase, whereas the relative abundance of pathogenic fungi such as Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Curvularia experienced a marked decline. Functional predictions also indicated a notable enhancement in the abundance of microorganisms associated with nitrogen and carbon cycling processes. In summary, the intercropping of tea and T. jasminoides holds the potential to enrich soil nutrient content, reshape the microbial community structure, bolster the abundance of functional microorganisms, and mitigate the prevalence of pathogenic fungi.

AB  - Rising numbers of wild ungulates in human-dominated landscapes of Europe can induce negative effects like damages to forests. Therefore, effective wildlife management, including harvesting through hunting is becoming increasingly important. However, current hunting practices often fail to diminish those negative effects, as many ungulate species retreat to areas unsuitable for hunting. This predator-avoidance behaviour makes it difficult to fulfill the demand of reducing population numbers. Thus, there is an urgent need for innovative and effective wildlife management tools to counteract this problem. Here we provide for the first time a hunting suitability model for wild ungulate management in mountainous landscapes to visualise hunting suitability objectively and realistically. Using red deer as a model species, we modelled hunting suitability with high spatial resolution (10 x 10 m), based on remote sensing information, field surveys and expert knowledge of professional hunters. We analysed spatio-temporal habitat selection by radio-collared deer in relation to locations of varying hunting suitability. The suitability of various locations regarding hunting influenced the spatio-temporal habitat selection by this species, consistent with our hypothesis. Red deer avoided areas suitable for hunting during daylight hours in the hunting season, but not during the night. This species seems to perceive a landscape of heterogeneous anthropogenic predation risk, shaped by locations of various hunting suitability, as we modelled it. This confirms the empirical realism of the model. Concerning wild ungulate management, our hunting suitability model provides high-resolution predictions of where species like red deer will retreat when perceived anthropogenic predation risk increases. The model also yields useful insights regarding the hunting suitability of particular locations, which is valuable information especially for non-locals. Furthermore, the model can serve as planning tool to inform decisions about where particular hunting strategies can be performed most efficiently to manage wild ungulates and therefore minimize human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - Field studies in post-mining sites on epigeic invertebrate groups are scarce despite their importance in pedogenesis and ecosystem multifunctionality. This research investigated the diversity, abundance and succession of aboveground invertebrates in a rehabilitated Pb/Zn tailings chronosequence of 5, 20 and 35 years. The study also explored the trophic relationship of selected arthropods and characterized the nitrogen (N) cycle using stable isotope measurements. The abundance and species richness in most investigated groups and the dominance index Berger-Parker (BP) of aboveground invertebrates increased with rehabilitation age from 0.17 BP in early to 0.31 BP in late stage. Elemental and stable isotope ratio analysis showed that N and C soil content increased and the C/N ratio decreased with age, yet despite this increased N availability in the system, the maturing N-cycle used N efficiently. The lack of large N losses from the system despite substantial atmospheric deposition inputs was indicated by the fact that N isotope ratios (delta 15N) in plants and animals became significantly more negative with rehabilitation age, -6.0 delta 15N for plants, -5.0 delta 15N for herbivores and 3.0 delta 15N for carnivores. The length of the invertebrate food chain expanded by more than half a trophic level (2.7 parts per thousand delta 15N) for top predator Coleoptera from early to late stage, probably reflecting more complex food webs including intra-guild predation in older communities. In conclusion, delta 15N measurements in plants and animals provided novel insights into the N-cycle, accumulative N flows and the trophic position in post-mining sites. It is proposed that isotope ratio measurements could be used as easy-to-measure, integrating indicators of nutrient cycling and the soil food web complexity of rehabilitated mine tailings and similar soil ecosystems.

AB  - A lack of co-evolved defensive mechanisms can make organisms especially vulnerable to invasive predators. Bosmina longirostris is an herbivorous zooplankton known to change morphology as an inducible defense mechanism against the native predatory invertebrate Leptodora kindtii. In 1999, Cercopagis pengoi, another predatory zooplankton, invaded six of the eleven New York Finger Lakes in which both L. kindtii and B. longirostris co-occur. This created a natural experiment for studying C. pengoi's (1) influence on the presence of B. longirostris' long morphological form, a known inducible defense against predation by native L. kindtii, (2) consumption rates of B longirostris using mass-balance equations for several prey preference scenarios, and (3) overlap with the native predatory cladoceran L. kindtii. Bosmina longirostris densities were lower in the invaded Finger Lakes and exhibited more long form morphology, with longer percent relative mucro lengths, than in non-invaded lakes (Mann Whitney, p = 0.006). The percent relative mucro length was positively correlated with predator densities, particularly those of C. pengoi (Spearman, r = 0.812, p < 0.001), consistent with C. pengoi predation on B. longirostris as a potential driver of this inducible defense expression. Mass balance calculations estimated predation by C. pengoi could reduce B. longirostris densities by 10-100% during peak C. pengoi densities if the latter only consumed the former or preferentially selected large zooplankton from the available prey assemblage. Additionally, C. pengoi and L. kindtii populations overlapped temporally in the invaded lakes, suggesting that their prey species were abundant enough to support both populations. This study indicates that (1) B. longirostris likely produce an inducible defense protective against native predators in response to invasive C. pengoi, and (2) C. pengoi distribution overlaps with L. kindtii in invaded lakes.

AB  - Simple Summary Mitragyna speciosa is an herbaceous plant found mostly in Thailand's southern regions. This plant has phytonutrient elements that may be beneficial to ruminants. We observed that giving Mitragyna leaf powder to growing goats improved meat quality by increasing hot carcass weight, longissimus muscle area, oleic acid content, and protein content. As a result, Mitragyna leaf supplementation for small ruminant production may become a viable alternative feed additive in the future. The objective of this study was to see how dried Mitragyna speciosa Korth leaves (DKTL) affected growth, hematological parameters, carcass characteristics, muscle chemical composition, and fatty acid profile in finishing goats. In a randomized complete block design, twenty crossbred males (Thai Native x Boer) weaned goats (17.70 +/- 2.50 kg of initial body weight (BW)) were provided to the experimental animals (5 goats per treatment) for 90 days. Individual dietary treatments of 0, 2.22, 4.44, and 6.66 g/d of DKTL on a dry matter basis were given to the goats. The diets were provided twice daily as total mixed rations ad libitum. In comparison to the control diet, DKTL supplementation had no effect on BW, average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), carcass composition, meat pH, or meat color (p > 0.05). After DKTL treatment, the hot carcass weight, longissimus muscle area, oleic acid (C18:1n9), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and protein content increased, but saturated fatty acids (SFA) and ether extract decreased (p < 0.05). To summarize, DKTL supplementation can improve goat meat quality.

AB  - We conducted a series of studies to assess the effectiveness of an electric barrier in deterring the movements of freshwater fish. Fish responses (detections center dot individual(-1)center dot hr(-1) within the 3 m exclusion zone) were quantified for a mixed assemblage of native and nonnative fishes within 0.4 ha ponds. Additionally, we mapped the surface voltages generated by the electric barrier in a nearby stream. The electric barrier (operated at 10 kW) was effective at deterring native and invasive fishes, as > 99% of all fish detections within the exclusion zone occurred while the electric barrier was off. However, some fish detections occurred while the system was operated at full power, indicating the electric barrier was not 100% effective. A follow-up study found that fish responses differed between low (3.6 kW), medium (6.6 kW), and high (10 kW) field strengths, with smallmouth buffalo Ictiobus bubalus exhibiting a greater sensitivity to the low setting than bighead carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and silver carp H. molitrix. Maps of the surface voltages within a nearby stream indicated that the electric barrier was strong enough to deter silver carp (> 1 V/cm). However, the surface voltages quickly dissipated upstream and downstream of the electrodes. Overall, the electric barrier appears to be an effective tool that can be used to combat the spread of invasive fishes in freshwater environments. However, more evaluations are needed to test how the system performs in different conditions and to identify whether fish of varying sizes or life stages respond similarly.

AB  - The myxozoan Henneguya ictaluri is cited as the cause of proliferative gill disease (PGD) in Channel Catfish Ictalurus punctatus and Channel x Blue Catfish I. furcatus hybrids. Differences in host susceptibility result in decreased transmission rates, reduced sporogenesis, and lesser incidence of PGD in hybrid catfish. In experimental pond trials, continuous monoculture of hybrid catfish suppressed H. ictaluri abundance in pond systems compared to Channel Catfish monoculture. The present study examined differences in myxozoan community structure in catfish ponds stocked with Channel Catfish or hybrid catfish. Experimental ponds (0.4 ha) dedicated to Channel Catfish or hybrid catfish monoculture were maintained over three production cycles. Pond water collected during the spring of each year was subjected to metagenomic analysis by targeted amplicon sequencing of a diagnostic hypervariable region (DVR3) of the myxozoan 18S ribosomal RNA gene. Relative abundance of H. ictaluri was significantly greater in Channel Catfish ponds than in hybrid catfish ponds during years 2 and 3. In hybrid catfish ponds, H. ictaluri never exceeded 20% average relative abundance. Hybrid catfish ponds also revealed decreased myxozoan diversity and species evenness compared to Channel Catfish ponds, suggesting that myxozoan taxa associated with Channel Catfish may not be well adapted to the hybridized host. Results corroborate previous research indicating that hybrid catfish monoculture can suppress H. ictaluri compared to ponds that are devoted to Channel Catfish. These data imply that alternating catfish culture species in ponds (crop rotation) has the potential to mitigate PGD by precluding H. ictaluri from accumulating within ponds to levels associated with disease and catastrophic loss. Further, this work identified numerous previously unidentified taxa present within these systems that clustered phylogenetically with both catfish and noncatfish hosts. The impacts that these other myxozoans have on catfish health and production are unknown, but their presence indicates that myxozoan diversity within catfish aquaculture ponds has been greatly underestimated and is significantly influenced by stocking choice.

AB  - Soil microbial mutualists like rhizobia bacteria can promote the establishment of rare, late-successional legumes. Despite restoration efforts, these mutualists are often absent in the microbiome. Therefore, restoring this mutualism by directly inoculating rare legumes with rhizobia mutualists may increase plant establishment. We inoculated seedlings of Amorpha canescens, Dalea purpurea, and Lespedeza capitata with three strains of species-specific rhizobia each to investigate how this mutualism would promote growth in the field and in the greenhouse. Because many herbaceous plants are vulnerable to herbivory, we used exclosures for half of our field transplantations to prevent mammalian herbivory. We did not find that rhizobia bacteria directly promoted the growth of our legumes in the field but rather that herbivory and environmental conditions overwhelmed the effects of the rhizobia. Of the plants transplanted, only 17.78% of 180 survived to the end of the growing season, all of which were protected from herbivory. Survival at the end of the growing season was also greater in the northern, drier end of the field site. In the second growing season, plants were more likely to survive in the exclosure treatment, while only four recovered in the open treatment. In the greenhouse, we found increased nodulation with inoculations, supporting the hypothesis that species-specific mutualists are absent from restoration sites. Though several recent studies have shown that restoring mutualistic interactions has the potential to dramatically improve the outcomes of ecological restoration, our results show that protecting rare species from herbivory after transplantation might achieve greater gains in establishment.

AB  - Many species rear offspring in fixed sites, returning frequently to provision them, and the selection of these sites is a critical decision in the life cycle, as they may in some instances increase susceptibility to predators. African wild dogs are a groupliving large carnivore that rear their offspring in fixed sites, provisioning dependent pups in dens for 3 months post-birth. Where possible, African wild dogs select den sites in rocky terrain, and it is hypothesised that this is because lions, their main predators, generally avoid this habitat. In the Okavango Delta, Botswana, there is a lack of rocky terrain, providing an opportunity to assess whether lions drive den site selection. GPS collar data from 7 impala and 4 lions revealed that both species prefer to reside in grassland and mixed woodland habitats, demonstrating that these are high risk/reward areas for African wild dogs. Using GPS collar data from 16 African wild dog packs over 8 years, our study characterised 116 African wild dog den sites identified in the field. Packs showed a preference for denning in mopane woodland, which lions avoid, and packs commuted further from the den each day as the den's distance to grassland and mixed woodland increased, suggesting a preference for hunting in this habitat. Our results suggest that African wild dogs trade-off the costs of commuting and predation risk, such that longer commuting costs confer increased safety. Significance statement Species which utilise dens, nests, or other fixed sites to rear offspring must balance the need to protect their young from predators with the need to acquire resources for themselves and their young. The selection of den sites is expected to be of considerable importance to enable the animal to meet these two requirements and successfully raise young. Our study of African wild dogs indicates that they select dens in resource-scarce areas which are likely to minimise interactions with their main predator, lions. This increases the distance to prey-rich areas and therefore the cost of hunting. Availability of appropriate habitat for both hunting and denning is therefore important when considering landscapes appropriate for African wild dog conservation, energetic constraints of breeding, and home-range indices.

AB  - Organic fertilizer can alleviate soil degradation. While numerous studies have explored the immediate impacts of organic fertilizer on soil properties and crop production, the legacy effects of organic fertilizer addition remain less understood. This research investigated the subsequent effects of organic fertilizer addition during the winter wheat season on soil microbial community structure, co-occurrence networks, soil function, and summer maize yield from 2018 to 2020. Six fertilization treatments were implemented as chemical nitrogen fertilizer (N) alone or combined sheep manure and nitrogen fertilizer (SMN) at low, medium, and high fertilization levels during the winter wheat season, with only N fertilizer applied during the maize season. The findings revealed significant variations in bacterial and fungal community structures between the SMN and N treatments. The SMN treatments increased the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes and decreased the relative abundance of Rokubacteria, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi, and Nitrospirae compared to the N treatment. The SMN treatments had higher fungal network connectivity and lower mean path distance and modularity than the N treatment, resulting in heightened sensitivity of fungi to environmental changes. The legacy effects of organic fertilizer changed the functional potential of the N and C cycles, with keystone taxa such as Proteobacteria, Actinomycetes, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroides, and Ascomycota significantly correlating with functional genes related to the C and N cycles. Surprisingly, no significant differences in summer maize yield occurred between the SMN and N treatments. However, the random forest model revealed that the SMN treatments had significantly higher explanatory power of soil microbial community structure for maize yield (74.31%) than the N treatment (13.07%). These results were corroborated in subsequent studies and un-derscore the legacy effects of organic fertilizer addition on soil microbial communities. This research offers valuable insights into organic fertilizer use for enhancing soil quality and sustaining agricultural productivity.

AB  - The West African giraffe is restricted to Niger, but historically it inhabited much of the Sudano-Sahelian zone. The population is concentrated in the 'Giraffe Zone' (GZ), an unprotected area with a high human population density. Since the mid-1990s, the giraffe population has steadily increased mainly due to the collective social and conservation initiatives of the government, non-governmental organizations and the local community. In 2018, the first West African giraffe satellite population was established through the reintroduction of eight individuals into Gadabedji Biosphere Reserve (GBR). In this study, we aimed to describe the current state of human-giraffe coexistence, human attitudes towards giraffe and human habits of natural resources use through a questionnaire survey conducted in the GZ and GBR. Although most of the GZ respondents highlighted crop damage caused by giraffe, we also found overall positive attitudes towards the animals. Most respondents from both sites expressed positive attitudes towards giraffe, highlighting that they do not see poaching as a major current threat. However, the giraffe population continues to be directly threatened by habitat loss through firewood cutting, livestock overgrazing and agriculture expansion. Long-term conservation of the West African giraffe is dependent on better habitat protection and understanding of current human-giraffe coexistence through ensuring that giraffe presence will benefit local communities across their range.

AB  - Tibetan sheep are indigenous to the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau. Owing to the harsh hypoxic environment in this plateau, the hemoglobin (Hb) protein in Tibetan sheep has undergone adaptive changes over time. Hb is primarily responsible for transporting O2 and CO2 between the lungs and other tissues of the body. The alpha subunit of Hb, encoded by the HBA gene, is a crucial component of the protein. However, whether variations in the HBA gene sequence affect the adaptation of Tibetan sheep to high-altitude hypoxia remains unclear. In this study, we sequenced the HBA gene and identified three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These SNPs were genotyped in Tibetan and Hu sheep using Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP). The results showed that the frequencies of the AT genotype and H1H2 haplotype were higher in Tibetan sheep than in Hu sheep. Individuals with the AT genotype exhibited higher P50 levels, whereas those with the H1H2 haplotype exhibited lower PO2 and SaO2 levels. The higher P50 levels indicated that O2 was more readily released from oxygenated Hb into the tissues, with the lower PO2 and SaO2 levels facilitating this process. These findings indicate that variations in the HBA gene sequence contribute to enhancing O2 transfer efficiency in Tibetan sheep.

AB  - Concentrations of microplastics in aquatic environments continue to rise due to industrial production and pollution. While there are various concerns regarding potential deleterious effects of microplastics on ecosys-tems, several knowledge gaps remain, including the potential for microplastics to directly and indirectly affect biotic interactions and food web dynamics. We explored the effects of environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations on two co-exposed species of herbaceous freshwater crustaceous zooplankton, filter feeding Daphnia dentifera and selective phytoplankton grazers Arctodiaptomus dorsalis. Study organisms were exposed to different concentrations of microplastics (plastic polyethylene microspheres; low = 2.38 x 10(-8) mg/L, medium = 0.023 mg/L, high = 162 mg/L), phytoplankton prey, and predator cues, simulating a simple freshwater food web. Microplastic uptake was greater by D. dentifera, but both species were characterized by decreased algal consumption in the highest microplastic concentration treatment. Importantly, aqueous chlorophyll-a concen-trations at the conclusion of the experiment were greater for the high microplastic treatment than all controls and other microplastic treatments. Finally, a predator effect was only apparent for D. dentifera, with greater micro-plastic uptake in the presence of a predator. We conclude that microplastics may adversely impact the ability of zooplankton to feed on algae and potentially release algae from consumptive control by herbivorous zooplankton.
   Synopsis: This research aimed to better understand the broader food web effects of environmentally relevant microplastic concentrations on aquatic communities.

AB  - Immunocastration can be an alternative to surgical castration in Bisaro pigs when there is a need to keep animals on the farm until at least 8 months old. As an autochthonous breed, some particularities must be addressed when doing immunocastration, for which 3 different protocols were tested and two control groups were made with surgically castrated males (SC) and boars (Bo). Two protocols were made in prepubertal pigs, with two (E2) and three inoculations (L3) in the first cycle, and another in adults (A2) with only two inoculations. Physicochemical parameters and boar taint compounds quantification and sensory analysis of the meat from the studied pigs were assessed. Immunocastration provided intermediate values between surgically castrated pigs and entire males, with low levels of boar taint compounds. The L3 group provided closer results to SC, which was also corroborated by the sensory analysis. Although the other two protocols had no significant differences with Bo, there was a positive tendency towards them. As is, the L3 protocol was promising as a good alternative to surgical castration, maintaining the characteristic attributes of the Bisaro pig meat.

AB  - The endangered Amami rabbit (Pentalagus furnessi), endemic to two Japanese subtropical islands, has a habit of egesting faeces on streambanks in their habitats. We hypothesized that rabbit faeces transported into streams are consumed by aquatic animals. Underwater behavioural observations using time-lapse photography showed that decapod crustaceans foraged on rabbit faeces introduced experimentally into a forest stream on Amami-Oshima Island. From in situ samples, stable isotopic analysis showed mean contributions of rabbit faeces to diets of benthic macroinvertebrates ranged from 12% to 66%. This study suggests that rabbit faeces form an allochthonous resource unique to this insular stream ecosystem.

AB  - Breeding outcome in birds can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, which may contribute differentially to each stage of the breeding cycle. Island raptors are relatively threatened species that rely on simplified food webs and usually co-occur with invasive species. Here, we studied a population of Striated Caracara Phalcoboenus australis in Isla de los Estados (Argentina) to understand the relative contribution of food availability, topographical features and territoriality to breeding parameters. Caracaras in the area depend on the short seasonal (i.e. pulsed) availability of seabirds for feeding their chicks. On the other hand, the recent introduction of non-native ungulates may have led to a suboptimal breeding environment by reducing Caracara nest-site availability within the seabird colonies via disturbance of the grassland. Using data from seven breeding seasons we analyse the abundance, the proportion of breeding individuals, the spatial structure of breeding events and the population-level breeding performance, including chick sex ratio, to study whether the breeding ecology of this species is still shaped by marine food web pulses or could be associated with invasive herbivore disturbance. The breeding adults represented only 6-15% of the population. The spatial pattern of nest-sites did not differ from random arrangement after considering the heterogeneous distribution of food availability. Territory identity accounted for most of the variation in clutch size and productivity, and penguin availability explained part of the variability in territory occupancy and hatching rate. The chick sex ratio was biased towards females and varied according to brood size, with the more productive territories producing 91% of males. The breeding cycle of this population is still mainly dependent upon the Rockhopper Penguin Eudyptes chrysocome food pulse and presents mixed evidence of being disrupted by invasive herbivores. The studied factors contributed differentially to the output of each reproductive stage, with territory identity accounting for most of the variation. Our results suggest that individual-level, long-term data could be relevant to understanding the dynamics of this species in the Fuegian archipelago, and thus a broad-scale research programme is warranted to assess the conservation status and propose future management scenarios for this species.

AB  - Foskett Spring in Oregon's desert harbors a historically threatened population of Western Speckled Dace (Rhinichthys klamathensis). Though recently delisted, the dace's recruitment depends upon regular removal of encroaching vegetation. Previous studies assumed that Foskett Dace separated from others in the Warner Valley about 10,000 years ago, thereby framing an enigma about the population's surprising ability to persist for so long in a tiny habitat easily overrun by plants. To investigate that persistence and the effectiveness of interventions to augment population size, we assessed genetic diversity among daces inhabiting Foskett Spring, a refuge at Dace Spring, and three nearby streams. Analysis revealed a robust effective population size (Ne) of nearly 5000 within Foskett Spring, though Ne in the Dace Spring refuge is just 10% of that value. Heterozygosity is slightly lower than expected based on random mating at all five sites, indicating mild inbreeding, but not at a level of concern. These results confirm the genetic health of Foskett Dace. Unexpectedly, genetic differentiation reveals closer similarity between Foskett Dace and a newly discovered population from Nevada's Coleman Creek than between Foskett Dace and dace elsewhere in Oregon. Demographic modeling inferred Coleman Creek as the ancestral source of Foskett Dace fewer than 1000 years ago, much more recently than previously suspected and possibly coincident with the arrival of large herbivores whose grazing may have maintained open water suitable for reproduction. These results solve the enigma of persistence by greatly shortening the duration over which Foskett Dace have inhabited their isolated spring.

AB  - phosphate-rich rock, which underpin the green revolution are becoming rarer. Here we propose a mechanism to help alleviate the problem of "peak phosphorus". In the past, wild animals played a large role in returning P from ocean depths back to the continental interiors. In doing so, they collectively retained and redistributed P within the biosphere, supporting a more fertile planet. However, species extinctions and population reductions have reduced animal-mediated P transport >90% over the past 12,000 years. Recently a 5R strategy was developed to Realign P inputs, Reduce P losses, Recycle P in bio-resources, Recover P in wastes, and Redefine P in food systems. Here, we suggest a sixth R, to Revitalize the Natural Phosphorus Pump (RNPP). Countries are starting to mandate P recycling and we propose a P-trading scheme based on REDD+, where a country could partially achieve its recycling goals by restoring past animal-mediated P pathways. Accrued money from this scheme could be used to restore or conserve wild animal populations, while increasing natural P recycling.

AB  - The upper and lower jaws of some wrasses (Eupercaria: Labridae) possess teeth that have been coalesced into a strong durable beak that they use to graze on hard coral skeletons, hard-shelled prey, and algae, allowing many of these species to function as important ecosystem engineers in their respective marine habitats. While the ecological impact of the beak is well understood, questions remain about its evolutionary history and the effects of this innovation on the downstream patterns of morphological evolution. Here we analyze 3D cranial shape data in a phylogenetic comparative framework and use paleoclimate modeling to reconstruct the evolution of the labrid beak across 205 species. We find that wrasses evolved beaks three times independently, once within odacines and twice within parrotfishes in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. We find an increase in the rate of shape evolution in the Scarus+Chlorurus+Hipposcarus (SCH) clade of parrotfishes likely driven by the evolution of the intramandibular joint. Paleoclimate modeling shows that the SCH clade of parrotfishes rapidly morphologically diversified during the middle Miocene. We hypothesize that possession of a beak in the SCH clade coupled with favorable environmental conditions allowed these species to rapidly morphologically diversify.

AB  - Horns play an important role in the intraspecific struggle of buffalo (Bovinae) and their resistance to invaders. To reveal the mechanical mechanism of the buffalo horn material, the effects of anisotropy, moisture and strain rate on the response of the buffalo horn material under quasi-static and dynamic loading were investigated in this paper. The microstructure of the buffalo horn material at different orientations was also observed. Combining the response of macroscopic loading measurement results of the buffalo horn material with its microscopic observation, the mechanical behavior of the buffalo horn material under loading have been revealed. The findings indicate that the buffalo horn material hierarchical corrugated structure results anisotropy. Hydrated horn samples notably increase the plastic deformation and reduces the strength of flow stress. The optimal energy absorption of 40MJ/m3 under radial impact corresponds to the primary load direction of the buffalo horn material. Furthermore, the elasticity modulus of the specimens increased 1.7-2.5 and 1.6-6 times with strain rate increasing, which indicates the strain rate effect of the buffalo horns. The characteristics exhibited by buffalo horn material in mechanical response can provide a reference for the design of bio-inspired material with superior performance in load resistance and energy absorption.

AB  - Plants exhibit significant variation in morphological and chemical traits of shoots and roots in response to an array of biotic and abiotic selection pressures, and this variation in turn affects their interactions with the biotic and abiotic environment. Thus far, most studies examining these interactions have focused on the aboveground domain, which is easier to study than the belowground domain. However, soil organisms significantly affect plant fitness directly through mutualisms e.g. growth promotion, or antagonisms e.g. herbivory and disease. Natural populations of wild Brassica oleracea L. growing along the south coastline of Great Britain exhibit sig-nificant differences in growth form and secondary chemistry. Studies in the field have shown that these differ-ences affect aboveground plant-insect interactions, whereas soil communities have not been explored. We sampled belowground communities of nematodes, bacteria and fungi associated with roots, rhizosphere and bulk soil in five coastal wild cabbage populations in Dorset, England, and found significant differences among these communities. Site-related differences in nematode community composition were primarily found for nematodes in bulk soil and were consistent over two years of sampling. Nematode communities in roots of wild cabbage did not significantly differ across the cabbage populations but did differ between the two years. Results for com-munities in rhizosphere soil were spatially and temporally variable. The composition of nematode communities in cabbage roots differed strongly from those in the rhizosphere and bulk soil, showing that plants attract a subset of nematodes from the bulk soil community. For microbes, we analysed only rhizosphere samples, and found that fungal communities differed more strongly among plant populations than bacterial communities. Thus, while there is spatio-temporal variation in belowground communities, soil and/or plant properties differentially affect the assembly of nematodes, fungi and bacteria.

AB  - Many critically endangered species persist in remnant populations so small that ecological information required to assist recovery, such as species-typical demographic parameters and habitat preferences, can be difficult to acquire based on science alone. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) or local ecological knowledge (LEK) can fill information gaps and provide additional understanding, though this expertise is not everlasting and often overlooked. We report on research focused on a species survival plan for mountain bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaci), a critically endangered antelope endemic to Kenya, persisting in the wild with fewer than 80 individuals in four separated montane forests. In preparation for a potential conservation translocation of captive-bred bongos into one or more forests, extensive camera trapping yielded limited results, suggesting that data were based on the activities of just a few individuals. Moreover, additional information critical to translocations, such as typical group size and sex ratios, could neither be observed nor obtained from the literature. This knowledge gap was largely resolved using expert interviews conducted with eight former Kenyan hunters, along with historical range and browse mapping, enriching understanding of behavioral characteristics rendering bongo particularly vulnerable to exploitation. Consistently similar responses from observations spanning a 50-year period (1950s to 1990s) across four ecosystems added certainty to responses. This study endorses a combination of data sources when dealing with remnant populations, and specifically recommends making use of this documented mountain bongo TEK/LEK to inform decisions about potential bongo reintroductions in Kenya.

AB  - Remote cameras have become a widespread data-collection tool for terrestrial mammals, but classifying images can be labor intensive and limit the usefulness of cameras for broad-scale population monitoring. Machine learning algorithms for automated image classification can expedite data processing, but image misclassifications may influence inferences. Here, we used camera data for three sympatric species with disparate body sizes and life histories - black-tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis), and pronghorns (Antilocapra americana) - as a model system to evaluate the influence of competing image classification approaches on estimates of occupancy and inferences about space use. We classified images with: (i) single review (manual), (ii) double review (manual by two observers), (iii) an automated-manual review (machine learning to cull empty images and single review of remaining images), (iv) a pretrained machine-learning algorithm that classifies images to species (base model), (v) the base model accepting only classifications with & GE;95% confidence, (vi) the base model trained with regional images (trained model), and (vii) the trained model accepting only classifications with & GE;95% confidence. We compared species-specific results from alternative approaches to results from double review, which reduces the potential for misclassifications and was assumed to be the best approximation of truth. Despite high classification success, species-level misclassification rates for the base and trained models were sufficiently high to produce erroneous occupancy estimates and inferences related to space use across species. Increasing the confidence thresholds for image classification to 95% did not consistently improve performance. Classifying images as empty (or not) offered a reasonable approach to reduce effort (by 97.7%) and facilitated a semi-automated workflow that produced reliable estimates and inferences. Thus, camera-based monitoring combined with machine learning algorithms for image classification could facilitate monitoring with limited manual image classification.

AB  - Forbs in South African mesic grasslands are ancient, numerous, and diverse, thriving with fires and light herbivory but declining under chronic, severe grazing and trampling. This study tested the hypothesis that repeated herbivory progressively weakens forbs by reducing their underground growth and storage capacity, ultimately threatening their persistence in grazed grasslands. Over two years, Thunbergia atriplicifolia, a forb with tuberous storage roots, was subjected to frequent, severe defoliation during the growing season in a replicated pot experiment. Recurrent defoliation significantly reduced stem length, stem number, and tuberous and fibrous root biomass in the subsequent spring of each year. Notably, underground growth declined more sharply in the second year (75.6%) than in the first (60.4%), despite fewer defoliations and higher rainfall. While defoliated plants initially compensated with increased above-ground growth, this strategy proved unsustainable, leading to a severe reduction in below-ground reserves. These findings indicate that persistent defoliation reduces the resilience of forbs, diminishing their competitiveness against grasses and threatening their long-term survival. To conserve the high forb diversity of mesic grasslands, precautionary management with reduced defoliation frequency and intensity and periodic whole-year rest periods are recommended, alongside adaptive management that adjusts grazing intensity and timing based on regular monitoring.

AB  - The population density of P & egrave;re David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) in Jiangsu Dafeng Milu Nature Reserve was excessively high due to an overemphasis on population recovery, while ignoring the crucial relationship between population size and habitats. This study used immunocastration to capture four P & egrave;re David's deer and observed their behavior. Their blood was collected for sex hormone testing, transcriptomics, and metabolomics analysis. In addition, six uncastrated P & egrave;re David's deer were included as control group. The results showed that reproductive behavior was absent in castrated P & egrave;re David's deer, while castrated individuals exhibited a significant decrease in blood hormone testosterone concentration compared to uncastrated P & egrave;re David's deer. Transcriptome and metabolome analyses revealed 450 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and five differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs), Combined analysis of transcriptome and metabolic data revealed a significant correlation between DEGs and DEMs. It shows that using immune castration to control the population of P & egrave;re David's deer may disrupt their cell apoptosis and disturb the cell cycle, leading to abnormal pathways and promoting the onset of many diseases. Therefore, a cautious approach should be adopted toward immune castration as a means of population control. This study can provide valuable references for the standardized management of P & egrave;re David's deer populations.

AB  - Abalone is one of the most important small-scale fisheries in Mexico and is challenged by multiple stressors. For example, the loss of the native main food, Macrocystis pyrifera, and the subsequent takeover of non-indigenous algae species represent a major threat to abalone growth and survival. In Baja California, Mexico two introduced macroalgae, Undaria pinnatifida and Sargassum horneri have become common in the past decade with unknown consequences on native herbivores. In this work, we explored the effect of these invasive algae on the growth and survival of juvenile red abalone, Haliotis rufescens. One hundred and ten juvenile red abalone were tagged and fed with invasive algae U. pinnatifida and S. horneri, and a control with M. pyrifera. Then, the shell length, body weight, and survivorship were assessed monthly for 90 days. Results show that abalone fed U. pinnatifida had a total growth in length, weight, and survivorship, similar to those fed native M. pyrifera. In contrast, abalone fed S. horneri had significantly lower overall performance. Marine heatwaves and other climatic impacts are expected to favour the establishment of invasive species. These results may be relevant to inform local fisheries and management efforts in this area under future scenarios.

AB  - Previous studies on mangrove carbon utilisation and mineralisation were focused on mangrove sesarmid crabs (Grapsoidea: Sesarmidae) because they are initial processors of mangrove organic carbon. Grapsoid crabs from other families and habitats were generally ignored although they also perform various levels of herbivory. It remains unclear how the herbivorous crabs utilise the production from mangrove or vascular plants because of the high C/N ratio and high structural carbon content of these materials. In this study, production of cellulase and expression of hepatopancreatic glycosyl hydrolase of grapsoid crabs were investigated in a more extensive way in terms of their taxa (15 species) and habitats (i.e., land margin, mangrove, mudflat, and subtidal area). Generally, low gastric endoglucanase (1.46-2.98 mu mol min(-1) ml(-1)) and beta-glucosidase (0.06-0.61 mu mol min(-1) ml(-1)) activity was detected in 15 grapsoid crabs distributed along the land-sea transition. The activity of both enzymes was significantly affected by the taxonomic affiliation and habitat of the crabs: endoglucanase in sesarmids > varunids > grapsids; and land margin, mangrove and limnic habitats > mudflat and subtidal area. For beta-glucosidase: sesarmids > varunids and grapsids; and land and limnic > mangrove and subtidal > mudflat. Our detection of gastric cellulases in mudflat and subtidal grapsoid crabs has rarely been reported. These results show that there is a need to re-evaluate the role of crabs from these habitats in mangrove/vascular plant carbon mineralisation. Further, low cellulase activity could be a common trait among crabs along the land-sea transition and the importance of cellulase in vascular plant carbon utilisation could have been previously over-rated. Glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9) genes were identified in the hepatopancreatic transcriptome of all 15 species, indicating endogenous production of cellulase. In addition, the presence of other digestive carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), including GH5_10, GH13, GH13_24, and GH16, suggests that a capacity for the utilisation of carbon sources other than cellulose by the grapsoid crabs, which may enable sufficient assimilation of vascular plant carbon despite the low cellulase activity.

AB  - Background The neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn) mediate the transfer of immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules from a dam's circulation to the colostrum produced by it immediately after parturition. In ruminants, the calves born are agammaglobulinemic therefore, ingestion of colostrum with high concentration of IgG imparts passive immunity to the newborn. The FcRn molecule is a heterodimer, coded by FCGRT (Fc fragment of IgG Receptor Transporter neonatal) and B2M (Beta 2 microglobulin) genes. Present study attempted to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FCGRT gene in 40 buffaloes of Murrah breed and evaluated the association of these nucleotide variations and haplotypes with IgG concentration in their colostrum. Methods and results Animals producing colostrum with high IgG and low IgG levels were identified by indirect ELISA and selected. SNPs were detected in the FCGRT gene sequence of selected animals by amplifying it in nine fragments covering all exons (with flanking introns) followed by PCR-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). A total of nine SNPs were observed of which seven were present in flanking introns and two in exon 4 of the gene. The SNP A75G was non-synonymous and produced an amino acid change from isoleucine to valine. The exonic SNPs and corresponding haplotypes were found to be significantly (P < 0.01 and 0.05 respectively) associated with colostral IgG concentration based on Odds ratios at 95% confidence interval. Conclusion Polymorphism in FCGRT gene is found to be associated with IgG concentration in colostrum and identification of females with desirable variations may prevent failure of passive transfer in neonatal ruminants.

AB  - Although the role of host movement in shaping infectious disease dynamics is widely acknowledged, methodological separation between animal movement and disease ecology has prevented researchers from leveraging empirical insights from movement data to advance landscape scale understanding of infectious disease risk. To address this knowledge gap, we examine how movement behaviour and resource utilization by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) determines blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) distribution, which depend on deer for dispersal in a highly fragmented New York City borough. Multi-scale hierarchical resource selection analysis and movement modelling provide insight into how deer's movements contribute to the risk landscape for human exposure to the Lyme disease vector-I. scapularis. We find deer select highly vegetated and accessible residential properties which support blacklegged tick survival. We conclude the distribution of tick-borne disease risk results from the individual resource selection by deer across spatial scales in response to habitat fragmentation and anthropogenic disturbances.

AB  - When managing grazing pressure for conservation, understanding forage dynamics is essential. In south-eastern Australia, ongoing grazing is inhibiting regeneration in several semi-arid woodland communities. Western grey kangaroos (Macropus fuliginosus (Desmarest, 1817)) have been identified as a key component of total grazing pressure. They are thought to switch from grass to lower-quality browse, including tree seedlings, when grass biomass falls below 400 kg ha(-1). One static threshold may not adequately capture the spatial and temporal hazard associated with kangaroo grazing, and this study aimed to explore how grassy biomass varies across a case-study landscape. Understorey biomass and species composition data were collected in the field on seven occasions between December 2016 and May 2019. We used Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) to describe the influence of environmental and herbivory variables on total (live and dead) understorey, live understorey, and grass (live and dead) biomass. Canopy cover showed the strongest influence on understorey biomass, with more biomass found in open sites than in woodland. Understorey biomass levels were lowest in summer and autumn. Grass biomass, in particular, fell below the 400 kg ha(-1) forage-switch threshold in wooded areas during this time. We anticipate that an increased understanding of understorey biomass dynamics will inform managers as to when and where to focus management efforts to promote regeneration and sustained recovery of these semi-arid woodlands. Results of this study suggest that conducting management efforts before the summer/autumn decline in understorey biomass, particularly in woodlands, is critical in reducing the browsing risk to seedlings.

AB  - Understanding pest evolution in agricultural systems is crucial for developing effective and innovative pest control strategies. Types of cultivation, such as crop mono-cultures versus polycultures or crop rotation, may act as a selective pressure on pests' capability to exploit the host's resources. In this study, we examined the herbivorous mite Aceria tosichella (commonly known as wheat curl mite), a widespread wheat pest, to understand how fluctuating versus stable environments influence its niche breadth and ability to utilize different host plant species. We subjected a wheat-bred mite population to replicated experimental evolution in a single-host environment (either wheat or barley), or in an alternation between these two plant species every three mite generations. Next, we tested the fitness of these evolving populations on wheat, barley, and on two other plant species not encountered during experimental evolution, namely rye and smooth brome. Our results revealed that the niche breadth of A. tosichella evolved in response to the level of environmental variability. The fluctuating environment expanded the niche breadth by increasing the mite's ability to utilize different plant species, including novel ones. Such an environment may thus promote flexible host-use generalist phenotypes. However, the niche expansion resulted in some costs expressed as reduced performances on both wheat and barley as compared to specialists. Stable host environments led to specialized phenotypes. The population that evolved in a constant environment consisting of barley increased its fitness on barley without the cost of utilizing wheat. However, the population evolving on wheat did not significantly increase its fitness on wheat, but decreased its performance on barley. Altogether, our results indicated that, depending on the degree of environmental heterogeneity, agricultural systems create different conditions that influence pests' niche breadth evolution, which may in turn affect the ability of pests to persist in such systems.

AB  - Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) is a species of economic interest and an outstanding study model. The aspen borer (Saperda calcarata) causes irreversible damage to poplars and other riparian species in North America. The insect can produce multiple effects ranging from the presence of some galleries in the stem to tree death. Despite the ecological and commercial importance of this tree-insect interaction, the genetic mechanisms underlying the response of P. trichocarpa to S. calcarata are scarcely understood. In this study, a common garden trial of P. trichocarpa provenances, established in Davis, California, was assessed at the second year of growth, regarding the infestation of S. calcarata from a natural outbreak. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using 629k of exonic SNPs to assess the relationship between genomic variation and insect attack. Tree architecture, in terms of stem number per plant, and the wood metabolome were also included. Insect attack was independent of the number of stems per tree. The performed GWAS identified three significantly associated SNP markers (q-value < 0.2) belonging to the same number of gene models, encoding proteins involved in signal transduction mechanisms and secondary metabolite production, including that of R-mandelonitrile lyase, Chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding family protein, and Leucine-rich repeat protein. These results are aligned with the current knowledge of defensive pathways in plants and trees, helping to expand the understanding of the defensive response mechanisms of black cottonwood against wood borer insects.

AB  - Translocations are essential for the establishment of new populations of the critically endangered black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), but success will largely depend on forage availability. We investigated the degree of competition for woody browse between African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) and a recently reintroduced population of rhinoceroses in Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe in the dry season of 2022. We examined overlap in space use and selection for plant species, stem diameters, and feeding height by measuring use of shrubs by both species at 75 sites across a range of topo-edaphic conditions. Areas heavily used by rhinoceroses had high shrub densities, were close to water, and were on alkaline soils with elevated conductivity. Sites with medium to high levels of rhinoceros use were nested within areas of high elephant use. We also observed high elephant use in areas not favored by rhinoceroses, occurring farther from water and having lower shrub densities. Both species avoided thickets on acidic soils. There was substantial overlap in feeding areas, the plant species selected, and foraging height, although elephants used stems with larger diameters than rhinoceroses. Feeding by elephants on woody plants often resulted in a proliferation of small-diameter coppice stems, which rhinoceroses used more than non-coppice growth. Elephants did not appear to favor small coppice stems, indicating a degree of elephant-induced facilitation of browse for rhinoceroses. Evidence for competition with elephants indicates black rhinoceroses may be best introduced into areas with a low elephant density.

AB  - Many mammalian species use photoperiod as a predictive cue to time seasonal reproduction. In addition, metabolic effects on the reproductive axis may also influence seasonal timing, especially in female small, short-lived mammals. To get a better understanding of how annual cycling environmental cues impact reproductive function and plasticity in small, short-lived herbivores with different geographic origins, we investigated the mechanisms underlying integration of temperature in the photoperiodic-axis regulating female reproduction in a Northern vole species (tundra vole, Microtus oeconomus) and in a Southern vole species (common vole, Microtus arvalis). We show that photoperiod and temperature interact to determine appropriate physiological responses; there is species-dependent annual variation in the sensitivity to temperature for reproductive organ development. In common voles, temperature can overrule photoperiodical spring-programmed responses, with reproductive organ mass being higher at 10 degrees C than at 21 degrees C, whereas in autumn they are less sensitive to temperature. These findings are in line with our census data, showing an earlier onset of spring reproduction in cold springs, while reproductive offset in autumn is synchronized to photoperiod. The reproductive organs of tundra voles were relatively insensitive to temperature, whereas hypothalamic gene expression was generally upregulated at 10 degrees C. Thus, both vole species use photoperiod, whereas only common voles use temperature as a cue to control spring reproduction, which indicates species-specific reproductive strategies. Due to global warming, spring reproduction in common voles will be delayed, perhaps resulting in shorter breeding seasons and thus declining populations, as observed throughout Europe.

AB  - Organic amendments are widely used to enhance soil fertility and nutrient cycling in greenhouse cultivation, but their effectiveness can vary depending on their origin and composition. This study investigated the impact of four organic materials (rice husk, coconut coir, biochar, and sheep manure) on nutrient cycling and enzyme activities in two of greenhouse tomato soils. The distribution of soil nutrients and enzyme activities was analyzed under controlled conditions during a pot experiment. The addition of organic amendments, regardless of their source, significantly altered the microbial resource allocation, reducing the carbon limitation while increasing the nitrogen demand. The effect on soil nutrient pools was largely determined by the chemical composition of the amendments. In clayey soils, biochar and rice husk additions most effectively promoted enzyme activities related to carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus acquisition. Under sandy soil conditions, sheep manure increased carbon and phosphorus acquisition enzymes, while biochar most effectively enhanced nitrogen acquisition enzymes. Biochar emerged as a particularly effective amendment, enhancing organic carbon sequestration across different soil types. The chemical composition of the amendments, specifically, the content of carboxyl C, aromatic C, and O-alkyl C, played a crucial role in influencing soil nutrient limitations. In clayey soils, the mean C:N:P ratios for CK, T1, T2, T3, and T4 treatments were 1:1.375:0.625, 1:1.244:0.662, 1:0.839:0.610, 1:1.161:0.689, and 1:1.038:0.549, respectively. In sandy soils, the ratios were 1:1.117:0.698, 1:1.18:0.75, 1:1.096:0.731, 1:1.217:0.689, and 1:1.06:0.669, respectively. These findings suggest that the addition of organic amendments can improve nutrient retention and enzyme activities, but their effects on soil nutrient pools are influenced by both the composition of the amendments and the soil texture. This research enhances our understanding of organic amendments and soil nutrient transformations, and aids in optimizing the application of organic materials for improved soil management in greenhouse cultivation.

AB  - We comprehensively analyzed sediments obtained from an archeological excavation. A trench sediment profile of Maedun Cave (MC), South Korea, was analyzed geoarchaeologically. Multi-proxy analyses (palynomorphs, grain size, magnetic susceptibility, animal bones and artifacts) reflected the vegetation, hydroclimate and lives of prehistoric people at Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 3 (ca. 40-30k cal a bp) in the early Late Paleolithic. The palynoflora consisted of pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs. Under the air-circulation system in the cave, anemophilous pollen flowed in during the day, whereas waterborne pollen and spores, and freshwater algae, were transported by flooding during the summer monsoon rainy season. Mixed conifer and deciduous broad-leaved forest with an understory of pteridophytes flourished around the north-east central Korean Peninsula during MIS 3. Freshwater algae and grass pollen records may reflect precipitation intensity. It is assumed that they had flowed in during flooding caused by high precipitation during the enhanced East Asian summer monsoon, corresponding to Dansgaard-Oeschger (D/O) events 5 and 8 of delta O-18 GISP2 and Hulu Cave. The prehistoric people hunted herbivorous animals in the area around MC and sheltered inside it seasonally. They also used the grains of oats growing near the dwelling as a source of food.

AB  - Wildlife conservation and management is evolving to address new challenges that encompass diverse socio-economic, political, and ecological demands. The traditional expert-driven approach has shifted towards an inclusive stakeholder-driven form of management, necessitating multidisciplinary research and stakeholder input. Modern wildlife management therefore requires the bridging of research and practice, with policymakers balancing the needs of stakeholders and evidence to implement robust systems of management. To understand the challenges of wildlife management in the face of stakeholder conflict, we undertook a multidisciplinary study of stakeholder views focusing on deer management in Ireland as an example. The highest ranked issues identified related to increasing deer numbers were biodiversity loss and road traffic accidents risk. However, there was evidence that importance ranking depended on persons landownership status, their self-identified background (urban or rural), or what country they came from (Ireland vs. other). The ranking of management options and impediments to progress also varied by stakeholder type (e.g. hunters; farmers). However, there was large degree of consensus on culling being an important management tool and collaboration as a means of overcoming obstacles. Qualitative analysis highlighted six core themes, including the perceived problems from excessive deer populations, the need for better management systems, and differing views on state and non-state actors responsibility for deer problems. By employing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, our study provides a comprehensive understanding of stakeholder perspectives on deer management. This mixed-methods approach highlighted the divergent priorities of stakeholders, influenced by their backgrounds and values, particularly on key areas of human-wildlife conflict surrounding these species. While common ground was found in identifying key impacts and management solutions, the need for enhanced collaboration and tailored strategies emerged as critical. Finally, we discuss how drawing lessons from successful models in other jurisdictions, and investing in research, monitoring, and education, is essential for designing future effective and sustainable wildlife management in Ireland. This study examines how conflicting stakeholder values can exacerbate human-wildlife conflict. However, by understanding these issues thoroughly, targeted monitoring and management systems can be designed to alleviate conflict.

AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal neurological disease of cervids caused by a misfolded protein with no vaccines or other cures to prevent infection and death. In the past decade, CWD has been recognized as one of the 10 most important challenges facing wildlife management. This paper evaluates the temporal and spatial patterns of CWD prevalence in southern Wisconsin white-tailed deer during the past 20 years. In most CWD areas, prevalence progresses from introduction to enzootic equilibrium in 15-20 years. In some monitoring areas, the disease grows at a much slower rate and remains below the equilibrium levels. Outbreaks are characterized by four distinct epizootic stages. Disease establishment (Stage 1) depends on the distance from a CWD focus. High rates of incidence and prevalence growth (Stage 2) are followed by slower growth as the relative number of susceptible deer declines (Stage 3). The rate of prevalence increase over time is higher in more forested ecoregions and in males (0.48 vs. 0.43) but similar in females (0.43 vs. 0.37) and yearlings (0.44 vs. 0.39). Habitat features, acting as surrogates for deer behavior and contact, may affect the rate of prevalence growth at a landscape (ecoregion) scale. Additionally, prevalence may be affected by deer management practices that favor higher deer abundance and more mature males. Finally, enzootic equilibrium (Stage 4) is higher in males (0.5), followed by females (0.36) and then yearlings (0.26). These equilibrium prevalence levels are high enough to have significant population impacts, reduce the abundance of mature males, and facilitate CWD spread by infected yearlings. Epizootic patterns suggest that CWD transmission has been frequency-dependent and primarily driven by direct contact with infected deer. Evidence for a meaningful change in the epizootic pattern from a 10-year management program to reduce deer abundance is lacking. The trajectory of CWD dynamics in Wisconsin suggests rapid growth in regional prevalence following introduction and increased spread across the landscape.

AB  - Straw and animal manure are major organic waste materials from agricultural ecosystems. Different kinds of animal manure combined with straw (AM-S) may have varying effects on the decomposition, nutrient release, and structural changes of maize straw. Using the Humic Cambisols soil as the experimental area, the straw decomposition characteristics under the co-application of animal manure were studied following the nylon net bag landfill method. The experiment involved four treatments: maize straw only (S), maize straw plus ox manure (SO), maize straw plus chicken manure (SC), and maize straw plus pig manure (SP). The treatments with AM-S accelerated the decomposition of straw and increased the release rate of nutrients and organic components (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin). During the 240 days of the study, straw decomposition showed a trend of increasing rapidly in the first stages and then increasing slowly in the latter stages in all the treatments. At 240 d, the straw decomposition rates and carbon release rates of the AM-S treatments were 65.25-71.87% and 64.04-69.35%, respectively. At the end of the experiment, the order for the final release rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) was K (93.25-96.56%) > P (42.25-55.08%) > N (40.01-52.23%). Moreover, scanning electron microscopy showed that SP treatment had the highest degree of structural changes of the maize straw compared with the other treatments. The purpose of this study was to screen the effective animal manure that can promote straw decomposition and provide a reference for the rational use of straw and animal manure management. In conclusion, the study suggested that the co-application of animal manure and straw should be adopted in agricultural systems, especially SP treatment, as it was more conducive to promoting the decomposition of maize straw and the release of nutrients.

AB  - Glucocorticoid (GC) levels are increasingly and widely used as biomarkers of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity to study the effects of environmental changes and other perturbations on wildlife individuals and populations. However, identifying the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence GC levels is a key step in endocrinology studies to ensure accurate interpretation of GC responses. In muskoxen, qiviut (fine woolly undercoat hair) cortisol concentration is an integrative biomarker of HPA axis activity over the course of the hair's growth. We gathered data from 219 wild muskoxen harvested in the Canadian Arctic between October 2015 and May 2019. We examined the relationship between qiviut cortisol and various intrinsic (sex, age, body condition and incisor breakage) and extrinsic biotic factors (lungworm and gastrointestinal parasite infections and exposure to bacteria), as well as broader non-specific landscape and temporal features (geographical location, season and year). A Bayesian approach, which allows for the joint estimation of missing values in the data and model parameters estimates, was applied for the statistical analyses. The main findings include the following: (i) higher qiviut cortisol levels in males than in females; (ii) inter-annual variations; (iii) higher qiviut cortisol levels in a declining population compared to a stable population; (iv) a negative association between qiviut cortisol and marrow fat percentage; (v) a relationship between qiviut cortisol and the infection intensity of the lungworm Umingmakstrongylus pallikuukensis, which varied depending on the geographical location; and (vi) no association between qiviut cortisol and other pathogen exposure/infection intensity metrics. This study confirmed and further identified important sources of variability in qiviut cortisol levels, while providing important insights on the relationship between GC levels and pathogen exposure/infection intensity. Results support the use of qiviut cortisol as a tool to monitor temporal changes in HPA axis activity at a population level and to inform management and conservation actions.

AB  - Creating a future for elephants and people is a highly complex and dynamic challenge, involving social, behavioral, and ecological dimensions as well as multiple actors with various interests. To foster learning from human-elephant conflict (HEC) management projects and share best practices, a study was conducted to review the management of conflicts between elephants and humans in 12 African countries by qualitative expert interviews. Based on this information, a HEC management framework was developed in a two-tiered process. In the first phase, the theory of the framework was developed. In a second phase, the theoretical framework was validated and adjusted through stakeholder participation in two southern African projects (in Mozambique and Malawi). This holistic approach considers environmental as well as social, political, cultural, and economic factors directly or indirectly affecting interactions between people and wildlife. The framework integrates six interlinked strategies to guide managers and conservation practitioners to address HWC drivers and mitigate their impact. A legal environment and spatial planning form the basis of the framework. Social strategies, including meaningful stakeholder engagement and design of appropriate institutional structures and processes are considered the heart of the framework. Technical and financial strategies represent its arms and hands. At the top, monitoring steers all processes, provides feedback for adjustment, and informs decisions. The integration and coordination of these six strategies has great potential as a guiding route to human-wildlife coexistence in Africa and elsewhere.

AB  - Knowledge about the extent of genotype in environment interaction is helpful for farmers and plant breeders. This is because it helps them choose the proper strategies for agricultural management and breeding new cultivars. The main contribution of this paper is to investigate genotype on environmental interaction using the GGE biplot method (Genotype and the Genotype-by-Environment) in ten canola cultivars. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replications to assess the stability of grain yield of ten canola cultivars in five regions of Iran, including Birjand, Karaj, Kashmar, Sanandaj, and Shiraz, within two agricultural years of 2016 and 2017. The results of combined ANOVA illustrated that the effects of the environment, genotype x environment, and genotype were highly significant at 1%. Variance Analysis showed that three environmental impacts, genotype, and interaction of genotype in the environment effect, produced 68.44%, 18.63%, and 12.9% of the total variance. The GGE biplot graphs were constructed using PCA. The first principle component (PC1) explained 65.3%, and the second (PC2) explained 18.8% of the total variation. The research examined polygon diagrams to identify two top genotypes and four mega-environments. Also, the appropriate genotypes for each environment were diagnosed. Using the GGE biplot, it was possible to make visual comparisons and identify superior genotypes in canola. Accordingly,. The results obtained from graphical analysis indicated that Licord, Hyola 401 and Okapi genotypes showed the highest yield and were selected as the most stable genotypes. Also, Karaj region was chosen as a experimental region where the screening of genotypes was very suitable. Based on the ranking of the genotypes in the most suitable region (Karaj), Okapi genotype was selected as the desired genotype. In examining the heatmap drawn between the genotypes and the investigated environments, a lot of similarity between the genotypes of Sarigal, Hyola 401 and Okapi was observed in the investigated environments. The GGE biplot graphs enabled the detection of stable and superior environments and the grouping of cultivars and environments based on grain yield. The results of this research can be used both for extension and for future breeding programs. Our results provide helpful information about the canola genotypes and environments for future breeding programs.

AB  - Climate change poses a significant threat to the sustainability of livestock production systems in developing countries, particularly impacting small ruminants like goats, which are highly susceptible to heat stress. This stressor not only reduces productivity but also undermines economic viability. This study aimed to delve into the molecular mechanisms underlying heat stress tolerance in goats by conducting a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of heat-tolerant (HT, n = 4) and heat-susceptible (HS, n = 6) Jamunapari goats. Physiological metrics, such as rectal temperature, respiratory rate, and heart rate, were meticulously monitored under extreme environmental conditions (Temperature Humidity Index >92) to effectively classify goats based on their distinct heat stress responses. Samples of blood were obtained, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were extracted for subsequent RNA extraction. RNA-Seq analysis revealed a sum of 734 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), comprising 251 upregulated and 483 downregulated genes in HT goats compared to their HS counterparts. The WGCNA revealed three key modules, darkorange (tolerance), paleturquoise (respiration rate), and darkmagenta (heart rate). Moreover, functional enrichment analysis revealed that DEGs within these modules played intricate roles in crucial biological processes and pathways, including mitochondrial function, cardiac function, immune response, genomic stability, and metabolic regulation. This research notably enhances our comprehension of the genetic underpinnings of thermo-tolerance in goats and provides invaluable guidance for formulating breeding strategies aimed at bolstering livestock resilience against the challenges of climate change.

AB  - The molluscan 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) naturally cleaves into two fragments of similar size as 18S rRNA. This phenomenon, known as the hidden break, has been described in many other protostome species. Here, we characterize the 28S rRNA hidden break region in seven giant clam species, Tridacna gigas, T. derasa, T. maxima, T. noae, T. crocea, Hippopus hippopus and H. porcellanus. We confirm that the break consistently occurs in giant clams and is observed in all tissues and developmental stages. The region of the giant clam 28S rRNA break is located at a position homologous to the well-characterized 28S rRNA break in insects. High AU content and a stem-loop secondary structure in the region may contribute to fragmentation of the 28S rRNA molecule. An awareness of the existence of the hidden break in molluscs, such as the giant clams, which are emerging systems for understanding how environmental change affects life in the ocean, will facilitate progress of RNA sequencing-based analyses that currently rely on standard RNA profiles as a measure of sample integrity.

AB  - Ants play important roles in trophic dynamics through their functions, ranging from herbivores to predators. However, little is known about whether the ant community modifies diet preferences and feeding habits during primary succession. We performed a bait-choice experiment and analyses of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (delta C-13 and delta N-15) and radiocarbon (Delta C-14) of ants at four study sites that underwent primary succession on lava flows created by four volcanic eruptions approximately 70, 100, 230, and 540 years ago in Sakurajima, Japan. The ant community increasingly preferred plant-based diets over animal-based diets as the primary succession proceeded, likely because the ants attempted to balance nutrition through compensatory feeding according to diet availability. The delta C-13 values showed that the ants depended largely on carbon from C4 plants at the young sites with no canopy trees. The delta N-15 values of ants consistently differed among the species, suggesting that each species maintained the proportion of plant- and animal-based diets during succession. The baseline-corrected delta N-15 values of the ants were significantly higher at the youngest site than at the older sites; this probably reflects intraguild predation or reliance on aerial prey from surrounding older sites, which exhibited a higher delta N-15-baseline partly due to the colonisation of nitrogen-fixing plants. The Delta C-14 values show that the two ant species examined had older diet ages, by approximately 2 years, at the old sites than those at the young sites, indicating their greater dependence on the detritus food web.

AB  - Livestock and poultry breeding modes, feed compositions and manure collection systems have regional characteristics, which can directly affect the composition of livestock and poultry breeding manure, energy production by anaerobic digestion and resource utilization of products. The chemical, heavy metal contents and microbiological characteristics of pig manures and digestates were characterized in five pig farms and biogas plants in Quzhou (Zhejiang Province) in this study. The results showed that hemicellulose and cellulose of pig manures could be partly degraded in anaerobic digestion, but lignin was difficultly degraded and accumulated in digestates. The content of Zn was highest in the pig manure and digestate samples, followed by Cu, Cr, As, Ni, Pb, Cd, T1 and Hg. The As content was 16.09-31.22 mg kg(-1) in the pig manure and digestate samples, which exceeded the standard limitation requirements in fertilizers in China (<= 15 mg kg(-1)). Bacteroidota, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetota dominated in the pig manure and digestate samples, with a relative abundance of 73.6%-99.4%. The microbial community structure in the pig manure samples was quite different among the five farms. The pH, contents of lignin, T1 and As had a significant effect on the microbial community structure in the pig manure samples, while the contents of total phosphorus, NO3--N, cellulose and Pb could significantly influence the microbial community structure in the digestate samples. These findings can provide a theoretical basis for recycling manure and improving biogas engineering in large-scale pig farms.

AB  - In advanced wastewater treatment plants on pig farms, meticulous design aims to eliminate intrinsic pollutants such as organic matter, heavy metals, and biological contaminants. In our field survey across Southern China, a notable disparity in wastewater treatment procedures among various farming facilities lies in the utilization of terminal chemical oxidation post-sedimentation tank. However, recent focus in wastewater surveillance has predominantly centered on antibiotic resistance genes, leaving the efficacy of virus removal in different effluent systems largely unexplored. To profile virus composition at the effluent, assess the virus elimination efficiency of chemical oxidation at the effluent end, and the potential environmental driver of virus abundance, we deployed a meta-transcriptomics approach to first determine the total virome in effluent specimens of terminal clean water tank system (CWT) and terminal chemical oxidation system (TCO) in Southern China pig farms, respectively. From these data, 172 viruses were identified, with a median reads per million (RPM) of 27,789 in CWT and 19,982 in TCO. Through the integration of analyses encompassing the co-occurrence patterns within viral communities, the ecology of viral diversity, and a comparative assessment of average variation degrees, we have empirically demonstrated that the procedure of TCO may perturb viral communities and diminish their abundance, particularly impacting RNA viral communities. However, despite the diminished abundance, pathogenic viruses such as PEDV and PRRSV persisted in the effluent following chemical deoxidation at a moderate RPM value, indicating a substantial in situ presence at effluent. Our environmental driver modeling, employing GLM and mantel tests, substantiated the intricate nature of virus community variation within the effluent, influenced heterogeneously by diverse factors. Notably, pond temperature emerged as the foremost determinant, while fishing farming exhibited a positive correlation with virus diversity (p < 0.05). This revelation of the cryptic persistence of virus communities in wastewater effluent expands our understanding of the varied responses of different virus categories to oxidation. Such insights transcend mere virus characterization, offering valuable implications for enhancing biosafety measures in farming practices and informing wastewater-based epidemiological surveillance.

AB  - BACKGROUND Generalist predators that kill and eat other natural enemies can weaken biological control. However, pest suppression can be disrupted even if actual intraguild predation is infrequent, if predators reduce their foraging to lower their risk of being killed. In turn, predator-predator interference might be frequent when few other prey are available, but less common when herbivorous and detritus-feeding prey are plentiful. We used molecular gut-content analysis to track consumption of the predatory bug Geocoris sp. by the larger intraguild predator Nabis sp., in organic and conventional potato (Solanum tuberosum) fields. RESULTS We found that higher densities of both aphids and thrips, two common herbivores, correlated with higher probability of detecting intraguild predation. Perhaps, Nabis foraging for these herbivores also encountered and ate more Geocoris. Surprisingly, likelihood of intraguild predation was not strongly linked to densities of either Nabis or Geocoris, or farming system, suggesting a greater importance for prey than predator community structure. Intriguingly, we found evidence that Geocoris fed more often on the detritus-feeding fly Scaptomyza pallida with increasing predator evenness. This would be consistent with Geocoris shifting to greater foraging on the ground, where S. pallida would be relatively abundant, in the face of greater risk of intraguild predation. CONCLUSION Overall, our findings suggest that while herbivorous prey may heighten intraguild predation of Geocoris in the foliage, detritivores might support a shift to safer foraging on the ground. This provides further evidence that prey abundance and diversity can act to either heighten or relax predator-predator interference, depending on prey species identity and predator behavior.

AB  - Although there are benefits to being a generalist, the majority of herbivorous insects are diet specialists. This raises the question whether the ability to reproduce on various host plants hides an unknown ecological optimum. Our study investigated the existence of such an ecological optimum in the fungus-farming ambrosia beetle, Xyleborinus saxesenii Ratzeburg (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). We hypothesised that X. saxesenii may exhibit higher fitness in specific hosts that are particularly abundant in their respective regions. To test this hypothesis, we bred X. saxesenii from a broadleaved forest population in semi-artificial media mimicking either a coniferous or a broadleaved host-tree species. As trade-offs between different traits can occur, we examined various aspects of the life history, social behaviour and fungal symbionts of X. saxesenii. We found that dispersing females did not exhibit any preference, and that the host tree did not have any impact on life history parameters or larval and adult behaviours. The fungal community associated with the species was made up of identical fungal species, albeit with different relative abundances between host trees. Our findings indicate that X. saxesenii does not exhibit a specific adaptation to the most abundant host trees in its native habitat. However, we identified significant effects of laboratory breeding on life history traits, social behaviour and adult dispersal. This generalism in host use in combination with inbreeding mating system may be the main drivers of the invasion success of the Eurasian X. saxesenii, which is currently among the most prevalent and widely distributed ambrosia beetle species worldwide.
   We analysed the life history, behaviour and symbionts of Xyleborinus saxesenii in different host trees. The life history traits, behaviour and nutritional symbionts were not impacted by the host tree, but other fungal symbionts were. Our results show that wood-dwelling insects do not always adapt to the locally abundant plants. image

AB  - Simple Summary The yak is endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and serves as an important livestock animal for Tibetan pastoral society. Phenotypic traits vary among domestic yaks. However, genomic characteristics, population structure, and the genetic relationship of domestic yaks with wild yaks have not been effectively characterized until now. In this study, six domestic populations were sequenced, and selective sweep regions involved in yak domestication were detected. Furthermore, divergence time for domestic and wild yaks was estimated. This study revealed new insight into selection for domestic and wild yaks.Abstract The yak (Bos grunniens) was domesticated in the high-altitude QTP. Research about their genetic diversity and population structure is limited. In this study, we resequenced the genome of 494 domestic yaks using Specific-Locus Amplified Fragment Sequencing (SLAF-seq). The survey was conducted on six populations sampled from isolated locations in China in order to analyze their structure and genetic diversity. These six domestic populations were clearly grouped into two independent clusters, with Jinchuan, Changtai, and Jiulong showing a tight genetic relationship with the wild yak. Nerve development pathways were enriched with GO enrichment analysis of 334 domesticated genes. Major genomic regions associated with the differentiation of domestic yaks were detected. These findings provide preliminary information on the yak genome variability, useful to understand the genomic characteristics of different populations in QTP.

AB  - Free water can influence the ecology of desert species. While the use of free water is influenced by physiological factors (e.g., species-specific water requirements, moisture in forage, temperature), nonphysiological factors, such as habitat characteristics and interspecific interactions, are also important. In fact, for species of concern, interspecific interactions and habitat can be important factors influencing their spatial and temporal use of the landscape and its resources. The kit fox (Vulpes macrotis) is a small carnivore considered to be a species of concern over much of its range, and two of the most important conservation challenges it faces are related to (1) habitat and (2) predation/competition by intraguild species. Our objective was to determine the influence of habitat characteristics, predators (bobcats [Lynx rufus], coyotes [Canis latrans]), and potential competitors (badgers [Taxidea taxus], gray foxes [Urocyon cinereoargenteus]) on the use of water by kit foxes. From June to September 2010-2012, we used remote cameras to monitor carnivores at 63 water sources in the Mojave Desert. We used zero-inflated mixed-effects models and a two-stage model selection analysis to evaluate the influence of habitat, predators, and competitors on spatial visits to water by kit foxes. We also assessed temporal avoidance of intraguild predators and competitors by kit foxes at water sources using a coefficient of overlap. We found that visual obscurity, overhead canopy cover, badgers, and coyotes influenced spatial visits of kit foxes. In addition, kit foxes exhibited strong temporal overlap with badgers and bobcats, moderate temporal overlap with gray foxes, and weak temporal overlap with coyotes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the spatial and temporal use of water sources by kit foxes is dynamic, depending on habitat characteristics and the activity of intraguild predators and competitors.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the roles of selenite (Se) on nitrogen conservation and greenhouse gases (GHGs) mitigation during the composting process. Six levels of Se(IV) dosages (i.e. 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mg/kg) were examined for 80-day composting of goat manure and wheat straw mixtures, where the different blending proportions were marked as T1 (Control), T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6, respectively. The results showed that adding Se(IV) was beneficial for reducing NH3 by 3.50-42.41% by buffering pH and promoting nitrification. For N2O, it showed different responses to different Se(IV) dosages, and it was increased by 29.62-71.29% in T2-T4 but reduced by 30.45-69.54% in T5-T6. Methane (CH4), another main component of GHGs, was increased by 1.35-107.42% by adding 2-10 mg/kg Se(IV). To further evaluate the effect of Se(IV) on GHGs, global warming potential value was calculated, which was 103.32-499.80 and minimum value was in T5. Furthermore, the physicochemical indexes, especially temperature and OM, had vital effects on microbial community. Overall, the results obtained from this study demonstrated that the application of Se (IV) in composting was reasonable to generate Se-rich organic fertilizer, and the 8 mg/kg was suggested from perspectives of nitrogen conservation and GHGs reduction.

AB  - Adult male sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) are long distance runners of the marine realm, feeding in high latitudes and mating in tropical and subtropical waters where stable social groups of females and immatures live. Several areas of uncertainty still limit our understanding of their social and breeding behavior, in particular concerning the potential existence of geographical and/or social fidelities. In this study, using underwater observation and sloughed-skin sampling, we looked for male social fidelity to a specific matrilineal sperm whale group near Mauritius. In addition, we captured a wider picture of kin relationships and genetic diversity of male sperm whales in the Indian Ocean thanks to biopsies of eight individuals taken in a feeding ground near the Kerguelen and Crozet Archipelagos (Southern Indian Ocean). Twenty-six adult male sperm whales were identified when socializing with adult females and immatures off Mauritius. Sloughed-skin samples were taken from thirteen of them for genetic analysis. Long-term underwater observation recorded several noteworthy social interactions between adult males and adult females and/or immatures. We identified seven possible male recaptures over different years (three by direct observation, and four at the gametic level), which supports a certain level of male social fidelity. Two probable first- and thirty second-degree kin relationships were highlighted between members of the social unit and adult males, confirming that some of the adult males observed in Mauritian waters are reproductive. Male social philopatry to their natal group can be excluded, as none of the males sampled shared the haplotype characteristic of the matrilineal social group. Mitochondrial DNA control region haplotype and nucleotide diversities calculated over the 21 total male sperm whales sampled were similar to values found by others in the Indian Ocean. Our study strongly supports the existence of some levels of male sperm whale social fidelity, not directed to their social group of birth, in the Indian Ocean. Males sampled in breeding and feeding grounds are linked by kin relationships. Our results support a model of male mediated gene flow occurring at the level of the whole Indian Ocean, likely interconnected with large-scale geographical fidelity to ocean basin, and a small-scale social fidelity to matrilineal social groups.

AB  - The "rhinorays" (giant guitarfish-Glaucostegidae and wedgefish-Rhinidae) are a critically endangered group of "shark-like rays," which have experienced steep global population declines in the past decade due to overfishing. Their slow life histories and high market value increase the risk of trade-driven extinction and lead to trade-offs between conservation objectives and fishers' economic objectives. As such, it is important to understand the social and ecological dimensions of risk to rhinorays to identify feasible conservation interventions. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 162 small-scale fishers in Karimunjawa National Park (KJNP), Indonesia. We collected data on fisher interactions with rhinorays, the technical and socio-economic characteristics of the fisheries, key risks to rhinorays, and potential leverage points for management, including feasible pro-conservation actions that fishers could engage in. We then constructed a linear model to identify socio-demographic predictors of fishers' stated willingness to engage in pro-conservation actions for rhinorays (specifically, willingness to release), to inform the design of future interventions. Our results indicate that socio-economic factors-fishers' perceived income contribution from catches of rhinorays and formal education levels-were significant predicators of fishers' willingness to release rhinorays. In contrast, awareness of rhinorays threat status was not a significant predictor. These findings are a first step toward understanding barriers and opportunities for engaging fishers in rhinorays conservation in KJNP. Our findings and recommendations also offer lessons learned for other marine conservation interventions at the intersection between small-scale fisheries management, marine protected areas, and marine megafauna conservation.

AB  - Testosterone is strongly associated with the annual development of antlers in cervids, but endocrine research on wild, freely breeding ungulates is often done without repeated capture of known-aged individuals. As a result, our knowledge on how testosterone fluctuates over the course of a lifetime and variation in lifetime patterns among individuals is limited. We investigated patterns of testosterone in a freely breeding population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Alabama, USA, that breeds in January. Testosterone peaked during the height of the breeding season, despite this period occurring approximately 2 months later than in most temperate-region white-tailed deer populations. Age-related differences in testosterone were only prevalent during the breeding season, with bucks >= 3.5 years old having greater testosterone (853 ng/dl +/- 96 SE; p = 0.012) than bucks 1.5-2.5 years old (364 ng/dl +/- 100 SE). Additionally, an individual's testosterone level as a yearling was not positively associated with their lifetime maximum testosterone level (p = 0.583), and an individual's mean testosterone level was positively associated with lifetime testosterone variation (p < 0.001). To our knowledge, our study is one of the first to assess how testosterone early in life might relate to individual testosterone later in life. We believe these data provide insight into lifetime hormonal patterns in cervids, and that these patterns may indicate intraspecific variation of lifetime reproductive strategies.

AB  - The expression of plant resistance traits against arthropod herbivores often comes with costs to other essential plant functions such as growth and fitness. These trade-offs are shaped by the allocation of limited resources. However, plants might also possess the capability to allocate resources to both resistance and growth, thereby ensuring their survival when under herbivore attacks. Additionally, the extent of damage caused by herbivores could vary across different years or seasons, subsequently impacting plant performance. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the annual variations in herbivore abundance and damage levels affect plant performance. We generated F-2 progeny through a cross between two populations of the annual herb Datura stramonium (Solanaceae). These populations are known to have differing levels of chemical defense and herbivory. These F-2 plants were cultivated in a common natural environment for two consecutive years (2017 and 2018). Our findings reveal that plants with higher resistance, attained higher seed production but this trend was evident only during 2018. This relationship coincided with a five-fold increase in the abundance of Lema daturaphila (Chrysomelidae) larvae in 2018. Indeed, the plants experienced a 13-fold increase in damage during this second year of study. Furthermore, our results indicated that there was no trade-off between resistance, growth, and fitness in either of the 2 years. In contrast, during 2018, when plants faced stronger herbivore pressure, they allocated all available nutritional resources to enhance both resistance and growth. Our study highlights how the selection for plant resistance is dependent upon the inter-annual variation in herbivore abundance.

AB  - Successful recovery and management of threatened and endangered species requires an understanding of the capacity of the available habitat to support the species. Measuring habitat supply, or specific elements of that habitat, has been a key objective and challenge in wildlife management, especially for wide-ranging omnivorous species. In this study, we provide a framework for estimating the carrying capacity of a threatened grizzly bear population in Alberta, Canada. Specifically, we compare current patterns in abundance from recent population inventories to potential abundance from our habitat-based estimates of carrying capacity to determine where conservation actions would be most effective in recovery. To estimate carrying capacity, we used field data from 2001 to 2016 to measure abundance of vegetation, insects (ants), and ungulates. We predicted spatial patterns in abundance and biomass from these field data using generalized linear models and combined these into one of five categories used by bears: roots, fruits, herbs, ants, and ungulates. Models were then converted to digestible energy (kilocalorie content) and summarized for individual watersheds. We then used a protected population of grizzly bears (i.e., a reference area) to calculate kilocalorie relationships per bear, and from that potential carrying capacities for watersheds using two methods. First, we considered the 'full resource' approach using kilocalories of all key food items. Second, we simplified it to only fruit and meat resources, for which data are more widely available and known to correlate locally with grizzly bear density. Despite differences between the two approaches, density (bears per 1000 km2) estimates for carrying capacity were similar across most of the region for the two scenarios suggesting one can may be able to just use fruit and meat resources and thus other food items may not limit bear populations. Finally, we identified watersheds where differences between current bear densities and carrying capacity was large and road densities high (risk of bear mortality), and thus where management efforts are most needed. This study provides a comprehensive framework for estimating carrying capacity and demonstrates how these findings can be applied to support grizzly bear management and population recovery efforts.

AB  - Rhythmic changes in the rectal temperature of goats, an important health indicator, can be influenced by nutrient supplementation and seasonal environmental conditions. This study evaluates the effects of ascorbic acid and L-glutamine on the daily rhythms of rectal temperature in Red Sokoto goats during the early rainy season. Twenty-four male Red Sokoto goats (6.0-15.0 kg) were divided into four groups: a control group, an ascorbic acid (AA) group, an L-glutamine (L-GLU) group, and a combination group (AA + L-GLU), with six goats in each group, housed separately. Supplementation lasted 21 days. Dry-bulb temperature (DBT), relative humidity (RH), and temperature-humidity index (THI) were measured every 2 h for 24 h on days 0, 2, 5, and 8 post-supplementations. Rectal temperature (RT) was recorded at the same intervals. Results indicated that while DBT was within the acceptable range, RH and THI were often outside the thermoneutral zone for goats. Ascorbic acid significantly reduced RT during the light phase (P < 0.05), while L-glutamine increased RT during the dark phase. Ascorbic acid also decreased (P <0.05) the baseline, amplitude, and phase shift of RT cycles. The phase shift was delayed in goats receiving both AA and L-GLU. In conclusion, ascorbic acid and L-glutamine affected the circadian rhythms of rectal temperature in Red Sokoto goats during the early rainy season.

AB  - Gut microbiota are important for the health and adaptability of the domestic yak. Fecal microbiota are one of the most popular groups of microorganisms used to estimate the domestic yaks' status, given the ease of obtaining fecal samples. However, because gut microbiota differ between gut sections, the representativeness of feces in microbiota is unclear in yak. To fill this gap, we compared the gut microbial diversities and functions of microbiota in the feces and seven other intestinal parts of domestic yaks based on 16S rRNA, including the rumen, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum. The gut microbiota of eight intestinal parts showed significant differences at the beta-diversity level. However, there were no significant differences in the diversity and functions of microbiota between the feces and cecum and the feces and colon because of the digestive process. According to source-tracking analysis, most fecal microbiota originate from the cecum and colon. We speculated that the representativeness of fecal microbiota is limited to cecum and colon in domestic yak. Our study is the foundation of the use of fecal microbiota for animal husbandry research.

AB  - This research aims to describe the process of ecological succession by associating the decomposition stages of pig carcasses with flies from the Calliphoridae family (Diptera). For this, 6 pig carcasses were exposed in Maranhao's Cerrado, utilizing metal cages with sawdust trays to catch immature specimens and "suspended traps" to capture adults. Adults of the Hemilucilia benoisti Seguy, and Hemilucilia townsendi Shannon species were only associated with the swelling stage. Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius) was associated with 2 stages (black putrefaction and fermentation). The species Chloroprocta idioidea (Robineau-Desvoidy), Chrysomya albiceps (Wiedemann), Cochliomyia macellaria (Fabricius), and Lucilia eximia (Wiedemann) were associated with 4 of the 5 stages of decomposition, the latter being the only 1 associated with the initial stage. The larvae abandoned the carcasses to pupate from the second stage of decomposition, with L. eximia being the only 1 leaving the carcasses in the swelling stage, and C. albiceps the only 1 associated with both the fermentation and dry stages. Our findings indicate that calliphorid species can help forensic investigators estimine the post-mortem interval of cadavers in situations similar to those detailed in this study. Since there was a link between adult and immature species and certain stages, they can be used as indicators in future forensic investigations.

AB  - Biochar amendment in soils has been proposed as an important strategy to improve soil C retention. However, while the exact roles of different biochar types on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics are not clear, the effect of their interactions with chemical fertilization on SOC, the dynamics of C-cycling enzyme activities and key Ccycling-related bacteria in rhizosphere soil remain unexplored. Therefore, biochars derived from rice straw, bamboo, cow, and pig manure were applied with/without chemical fertilizer to study soil C dynamics, the activities, diversity, and abundance of different C-cycling-related bacteria in the plant-soil system. Biochar + fertilizer (BF), irrespective of biochar source, induced an initial increase in dissolved organic and inorganic C (DOC and DIC) that were subsequently reduced compared to biochar over 15-weeks. Higher intensities of Ccontaining functional groups rather than the total C content of biochar induced the mineralization of SOC. Also, higher nutrient uptake, biomass, and CO2 concentration in plants under BF had an insignificant influence on SOC. Similarly, the reduction in mineral-associated organic C, DOC, DIC, and invertase activity in BF soils was associated with a decrease in the relative abundance of some key C-cycling related bacterial orders: Gemmmatimonadales, Myxococcales, Nitrosomonadales, and Acidimicrobiales, while the hydrocarbon-degrading taxa (Sphingmonadales and Xanthomonadales), and N-cycling bacteria were stimulated. Hence, BF amendment could exert varied influences on C-cycling-related bacteria and on global C-cycling. The use of BF limited C-cycling and its loss by providing more N-substrates for N-cycling organisms, which also competed with most C-cyclingrelated bacteria for organic C to regulate C mineralization and its associated loss.

AB  - Organic fertilizer is effective in improving soil quality, and promoting crop growth. Combined organic and inorganic fertilization has been proved as a more favorable way to tobacco yield and quality. However, the mechanisms underlying tobacco yield and quality under combinations of different organic and inorganic fertilizer remain unclear. We conducted a 12-year tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.)-maize crop rotation field experiment in Yanhe experimental station, China to examine the yields and qualities of tobacco, soil nutrients, and extracellular enzyme activities associated with carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles in response to different fertilization treatments. Five fertilization treatments (no fertilization; 75 kg N fertilizer ha(-1); 450 kg oil cake ha(-1) + 75 kg N fertilizer ha(-1); 15,000 kg pig dung ha(-1) + 60 kg N fertilizer ha(-1); 3,000 kg straw ha(-1) + 75 kg N fertilizer ha(-1)) were applied to tobacco while maize was fertilized with inorganic compound fertilizers. After 12 years of tobacco-maize rotation, the results showed that organic fertilizer additions elevate tobacco yield and quality, and the soil extracellular enzymes activities. Gram-negative bacteria, actinomycetes, and total soil microbial biomass were increased by organic fertilizer additions, both plant-based (oil cake and straw) and animal-based (pig dung) organics. The levels of soil organic matter, total organic carbon, total phosphorus and available phosphorus are higher in pig dung addition treatment than oil cake and straw additions. By variance analysis with respect to fertilization treatments, organic sources differentially affected the activities of diverse soil enzymes. The redundancy analysis gave that yield and quality of tobacco leaves (upper, middle, and lower leaves) positively related to soil extracellular enzyme activities. Based on analysis of yield and quality of tobacco leaves with extracellular enzyme activities and soil nutrients, it is suggested animal-based organic fertilizer, thus pig dung, should be used in combining with chemical fertilizers to improve the quality of tobacco and soil nutrients.

AB  - Blueberry gall midge, Dasineura oxycoccana (Johnson) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is a pest in American cranberry, Vaccinium macrocarpon Aiton (Ericales: Ericaceae) and wild blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton (Ericales: Ericaceae), and has been observed in areas of high soil and foliar nutrient levels. New management strategies, including fertilization, will need to be altered to sustain wild blueberry production under climate change and, in turn, may impact the occurrence of this pest. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of diammonium phosphate (DAP) fertilizer application on density of infested stems and the combined effects of fertilizer application with and without infestation on wild blueberry systems. This study was conducted at two field sites in Jonesboro and Washington, ME during 2020 and 2021. Despite increases in habitat availability (blueberry cover) for the gall midge and greater infestation density, wild blueberry production benefited from DAP application. This was shown in the number of buds per stem at both sites, as well as in stem height, flowers, green fruit, blue fruit per stem, and total yield at the Washington site. Foliar nitrogen and phosphorus levels had a significant positive linear relationship with infestation density. Growers applying fertilizers should monitor blueberry gall midge field infestation levels due to our findings that DAP fertilizer impacted infestation density and the interaction of DAP fertilizer with infestation impacted wild blueberry production.

AB  - Local adaptation is common in invasive plants, but there is no consensus as to whether shifts in functional traits between invader "home" and "away" ranges contribute to their success in competition with native species. Theory based on enemy release suggests that invaders should reallocate limiting resources away from nutritive-based defenses and toward high growth potential. However, empirical studies of home-away trait shifts are typically conducted on a single invader and fail to consider how environmental differences across regions may impact leaf trait syndromes. We measured nine defense-related leaf traits for 27 invasive species across their home and away ranges in France, Japan, and the United States, and compared them to distributions of those same traits for co-occurring native species in both their home and away ranges. Our study included a total of 21 woody species sampled under forest canopies, and 23 herbaceous species sampled in fields and roadsides. Traits included toxic leaf alkaloids and cyanogenic glycosides; structural attributes including cell wall mass and fiber content; carbon (C), nitrogen (N), C:N, and total protein content; and specific leaf area. We found significant overall shifts in both qualitative (alkaloids) and quantitative (fiber, cell wall, N content) defense traits, particularly in woody species that are hypothesized to be more apparent to herbivores. However, the direction of trait shifts was not consistent across regions. Rather, for seven of nine traits, trait means of invaders shifted toward the means of native species in the recipient communities, likely reflecting environmental differences among regions rather than a shift in allocation from defense to growth. We suggest this "join the locals" pattern, whereby trait shifts in invaders match regional differences in native trait syndromes due to environmental variation, is a reasonable null model for studies of adaptive evolution in invasive species. Although the "join the locals" pattern is not mutually exclusive with shifts in functional traits caused by enemy release, our study involving multiple species and habitats suggests environmental gradients override trait shifts driven by varying herbivore communities.

AB  - Periodic drought is one of the most frequent stressors for grassland plants under climate change, potentially inhibiting ecosystem productivity and stability through its legacy effects. Recent findings on plant stress memory and microbial legacy effects provide some unique perspectives on this issue. However, the mechanisms underlying intra- and inter-generational adaptation to drought in grassland plants are currently unclear. Here, we conducted a set of experiments using the perennial rhizome grass Leymus chinensis, the dominant species in the eastern Eurasian grasslands, aiming to examine the roles of (1) stress memory in intra-generational adaptation and clonal trans-generational plasticity and (2) phyllosphere/soil legacy effects in inter-generational adaptation to repeated drought events. We found that L. chinensis experiencing repeated drought had increased proline content, photosynthetic rate, and water retention capacity than those that did not experience repeated drought. This supports the hypothesis that stress memory is a key mechanism underlying within-generation physiological adaptation of plants. Moreover, clonal offspring of drought-exposed L. chinensis had poor growth but showed higher levels of tolerance to drought relative to the control group. Inoculation with drought-conditioned phyllosphere communities increased proline content but decreased the photosynthetic rate of L. chinensis. In contrast, drought-associated soil aided plant growth through legacy effects but did not affect proline content under repeated drought events. Overall, drought resilience enhances the ability of clonal L. chinensis to cope with repeated drought via intra-generational stress memory. Our findings highlight the importance of stress memory and the potential complementary effect of soil and phyllosphere legacy effects on plant growth and tolerance to repeated drought under climate change.

AB  - Small-scale fisheries represent an economically marginalized sector, that struggles to balance operational costs and profit from catches. Economic revenues from catches have declined due to overfishing, and additional costs may jeopardise the sustainability of the sector. In Greece, reported net damage from interaction with marine megafauna, especially the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) is a common occurrence for many coastal areas, where small-scale fisheries operate. A seasonal experimental trial took place during 2016-2017 in the northern Aegean Sea, in an area where large actively swimming marine organisms other than dolphins were lacking. Three gangs of different panels of net (mixed gill nets and trammel nets) were deployed in three different depth zones. For each gang, we recorded the number, size, and position of holes on each net, and assessed overall damage. Multifactor analysis was used to identify possible links between fishing practices and damage intensity. Results showed a correlation between reduced net damage by dolphins with larger mesh sizes and increasing depth. In the case of small mesh sizes, one should seek a combination of solutions, as changes in deployment depths alone, do not seem to be adequate for the depth ranges studied. The adoption of larger than 22 mm mesh size is proposed for all set nets, to increase net selectivity and decrease accumulated damage. Fishers should focus on adjusting, substituting or even ceasing specific fishing tactics to have the lowest possible economic loss, whereas fisheries scientists, managers and policy makers must monitor and offer guidance for this transition.

AB  - Marine vegetated habitats such as seagrass, mangroves, and macroalgae are common along tropical coastlines globally and provide habitats for a diversity of fishes, including juvenile fish and species found on coral reefs. Understanding the use of these habitats by different fish species and life stages is fundamental to spatial planning, fisheries management, and conservation. While previous studies have focused on the habitat potential of seagrass, macroalgae, or mangroves for coral reef fish independently, it is important to consider their combined roles, as tropical seascapes are often mosaics of such habitats. In this study, we evaluated habitat associations across life stages for fish species in coral reefs, seagrasses, macroalgae, and mangroves in Saudi Arabia's central Red Sea. Through in situ visual surveys, we documented 36% of local coral reef fish species in one or more vegetated habitats, with the fraction of coral reef species utilizing macroalgae or seagrass much greater than that of mangroves ( 29%, 18%, and 6%, respectively). Mangroves hosted mainly juvenile fish (83% of observed population) and macroalgae hosted the largest proportion of herbivores (39% of observed population), suggesting that each environment offers different combinations of resources (food and shelter), and a mix of these habitats could support biological connectivity across a seascape. Species targeted by local fisheries made up 37% of the species documented in vegetated habitats. The use of multiple habitat types by juvenile and commercially important fishes in the Red Sea underscores the need for a holistic approach to habitat protection.

AB  - The plant species of the Caatinga biome are food sources of great importance for herds. Goat farming is one of the most explored agricultural activities in the Northeast region of Brazil, where goats are important seed dispersers in semiarid areas. In this study, we evaluate the passage of seeds of four Caatinga forest species through goats' digestive system, their recovery, and the effect on seed germination (Ger). A completely randomized experimental design was used. The seeds of four species Piptadenia stipulacea, Mimosa tenuiflora, Desmanthus virgatus, and Mimosa caesalpiniifolia were provided to eight goats and evaluated after nine excretion periods (12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 108 h). Seed recovery was low, with values of 10.87% for M. tenuiflora, 3.41% for P. stipulacea, 2.04% for M. caesalpiniifolia, and 1.54% for D. virgatus. The seeds of D. virgatus and M. tenuiflora are small and pass faster through goats' digestive system, with the largest amount recovered 48 h after ingestion. In contrast, P. stipulacea and M. caesalpiniifolia seeds are retained for a longer period in the intestine of the animals, with the highest number obtained 72 and 96 h after, respectively. The passage of seeds through the digestive system of D. virgatus for 24 h and P. stipulacea for 72 h, promoted the overcoming of dormancy, reaching Ger values of 66.7 and 35.7%, respectively. The Ger of M. tenuiflora seeds as well as the Ger and survival of M. caesalpiniifolia seeds decreased after passing through the digestive system. The recovery of seeds from the four species indicates that goats are efficient seed dispersers in Caatinga areas.

AB  - Grey wolf (Canis lupus), golden jackal (Canis aureus), coyote (Canis latrans) and stray dog (Canis familiaris) are having increasing population trends in Europe and the United States, fuelling humanpredator conflict. Predation on livestock is causing devastating losses both in terms of finance and resources to local communities. We investigated the extent to which these canine predators depend on livestock as their food source by performing a systematic literature analysis. We predicted that the wolf feeds the most livestock and selects larger domestic animals compared to jackals, coyotes and dogs. The information retrieved from 115 scientific publications included the frequency of occurrence (%O) and biomass proportion (%B) of livestock species in the predators' diet. Our analyses revealed that wolves consumed significantly more livestock than the golden jackal and coyote. Statistical analyses indicated that in case of wolves, cattle and goats were chosen the most compared to any other species of livestock. For jackals the consumption of pig was significantly higher than equines and sheep. There was little data on coyotes and dogs, although we found higher consumption of pig compared to the cattle in case of coyotes and no differences in livestock species consumption frequencies in case of dogs. Most studies reported that domestic species in wolf diets have been observed in areas where the wild prey availability is degraded. Predator management differs among countries and is continuously influenced by a number of unique, local factors modifying the predation rates and the intensity of this human-wildlife conflict. It is a priority to identify the real mechanism and cause of the livestock predation and set adaptive steps for its elimination.

AB  - Medium-sized deer are frequently found in Early Pleistocene fossiliferous deposits of Southern Europe, and hence they represent a reference group for the Villafranchian fauna. Their evolutionary history is still highly debated, as multiple classifications and systematic revisions have been proposed with specimens being ascribed to several genera such as Pseudodama, , Metacervoceros, , Euraxis, , Praeelaphus, , Axis, , Dama, , or Cervus. . Whereas most studies focus on the taxonomy of the group, a few have addressed how these cervids evolved in relation to the major Early Pleistocene climatic events such as the onset of the Quaternary glaciations. A remarkably rich collection of Dama-like deer has been unearthed from the Early Pleistocene site of Pirro Nord (Apricena, south-eastern Italy). Here we analyse palaeoecological and palaeoneurological data of the Pirro Nord sample to investigate both habitat occupation and the evolutionary history of this group during the Early Pleistocene. To do so, we integrate dietary proxies (dental wear patterns and stable isotope signal) with morphological data from a virtual endocast of a well-preserved male specimen, a largely unexplored research path in cervid palaeobiology studies. Moreover, palaeoneurological data may also provide clues to solve the systematic issue of this group. Dental mesowear results point to a long-term mixed diet for the Pirro Nord deer, while a leaning towards a grazing behaviour is suggested by dental microwear patterns. The range of the stable isotope delta 13C 13 C ratios suggests that it foraged on abrasive water-stressed C3 vegetation in warm woodland and semi-open habitats. Palaeoneurological data seems to confirm a closer affinity in the endocranial morphology of this taxon to the extant fallow deer Dama compared to other Early Pleistocene forms. Our research represents a novel approach to the study of Early Pleistocene fossil deer palaeoecology that can be extended also to other groups to investigate their evolutionary history in relation to climate changes.

AB  - Increasing evidence has shown that introducing broadleaved trees into coniferous plantations can regulate hydrologic stores and fluxes; however, the effects and regulatory mechanisms of species mixing on the water conservation capacity of the litter-soil continuum remain poorly understood, and differences among tree species may appear. Herein, we investigated and compared the water conservation capacity of the litter layer (semi-decomposed and decomposed layer) and soil layer (0-100 cm) in a monoculture plantation (Pinus massoniana) and five mixed plantations (Pinus massoniana mixed with Cercidiphyllum japonicum, Manglietia chingii, Camellia oleifera, Michelia maudiae, and Bretschneidera sinensis) and comprehensively considered their potential influencing factors. We discovered that the identity of broadleaved tree species significantly affected the water storage of litter and soil in the mixed plantations (p < 0.05). The effective water-holding capacity of the litter (13.39 t center dot ha(-1)) was low due to the coniferous litter's simple structure and challenging breakdown, despite the fact that the litter stock of the monoculture plantation was substantially larger than that of the mixed plantation (14.72 t center dot ha(-1)). Introducing deep-rooted tree species (e.g., Bretschneidera sinensis and Camellia oleifera) into Pinus massoniana farmsteads improved the soil-pore structure and aggregate stability, thereby significantly increasing the 0-100 cm soil water storage. Furthermore, we found that litter storage, soil organic carbon, and litter thickness, as key influencing factors, have complex effects on the water storage of the litter-soil continuum. Generally, these findings demonstrated that mixed plantations can potentially improve the water conservation capacity of the litter-soil system. Nevertheless, special attention should be given to the complementarity between tree species combinations.

AB  - Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) play a crucial role in mammalian spermatogenesis and maintain the stable inheritance of the germline in livestock. However, stress and bacterial or viral infections can disrupt immune homeostasis of the testes, thereby leading to spermatogenesis destruction and infertility, which severely affects the health and productivity of mammals. This study aimed to explore the effect of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) knockdown (KD) in goat SSCs and mouse testes and investigate the potential anti-inflammatory function of UCHL1 in a poly(I:C)-induced inflammation model to maintain microenvironmental homeostasis. In vitro, the downregulation of UCHL1 (UCHL1 KD) in goat SSCs increased the expression levels of apoptosis and inflammatory factors and inhibited the self-renewal and proliferation of SSCs. In vivo, the structure of seminiferous tubules and spermatogenic cells was disrupted after UCHL1 KD, and the expression levels of apoptosis- and inflammation-related proteins were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, UCHL1 inhibited the TLR3/TBK1/IRF3 pathway to resist poly(I:C)-induced inflammation in SSCs by antagonizing HSPA8 and thus maintaining SSC autoimmune homeostasis. Most importantly, the results of this study showed that UCHL1 maintained immune homeostasis of SSCs and spermatogenesis. UCHL1 KD not only inhibited the self-renewal and proliferation of goat SSCs and spermatogenesis but was also involved in the inflammatory response of goat SSCs. Additionally, UCHL1 has an antiviral function in SSCs by antagonizing HSPA8, which provides an important basis for exploring the specific mechanisms of UCHL1 in goat spermatogenesis.

AB  - Elephant conservation in Africa occurs within and beyond gazetted protected areas. We collared and tracked 19 male and seven female savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) in Gonarezhou National Park (GNP), Zimbabwe, between 2016 and 2022. We investigated the extent of elephant activity outside the park and the role that season and diel played in this. We further documented habitat use, including the use of human-dominated landscapes. Our results showed that male elephants were more likely to move outside the GNP than females, dispersing at greater distances than females. Male elephants moved as far as 60 km from Gonarezhou, while females typically did not disperse farther than 15 km. Most movement outside protected area boundaries were during the cool-dry season (April-July). Male and female elephants returned to the GNP during the hot-wet season (December to March). When outside the GNP, male elephants preferred forested land cover types, while females remained in shrublands. Collared elephants avoided areas adjacent to GNP where human population densities were high. Surface water may also play a role in elephant movement outside of Gonarezhou, but we did not have reliable data to validate this. Our results indicate some use of areas neighbouring GNP by elephants, particularly in Mozambique, but not widespread dispersal. Conservation implications: To achieve a stable elephant population growth rate in GNP, conservation planning in the region should consider immediate interventions for addressing barriers to the movement of elephants to Zinave and Banhine National Parks in Mozambique to avoid the risk of escalating fragmentation of the landscape. In addition, the communal area linking Gonarezhou to Kruger National Park should be prioritised for conservation efforts and pilot projects to test the functionality of the Sengwe corridor.

AB  - Cumulative evidence has revealed that particulate matter from swine confinement buildings (SCBs) is a reservoir of zoonotic pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from feces, which have been associated with the growth stage of pigs. SCB bioaerosols can spread over long distances to the external environment, posing a significant risk to public health. However, the bacterial microbiome and resistome profiles of SCB bioaerosols and their relationship with the growth stages of pigs are not well understood. In this study, 24 bioaerosol samples from buildings separately housing weaning piglets (WP), growing-finishing pigs (FP), gestation sows (GS), and farrowing sows (FS) were used to determine the bacterial microbiome and resistome of the indoor air of SCBs using next-generation high throughput sequencing approaches. The results indicated that FP bioaerosols exhibited the highest alpha diversity and ARG abundance. The composition of the bacterial microbiome and resistome of SCB bioaerosols varied according to the growth stage of the pigs. The most abundant phyla and ARG types were Proteobacteria and aminoglycosides, respectively, across the four types of SCBs. Three potential pathogens and 18 possible ARG host genera were found to occur in the SCB bioaerosols. The highest abundances of dominant potential pathogens (Acinetobacter) and ARG subtypes (aph(3"')-III) were observed in the FP bioaerosols. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between the bacterial microbiome and the resistome in bioaerosols from the SCBs. It can be concluded that the growth stage of pigs exerted a significant effect on the bacterial microbiome and resistome profiles of the indoor air of SCBs.

AB  - Sympatric species with similar niches compete for common resources, often resulting in spatio-temporal avoidance. To date, little is known about the spatio-temporal interactions of ungulates in forested habitats. Using camera traps, we investigated the spatio-temporal responses of alpine chamois to the presence of red deer in the mountain forests of northern Croatia during the four seasons of 2018/2019. We hypothesized that chamois activity patterns should be affected by the presence of red deer, leading to either temporal or spatial segregation between the species. Our results showed that chamois tended to be more active during the day when red deer were absent, and showed contrasting patterns of activity across seasons, from bimodal to multimodal. However, temporal overlap coefficients between chamois and red deer were moderate throughout the study period, ranging from 0.57 in summer to 0.68 in autumn. Conversely, we found inconsistent/random occupancy patterns of chamois and red deer at different camera trap locations in different seasons. Our results are among the few available data on the interaction of these two species in forested areas and suggest weak effects of red deer on the spatio-temporal behaviour of Alpine chamois. However, finer-scale data may be required to better understand the relationship between these species.

AB  - Large-sized herbivores in cold regions often suffer from deep snow, which sharply increases their physio-behavioral costs. Among such animals, sika deer (Cervus nippon) have recently expanded their distribution into northern mainland Japan, one of the snowiest regions on Earth. In this study, we aimed to reveal the overwintering foraging tactics adopted by sika deer in these regions. We recorded the feeding marks of sedentary deer for 3 years with different snow accumulations by surveying transects established in southwestern Fukushima (total lengths: 145.5, 133.6, and 172.9 km in 2021-2023, respectively) and analyzed the composition and selectivity of food plants. Our key findings are as follows: (1) sedentary deer fed on the branch tips and bark of 112 woody plant species; (2) although the expected species richness of plants consumed by the deer differed only slightly between different snow conditions based on rarefaction/extrapolation analysis, food plant composition varied widely across the years (Bray-Curtis index >0.5 between every pair of years); (3) Manly's selectivity index indicated that the compositions of positively and negatively selected plant species were sensitive to different snow conditions; and (4) deer relied heavily on bark when snow depth increased; specifically, the probability of debarking when deer fed on plants in the heavy snow year was seven times higher than in the light snow year. These findings reveal that sedentary deer adopt euryphagous and opportunistic feeding tactics by switching their dietary composition to readily available foods in response to different snow conditions.

AB  - Leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) are top-order predators that prey on a wide variety of species including crustaceans, cephalopods, fishes, birds, and pinnipeds. While multiple diet studies have been conducted worldwide, there are no previous accounts of leopard seals predating on chondrichthyans. As part of a wider study on the diet of leopard seals in New Zealand (NZ) waters, researchers and citizen scientists recorded 39 observations of predation and collected 127 scats (166 total records) between 1942 and 2019. Predation on chondrichthyans was detected in 23.1% (n = 9) of observations of predation and 7.1% (n = 9) of scats (the latter via morphological examination and DNA sequencing). From both observations of predations and scats, three chondrichthyan species or genus were identified; elephantfish (Callorhinchus milii), ghost sharks (Hydrolagus spp.) and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). While this is the first published record of leopard seals feeding on chondrichthyans, the relatively high frequency of occurrence within our NZ records, and that certain individuals appeared to target this type of prey, indicates that these species could constitute a substantial, or important, part of the diet for some leopard seals in this region. As chondrichthyans form an important part of the NZ marine ecosystems, our recognition of an additional top-order predator of these species contributes to understanding the overall health of, and future impacts of predators on, the wider NZ marine ecosystem.

AB  - Abundance estimation is a critical component of conservation planning, particularly for exploited species where managers set regulations to restrict harvest based on current population size. An increasingly common approach for abundance estimation is through integrated population modeling (IPM), which uses multiple data sources in a joint likelihood to estimate abundance and additional demographic parameters. Lincoln estimators are one commonly used IPM component for harvested species, which combine information on the rate and total number of individuals harvested within an integrated band-recovery framework to estimate abundance at large scales. A major assumption of the Lincoln estimator is that banding and recoveries are representative of the whole population, which may be violated if major sources of spatial heterogeneity in survival or harvest rates are not incorporated into the model. We developed an approach to account for spatial variation in harvest rates using a spatial predictive process, which we incorporated into a Lincoln estimator IPM. We simulated data under different configurations of sample sizes, harvest rates, and sources of spatial heterogeneity in harvest rate to assess potential model bias in parameter estimates. We then applied the model to data collected from a field study of wild turkeys (Meleagris gallapavo) to estimate local and statewide abundance in Maine, USA. We found that the band recovery model that incorporated a spatial predictive process consistently provided estimates of adult and juvenile abundance with low bias across a variety of spatial configurations of harvest rate and sampling intensities. When applied to data collected on wild turkeys, a model that did not incorporate spatial heterogeneity underestimated the harvest rate in some subregions. Consistent with simulation results, this led to overestimation of both local and statewide abundance. Our work demonstrates that a spatial predictive process is a viable mechanism to account for spatial variation in harvest rates and limit bias in abundance estimates. This approach could be extended to large-scale band recovery data sets and has applicability for the estimation of population parameters in other ecological models as well.

AB  - 1. Playing video games is often perceived as the antithesis of engaging with, and learning about, the natural world. Nevertheless, there is growing recognition that digital media is now a central part of many people's lives. This has led to increased efforts to harness the power and popularity of digital games for both ecological education and conservation advocacy.
   2. Games designed for educational purposes may be perceived as too niche, or have insufficient resources, to reach wider audiences. In contrast, big budget video games reach many millions of players, but are generally designed for entertainment rather than education. Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2), a Western-themed action-adventure game, is one such product. Nevertheless, due to its detailed, open-world simulation of late 19th century North American ecosystems, it provides opportunities for players to learn about real-world wildlife.
   3. We surveyed self-described gamers who both had, and had not, played RDR2. Participants undertook a wildlife identification quiz focusing on 15 species depicted in the game. We also asked participants about their self-reported learning and experiences of playing RDR2.
   4. We found that participants who had played RDR2 correctly identified more species in the quiz, with this improvement enhanced by having completed the game's main storyline, played more recently or played online in a 'Naturalist' role. The difference in performance was greatest for ungulate and fish species which have high in-game utility value.
   5. In addition to species identification, participants reported learning about animal behaviours and interspecies interactions. Their most memorable experiences were associated with RDR2's immersive environment and ability to provoke emotional responses.
   6. We conclude that big-budget video games can have educational as well as entertainment value and should be taken seriously by educators, ecologists and conservationists as a communicative force.

AB  - The response of plants to a warming climate could have a large feedback on further climatic change. This feedback is especially important for tropical forests, where the global peak in plant productivity and biodiversity occurs. Here we test the response of tropical forest tree seedling growth, photosynthesis and herbivory to 3 years of in situ full-soil profile warming. We studied six species, three of which are known nitrogen-fixers and we hypothesized that the warming response of growth will be mediated by nutrient availability to plants. Across species, growth was significantly lower in warmed soil compared to soil at ambient temperature, and the same pattern was observed for light-saturated photosynthesis, pointing toward a growth decline associated with decreased C fixation. Within species, the relative growth decline was significant for two species, Inga laurina and Tachigali versicolor, both of which are N-fixers. Together our results suggest a growth decline may have resulted from a negative effect of warming on N-fixation, rather than via changes in nutrient mineralization from soil organic matter, which was unchanged for N and increased for P during the dry-to-wet season transition. Overall, our study demonstrates that belowground warming causes species-specific declines in the growth and photosynthesis of seedlings, with a suggestion-requiring further investigation-that this growth decline is larger in N-fixing species.Abstract in Spanish is available with online material.

AB  - ContextUrban landscapes present a diverse matrix of structures and habitats containing significant physical and behavioural barriers to terrestrial wildlife dispersal. Yet, our understanding of these barriers for large mammals in the context of genetic connectivity within urbanising landscapes is limited.ObjectiveWe investigated the effects of landscape structures on the genetic differentiation of a large herbivorous macropodid, the Eastern Grey Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), within the Sunshine Coast region of Australia. We tested whether genetic differentiation and gene flow in this rapidly urbanising environment was best explained by landscape structures (Isolation-by-Resistance) or geographical distances (Isolation-by-Distance), at multiple spatial scales.MethodsWe simulated ecological succession from genetic (n = 130), and spatial datasets (n = 48) to quantify the strength of the relationship between observed genetic distances and landscape structures. A multiscale design was used to assess spatio-genetic impacts at different spatial scales. Circuit theory methods were used to simulate ecological successions and subsequently infer landscape effects on observed genetic differentiations.ResultsGenetic differentiation was explained primarily by vegetation structures, major waterways, roads and built infrastructure. Changes in biophysical variables related to vegetation health and moisture explained gene flow unilaterally in fine-scale scenarios, while built infrastructure best explained broad-scale genetic differences. Influence of landscape structures were scale-dependent, with biophysical and built infrastructures exhibiting the most variability across scales.ConclusionOur results suggest that gene flow between M. giganteus populations is highly dependent on the structure of the landscape, and influenced by anthropogenic structures. As such, emphasis on gene flow pathways of M. giganteus, and other large mammals, is required in conservation planning. The findings of this study can inform spatially-guided management decisions and long-term conservation strategies for large mammals under growing urban pressures worldwide.

AB  - Wild pigs (Sus scrofa) pose significant challenges to wildlife managers. This research explored Texas hunters' acceptability of wild pig control actions, and whether acceptability varied according to hunters' affiliation with four different categories of natural resource organizations as an indicator of social identity. Results of a survey (n = 37,317) revealed that most hunters were accepting of all control actions except toxicants and non-lethal deterrents. Mean acceptability scores for each action differed significantly across the four affiliation categories, but effect sizes were minimal. Hunters affiliated with agricultural organizations were the most accepting of control actions, while hunters with no organizational affiliations were least accepting. Findings suggested that while the type of organization with which a hunter affiliates provides some basis for predicting acceptability of control actions, the association is likely not significant enough to warrant differentiating wild pig outreach messaging on the basis of affiliation.

AB  - Simple Summary Yak is the dominant animal species in China's plateau regions. The development of the yak industry is conducive to protecting the ecosystem of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and promoting local economic development. However, the slow growth and development of yak have seriously affected the development of the yak industry. Structural variation (SV) has been widely applied in livestock breeding for growth traits. Therefore, it is of great significance to use SV to improve yak growth traits in yak breeding. Meanwhile, the GHR gene plays an important role in the formation and normal development of bones. This study associated the correlation between the yak GHR SV gene and growth traits and confirmed that GHR-SV can be used as a molecular marker for the early reproduction of yaks. This study provides a theoretical basis for the early growth and development of yaks. The growth hormone receptor (GHR) is a member of the cytokine/hematopoietic factor receptor superfamily, which plays an important role in the growth and development, immunity, and metabolism of animals. This study identified a 246 bp deletion variant in the intronic region of the GHR gene, and three genotypes, including type II, type ID, and type DD, were observed. Genotype analysis of structural variation (SV) was performed on 585 individuals from 14 yak breeds, and it was found that 246 bp deletion was present in each breed. The II genotype was dominant in all yak breeds except for SB yak. The association analysis of gene polymorphisms and growth traits in the ASD yak population showed that the 246 bp SV was significantly associated with body length at 6 months (p < 0.05). GHR messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed in all the tested tissues, with significantly higher levels in the liver, muscle, and fat than in other organs. The results of transcription activity showed that the luciferase activity of the pGL4.10-DD vector was significantly higher than that of the pGL4.10-II vector (p < 0.05). Additionally, the transcription-factor binding prediction results showed that the SV in the runt-related transcription factor 1 (Runx1) transcription-factor binding site may affect the transcriptional activity of the GHR gene, regulating yak growth and development. This study showed that the novel SV of the GHR gene could be used as a candidate molecular marker for the selection of the early growth trait in ASD yak.

AB  - This study compared phosphorus (P) transformation, microbial succession, and functional gene dynamics during facultative and aerobic composting of pig and chicken manures, using 16S rRNA sequencing and PICRUSt2-based functional prediction. The results showed that, compared to facultative composting, aerobic composting increased thermophilic-phase temperature, reduced electrical conductivity, and improved the germination index (GI), indicating better maturity and lower phytotoxicity. Aerobic composting significantly enhanced total P (TP) accumulation (Pig manure, p < 0.001; Chicken manure, p < 0.05) and plant-available fractions (H2O-P and NaHCO3-P), whereas facultative composting favored the formation of more stable, less bioavailable fractions (NaOH-P and HCl-P). Aerobic treatments also induced more dynamic microbial shifts, complex networks, and higher expression of key genes (phoA, PHO, gcd, mdh), whereas facultative conditions upregulated high-affinity phosphate transporter genes (pstA, pstB, pstC). Correlation analysis revealed that P-cycling functional genes were closely associated with GI, TP, and labile P fractions, with stronger microbe-environment-function coupling observed under aerobic composting. These findings highlight mechanistic differences in P mobilization between facultative and aerobic treatments, which provide insights for optimizing manure composting for enhanced P recovery.

AB  - Italy is home to several indigenous goat breeds with great economic and cultural implications, but their genetic makeup remains largely unexplored. This study used the Illumina Goat SNP chip to genotype 142 samples from four Italian goat breeds: Capestrina, Fulva, Grigia Ciociara, and Bianca Monticellana. The genotypes were combined with genome-wide SNP data from 31 Italian breeds to evaluate the genetic profile of Lazio's indigenous goats. After filtering, the dataset included 51,423 SNPs. Genetic structure and diversity were assessed using MDS, ADMIXTURE analysis and inbreeding coefficients. Focusing on the four Lazio breeds, we examined inbreeding levels (FROH), effective population size (Ne), gene exchange, and runs of homozygosity islands (ROHi). The Bianca appeared highly inbred, whereas Fulva, Capestrina, and Grigia showed heterozygosity levels comparable to other breeds. The increased sample sizes highlighted changes in genetic composition, indeed, ADMIXTURE analysis revealed genetic substructures within Bianca and Fulva. The Ne was found to be declining, with Bianca having the lowest Ne, indicating high susceptibility to inbreeding and genetic drift. The NetView analysis identified two interconnected genetic groups corresponding to: Bianca and Fulva. Key contributors to genetic structure, representing ancestral genotypes, were identified, providing targets for conservation. Moreover, ROH analysis pinpointed individuals with excessive ROH and long homozygosity stretches, particularly in Capestrina and Bianca, which could be limited from breeding to preserve genetic diversity. Finally, ROHi revealed genes linked to coat colour, disease resistance, and heat stress tolerance. These conclusions emphasise the importance of local breeds in maintaining biodiversity and enhancing breeding strategies.

AB  - A human -leopard conflict (HLC) is said to be any type of interaction that results in a mutually harmful effect on wildlife and humans. In recent decades, the scope and intensity of the HLC have increased due to the growth of the human population, changes in land use patterns, inefficient nature protection measures, and manipulation of nature. The study of habitats is considered vital to know their current situation and to think of solutions to solve emerging HLCs. Also, investigating the attitude of human local communities toward carnivores in the habitat where these HLCs is necessary for the management and protection of these species. Therefore, identifying the habitat needs of this valuable species is one of the essential needs of managers. Determining the distribution status of wildlife species and the status of their occupied habitats is important in managing wildlife and habitats. Social factors such as the attitude of human local communities are considered one of the most important factors affecting the HLC. To reach an effective management decision to reduce HLC, we investigated the factors affecting the attitude of human local communities toward this species in the conservation areas of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province. In this research, to investigate the attitude of human local communities, we used a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions. According to the nature of the work, we selected 256 questionnaires related to the people who had the closest population center to the interviewed site. We interviewed the people who had the most knowledge and information about the local wildlife. The obtained results showed that the most damage to the property of human local communities is the attack on sheep and then domestic goats. The main reason can probably be due to the lack of main prey, as well as the entry of livestock into the range of the leopard's habitat in the slopes of protected areas or free areas. The results showed that knowledge of local communities about the leopard was effective in the positive attitude and interest in its presence, and the fear of the leopard did not cause a negative attitude and lack of interest in it. However, due to the increase of HLCs in recent years in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad provinces, economic losses may increase the retaliatory measures by the human local communities and endanger the survival of this species.

AB  - Sheep grazing is increasingly being considered by winegrape growers to manage cover crop growth in Mediterranean vineyards, a practice that could contribute to reducing fertilizer inputs, coupling the cycles of C and N and increasing soil health. Nevertheless, short-term increases in available soil C and N could trigger the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). We carried out a field experiment in a Mediterranean vineyard of the Central Coast of California to investigate the short-term effects of grazing in combination with tillage on soil C, N and GHG emissions. Tillage and grazing treatments were combined in a full factorial design with 16 plots. Gas samples were collected using static chambers during the main management events from the tractor row and the soil under the vines within each plot. Gas samples were collected through two years, including two wet and two dry seasons and analyzed to assess daily fluxes and cumulative seasonal emisions of N2O, CH4 and CO2. In spring each year we collected soil samples from 0 to 15 and 15-30 cm depths of the vine and tractor rows of each plot, and from 0 to 15 cm depth at the time of gas sample collection. We observed that sheep grazing did not produce an increase in available soil N and C, but resulted in sporadic and localized peaks in daily N2O, CH4 and CO2 emissions. Nevertheless emissions were not significantly larger than non-grazed soils when extrapolated to the cumulative emissions of the whole season. The combination of tillage and grazing increased N2O emissions from the soil under the vine potentially due to increased nitrification rates. Sheep grazing and tillage did not have a significant effect on the yield and quality of the grapes during the two years of the study.

AB  - Invasive freshwater fish can often have severe negative effects on native fishes in river systems. The interactions between hydrology and habitat variability can mediate the speed and success of individual invasions and the consequent impact on biodiversity. The rivers within Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) in the Eastern Cape, South Africa experience cyclical droughts and wet periods and as a result are naturally episodic. These rivers were recently invaded by three non-native species, the invasive largemouth bass ( Micropterus salmoides ) as well as the extralimital sharptooth catfish ( Clarias gariepinus ) and Mozambique tilapia ( Oreochromis mossambicus ). Monitoring of key sampling sites along two rivers over a 12-year period that included two major droughts revealed unexpected patterns in the spread of these species and their interactions with native fishes. On the Coerney River, C. gariepinus repeatedly invaded and was extirpated from a seasonal reach of the river, wherein O. mossambicus was only occasionally captured. On the Wit River, two apparently independent introductions of M. salmoides in the lower and upper reaches of the river resulted in patchy habitat occupancy over the course of 12 years. While C. gariepinus regularly co-occurred with native species, M. salmoides appeared to locally extirpate the endangered Eastern Cape redfin ( Pseudobarbus afer ). During drought, both species persisted in close but disconnected pools, suggesting that the episodic hydrology and geomorphology of these rivers may offer temporary predation refugia for native species during drought. Conservation implications: Drought in episodic rivers can mitigate against the impact and spread of freshwater invasions within protected areas. Effects of drying on invasion corridors and spatial interactions with native species should be taken into consideration when managing such invasions. Severe droughts also offer an opportunity to actively control invasive species when they are confined to accessible drought refugia within the protected area.

AB  - Urban development can fragment and degrade remnant habitat. Such habitat alterations can have profound impacts on wildlife, including effects on population density, parasite infection status, parasite prevalence, and body condition. We investigated the influence of urbanization on populations of Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami) and their parasites. We predicted that urban development would lead to reduced abundance, increased parasite prevalence in urban populations, increased probability of parasite infection for individual animals, and decreased body condition of kangaroo rats in urban versus wildland areas. We live trapped kangaroo rats at 5 urban and 5 wildland sites in and around Las Cruces, NM, USA from 2013 to 2015, collected fecal samples from 209 kangaroo rats, and detected endoparasites using fecal flotation and molecular barcoding. Seven parasite species were detected, although only two parasitic worms, Mastophorus dipodomis and Pterygodermatites dipodomis, occurred frequently enough to allow for statistical analysis. We found no effects of urbanization on population density or probability of parasite infection. However, wildland animals infected with P. dipodomis had lower body condition scores than infected animals in urban areas or uninfected animals in either habitat. Our results suggest that urban environments may buffer Merriam's kangaroo rats from the detrimental impacts to body condition that P. dipodomis infections can cause.

AB  - Many protected areas provide opportunities for people to view wildlife using roads and walking trails. The impacts of roads and trails on wildlife populations, however, have seldom been investigated by examining their consequences on individual animals. We studied the impacts of a road and use of a wildlife viewing trail on eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus) in Wilsons Promontory National Park, Australia. We analyzed 11 years of data from 433 marked individuals to quantify road mortality, and how distance from the road, where the walking trail started, affected survival, movement, and reproductive success. Kangaroos in the west of the study area, nearer the road and around a popular wildlife viewing trail, showed increased mobility, more vehicleassociated mortality, and decreased weaning success and survival, compared to kangaroos in the east that were exposed to substantially fewer visitors. Mature males, the sex-age class most likely to be killed by vehicles, had a 51 % higher probability of road mortality at the western than at the eastern end, contributing to a 47 % decrease in overall survival. Prime-aged females at the western end of the study area, where they experienced frequent exposure to visitors, had a 45 % lower probability of weaning a young compared to females in the east of the study area. Managers should consider these undesirable impacts when planning how to encourage people to interact with wildlife in protected areas.

AB  - Sulphur cinquefoil (Potentilla recta L.) is an invasive perennial forb threatening rangelands in western North America. To identify best management strategies to control P. recta, we examined targeted goat (Capra hircus L.) grazing conducted once (pre-flowering) versus twice (pre-flowering and flowering and seed set), aminopyralid application, and integrated targeted grazing and aminopyralid as management strategies. We also examined the interaction between treatments and seasonality (spring and summer) and explored the possibility of off-target effects to non-target species. Two intermountain rangelands in British Columbia, Canada, were treated, one with targeted grazing treatments only and one with targeted grazing and herbicide treatments. Targeted grazing treatments were implemented in 2019 and 2020, and aminopyralid was applied once in 2019 at a rate of 56 g ai ha(-1). Potentilla recta aboveground biomass and number of seed heads declined following targeted grazing treatments at both field sites in 2019 and 2020 when compared with the control, with no differences between targeted grazing treatments. In May 2020, before the implementation of targeted grazing for the second year, a decrease in P. recta biomass was not measured in the targeted grazing treatments, but biomass was 87% to 99% less in the herbicide-only and targeted grazing plus herbicide treatments. In July 2020, declines in biomass and seed heads in the herbicide-only and targeted grazing plus herbicide treatments did not differ from grazing twice, and aminopyralid effects did not differ among the three herbicide treatments. Further research is required to examine legacy effects of targeted goat grazing and aminopyralid on P. recta, establish reapplication frequency of treatments, and determine whether integrating targeted goat grazing and aminopyralid is needed in the long term to manage P. recta. A long-term study is also needed to examine off-target effects from targeted goat grazing and aminopyralid and ways to mitigate these effects to promote healthy native rangeland plant communities.

AB  - Creole goat milk is a valuable product for human consumption. Its physicochemical characteristics could be influenced by altitude and lactation stage. In this work, we evaluated several chemical and physical conditions of Creole goat milk in semiarid rangeland. The main results indicated that protein and density are influenced by altitude, while fat, freezing point, and pH are influenced by the lactation stage. One of the most nutritional values of goat milk is the type and concentration of fatty acids. In this work, we found that the effect of the agroecological region was minimal on their concentration. The lactation stage affected the composition of medium-chain fatty acids and linoelaidic acid. We concluded that nutrition by altitude and goat genetic background could contribute to milk composition.
   Goat milk composition is affected by feeding, and in semiarid rangeland, information on Creole goat milk physicochemical composition is lacking. For the fulfillment of this objective, three agroecological regions (AR) considering altitude (lowland 87, highland 779, and mountain 1309 m above sea level) with different botanical compositions were chosen. Every AR analyzed accounted for 30 goat herds, with a total of 90 herds. The results demonstrated that altitude had an influence mainly on density and protein. Milk density increases as altitude increases; conversely, milk protein increases as altitude decreases. On the other hand, in the mountain and lowland ARs, the salts and solids not fat (SNF) percentages were higher compared to that of the highland AR (p < 0.05). The freezing point (FP) was higher at highland altitudes compared to that of mountain and lowland ARs (p < 0.01). In the milk fatty acids (FA) profile, only the C14:1 value was affected by altitude, whereas goat milk at lowland and mountain altitudes had higher values compared to that at highland altitudes (p < 0.05). Additionally, late lactation stage fat, FP, and pH values were higher compared to early lactation values. The opposite effect was observed for salts and SNF. In the FA profile, late lactation values were higher for C10:0 and C8:0 compared to early lactation values. The opposite trend was observed for C18:2n6t. The thrombogenic index was significantly higher at lowland altitudes compared to highland altitudes, and similar to the mountain AR. These goat milk characteristics could be explained as a consequence of animal nutrition, as well as the goat's meat-type phenotype.

AB  - Reproduction in young females can show a particularly sensitive response to environmental challenges, although empirical support from individual-based long-term studies is scarce. Based on a 20-year data set from a free-roaming Przewalski's horse population (Equus ferus przewalskii), we studied effects of large-herbivore density (horses + cattle) and weather conditions experienced during different life stages on females' annual birth rates. Foaling probability was very low in 2-year-olds, reaching maximum values in 5 to 10-year-olds, followed by a decrease in older females indicating reproductive senescence. Mother's previous reproductive investment affected her current reproduction; young and old mothers (as opposed to middle-aged ones), which had nursed a foal for at least 60 days during the previous year, reproduced with a lower probability. Foaling probability and body condition of young females were lower when large-herbivore density was high. Reproduction was also influenced by interactive weather effects during different life stages. Low late-summer precipitation during the females' year of birth was associated with a pronounced decrease in foaling probability in response to harsh late-winter temperatures prior to the mating season. In turn, increased amounts of late-summer rain during this early age together with more late-summer rain during the females' current pregnancy led to an increased reproductive probability in 2-3-year-olds. These results were corroborated by the ameliorating effects of late-summer rain on body condition in such females. In conclusion, our findings highlight the interactive importance of weather conditions experienced during early life, and of density and weather during current pregnancy on foaling probability, particularly in young females.

AB  - Human-wildlife encounters are characterized by a diverse array of engagements located on the continuum between the negative and the positive. In India, protracted conflict with wildlife is reflected in violence across a range of rural and urban ecologies, but is only one aspect of the multiple facets of ongoing human-non-human encounter. Within these shared spaces, there are often equally significant elements of acceptance, tolerance and reverence. Together, these are dependent on context, and can be explored via lived experiences and worldviews, and a moral economy of human-wildlife and human-human relationships. Historically, though hardly static, such relationships have been mediated by the ontological positioning of traditional societies and their embedded rules and practises. In recent years, these tenuous equilibria have been disrupted by top-down catalysts, including universalist conservation agendas percolating from the state and the global arena. This study aims to explore the changing nature of coexistence by using several historical and contemporary vignettes in relation to key species that routinely "transgress" from their primary natural habitats into the "garden" spaces of human cultivation and habitation. The study will argue that insights at the intersection of environmental history, political ecology and anthropology can improve our understanding of human-wildlife coexistence in India as well as across the world.

AB  - The trade in wild meat is an important economic component of rural people's livelihoods, but it has been perceived to be among the main causes of the decline of wildlife species. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light an additional concern of wildlife markets as a major human-health challenge. We analyzed data from the largest longitudinal monitoring (1973-2018) of the most important urban wild-meat markets in Iquitos, Peru, to examine the trends in and impacts of these markets on people's livelihoods. Over the last 45 years, wild meat sales increased at a rate of 6.4 t/year (SD 2.17), paralleling urban population growth. Wild meat sales were highest in 2018 (442 t), contributing US$2.6 million (0.76%) to the regional gross domestic product. Five species of ungulates and rodents accounted for 88.5% of the amount of biomass traded. Vulnerable and Endangered species represented 7.0% and 0.4% of individuals sold, respectively. Despite growth in sales, the contribution of wild meat to overall urban diet was constant: 1-2%/year of total meat consumed. This result was due to greater availability and higher consumption of cheaper meats (e.g., in 2018, poultry was 45.8% cheaper and was the most consumed meat) coupled with the lack of economic incentives to harvest wild meat species in rural areas. Most wild meat was sold salted or smoked, reducing the likelihood of foodborne diseases. Community-based wildlife management plans and the continued trade bans on primates and threatened taxa may avoid biodiversity loss. Considering the recent COVID-19 pandemic, future management plans should include potential viral hosts and regulation and enforcement of hygiene practices in wild-meat markets.

AB  - Soil microorganisms maintain soil functions, playing a key role in nutrient cycling. However, human activities may alter ecological processes through, for instance, wildlife management tools, which affect environment conditions. Some management tools, such as diversionary feeding, are a source of organic matter and promote high animal densities in small areas, which could affect soil properties and nutrient cycling. This study evaluated how diversionary food inputs that aim to manage an exotic wild ungulate (Ammotragus lervia) can affect the soil potential for microbial N cycling on a Mediterranean mountain in SE Spain. We quantified the functional genes involved in N cycling present in soil exposed to diversionary feeding and compared soil characteristics from three areas: feeding station soil, contour area soil (surrounding the feeding station) and a reference soil (not influenced by supplementary feeding). Our results showed that the amount of the amoA-arch gene (from ammonia-oxidising archaea), the nifH gene (associated with N-fixation), the nirK gene (associated with denitrification) and the ureC gene (associated with ureolysis) were smaller in the feeding stations than in other areas. However, the nirS and nosZ genes (associated with denitrification) were more abundant in soil from feeding stations than in the reference soil. Our results suggest that diversionary feeding modifies microbial abundance and alters nitrogen cycle dynamics because of nutrient inputs and biochemical changes in soil.

AB  - Simple Summary Effects of a high-rice dietary proportion on the meat quality, gut microbiota and metabolites in small ruminants are rarely reported. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the slaughtering characteristic and meat quality, acute phase reaction proteins (APRPs) in plasma and colonic microbiota and metabolites of goats subjected to a high-rice diet. After a 35-day period, sixteen goats received a high-rice diet (HR, 90% concentrate) or a control diet (55% concentrate). In summary, the results showed that the slaughter performance and meat quality were improved in the growing goats after being fed the HR diet. However, the HR diet induced an acute phase reaction and disturbed the gut microbiota to some extent, which increases the health risk to growing goats. Effects of a high-rice dietary proportion on the meat quality, acute phase reaction proteins (APRPs) and colonic microbiota and metabolites in goats are rarely reported. This study was designed to investigate the meat quality and metabolism in goats. Sixteen goats were equally divided into two groups and fed a control diet (Con, 55% concentrate) or a high-rice diet (HR, 90% concentrate) for five weeks. We found that the HR diet improved the slaughtering characteristic and meat quality but induced an acute phase reaction and decreased bacterial richness and diversity when compared to the control group. Furthermore, the levels of acetate, propionate and total VFA concentrations were higher in the colonic contents of the HR-fed goats than in those of the control group (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the HR diet decreased the pH value, lactic acid concentration and increased the activity of amylase and lipopolysaccharide concentration in the colonic contents of goats (p < 0.05). The proportion of Oscillibacter increased while Phocaeicola and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group significantly decreased with the HR diet (p < 0.05). Collectively, the HR diet induced an acute phase reaction and altered the colonic bacterial community, which increases the health risk to growing goats.

AB  - Rhododendron eastmanii is a species endemic to South Carolina and common in the Enoree Ranger District of the Sumter National Forest. A four-year study was undertaken to revisit known populations and to locate new populations. A total of 2,035 individuals in 38 populations were documented, including 663 seedlings, 705 non-flowering adults, and 667 flowering individuals. Plants were most commonly found on mature hardwood slopes above headwater streams. Pollinator visitors included eastern tiger swallowtail (Papilio glaucus), pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor), and bumblebees (Bombus spp.). Concerns for the future of the species were noted due to deer browsing and subcanopy shading, especially from Acer leucoderme (a native tree) and Elaeagnus umbellata (an introduced shrub). This survey results in a better understanding of the species distribution and documents its demographic changes over time.

AB  - In Iraq, the endangered Persian Leopard (Panthera pardus tulliana) is distributed in the northern part (Kurdistan Region) along the Zagros mountain steppe ecoregion, which includes the Bamo and Khoshk Mountains, where we carried out a field survey between October 2020 and November 2022 including camera trapping and interviews with local communities. At least five individuals were recorded during this study, including males, a female, and a family, given a population density of 1.25 indivuduals/100 km(2). Bezoar Goat and Wild Boar are their key prey species in the area. Poaching and wildlife trafficking, decreasing natural water sources, overgrazing, minefields, and forest fires are identified as key threats facing the Persian Leopard population, their prey species, and their natural habitats in the Bamo and Khoshk Mountains. It is suggested to designate the study area as a national protected area or a transboundary conservation area between Iraq and Iran.

AB  - Archaeological and archaeogenetic evidence points to the Pontic-Caspian steppe zone between the Caucasus and the Black Sea as the crucible from which the earliest steppe pastoralist societies arose and spread, ultimately influencing populations from Europe to Inner Asia. However, little is known about their economic foundations and the factors that may have contributed to their extensive mobility. Here, we investigate dietary proteins within the dental calculus proteomes of 45 individuals spanning the Neolithic to Greco-Roman periods in the Pontic-Caspian Steppe and neighbouring South Caucasus, Oka-Volga-Don and East Urals regions. We find that sheep dairying accompanies the earliest forms of Eneolithic pastoralism in the North Caucasus. During the fourth millennium Bc, Maykop and early Yamnaya populations also focused dairying exclusively on sheep while reserving cattle for traction and other purposes. We observe a breakdown in livestock specialization and an economic diversification of dairy herds coinciding with aridification during the subsequent late Yamnaya and North Caucasus Culture phases, followed by severe climate deterioration during the Catacomb and Lola periods. The need for additional pastures to support these herds may have driven the heightened mobility of the Middle and Late Bronze Age periods. Following a hiatus of more than 500 years, the North Caucasian steppe was repopulated by Early Iron Age societies with a broad mobile dairy economy, including a new focus on horse milking.

AB  - We used meta-analyses to compare the effects of 44 single insect species used as biocontrol agents against invasive weeds with the effects of 51 species of non-biocontrol insects on native plants. The effects of biocontrol insects on plant morphometrics were stronger than those of non-biocontrol insects. Overall effects of both groups together were significantly different across plant growth forms with grasses, shrubs, and trees impacted more than vines and herbs. The effect of plant organ was also significant, with roots and fruits suffering the greatest impacts. Insect order had a significant effect: Hemiptera and Coleoptera showed strong effects and Diptera weak effects. Insect feeding guild had significant effects with leaf chewers, sap suckers, stem borers, and stem gallers having the strongest effects. There were no significant effects of study duration or latitude of location. For most categories of plant growth form, plant organ attacked, insect order and feeding guild, biocontrol insects had significantly stronger effects than their non-biocontrol counterparts. The effects of non-biocontrol insects grouped alone against native plants were not always a reliable guideline for how biocontrol insects grouped alone affected their target plants.

AB  - The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought massive shifts in human activities through a global blockade, directly affecting wildlife survival. However, the indirect impacts of changes in human activities are often easily overlooked. We conducted surveys of Reeves's Pheasant (Syrmaticus reevesii) and its sympatric species by camera traps in forest-type nature reserves in three different scenarios: pre-lockdown, lockdown and postlockdown. An increase in livestock activities observed during the lockdown and post-lockdown period in our study area provided us an opportunity to investigate the indirect impact of the lockdown on wildlife. The prelockdown period was used as a baseline to compare any changes in trends of relative abundance index, activity patterns and temporal spacing of targeted species and livestock. During the lockdown period, the relative abundance index of livestock increased by 50% and there was an increase in daytime activity. Reeves's Pheasant showed avoidance responses to almost all sympatric species and livestock in three different periods, and the livestock avoidance level of Reeves's Pheasant during the lockdown period was significantly and positively correlated with the relative abundance index of livestock. Species-specific changes in activity patterns of study species were observed, with reduced daytime activities of Hog Badger and Raccoon Dog during and after the confinement periods. This study highlights the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on the responses of wildlife by considering the changes in their temporal and spatial use before, during and after lockdown. The knowledge gained on wildlife during reduced human mobility because of the pandemic aids in understanding the effect of human disturbances and developing future conservation strategies in the shared space, to manage both wildlife and livestock.

AB  - Camelina sativa (L.) is known as an important oilseed crop due to its application for biofuels, bio-products, and healthy food uses. However, it has a small seed (similar to 0.7 x 1.5 mm), which can be a serious problem for plant establishment in some environments. Despite this, there is not enough information about this plant in response to edaphic (i.e., soil pH and burial depth) and abiotic environmental (i.e., temperature, water potential, salinity and light) factors. Our findings showed that all studied germination and emergence characteristics were affected by each of the environmental factors mentioned above. The cardinal temperatures were 1.50, 20.3 and 34.7 degrees C for the base, optimum and ceiling temperatures, respectively. The tolerance threshold values for salt and water potential stresses were 232 mM and - 1.29 MPa for seed germination, and 202 mM and - 0.75 MPa for the seedling emergence, respectively. There was no significant difference between the seeds germinated in the light and dark regimes. The maximum germination and seedling emergence were recorded at a pH range of 7-8 and a sowing depth of 0.5 cm. The results obtained in the present study could help camelina producers to effectively manage the production of this oilseed crop under stressful conditions. The models fitted here could be applied in simulating camelina growth.

AB  - Consumption of meat from animals hunted with Pb ammunition can cause toxic accumulation with consequent health risks, even if relatively small amounts are consumed in each exposure. In El Palmar National Park, Argentina, invasive alien mammals, wild boar (Sus scrofa) and axis deer (Axis axis), are culled with Pb ammunition and their meat is consumed. In this study, we evaluated blood Pb concentrations in 58 consumers of culled game and examined Pb exposure risk according to their demographics, duty, and consumption habits. Likewise, the likelihood of exposure was evaluated by quantifying Pb concentrations in meat samples of seven culled axis deer. Twenty-seven participants (46%) had detectable blood Pb levels (limit of detection = 3.3 mu g/dL), with an average 4.75 +/- 1.35 mu g/dL (geometric mean +/- geometric S.D.); the average for all participants was 3.25 +/- 1.51 mu g/dL. Blood Pb concentrations were significantly higher in hunters, in participants who reported consuming game meat more than 5 times per week, and in participants who reported frequently consuming cured game meat (compared to cooked or pickled). Pb concentration varied significantly along the trajectory of the bullet in deer muscle, being highest at mid-point but with detectable Pb levels even in distant tissue samples (control), suggesting potential for dietary intake by consumers. These findings provide evidence of Pb exposure risk in consumers and emphasize the relevance of replacing Pb ammunition with non-toxic alternatives. This change would reduce dietary exposure in frequent consumers and allow the use of game meat as safe food for people whilst eliminating collateral risks to wild animals and the environment.

AB  - Extinction rates are increasing globally, and direct exploitation is an important driver. Many pathways have been proposed to explain how exploitation can lead to extinction. One of these proposed but understudied multispecies pathways is opportunistic exploitation, which occurs when a highly valuable but rare species is encountered and targeted during exploitation of a less valuable, but more common, target species. Using individual-based simulations of exploiters in a two-species spatial model, we contribute evidence which supports that opportunistic exploitation increases depletion when compared to single-species exploitation, and is as detrimental to the more valuable, rare species as the anthropogenic Allee effect (where price increases with rarity) and the Allee effect (where population growth declines at low abundance). The most important factors affecting the impact of opportunistic exploitation are gross revenue and abundance of the more common, less valuable species, while ease of capture and growth rate of the more common, less valuable species are less important. Thus, valuable but rare species are most at risk when harvested alongside low-value abundant species; this information is relevant for managers focused on protection of rare species in multispecies systems.

The model was developed in the Small Ruminants Breeding for Efficiency and Resilience (SMARTER) Horizon 2020 project. The SMARTER model is a comprehensive and adaptable linear programming model that enables the assessment of hypothetical scenarios/challenges related to animal traits that prevent infectious and noninfectious diseases. The optimal performance and the structure of the farm are modeled under the presence of infectious and noninfectious diseases (disease plan) and under conditions where no diseases occur (future plan). A comparison of the model solutions, between presence and absence of diseases, provides suggested adjustments to the farming system and insights into the potential shape of new sustainable farm system profiles for the sheep and goat sector. Technical and economic data from five different sheep farms and one goat farm in Greece and France were used in this empirical application to assess different scenarios in the presence of mastitis, parasitism, and lameness in the flocks. The results showed that the profitability and sustainability of the farms are significantly improved when the resilience of animals reduces the impact of the diseases (the highest increase in gross margin was 23.5%). However, although there is substantial improvement in the economic performance of the farms that rear healthy animals, this does not affect the production and management plan of the farmer and does not alter the farm's structure.

AB  - Animals adapt to environmental changes through behavioral and physiological regulation, and there are individual differences in their ability to adapt to the environment, which are associated with individual personality. Boldness is a fundamental axis of animal personality, characterizing an animal's response to unfamiliar environments and threats. From June 1 to July 28, 2023, a personality assessment experiment utilizing a novel stimulus test with an unfamiliar human was conducted on 39 captive alpine musk deer ( Moschus chrysogaster) ) at the Zhuanglang Musk Farm in Gansu Province, China. We recorded avoidance reaction indicators of musk deer in the presence of an unfamiliar human, and measured the level of the musk deer's boldness, influencing factors, and the relationships with fecal steroid hormone levels. Based on cluster analysis, 39 captive musk deer could be divided into bold (boldness score, BSS = 0.994 +/- 0.008, n = 3) and shy groups (BSS = 0.327 +/- 0.145, n = 36) and the average BSS in 39 musk deer was 0.378 +/- 0.228. Factors such as age, sex, and density of enclosures did not have a significant effect on the boldness of musk deer. There was a significant negative correlation between the musk deer's boldness and the level of fecal cortisol metabolites. However, the correlations between boldness and testosterone levels in males and estradiol levels in females were not significant. Based on the results of our study, in the practice of musk deer farming, the measurement of the boldness can help predict the individual's adaptation to environmental stress, and it can also provide a new research perspective for the study of the boldness of solitary animals that are forced to live in groups.

AB  - Monothalamid (single-chambered) foraminifera are a common constituent of high latitudinal coastal and deep-sea biota but are under-researched, and a limited number of species are described. Here, we present the first DNA barcoding study of monothalamid foraminifera collected from methane seeps along the Vestnesa and Svyatogor Ridge off NW Svalbard. Samples were taken from active pockmarks focusing on typical seep microhabitats characterized by microbial mats, and tubeworms. Additionally, reference samples were obtained from adjacent zones outside the pockmarks. We report here DNA barcode sequences of the 18S rRNA gene for seven monothalamid species of which three are described based on molecular and morphological data, the other four remain undescribed or undetermined. Conqueria bolivari sp. nov. has an elongate tubular shape and finely agglutinated test with a silvery, glossy surface. It branches with Conqueria laevis from the deep Weddell Sea and an undescribed Conqueria sp. from the Greenland Sea. Hilla arctica sp. nov. is elongated to broadly pyriform with a white, finely agglutinated test. It branches as a sister to Hilla argentea from South Georgia in the monothalamid Clade Y. Senguptiella vestnesensis gen. nov. sp. nov. branches in the monothalamid Clade C. It is rounded, with a finely agglutinated, reflective test wall. We also obtained DNA barcode sequences for undescribed Hippocrepinella sp. (Clade D) and Bathysiphon sp. (Clade BM) and two undetermined monothalamids (Clade Y and Clade Storthosphaera). Our study contributes to the efforts of obtaining DNA barcoding data for Arctic marine biodiversity and shows that monothalamid foraminifera are an important component of polar benthic communities.

AB  - Anthropogenic noise is pervasive across the landscape and can be present at two temporal scales: acute (occurring sporadically and stochastically over the shortest time scales, e.g., milliseconds), and chronic (more persistent than instantaneous and occurring over longer timescales, e.g., minutes, days). Acute and chronic anthropogenic noise may induce a behavioral fear-mediated response in wildlife that is analogous to a prey response to predators. Understanding wildlife responses to anthropogenic noise is especially important in the case of wildlife crossing structures that provide wildlife with access to resources across busy roadways. Focusing on two species common at wildlife crossing structures, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and coyotes (Canis latrans), we addressed the hypotheses that (1) acute traffic noise causes flight behavior; and (2) chronic traffic noise causes changes in a range of behaviors associated with the vigilance-foraging trade-off (vigilance, running, and foraging). We placed camera traps at entrances to ten crossing structures for a period of similar to 2 months each throughout California, USA. Mule deer and coyotes demonstrated a flight response to acute traffic noise at entrances to crossing structures. Both species demonstrated shifts in behavioral response to chronic traffic noise within and among structures. Coyote behavior was indicative of fear, demonstrating increased vigilance at louder times within crossing structures, and switching from vigilance to running activity at louder crossings. Mule deer responded positively, increasing foraging at both spatial scales, and demonstrating decreased vigilance at louder structures, potentially using crossing structures as a Human Shield. Our results are the first to demonstrate that anthropogenic noise at crossing structures could alter wildlife passage, and that variations in fear response to anthropogenic noise exist across temporal, spatial, and amplitude scales. This dynamic response could alter natural predator-prey interactions and scale up to ecosystem-level consequences such as trophic cascades in areas with roads.

AB  - Pollution is one of the main anthropogenic threats to marine ecosystems. Studies analysing the accumulation and transfer of contaminants in planktonic food webs tend to rely on samples collected in discrete water bodies. Here, we assessed the representativeness of measurements at the chlorophyll-a maximum layer during the MERITE-HIPPOCAMPE cruise for the entire water column by investigating the vertical distribution of particles and plankton obtained by in-situ optical profilers at nine stations across the Mediterranean Sea. We identified specific conditions where the interpretation of results from contaminant analyses can be improved by detailing plankton size structure and vertical distributions. First, the presence of higher than usual plankton concentrations can result in sampling issues that will affect biomass estimation within each size class and therefore bias our un-derstanding of the contaminant dynamics. Secondly, the presence of an unsampled water layer with high zooplankton biomass might imply non-resolved contaminant pathways along the trophic structure. This study lays the basis for optimizing sampling strategy in contaminant studies.

AB  - In India, human-elephant conflict has been on the rise for the last few decades. The situation is worse in the state of Assam, where 5719 elephants are present, and the density of elephants is greater than that of other areas. Most of the elephant habitats in the state are fragmented or intermingled with human-used lands. As a result, human-elephant conflict (HEC) has been increasing in the state. Each year, an average of 80 elephants and 70 humans die in the state because of HEC. Most of these conflicts occur during the paddy harvesting season. At that time of year, the elephants come out from their habitats and take refuge in forest patches and tea gardens near agricultural fields and raid crops at night. Different methods have been adopted to identify conflict-affected areas, but none of the studies have tried to identify all the HEC-affected areas in the state. Here, we provide a rapid appraisal approach for identifying HEC hotspots in the state by using published news information as the primary source of data. A total of 216 villages were identified as HEC-affected areas in Assam. The identified areas can be used to understand site-specific problems and for HEC mitigation practices, as these areas are currently limited to only a few areas.

AB  - Wire snares are among the most common and widely-used techniques for illegal harvesting of terrestrial animals around the world. Recent research has documented the mortality effects of wire snare poaching on animal populations, but the indirect impacts on the behaviour of surviving individuals remain largely uninvestigated. We know little about the short- and long-term effects of snaring injury on the behaviour of animals that survive wire snares. Here, we present a framework for assessing animal behavioural responses to wire snare poaching. Via the framework, we highlight the physiological mechanisms underlying animal responses to being captured, and identify the behaviours affected when animals escape entrapment with injury. We use evidence from mammal species that are vulnerable to wire snaring to highlight the short- and long-term effects of snaring injury on individual animal behaviour, and how they can potentially scale to have population-level consequences. The framework can be used to evaluate the nature of animal behavioural responses to being captured in snares and the resultant effects on their fitness and survival. We identify priorities for research as well as management actions to mitigate the impacts of snare injury on animals that survive wire snares.

AB  - Reproduction in fish is influenced by several environmental factors. In many cases, failure in reproduction is common once fish are no longer in their natural habitat. Thus, the use of exogenous hormones has been crucial to control the reproductive cycle of many fish species under ex situ conditions. These hormonal stimulations became yet more important for those species facing extinction, as the case of Hypancistrus zebra. Since its habitat has been destroyed, successful reproduction in captivity is a way to ensure species survival. The first phase of this study aimed to test the possibility of getting semen from Hypancistrus zebra without hormonal induction. Two groups of fish (24 each) were subjected to two treatments: hormonal induction with 3 mg kg(-1). CPH (carp pituitary homogenate) and spermiation without hormonal induction. In the second phase, was evaluated the effect of hormonal induction on semen quality using gonadorelin (a GnRH synthetic analogue) at doses of 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 mu g kg(-1). CPH treatment was used as a positive control and one group of fish was not induced (negative control). Collected semen was assessed for volume, sperm concentration, motility rate, sperm vigor, duration of motility, membrane integrity and spermatozoa morphology. We were able to successfully collect semen from the endangered Hypancistrus zebra without hormonal induction, however when subjected to the hormonal treatment males released a higher volume of semen, with higher quality in some parameters. CPH treatment was more efficient in improving sperm quality in H. zebra, favoring normal sperm morphology, although gonadorelin did not harm it. The minimum effective dose of gonadorelin to increase seminal volume is 100 mu g kg(-1), which can be applied in a single injection. Information gained from this study will assist semen collection procedures for a germplasm bank formation and other initiatives for conservation of this Amazonian endangered fish species.

In 2009, H. sanguineus appeared at the rocky intertidal of the island of Helgoland in the North Sea, where it encounters the native Green shore crab, C. maenas. H. sanguineus established a self-sustaining population, approaching in numbers and biomass that of C. maenas. Both species are considered to be opportunistic omnivores with variable food preferences and, thus, are potential competitors for food. To evaluate the intrinsic properties of either species to utilize food, we analyzed their stomach content, the morphology of the gastric mills, which shred the ingested food, the activities of digestive enzymes during a seasonal cycle, and the stable isotope ratios. A huge share of the stomach contents was macerated and, thus, could not be identified. The shares of animal food and algae food were almost equal in C. maenas but algae food dominated over animal food in H. sanguineus. The gastric mill of C. maenas shows blunt medial tooth and rounded lateral teeth, which indicates efficient grinding of a carnivorous diet. In contrast, the gastric mill of H. sanguineus shows sharp ridges, which facilitate cutting of algal food. The activities of the proteolytic enzymes trypsin and leucine-aminopeptidase were almost equal in both species with slightly higher activities in C. maenas in summer. The activities of the carbohydrases laminarinase and amylase dominated in H. sanguineus during all seasons. Stable isotope ratios indicate a higher degree of carnivory in C. maenas. The morphological and biochemical features indicate that C. maenas is better suited to utilize animal food and H. sanguineus algal food. Upon scarcity of animal food or severe competition with C. maenas, H. sanguineus may be able to increase the amount of algal food and to utilize it efficiently.

AB  - Reproduction involves communication. Males usually evolve elaborate displays that may declare their qualities and attract females to mate, using signals from different modalities. Females may use cues encoded in courtship signals to evaluate males and make choices concerning their qualities. We investigated the acoustic element of the elaborate display of the small Cavia rodents, the guinea pigs, Cavia porcellus. We verified the potentiality of the courtship call (purr) to reflect male identity and social status, through variations in acoustic structure and male vocal performance. Our results suggest that the purr encodes individuality but not male dominance status. Vocal performance and purr's structural parameters differed between individuals, but there was no correlation between acoustic parameters and male dominance status. Courtship in cavies is a multimodal display, and male quality may be encoded in visual and chemical signals. This study is the first evidence of individuality in the purr. Further studies may reveal the role of each communication channel in the courting process of Cavia. ? 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Reproduction outcomes affect the population growth, especially for endangered species in ex-situ conservation. Alpine musk deer (Moschus chrysogaster) is an endangered ungulate that is well-known for the musk secreted by adult males. Despite being captive for years, the reproduction outcome and the musk production of captive populations are not well documented; moreover their growth seems to be declining. To understand the characteristics in reproduction and musk secretion as well as the influential factors, we studied the litter size, parturition date, weaning success and newborns' sex ratio of 897 deliveries in captive alpine musk deer from 2008 to 2018. Additionally, we assessed the relationships between these traits with age and stud's musk secretion using generalized linear mixed modelling. We found that the seasonal parturition lasted for 70 +/- 17.86 days with a peak on June 22nd and there were more twins (49.3%) born than singletons (41%) with a female-biased secondary sex ratio. Twinning probability, weaning success and parturition date differed significantly among years, while female age affected positively both twinning probability and parturition date as senile females had late parturition with a tendency to have twins. However, age of males or musk secretion did not affect twinning probability or parturition date, studs with higher musk secretion contributed to a male-biased reproduction, resulting from better body condition and sexual attractiveness. The results enhance our zoological understanding of this endangered species, for which reproduction outcome can be predicted by monitoring maternal age and musk secretion of stud musk deer. Further, our findings have practical implications as they provide a basis for improving musk deer conservation and captive management.

AB  - Context Consumer-grade unoccupied aircraft systems (UAS) are increasingly being used by both scientists and hobbyists in the coastal environment. Marine megafauna are observed via UAS as part of monitoring programs, recreational interests, and scientific research, amassing aerial imagery datasets. Because manual documentation of these datasets is infeasible at scale, efficient approaches leveraging computer vision and deep learning have emerged to detect and classify marine megafauna.Aims This study provides a workflow to quantitatively estimate swimming kinematics tailbeat frequency (TBF) and tailbeat amplitude (TBA) of white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) from aerial UAS video data.Methods Body pose estimation was performed using computer vision model DeepLabCut to track six key white shark body parts across UAS videos. The relative positions of these body part coordinates were used to compute tail position over time and quantify TBF and TBA across a population of white sharks in Monterey Bay, California.Key results With a training set of just 52 images, the deep residual neural network reaches human-level labeling accuracy of body parts (root mean square error of <1.3 cm). This workflow is applied to 76 focal follows representing 34 individuals to produce TBF (0.43 +/- 0.07 Hz) and TBA (0.24 +/- 0.10 BL) values similar to those derived from biologging devices previously deployed on individuals in this population.Conclusions The results indicated that body pose estimation via DeepLabCut can allow for the rapid extraction of quantitative kinematics such as TBF and TBA in juvenile white shark populations that aggregate in coastal habitats.Implications This approach provides a non-invasive, scalable method to understanding megafauna kinematics in sensitive species that overcomes the logistical barriers of traditional biologging approaches.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variation in herbivory is a major driver of intraspecific variation in plant defense. Comparatively little is known, however, about how changes in herbivory regime affect the balance of constitutive and induced resistance, which are often considered alternative defensive strategies. Here, we investigated how nearly a decade of insect herbivore suppression affected constitutive and induced resistance in horsenettle (Solanum carolinense), a widespread herbaceous perennial. We allowed replicated horsenettle populations to respond to the presence or absence of herbivores by applying insecticide to all plants in half of 16 field plots. Horsenettle density rapidly increased in response to insecticide treatment, and this effect persisted for at least 4 years after the cessation of herbivore suppression. We subsequently grew half-sibling families from seeds collected during and shortly after insecticide treatment in a common garden and found strong effects of insect suppression on induced resistance. Feeding trials in field mesocosms with false Colorado potato beetles (Leptinotarsa juncta), a common specialist herbivore, revealed that multiyear herbivore suppression drove rapid attenuation of induced resistance: offspring of plants from insect-suppression plots exhibited a near-complete loss of induced resistance to beetles, whereas those from control plots incurred similar to 70% less damage after experimental induction. Plants from insect-suppression plots also had similar to 40% greater constitutive resistance compared with those from control plots, although this difference was not statistically significant. We nonetheless detected a strong trade-off between constitutive and induced resistance across families. In contrast, the constitutive expression of trypsin inhibitors (TI), an important chemical defense trait in horsenettle, was reduced by 20% in the offspring of plants from insect-suppression plots relative to those from control plots. However, TIs were induced to an equal extent whether or not insect herbivores had been historically suppressed. Although several defense and performance traits (prickle density, TI concentration, resistance against false Colorado potato beetles and flea beetles, biomass, and seed mass) varied markedly across families, no traits exhibited significant pairwise correlations. Overall, our results indicate that, whereas the divergent responses of multiple defense traits to insect suppression led to comparatively small changes in overall constitutive resistance, they significantly reduced induced resistance against false Colorado potato beetle.

AB  - Elevated CO2 concentrations can change the multi-level nutritional relationship of the ecosystem through the cascading effect of the food chain. To date, few studies have investigated the effects of elevated CO2 concentration on the Araneae species through the tritrophic system. Hylyphantes graminicola (Araneae: Linyphiidae) is distributed widely in Asia and is a dominant predator in cotton fields. This study investigated chemical components in the food chain of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum)-cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii)-predator (H. graminicola) and compared the development, reproduction, and predation of H. graminicola under ambient (400 ppm) and elevated concentration of CO2 (800 ppm). The results showed that the elevated CO2 concentration increased the chemicals of cotton and cotton aphid, but it did not affect the nutrients, development, reproduction, and predation of the spider. However, the survival rate of the spider was significantly decreased in elevated CO2. The results will further our understanding of the role of natural enemies in an environment with elevated CO2 concentration.

AB  - Sarcocystosis is an emerging disease in yaks, and Sarcocystis infection creates a health threat to humans and animals. During a recent study, Sarcocystis infection was detected in yaks by means of morphological observation using hematoxylin and eosin, Giemsa, and acridine orange staining. The species of Sarcocystis isolated from yaks were analyzed and identified phylogenetically. To establish the best model for culturing sarcocystosis isolated from yaks in vitro, four different cell lines-PAMs, Pk15, HeLa, and Vero cells-were used. The effects of sarcocystosis isolated from yaks on the MAPK signaling pathway in Vero cells were detected using Wes automatic Western blot and RT-qPCR. The results from the phylogenetic tree indicate that the sequences of Sarcocystis obtained from yaks in this study were grouped within the Sarcocystis cruzi clade. Results also have shown that S. cruzi had a higher proliferation rate in Vero cells, suggesting that Vero cells are more suitable for the long-term culturing of S. cruzi in vitro. Results also indicate that S. cruzi infecting Vero cells could cause the activation of ERK1/2 pathway, while inhibiting the ERK1/2 pathway could suppress S. cruzi infection in Vero cells. Therefore, the study and exploration of Sarcocystis-host relationships can effectively provide certain theoretical knowledge and the basis for the treatment of clinical diseases and the development of Sarcocystis drugs.

AB  - Knowledge of animal movement patterns is invaluable to understanding the spread of diseases among wildlife populations. One example is the recent African swine fever (ASF) outbreak among wild boar Sus scrofa populations across East Asia, where there is a lack of information on movements of this species. During a wild boar tracking project to inform abundance estimation methods in the Russian Far East's Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Zapovednik, the combination of high variability in pulsed resources of acorns and pine nuts between fall 2019 and fall 2020, and the outbreak of ASF during the latter year, offered the unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between wild boar movements to exploit pulsed resources and the potential for disease spread. We analyzed relocation data from GPS-collared wild boar in fall 2019 and 2020 and compared them to reference data in Belgium, representative of western Europe. We found remarkable differences in movement patterns, with Far East wild boar travelling large distances in fall 2020 (maximum observed of 77 km in four days) when the availability of acorns was low. In our resource selection analysis, we found clear selection for mast-producing forest types that corresponded with the species of greater mast production (oak or pine) for that year. Comparing the displacement of individual wild boar along a moving window of 1-7 days (time between infection and the onset ASF symptoms) highlighted the potential of rapid ASF spread over long distances when wild boar are in search of pulsed resources. This work demonstrates the capacity of wild boar to move long distances to exploit resources and emphasizes the need to consider resource availability when predicting the speed and extent to which diseases such as ASF can spread.

AB  - The tea plant (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae; previously Thea sinensis, Ternstroemiaceae) is a highly sought-after beverage source today. In 2018 alone, c. 270 B L of tea was consumed throughout the world. Global recognition of green tea has enhanced majorly, especially in the later decades of the 20th century, because of the level of antioxidants (c. 450 mg of vitamin C equivalents) it includes, currently seen valuable in the general well-being of humans. In this article, I chronicle the events that steered the 'discovery' of Thea assamica (presently, C. sinensis var. assamica) in the wilderness of Upper Assam (the Ahom country) and its commercial, large-scale production. William Griffith, who searched it and wrote on the T. assamica material growing in the Indian territory in the 1830s, examined the plant community in which the natural populations of T. assamica grew, in addition to writing on the soil and other related aspects vital for its large-scale cultivation. His notes shed light on an early understanding of the 'ecosystem' in which T. assamica grew in the wild. Griffith clarifies that they spread naturally along the river and creek beds in North-eastern India from the neighbouring Chinese territory over the last several hundreds of years. His remarks on the adaptations of the tea plant and other associated plants to specific soil types and on the top soil he found in tea-growing areas impress not only as remarkable but also as pioneering. His comments on the kinds of plants associated with the tea-plant populations and the general vegetation around the tea plant foreshadow the ecological concepts, 'communities' and 'vegetation types', which were recognized formally much later.

AB  - Simple Summary The paper presents practices related to reproductive management in sheep and goat farms in Greece. It presents descriptive information regarding the practices followed and the predictors associated with them. The results also indicate that various reproductive practices can have significant effects on the production outcomes (milk production, lamb production) in sheep and goat farms. The correct implementation of reproductive management in sheep and goat farms, based on scientific principles and compliance with established regulations, is important for the improvement in the welfare of farm animals and high production outcomes. This paper reports findings regarding patterns of reproductive management in 325 sheep flocks and 119 goat herds throughout Greece. The objectives were to describe the patterns of reproductive management in sheep and goat farms, to highlight factors that were associated with these management patterns and the clinical application of the various reproductive management approaches in the farms and to establish potential associations with production outcomes. The median months of the start of the mating period for adult sheep and goats were May and June, respectively and for ewe lambs and replacement goats these were August and September, respectively. The median duration of the mating period was 2 months for adults and 1 month for replacements. The median ratio of female to male animals was 22:1 and 25:1 in sheep and goat farms, respectively. Control of reproduction was applied in 33.2% and 16.8% of sheep and goat farms, respectively, mostly by intravaginal progestagen sponges and less often by melatonin implants; multivariable analysis indicated five (availability of milking parlour, number of ewes in a farm, number of daily milkings, daily period spent by farmers at the farm, farming tradition in the family) and two (number of daily milkings, availability of milking parlour) predictors in sheep and goat farms, respectively. Pregnancy diagnosis ultrasonographically was performed in 36.6% and 16.8% of sheep and goat farms, respectively; multivariable analysis indicated as significant three (management system applied in farms, age of farmer, farming tradition in the family) and two (management system applied in farms, availability of milking parlour) predictors in sheep and goat farms, respectively. The control of reproduction and pregnancy diagnosis were associated with a higher number of vaccinations during pregnancy: 2.6 and 2.7, respectively, versus 2.2 and 2.1 in farms where they were not performed. The average per farm number of lambs/kids born per female animal was 1.33 +/- 0.01 and 1.30 +/- 0.02 for sheep and goat farms, respectively; five (control of reproduction, location of the farm, presence of working staff, collaboration with veterinary practice, breed of ewes) and two (control of reproduction, breed of female goats) predictors were identified in sheep and goat farms, respectively, for high numbers of lambs/kids. Lambs/kids were taken away from their dams at the age of 50 and 65 days, respectively. The average culling age (females, males) was 5.9 and 4.4 years and 6.9 and 4.9 years for sheep and goats, respectively. Farmers sourced animals to be used as replacements for those removed from the farm, mostly from the animals in their own farms, considering criteria related to milk production.
   Finally, the application of the control of reproduction was associated with increased milk production and the number of newborns, whilst an inverse correlation between the culling age of animals and milk production was seen.

AB  - Throughout its distribution across Eurasia, domestic pig (Sus scrofa) populations have acquired differences through natural and artificial selection, and have often interbred. We resequenced 80 Eurasian pigs from nine different Asian and European breeds; we identify 42,288 reliable SNPs on the Y chromosome in a panel of 103 males, among which 96.1% are newly detected. Based on these new data, we elucidate the evolutionary history of pigs through the lens of the Y chromosome. We identify two highly divergent haplogroups: one present only in Asia and one fixed in Europe but present in some Asian populations. Analyzing the European haplotypes present in Asian populations, we find evidence of three independent waves of introgression from Europe to Asia in last 200 years, agreeing well with the literature and historical records. The diverse European lineages were brought in China by humans and left significant imprints not only on the autosomes but also on the Y chromosome of geographically and genetically distinct Chinese pig breeds. We also find a general excess of European ancestry on Y chromosomes relative to autosomes in Chinese pigs, an observation that cannot be explained solely by sex-biased migration and genetic drift. The European Y haplotype is associated with leaner meat production, and we hypothesize that the European Y chromosome increased in frequency in Chinese populations due to artificial selection. We find evidence of Y chromosomal gene flow between Sumatran wild boar and Chinese pigs. Our results demonstrate how human-mediated admixture and selection shaped the distribution of modern swine Y chromosomes.

AB  - During domestication processes, changes in selective pressures induce multiple phenotypical, physiological, and behavioral changes in target species. The rise of next-generation sequencing has provided a chance to study the genetics bases of these changes, most of the time based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, several studies have highlighted the impact of structural variations (SVs) on individual fitness, particularly indomestic species. We aimedat unraveling the role of SVs during the domestication and later improvement of small ruminants by analyzing whole-genome sequences of 40 domestic sheep and 11 of their close wild relatives (Ovis orientalis), and 40 goats and 18 of their closewild relatives (Capra aegagrus). Using a combination of detection tools, we called 45,796 SVs in Ovis and 15,047 SVs in Capra genomes, including insertions, deletions, inversions, copy number variations, and chromosomal translocations. Most of these SVs were previously unreported in small ruminants. 69 and 45 SVs in sheep and goats, respectively, were in genomic regions with neighboring SNPs highly differentiated between wilds and domestics (i.e., putatively related to domestication). Among them, 25 and 20 SVs were close to or overlapping with genes related to physiological and morpho-anatomical traits linked with productivity (e.g., size, meat or milk quality, wool color), reproduction, or immunity. Finally, several of the SVs differentiated between wilds and domestics would not have been detected by screening only the differentiation of SNPs surrounding them, highlighting the complementarity of SVs and SNPs based approaches to detect signatures of selection.

AB  - Resilience is the capacity of animals to return quickly to their pre-stress status following a disturbance, including social, physical, and/or disease challenges. In modern farming, where there are many stressors, resilience is crucial for pigs because it affects their welfare and production. The goal of the study was to assess whether behavioral response to an auditory stimulus during a startle test (acute stress) differed between pigs designated at weaning (27 +/- 2d of age) as stress-resilient (SR) or stress-vulnerable (SV). Blood samples were collected from female piglets (n = 170) from 26 litters surrounding weaning at multiple time points. Using serum cortisol levels from these samples, two female pigs from each litter (n = 52) were classified as either SR (n = 26) or SV (n = 26) and used for the startle test. The startle test was conducted when pigs were 7wk-of-age while they were housed in the nursery room and recordings were captured utilizing cameras positioned on the ceiling. We assessed startle magnitude score (SM) and time to resume home pen behavior as indicators of the pigs' behavioral responses. In addition to stress resilience designation, pigs' relaxed-tense score (RT), orientation to stimulus (OS), and pen position were also observed which may affect startle response. Our data suggest no relationship between behavioral response to an auditory startle test and resilience or vulnerability to weaning stress. The difference in the type of stressors needs to be considered as an acute, simple auditory stimulus was used for the startle test and a longer-lasting, multi-modal weaning stress was used for initial resilience designation. However, the startle test could be a relatively easy way to assess the fearfulness of pigs on farms, as it requires no training of pigs and can be conducted in the home pen, but further methodological improvement is required. Though our results did not support a clear connection between a behavioral fear response and physiological stress resilience, examining the resilience of pigs during their early developmental phases using behavioral markers is worthwhile. Early detection of non-resilient animals could offer the opportunity to implement more effective management strategies beginning earlier in life when pigs might be more vulnerable to stressors or the effects more long-lasting, thereby improving the welfare of pigs. Furthermore, it facilitates the selection of robust animals for future breeding. Further research is required to identify behavioral traits clearly indicative of stress resilience.

AB  - The breadth and depth of plant leaf metabolomes have been implicated in key interactions with plant enemies aboveground. In particular, divergence in plant species chemical composition-amongst neighbors, relatives, or both-is often suggested as a means of escape from insect herbivore enemies. Plants also experience strong pressure from enemies such as belowground pathogens; however, little work has been carried out to examine the evolutionary trajectories of species' specialized chemistries in both roots and leaves. Here, we examine the GCMS detectable phytochemistry (for simplicity, hereafter referred to as specialized volatile metabolites) of the tropical tree genus Protium, testing the hypothesis that phenotypic divergence will be weaker belowground compared to aboveground due to more limited dispersal by enemies. We found that, after controlling for differences in chemical richness, roots expressed less structurally diverse compounds than leaves, despite having higher numbers of specialized volatile metabolites, and that species' phylogenetic distance was only positively correlated with compound structural distance in roots, not leaves. Taken together, our results suggest that root specialized volatile metabolites exhibit significantly less phenotypic divergence than leaf specialized metabolites and may be under relaxed selection pressure from enemies belowground.

AB  - Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) are important signaling compounds released by plants upon wounding. These compounds have been shown to mediate tritrophic interactions in recruiting insect predators and parasitoids. Recent work has begun to show that avian species, which were once thought to have a very limited sense of smell, can cue in on these HIPVs to find insect prey. Here, we test the ability for two general HIPVs, methyl jasmonate and methyl salicylate, to recruit avian predators. We test the recruitment efficacies of these HIPVs across four different host plant species, black walnut (Juglans nigra), red maple (Acer rubum), cattail (Typha latifolia), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), and use clay caterpillars to quantify predation by insectivorous birds. We found no significant differences in predation between treatment groups across any of our host plants. However, there was a nearly significant effect of methyl salicylate in black-walnut trees. Interestingly, our results did show a significant effect of host plant species on predation levels. The two tree species, particularly black walnut, had higher levels of predation than the herbaceous species. We discuss the implications of these results and suggest a number of ideas and suggestions for future studies investigating the role of HIPVs in attracting insectivorous birds.

AB  - Attempts to deter elephants from entering crop fields and human settlements in Africa have used various barriers (e.g. electric fences, chilli fences, beehive fences or plant barriers), situated on or very near the boundaries of fields or villages, with rather variable success. We explored a very simple new barrier concept based upon re-arranging the layout of foreign stimuli already known to arouse suspicion and fear among elephants. Deterrence involved deploying unnaturally scented objects on and across their pathways of habitual movement leading to crop field clusters. Elephants are suspicious of unpleasant olfactory stimuli, like string or cloth saturated with pungent-smelling chilli oil, old engine oil, or creosote and dislike 'chilli smoke'. Foreign visual items like plastic bottles, reflective metal strips and cow bells possibly reinforced suspicion of these unpleasant scents and influenced the deterrent effect. These flimsy items deployed over very short distances merely acted as a bluff to 'problem elephants' that people were actively trying to impede their progress, and the vast majority chose to turn back or deviate substantially. Thus we coined the term a 'soft virtual boundary'. We demonstrate that placing virtual boundaries away from village and agricultural lands, forces elephants to encounter them upon leaving their daytime refuges, while still in natural habitat. The suspicion and fear generated here considerably reduces elephants' determination to proceed onwards to risk crop raiding. When multiple, small virtual boundaries are strategically moved around at intervals, a 'virtual fence dynamic' delivers an enduring deterrent effect. In ten study areas in two countries over seven years this technique led to considerable and consistent reductions in crop damage levels of up to 95% in places. Because these methods (i) completely rely on local knowledge, (ii) were exceptionally low cost and (iii) demonstrated rapid results, the 'buy-in' from affected communities of small-scale subsistence farmers was immediate and very enthusiastic. So this strategy has the potential to remove the most intractable stumbling block to the sustainability of human-elephant conflict mitigation efforts in smallholder agriculture - reliance upon conservation donor funding for very costly and problematic mitigation measures like fencing, compensation schemes and elephant translocations.

AB  - When making foraging decisions, animals evaluate the risk of being preyed upon or hunted. This applies particularly to large-bodied, long-lived species with a long evolutionary history of human persecution, such as wild boars (Sus scrofa). Wild boar populations are rapidly expanding throughout natural, agricultural, and urban areas worldwide, thus escalating human-wild boar conflicts. Most of these conflicts are associated with crop and garden damages by foraging wild boars. To study the foraging behavior of wild boars across a gradient of human risk, we evaluated the combined effects of hunting, land use type, and wild boar group size and structure on boar use of feeding devices. We installed corn-supplemented feeding devices in four land-use types and hunting combinations: urban areas with and without hunting, rural areas (namely, agricultural areas with hunting), and nature reserves without hunting. Our results show that rural areas and urban areas were the most important predictors of the wild boars' decision to eat or not and the time it took them to start eating from the moment they arrived at the feeding device (TBE-Time Before Eating). In addition, our study suggests that the TBEs of urban boars were significantly lower compared to boars from nature reserves. We further found that TBEs of urban boars were significantly lower than TBEs of boars in nature reserves. Our results suggest that the foraging behavior of wild boars varies spatially, corresponding to the different land-use types. We propose that the readiness of boars to forage in urban areas results from their habituation to human presence and lower perception of risk.

AB  - The frozen semen of Erhualian pig can promote the continuous improvement of commercial pigs, but currently, frozen semen fails to satisfy the practical application requirement. Oxidative damage is one of the crucial factors affecting the quality of frozen semen; besides, there are individual differences in boar sperm freezability. Based on the previous analysis of the proteomic differences of Erhualian boar sperm with different freezability, two differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) in boar sperm, albumin (ALB) and protein disulfide isomerase family A member 4 (PDIA4), were selected as the research objects in the current study. It is assumed that redox-related proteins ALB and PDIA4 can be used as markers to predict Erhualian boar sperm freezability. We cry-opreserved the semen of 14 Erhualian boars. According to the difference of frozen semen quality, boars with good and poor freezability ejaculates (GFE and PFE, n symbolscript 3) were selected respectively. The relative contents of ALB and PDIA4 in GFE and PFE were analyzed by Western blot, and the localization patterns of ALB and PDIA4 in pre-frozen and frozen-thawed sperm were detected by immunofluorescence. The results showed that the abundances of ALB and PDIA4 in GFE were significantly higher than PFE, and there was a significant correlation between the relative contents of ALB and PDIA4 and frozen-thawed sperm quality parameters. Additionally, the freezing process had no effect on the localization patterns of ALB and PDIA4 in spermatozoa. In conclusion, these results suggest that ALB and PDIA4 are related to boar sperm cryotolerance and may be used as novel freezability markers.

AB  - . Increasing abundance of Snow and Ross's Geese (Anser caerulescens and Anser rossii; kangut and qaaraarjuk in Inuktut, respectively), referred to collectively as light geese, has caused alterations in various Canadian Arctic ecosystems. Inuit have harvested light geese for generations and hold knowledge that offers unique insights into the ecology and population dynamics of these species. By combining interviews with 40 light goose harvesters and Elders with results from aerial surveys in the Kivalliq region of Nunavut, we (1) describe changes in light goose distribution and abundance between the 1940s and the 2010s, (2) explore the effects of light geese on local ecosystems, and (3) identify factors driving these changes. Inuit observations gathered through lifetimes of land-based observations and results from aerial surveys concurred that (1) light goose numbers have increased regionally since the 1940s, and (2) light goose numbers decreased in several colonies within the Kivalliq region between the 1960s-1990s and the 2010s, including in two Migratory Bird Sanctuaries. Inuit have noted that habitat loss due to overgrazing and grubbing has pushed light geese to abandon altered habitats in favor of new breeding and foraging sites. Inuit observations also indicated that light geese have altered their migration behavior (how, when, and where they migrate and nest) in response to earlier spring snowmelt, the drying of ponds and lakes, and an increased number of predators. These conclusions add substantially to overall understanding about light geese in regions where aerial surveys are expensive and infrequent, and scientific studies are limited in geographic coverage.

AB  - Eg & oslash; Engs & oslash; is an artificial Danish suburban lake created in 2006, primarily for nutrient retention and flood control. Expanding submerged macrophyte cover (dominated by Stoneworts Chara spp. and Pondweeds Potamogeton spp.) attracted moulting concentrations of 600 mute swans Cygnus olor, 1100 greylag geese Anser anser and 280 Canada geese Branta canadensis. These unexpected additions to the avifauna benefit from reliable food supplies and effective protection from recreational disturbance on and near the water surface. Eg & oslash; Engs & oslash; is a model of enabling intense human activity at a waterbird moulting site, and confirming appropriate planning can accommodate multiple functional objectives following wetland creation.

AB  - Trait-based approaches are increasingly used to study species assemblages and understand ecosystem functioning. The strength of these approaches lies in the appropriate choice of functional traits that relate to the functions of interest. However, trait-function relationships are often supported by weak empirical evidence. Processes related to digestion and nutrient assimilation are particularly challenging to integrate into trait-based approaches. In fishes, intestinal length is commonly used to describe these functions. Although there is broad consensus concerning the relationship between fish intestinal length and diet, evolutionary and environmental forces have shaped a diversity of intestinal morphologies that is not captured by length alone. Focusing on coral reef fishes, we investigate how evolutionary history and ecology shape intestinal morphology. Using a large dataset encompassing 142 species across 31 families collected in French Polynesia, we test how phylogeny, body morphology, and diet relate to three intestinal morphological traits: intestinal length, diameter, and surface area. We demonstrate that phylogeny, body morphology, and trophic level explain most of the interspecific variability in fish intestinal morphology. Despite the high degree of phylogenetic conservatism, taxonomically unrelated herbivorous fishes exhibit similar intestinal morphology due to adaptive convergent evolution. Furthermore, we show that stomachless, durophagous species have the widest intestines to compensate for the lack of a stomach and allow passage of relatively large undigested food particles. Rather than traditionally applied metrics of intestinal length, intestinal surface area may be the most appropriate trait to characterize intestinal morphology in functional studies.

AB  - Sesamum alatum Thonn., of the Pedaliaceae family is rich in nutrients and is also used for medicinal purposes, but it is still collected from the wild. It thrives well in sandy soils which are known for low fertility and mois-ture content. Rural communities in KwaZulu-Natal usually keep cows, goats, poultry and sheep as their live-stock, where they also source organic manure for subsistence farming. Animal manure improves both plant and soil properties. Application of animal manure also results in an increase in growth, yield and nutrient content of leafy vegetables such as Amaranthus, Abelmoschus, and Corchorus species. In India, Sesamum indi-cum, a domesticated relative of S. alatum, also had its vegetative, reproductive and nutrient properties improved with the application of poultry manure. A selection of organic manure(s) for S. alatum domestica-tion is possible by reviewing the use of various domesticated animal manures to improve morpho-agronomic traits and nutrient content of leafy vegetables. Therefore, determining an agronomic protocol for this species in South Africa is a priority for future research. (c) 2022 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: We examine the phylogeographic genetic structure of the endangered pig-nosed turtle Carettochelys insculpta, the last remaining member of a once globally widespread family, now restricted to northern Australia and southern New Guinea, a region with a complex geological and eustatic history. We examine their historical biogeography, demographic history and genetic status of threatened populations. Location: Northern Australia, Southern New Guinea. Methods: We reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and patterns of genetic diversity using a genome-wide dataset of 15,081 single nucleotide polymorphisms and two mitochondrial loci from samples spanning the full species' range. Results: The Australian, Papua New Guinea and Indonesian Papua turtles are recovered as three distinct lineages; the Australian lineage diverged from the New Guinea lineages ca 660 Kya, while the Papua New Guinea and Indonesian Papua Province lineages diverged ca 564 Kya. Although the fossil record shows that C. insculpta has been a long-standing representative of the Australia and New Guinea fauna (since at least the Miocene), extant lineages diverged later in the Middle Pleistocene. Both the Australian and Papua New Guinea lineages were likely shaped by bottlenecks, isolation and genetic drift, which in the Australian lineage greatly reduced effective population sizes to 48-88. Main Conclusions: The contemporary genetic structure of C. insculpta is most consistent with a vicariance model whereby a large interchanging population occupying northern Australia and New Guinea came to be fragmented and diverged into Australian, Papua New Guinea and Indonesian Papua lineages. Subsequent dispersal via paleodrainages of the submerged continental shelf under the influence of Pleistocene sea-level change is thought to have been impeded by the isolation of the Akimeugah and Arafura Basins. All populations of the Australian lineage show low genetic diversity without contemporary gene flow, suggesting they are vulnerable to inbreeding and reduced fitness, requiring the consideration of genetic rescue.

AB  - Mitigating climate change and improving food production are major challenges worldwide. Applications of lignite-based bioorganic products (or lignite-based fertilizer) can improve soil physicochemical properties and crop production in saline-sodic farmland. However, little is known about the effects of lignite bioorganic fertilizer (LBF) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change mitigation. Thus, a two-year field experiment was conducted in saline-sodic farmlands in the upper Yellow River basin, Northwest China. The field experiment comprised six treatments, including a negative control without any organic fertilizer (CK), a positive control amended with sheep manure (FYM), and four treatments amended with 1.5 (LBF1), 3 (LBF2), 4.5 (LBF3), and 7.5 t ha(-1) (LBF4) LBF. The results showed that the LBF treatments decreased the emissions of CH4 and CO2 while increasing N2O emissions when the application rate was over 3 t ha(-1). Additionally, FYM treatment acted as a CH4 source, while LBF2 and LBF3 treatments were both CH4 sinks. The LBF3 treatment had the highest net ecosystem carbon budget (NECB) and the lowest net ecosystem global warming potential (NGWP), which were 6.04 and 4.82 t ha(-1) and -22.09 and-17.39 t ha(-1) higher than those of the CK treatment in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Moreover, the net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) of the LBF2 and LBF3 treatments was higher than that of the other treatments. Compared with the CK treatment, the FYM treatment increased the NCEB and decreased NGWP but it also decreased the NEEB. For nitrogen and carbon cycling, the LBF3 treatment increased almost all gene families involved in nitrogen cycling, except for nirA and hao, while the FYM treatment reduced the nirKS, norBC, nosZ, and hao gene families. The modules for carbohydrate metabolism and methanogenesis were also reduced by the LBF treatments. In conclusion, the LBF2 and LBF3 treatments had higher NECB, NGWP, and NEEB, indicating that the application of lignite bioorganic fertilizer at 3.0-4.5 t ha(-1) is appropriate for climate change mitigation in saline-sodic farmlands in the upper Yellow River basin, Northwest China.

AB  - Recent increases in wildlife cause negative impacts on humans through both economic and ecological damage, as well as the spread of pathogens. Understanding the population dynamics of wildlife is crucial to develop effective management strategies. However, it is difficult to estimate accurate and precise population size over large spatial and temporal scales because of the limited data availability. We addressed these issues by first fitting a random encounter and staying time (REST) model based on camera trap data to construct an informative prior distribution for a capture rate parameter in a harvest-based Bayesian state-space model. We constructed a Bayesian state-space model that integrated administration data on the number of captured wild boar with the prior distribution of capture efficiency estimated by camera trap data. The model with informative prior distribution from the REST model successfully estimated population dynamics, whereas the model using only the administration data did not, owing to a lack of parameter convergence. We identified areas where (1) wild boars exhibit a high potential population growth rate and a high carrying capacity, (2) current trapping efforts are effectively suppressing local populations, and (3) trapping reinforcement is required to control populations in the whole region. The model could be used to predict future trends in populations under the assumptions of ongoing trapping pressure. This will help identify spatially explicit trapping efforts to achieve target population levels.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the effects of different stocking densities on Matou goats. Thirty-six female Matou goats were randomly assigned into three experimental treatments including the low density (LD, 0.67 goat/m(2)), the medium density (MD, 1 goat/m(2)) and the high density (HD, 2 goats/m(2)) group. Compared with LD group, the average daily weight gain (ADG) of HD group decreased (p < .05). The length of duodenal and ileal villi in HD group was significantly lower than that in LD group (p < .05). The rumen pH and concentration of total volatile fatty acid (VFA), propionate butyrate and ammonia-nitrogen increased in HD group (p < .05). The acetate/propionate ratio was the highest in MD group (p < .05). The mRNA expression level of agouti-related protein gene (AgRP) in hypothalamus of LD was higher than that in HD group (p < 0.05). Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression level was the highest in MD group (p<.05) and the lowest in HD group (p < .05). An increase in growth hormone receptor (GHR), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and claudin-1 mRNA expression level were noticed in HD group (p<.05). Compared with LD group, the serum total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), globulin (Glb) IgA and IgG levels in HD group decreased (p < .05). Glucocorticoid (GCS), beta-endorphin (beta-EP) and cortisol levels in serum were also significantly increased in HD group compared with LD group (p < .05). These results showed that stocking density affected rumen environment and high stocking density resulted in a decrease in growth, digestive and immune function of Matou goats.

AB  - The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is one of the world's most elusive felids. In Bhutan, which is one of the 12 countries where the species still persists, reliable information on its distribution and habitat suitability is lacking, thus impeding effective conservation planning for the species. To fill this knowledge gap, we created a country-wide species distribution model using "presence-only" data from 420 snow leopard occurrences (345 from a sign survey and 77 from a camera-trapping survey) and 12 environmental covariates consisting of biophysical and anthropogenic factors. We analyzed the data in an ensemble model framework which combines the outputs from several species distribution models. To assess the adequacy of Bhutan's network of protected areas and their potential contribution toward the conservation of the species, we overlaid the output of the ensemble model on the spatial layers of protected areas and biological corridors. The ensemble model identified 7,206 km(2) of Bhutan as suitable for the snow leopard: 3,647 km(2) as highly suitable, 2,681 km(2) as moderately suitable, and 878 km(2) as marginally suitable. Forty percent of the total suitable habitat consisted of protected areas and a further 8% of biological corridors. These suitable habitats were characterized by a mean livestock density of 1.3 individuals per hectare, and a mean slope of 25 degrees; they closely match the distribution of the snow leopard's main wild prey, the bharal (Pseudois nayaur). Our study shows that Bhutan's northern protected areas are a centre for snow leopard conservation both at the national and regional scale.

AB  - Tam Pa Ling, a cave site in northeastern Laos, has yielded the earliest skeletal evidence of Homo sapiens in mainland Southeast Asia. The reliance of Pleistocene humans in rainforest settings on plant or animal resources is still largely unstudied, mainly due to poor collagen preservation in fossils from tropical environments precluding stable nitrogen isotope analysis, the classical trophic level proxy. However, isotopic ratios of zinc (Zn) in bioapatite constitute a promising proxy to infer trophic and dietary information from fossil vertebrates, even under adverse tropical taphonomic conditions. Here, we analyzed the zinc isotope composition (Zn-66/Zn-64 expressed as delta Zn-66 value) in the enamel of two teeth of the Late Pleistocene (63-46 ka) H. sapiens individual (TPL1) from Tam Pa Ling, as well as 76 mammal teeth from the same site and the nearby Nam Lot cave. The human individual exhibits relatively low enamel delta(66Z)n values (+0.24 parts per thousand) consistent with an omnivorous diet, suggesting a dietary reliance on both plant and

AB  - Hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; HWA), an invasive aphid-like insect, was first documented on the East Coast of the United States in the 1950 s. Hemlock woolly adelgid is an herbivore which primarily feeds at the needle base of hemlock tree species (Pinaceae: Tsuga). With no evolutionary defenses and few biotic controls, the eastern and Carolina hemlock (Tsuga canadensis and Tsuga carolinensis) serve as the primary diet of HWA in eastern North America. The invasive pest began to spread rapidly throughout the hemlock's range causing defoliation and death of the trees within 4 -10 years. With the loss of the foundational species, Tsuga canadensis, several microenvironmental changes were documented. Microenvironmental changes in response to biological invasions and anthropogenic forestry practices can lead to shifts in populations of physiologically sensitive taxa such as salamanders and their prey, terrestrial arthropods.
   National Park Service (NPS) staff at Great Smoky Mountains National Park manage HWA by treating eastern hemlocks with the neonicotinoid pesticides, imidacloprid and dinotefuran. To measure indirect effects of eastern hemlock mortality, and HWA management, this study collected data on several parameters in hemlock-dominated stands that have been repeatedly managed by the NPS and stands which were un-managed and where HWA has reduced the hemlock canopy. Our major objectives were to assess microenvironmental, vegetative, and arthropod community differences between managed and un-managed eastern hemlock stands and analyze those differences with respect to woodland salamander abundance. Answering these questions should provide insight into indirect impacts of the invasive species, HWA, on indicator species, terrestrial salamanders, through changes in prey availability and microenvironmental parameters. A mixed effects linear model using elevation range as a random effect or block was used to model salamander abundance with prey availability, microenvironmental parameters, and HWA management as a factor. Our results indicate that HWA management was the strongest predictor of total salamander abundance and for Plethodon jordani and Desmognathus wrighti abundance individually. We found over five times the relative salamander abundance in sites which had been managed for HWA compared to sites which had been left un-managed.

AB  - Genetic parameters, breeding values, and aggregate breeding values of number of piglets born alive (NBA), number of weaned piglets (NWE), and litter weight at weaning (LWWE) were predicted in the Hungarian Large White, Hungarian Landrace breeds, and in their cross (F1). Seven repeatability animal models were used. BLUP and REML methodology were used to estimate breeding values and variance-covariance components. PEST and VCE 6 software were used for estimating breeding values and variance components. Heritability for NBA and NWE was the same for all seven models. On the contrary, heritability estimates for LWWE were higher in comparison with NBA and NWE. The permanent environmental variance component was small for all traits. The large White breed had positive and significant genetic trends for all seven models and for all three traits. Landrace breed had significant trends for NBA, which was negative, and for NWE, the results were positive. The constructed indices result in one number (i.e., aggregate genetic merit); thus, the animals can be selected based on their overall performance considering the various aspects.

AB  - In wildlife captive management, contraception is highly desirable due to inbreeding risk and needed control of intra- and inter-specific aggressions. Deer, for which surgical castration can cause abnormal growth of the antlers, are suitable candidates for pharmacological castration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pharmacological castration on the physiological patterns and volatile chemical profiles of two deer species. We placed a subcutaneous implant of deslorelin acetate (4.7 mg) on four male red deer (Cervus elaphus) and two male fallow deer (Dama dama) (N = 6) living together in a mixed-sex and -species group housed at a wildlife rescue centre in Tuscany, Italy. We combined hormone measurements and chemical investigation of metatarsal scent-gland odour secretions to test whether pharmacological castration will influence the volatile chemical profile, potentially modifying the olfactory communication during the rutting season. We used radioimmunoassay technique to determine faecal and plasma testosterone as well as faecal cortisol levels, and solid-phase microextraction coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyse the scent-gland odour secretions. We found that deer testosterone levels decreased after the subcutaneous deposition of the implant. However, castrated red deer exhibited more variability in testosterone concentrations throughout the study period compared to fallow deer, whose testosterone levels remained low after the implant. We detected a total of 124 (red deer) and 88 (fallow deer) volatile compounds in male scent-gland odour secretions, including naturally occurring ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, terpenes, carboxylic acids, esters, volatile fatty acids, and hydrocarbons. Odour richness, but not total abundance or ratios of compounds, changed with testosterone levels in red deer. In conclusion, our preliminary findings suggest that deslorelin acetate, causing a decrease of testosterone level and impacting the chemical profile of odour secretions, could work as a non-invasive contraception approach in human-managed populations of deer.

AB  - The assessment of species' diet and trophic plasticity serve as key elements to understand their adaptations to harsh ecosystems, such as deserts and dry forests. Among dung beetles, coprophagy is the main feeding habit, which may be substituted or complemented by other unusual diets, such as granivory and necrophagy. This study presents new records of dung beetle uncommon diets in Caatinga, the largest Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest in America. We include novel descriptions of the genera Dichotomius Hope, 1838 and Canthidium Erichson, 1847 in using and removing seeds in Caatinga. We also present the first report of dung beetles from Caatinga attracted to dead millipedes, specifically for Coprophanaeus pertyi (Olsufieff, 1924). Also, we found goat hairballs along with the roller beetle Deltochilum verruciferum Felsche, 1911 inside a pitfall trap, suggesting that this species may use animal fur to feed or breed. Finally, we included an updated list on unusual food records of dung beetle species in Caatinga dry forest. Our findings indicate that dung beetles in Caatinga display diverse feeding habits in response to extreme environmental conditions and/or limited resources. We expand the still-scarce knowledge regarding dung beetle feeding ecology outside their interaction with dung or the soft tissues of carrion. Despite our findings, new evidence is essential to reinforce our understanding on trophic plasticity of dung beetles in Caatinga. A better comprehension of resource plasticity by dung beetles will also be a significant input for biodiversity conservation due to the changes in food availability in anthropogenic landscapes.

AB  - Elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) can affect the environmental adaptability of herbivorous insects by affecting the quality and quantity of host plants' nutrients under climate change. In this study, the impacts of eCO(2) on carbohydrate metabolism, chitin synthesis and cuticle thickness of western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) fed on kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) leaves were studied to elucidate the physiological responses of F. occidentalis to eCO(2) and provide a theoretical basis for the occurrence trend of thrips under future climate change. The results indicated that the trehalose and glycogen contents in F. occidentalis adults significantly increased with corresponding regulation of key genes related to carbohydrate metabolism under eCO(2) compared to ambient CO2 (aCO(2)), which was closely related to the increased foliar contents of starch and soluble sugars in P. vulgaris grown under eCO(2). Subsequently, since trehalose is a precursor of chitin, changes in its content would further affect the chitin synthesis. With the up-regulation of genes related to chitin synthesis and the down-regulation of most genes related to chitin hydrolysis, the chitin content in F. occidentalis adults significantly increased resulting in their increased cuticle thickness and layers, which might enhance their resistance under eCO(2) and become "thick-skinned thrips" under climate change condition.

AB  - Spatial heterogeneity in the local densities of terrestrial carnivores is driven by multiple interacting biotic and abiotic factors. Space-use patterns of large carnivores reflect the competing demands of resource selection (e.g., exploitation of habitats with abundant prey) and minimization of risks arising from human interactions. Estimating the relative strength of these drivers is essential to understand spatial variation in densities of large carnivores and there are still key knowledge gaps for many large carnivore populations. To better understand the relative roles of environmental and human drivers of spatial variation in tiger (Panthera tigris) densities, we surveyed a 3000 km2 landscape in North India using camera trap data. Over two years, we photo-captured 92 unique adult tigers. Associating spatial covariates with patterns of detection allowed us to test hypotheses about the relative influence of prey abundance, habitat structure and extent, and proximity to habitat edges on spatial variation in tiger densities across a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance. We documented extensive variation in tiger density within and across management units and protected areas. Spatial variation in prey abundance and proximity to grassland habitats, rather than human use (e.g. extent of human-dominated edge habitat and protection status), explained most of the spatial variation in tiger density in two of the five surveyed sites. The region's largest tiger population occurred in a multi-use forest beyond protected area boundaries, where wild ungulates were abundant. Our results suggest that tigers can occur at high densities in areas with extensive human use, provided sufficiently high prey densities, and tracts of refuge habitats (eg. areas with dense vegetation with low human use). We argue that tiger conservation portfolio can be expanded across multi-use landscapes with a focus on areas that are adaptively managed as "zones of coexistence" and "refuge habitats". Advancing this conservation strategy is contingent on greatly strengthening systems to effectively and equitably redress human-wildlife conflict and leveraging existing policies to strengthen local participation in conservation planning and forest stewardship. Our insights into the environmental drivers of spatial heterogeneity in tiger populations can inform both local management and guide to species recovery in working landscapes.

AB  - Under global change scenarios, rising seawater temperature could affect the toxicity of chemical pollutants on marine organisms. Tropical species inhabiting coastal areas are especially vulnerable to diurnal temperature variation (DTV), yet the impacts of DTV on pollutant toxicity remains obscured. This study evaluated how a 4 degrees C DTV affects the toxicity of phenanthrene (PHE) on the physiological traits of Trochus pyramis, a key herbivorous gastropod in coral reef ecosystems, under both control (28 degrees C) and elevated temperature (31 degrees C) conditions. T. pyramis were exposed to PHE (1 and 10 mu g/L) across different temperature scenarios for 14 days. Subsequently, PHE bioaccumulation, heat tolerance, antioxidant responses, and energy budgets of T. pyramis were assessed. The results showed that PHE had minimal effect on T. pyramis under DTV at 28 degrees C, likely due to enhanced antioxidant responses and adaptive energy supply strategies induced by DTV. Conversely, DTV exacerbated the deleterious effect of PHE at 31 degrees C, particularly under exposure to high-concentration PHE (10 mu g/ L), leading to reduced heat tolerance, suppressed antioxidant responses, and disturbed energy metabolism. These results underscore the necessity of incorporating DTV into PHE risk assessments for coral reef ecosystems in the context of global warming.

AB  - Using a spatial econometric approach and national prefecture-level hog inventory data, this paper analyzes the extent to which environmental regulation policies influence hog production in China, and obtained the following research results: 1) During the 12th Five-Year Plan period, environmental regulation policies will significantly reduce the output of the hog industry in highly regulated areas. 2) The specific policy commands from the central government targeting on livestock sector and a high share of agriculture in the economy will increase the stringency of the environmental regulation policies on hog production. 3) The COD emission reduction requirements also have a significant negative impact on major hog farming provinces, the results obtained from the main model are verified again. The results highlight the importance of a more flexible environmental decentralization regime in China and other developing countries for future reforms.

AB  - Marine community science presents an important route to gather valuable scientific information while also influencing local management and policy, thus contributing to marine conservation efforts. Because seahorses are cryptic but charismatic species, they are good candidates for engaging diverse people to help overcome the many gaps in biological knowledge. We have synthesized information contributed to the community science project iSeahorse from October 2013 to April 2022 for 35 of 46 known seahorse species. We then compared the obtained results with information in existing IUCN Red List assessments, executed from 2014 to 2017, to explore the potential of iSeahorse in expanding seahorse knowledge. Our results show updated geographic ranges for 7 seahorse species, new habitats described for 24 species, observations outside the previously recorded depth range for 14 species, and new information on sex ratio for 15 species and on pregnancy seasonality for 11 species. As one example of the power of iSeahorse, contributed observations on Coleman's pygmy seahorse (Hippocampus colemani) indicated that its geographic range is thousands of square kilometers larger, its habitat more diverse, and its depth range shallower than previously known. It is clear that iSeahorse is expanding knowledge on seahorses to a level that will help improve IUCN Red List assessments. The power of community science for marine conservation in general needs to be fully explored.

AB  - Simple Summary One of the main aims of selection is enhancing the economically important traits of animals and plants. Crossbreeding is one of the common ways to improve the economically important traits. Usually, different species of one genus are used for crossbreeding. The use of different closely related species is known as hybridization. It is expected that hybrids will have advantages over their parents in terms of economic productivity due to the effect known as heterosis. However, the phenomenon of negative heterosis exists and can induce negative impacts on different important traits, such as viability, reproductivity, productivity, etc. The exact biological mechanisms of negative heterosis remain unknown. In this study, we aimed to determine the genetic factors associated with negative heterosis in interspecific hybrids between domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and argali (Ovis ammon). We discovered one novel locus associated with viability and two novel loci associated with meat productivity. For loci associated with meat productivity, we demonstrated the effect of negative heterosis. These results may help to understand one of the possible genetic mechanisms of negative heterosis. Negative heterosis can occur on different economically important traits, but the exact biological mechanisms of this phenomenon are still unknown. The present study focuses on determining the genetic factors associated with negative heterosis in interspecific hybrids between domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and argali (Ovis ammon). One locus (rs417431015) associated with viability and two loci (rs413302370, rs402808951) associated with meat productivity were identified. One gene (ARAP2) was prioritized for viability and three for meat productivity (PDE2A, ARAP1, and PCDH15). The loci associated with meat productivity were demonstrated to fit the overdominant inheritance model and could potentially be involved int negative heterosis mechanisms.

AB  - Hunting with lead ammunition represents a source of heavy metal pollution to the environment that can be potentially high at the local scale. Intensive hunting of small game species can concentrate high levels of ammunition discharging in small areas. This type of hunting is a relevant economic resource for private landowners in some regions of Spain, and current legislation allows the use of lead ammunition in these scenarios. It becomes, therefore, highly relevant to study whether this activity may pose concerns to the conservation of the environment in the areas where it takes place. Using a red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa) shooting range as a study area, we examined the effect of intensive hunting on this species on the vegetation present. We found significantly higher lead levels in the sprouts of plants of shooting areas related to control sites of the same property where partridge shooting does not occur. We found differences in the presence of lead between sprouts of different plant species. In addition, old sprouts of existing vegetation in shooting areas also showed higher lead levels than newly emerged sprouts of the same plants. These results demonstrate the impact of lead ammunition on vegetation in terms of persistence over time and differences between species. Further analyses using chemical and ecotoxicological data are necessary to evaluate the extent of environmental pollution risks. Our results provide new support in favor of the use of alternative ammunition, with particular emphasis on scenarios where hunting activity is intensive.

AB  - Environmental impact evaluation of buildings is critical for further analysis and optimization of pig farms for sustainable pork production. This study is the first attempt to quantify the carbon and water footprints of a standard intensive pig farm building using building information modeling (BIM) and operation simulation model. The model was constructed with carbon emission and water consumption coefficients, and a database was built. The results showed that the operational stage of pig farm accounted for most of the carbon footprint (49.3-84.9 %) and water footprint (65.5-92.5 %). Building materials production ranked second in carbon (12.0-42 .5 %) and water footprints (4.4-24.9 %), and pig farm maintenance ranked third in carbon (1.7-5.7 %) and water footprints (0.7-3.6 %). Notably, the mining and production stages of building materials contributed the largest carbon and water footprints of pig farm construction. Masonry materials have a significant impact on the overall carbon and water footprints of the pig farm. Pig farm using aerated concrete could reduce 41.1 % of the total carbon footprint and 58.9 % of the total water footprint compared to that using coal gangue sintered brick and autoclaved fly ash brick. This study presented a BIM-enabled method for carbon and water footprint analysis of pig farms and illustrated how the model can be used to facilitate the low carbon design of agricultural buildings.

AB  - Simple Summary Liquid feeding is an alternative practice employed in swine production that allows the recovery of low-cost liquid by-products to reduce environmental impact. This type of feeding can positively affect animal's gut health, well-being, and performance. Liquid whey is a palatable feed and it can represent a resource to administer ingredients without additional costly processes. Nowadays, the study of the gut microbiome is considered a relevant tool due to the impact of this research field on host health, well-being, and growth. Therefore, this study investigated the fecal microbiota of the autochthonous pig breed Nero Siciliano fed a liquid whey co-feed-supplemented diet using a metagenomics approach. The utilization of dairy by-products as animal feed, especially in swine production, is a strategy to provide functional ingredients to improve gut health. This study explored the potential effect of a liquid whey-supplemented diet on the fecal microbiota of eleven pigs belonging to the Nero Siciliano breed. Five pigs were assigned to the control group and fed with a standard formulation feed, whereas six pigs were assigned to the experimental group and fed with the same feed supplemented with liquid whey. Fecal samples were collected from each individual before the experimental diet (T0), and one (T1) and two (T2) months after the beginning of the co-feed supplementation. Taxonomic analysis, based on the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA, showed that pig feces were populated by a complex microbial community with a remarkable abundance of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Spirochaetes phyla and Prevotella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Treponema genera. Alpha and beta diversity values suggested that the experimental diet did not significantly affect the overall fecal microbiota diversity. However, analysis of abundance at different time points revealed significant variation in several bacterial genera, suggesting that the experimental diet potentially affected some genera of the microbial community.

AB  - Outdoor pig production (OPP) can be considered an intensive system in many areas of the Mediterranean region. The concentration of the rainfall in the winter season, the OPP's topographic and soil properties, together with the continuous input of food and pigs' excreta, contribute to a profound increase in the nutrients leaching and soil erosion. This work aimed to evaluate the accuracy of the DRASTIC-LU index and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to provide early information to improve the planning of this type of pig production through more adequate location and sustainable management practices. The two models were applied to an OPP with 2.24 ha, with a heavy animal charge (one adult per 1.120 m(2)). The results showed that 85% of the OPP area has a moderate risk to the vulnerability index to groundwater pollution and 15% high risk. The risk of soil erosion ranged from very severe to extremely severe in 96% of the area. The DRASTIC-LU indexes and the RUSLE model produce a multi-risk assessment that agreed with the observed field data. These two models showed accuracy to be used for early assessment when choosing the best location and improving management practices for OPP systems.

AB  - Individuals pay attention to the social and mate decisions of others and use these to determine their own choices, displaying mate choice copying. The present study with deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus, showed that females copied the odor preferences and appetitive components of the mate choice of other females. It was found that an association between male and female odors, which is indicative of the apparent interest expressed by a female in a male, enhanced the preference of another female for the odors of that male. This socially learned odor preference lasted for at least 24 h and extended to a preference for the actual male that was the odor source. Neither kinship nor prior familiarity with the female whose odor was presented had a significant influence on the degree of odor-based mate choice copying displayed. These findings show that female deer mice can engage in mate choice copying using the odor-based social interest and mate choice of other females.

AB  - To study the rational application of pig manure, biogas residue and their effect on the improvement of soil fertility in tea garden, a plot location experiment of applying chemical fertilizer (T1), half-amount pig manure biogas residue (T2), fill amount pig manure biogas residue (T3) and pig manure organic fertilizer (T4) in tea garden soil for three consecutive years was carried out. Soil physicochemical properties, microbial biomass, carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents and related enzyme activities were compared among different treatments. The results showed that different pig manure application methods could effectively reduce the acidification degree of tea garden soil, and improve soil organic matter, soil total content and available NPK fertility, among which T4 treatment increased the most significantly. Compared with CK, the contents of soil organic matter, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium in T4 treatment were increased by 60.83%, 223.36%, 239.22% and 90.39%, respectively. The contents of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in microbial biomass were increased by 44.15%, 98.51% and 121.31%, respectively. Soil sucrase, urease, acid phosphatase, catalase and cellulase activities were increased by 23.00%, 37.69%, 40.24%, 31.53% and 61.07%, respectively. There were significant or extremely significant positive correlations between the activities of five enzymes and the contents of soil organic matter and nutrients. The results showed that soil organic matter and nutrient contents, enzyme activities and microbial biomass were significantly increased under different pig manure application methods, among which the application of pig manure organic fertilizer had the most significant effect. However, it was necessary to pay attention to the problems such as the aggravation of nitrogen and phosphorus loss caused by the high content of soil available nutrients.

AB  - Rewilding and species reintroductions are increasingly important conservation strategies, involving both captive-bred and wild-rescued animals, with the goal of restoring ecosystems and supporting populations of threatened species. Over the past 30 years, the Elephant Transit Home in Sri Lanka has rescued and rehabilitated more than 150 orphaned elephant calves that were subsequently released back into the wild. Understanding how rehabilitation and release processes affect the welfare status of these calves can provide valuable information on factors affecting release outcomes. This study evaluated patterns of faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (fGCM) concentrations as a physiological indicator of stress in 10 orphaned elephants (six males, four females) rescued at <= 1 year of age and released back into Udawalawe National Park after rehabilitation at the Elephant Transit Home (release age, 6 to 8 years). Faecal samples (similar to 2/week) were collected for 9 months pre- (n = 53 samples) and 16 months post- (n = 153 samples) release. Mean fGCM concentrations during the early post-release period (first 17 days) were significantly higher than in pre- and later post-release periods, with no differences between males and females. Results indicate elephants adapted quickly after release, likely aided by being released in a small group (n = 10) of socialized cohorts. In fact, fGCM normalized to concentrations lower on average than at the Elephant Transit Home in the months preceding release. Understanding the stress response of elephants during and after translocations is crucial for well-being and successful integration into the wild. Minimizing stress through appropriate protocols, such as selecting strong social units, is essential. Hormonal monitoring is a valuable tool that should be considered long-term to assess the adaptation, survival and eventual reproductive success of rewilded elephants.

AB  - The addition of nutrients to soil can induce changes through "bottom-up" effects in soil-plant-animal interactions, impacting higher levels in food chains. Changes in foliar nutrient content may influence diets of herbivorous insects, subsequently altering their feeding rates and abundance. Spiders established in foliage rely on these insects for sustenance; therefore, fluctuations in the abundance of herbivorous insect communities ultimately determine the population dynamics of their spider predators. We established a long-term field experiment to investigate the effects of nutrient addition of N (nitrogen), P (phosphorus), K (potassium) and their combinations on plant-arthropod interactions. We carried out sampling in 32 plots under different nutrient addition treatments, where we captured herbivorous insects and spiders on Nothofagus antarctica plants, the most abundant plant species in the Patagonian scrubland. Our results showed that foliar nutrient concentrations had cascading effects throughout the forest food chain. Herbivorous insects (Diptera, Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera orders) exhibited a positive response to the increased foliar phosphorus content, resulting in higher population densities. In addition, we found a strong positive relationship between herbivorous insect abundance and spider abundance. Our findings indicate that variations in the availability of soil nutrients play a crucial role in defining the structure of predator-prey interactions in forest ecosystems.

AB  - The foraging behavior of ruminating ungulates significantly impacts forest ecosystems due to their nutritional requirements. This study focuses on inter-specific comparisons of bark browsing (stripping) between Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Field measurements were conducted at the previously established research demonstration site "Husarik" in the Javorniky Mountains, north-western Slovakia. We measured the sizes of wounds on stems and assessed the dimensions of unrecovered parts of wounds, subsequently calculating areas of recovered bark patches. Then, the total areas of wounds recovered patches, and unrecovered parts were measured. Additionally, the percentages of wound areas, recovered areas, and unrecovered areas were expressed as proportions relative to the total bark surface. Influencing factors such as the position of wounds along the vertical stem profile and stem diameter class were analyzed using two- and three-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD test. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of both tree species to bark browsing by ruminating ungulates, primarily red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in our study site. Douglas fir exhibited slightly less intense browsing compared to silver fir, while silver fir had a slightly higher recovery rate. Specifically, 17.0% of the bark surface in Douglas fir and 21.5% in silver fir were browsed. The proportions of recovered areas on wounds were 62.5% and 69.6% in Douglas fir and silver fir, respectively. Regarding the vertical stem profile, the most intense browsing occurred at a height of 101-125 cm from the ground level, with rates of 40.7% in Douglas fir and 47.0% in silver fir. Browsing intensity showed negligible variation among diameter classes, which were classified as up to 35 mm, 35-50 mm, and over 50 mm. Our findings suggest that, as an introduced species, Douglas fir is not a suitable substitute for other commercially significant tree species in supporting sustainable forestry in European countries where ruminating ungulates are overabundant.

AB  - Blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) is an economically important herbivorous fish native to China. However, the lack of high-efficient genotyping tools has impeded the genomic breeding programs for M. amblycephala. SNP array, an important genotyping platform, is crucial for implementing genomic selection. In this study, we employed the genotyping by liquid hybridization capture sequencing technology to create a multiple single-nucleotide polymorphism (mSNP) liquid array named Fangxin-I, which comprised 49,173 evenly distributed SNP loci across the 24 chromosomes of M. amblycephala. The array was designed for the comprehensive assessment of allelic variations across the genome of M. amblycephala. A total of 79.59 % of the array loci were of high-quality, with a genotyping success rate of 98.63 % across 52 individuals. The average genotype concordance rates reached 96.56 % between batches, and 99.40 % within batches. The comparison of the genotyping results between the SNP array and whole-genome re-sequencing indicated a genotype concordance of 98.32 %. Fangxin-I SNP array was subsequently employed for population genetics and genetic sex identification to validate its efficiency and accuracy. The analysis results indicated that the phylogenetic trees constructed for six populations of M. amblycephala, using the genotyping data from the Fangxin-I SNP array and the identified genomic loci from re-sequencing, reflected similar genetic relationships. Fangxin-I demonstrated a high accuracy in the genetic sex identification, affirming its effectiveness in both population genetics and genetic sex determination. Additionally, the array was used for genome-wide association study and identified the loci related to the resistance of Aeromonas hydrophila in M. amblycephala mainly on chromosomes 2, 4, 11 and 20. In summary, Fangxin-I SNP array will serve as an instrumental platform for high-quality genotyping, thereby facilitating the genomic selection breeding of M. amblycephala.

AB  - Rubber-based agroforestry systems increased the complexity of fungal networks.Fungal community structure was strongly correlated with soil pH and SOC.Rubber-based agroforestry systems reduced the presence of certain pathogens.Rubber-based agroforestry systems have been recognized as a practical and sustainable solution to promote the development of agriculture and the environment. However, interactions between fungal communities and these systems are still not sufficiently investigated. In this study, we compared the abundance, diversity, and community composition of soil fungi in four treatments, including rubber monoculture and three rubber-based agro-forestry treatments involving intercropping with Camellia sinensis, Coffea liberica, and Theobroma cacao. The results revealed that the community composition exhibited significant variation between the four different treatments, while the overall soil alpha-diversity was relatively stable across all treatments. Soil pH and soil organic carbon were significantly related to the structure of the fungal community. In particular, the complexity of the functional fungal network increased in response to agroforestry treatments, promoting beneficial fungi and suppressing certain plant pathogens. These results suggest that rubber-based agroforestry systems can promote the health of soil microbial community composition, and therefore provide an effective approach to enhancing soil quality.

AB  - The current study investigated avian diversity correspondence with the potential threats to their habitat in and around Rudrasagar Lake. This study designed extensive field surveys at sixteen sites following distance point counting and fixed transect methods for birds' quantification. Currently, total 56 avian species were recorded, of which 55.35% species primarily inhabit waterbody peripheral terrestrial (WPT) zone, while 28.57% prefer to forage in swampy zones around the edge of the water body (EWB). Only 16.07% of bird species were recorded in open water bodies (IOW). The study also stratified 85.74% of the bird species as residents and 14.28% as migrants. Network mapping also showed that omnivores were the most prevalent (41.07%) while insectivores (16.07%) and herbivores (10.07%) were less common due to their specific diets. Shannon-Weiner (H'), Simpson (Ds) and Pielou's (J') indices indicated higher species diversity and relatively even distribution among the WPT community. Bird diversity was observed lowest at Rajghat which experienced the highest degree of anthropogenic disturbances for traditional tourism and recreational activities. Surface area reduction for encroachment posed a substantial threat to habitat health for IOW birds. Near-threatened and vulnerable species like Oriental darter, Common pochard and Painted stork recorded in 2002 are conspicuously absent from recent surveys. Declining avian population and local extinctions related to wetland degradation is considered a serious threat. Proposed management plan implied the requirement to conserve this enclave in accordance to increase the avian population and habitat sustainability. Therefore, this scholarly work drew immediate attention to develop management strategies for avian species conservation.

AB  - Simple Summary
   The seroprevalence of contagious caprine pleuropneumonia in goats and sheep was determined and the associated risk factors were identified using the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) data mining model. The disease is more prevalent in older animals raised in a flock size >= 200 and that have communal feeding and watering. The CART model showed that the flock size >100 animals is the most important risk factor (importance score = 8.9), followed by age >4 y (5.3) and communal feeding and watering (3.1). The CART model showed more accuracy (area under the curve, AUC = 0.92 than the traditional logistic regression (AUC = 0.89).
   Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis is a potentially powerful tool for identifying risk factors associated with contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) and the important interactions between them. Our objective was therefore to determine the seroprevalence and identify the risk factors associated with CCPP using CART data mining modeling in the most densely sheep- and goat-populated governorates. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 620 animals (390 sheep, 230 goats) distributed over four governorates in the Nile Delta of Egypt in 2019. The randomly selected sheep and goats from different geographical study areas were serologically tested for CCPP, and the animals' information was obtained from flock men and farm owners. Six variables (geographic location, species, flock size, age, gender, and communal feeding and watering) were used for risk analysis. Multiple stepwise logistic regression and CART modeling were used for data analysis. A total of 124 (20%) serum samples were serologically positive for CCPP. The highest prevalence of CCPP was between aged animals (>4 y; 48.7%) raised in a flock size >= 200 (100%) having communal feeding and watering (28.2%). Based on logistic regression modeling (area under the curve, AUC = 0.89; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.91), communal feeding and watering showed the highest prevalence odds ratios (POR) of CCPP (POR = 3.7, 95% CI 1.9 to 7.3), followed by age (POR = 2.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.8) and flock size (POR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2). However, higher-accuracy CART modeling (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.95) showed that a flock size >100 animals is the most important risk factor (importance score = 8.9), followed by age >4 y (5.3) followed by communal feeding and watering (3.1). Our results strongly suggest that the CCPP is most likely to be found in animals raised in a flock size >100 animals and with age >4 y having communal feeding and watering. Additionally, sheep seem to have an important role in the CCPP epidemiology. The CART data mining modeling showed better accuracy than the traditional logistic regression.

AB  - Invasive species are the second largest contributor to biodiversity loss and drivers of ecosystem change. Buffelgrass is a C4, perennial grass native to Africa and Asia that was widely introduced across tropical and subtropical rangelands as livestock forage. Buffelgrass reduces native biodiversity and ecosystem stability in its introduced range when it escapes livestock pastures. Understanding the ecology of insects associated with buffelgrass in its native range may provide an understanding of invasion processes and biological control opportunities where buffelgrass has become an invasive challenge. Here, we present the results of a six-year survey of herbivorous arthropods of a native buffelgrass population from Kenya. Buffelgrass was examined for externally and internally feeding insects of vegetative and reproductive tissues. We also categorised buffelgrass detritivores and parasitoids that may use buffelgrass herbivores as hosts. The samples were photographed and Sanger sequenced to identify them to the lowest possible taxonomic ranking. We collected information on sample abundances, phenologies, tissues consumed, and putative diet breadths. We identified 25 morphospecies representing seven orders and 16 families. The putative host plant specialisation was as high as 67% for Diptera. Phenological variation in herbivore presence correlated with seasonal rainfall and provided a guide for when to conduct follow-up biological control agent searches. The most abundant herbivore was a gall midge (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) that inhabits buffelgrass culms. Additional research should focus on bringing this species into containment where host choice trials can be conducted to determine if it is truly monophagous and assess its impact on buffelgrass growth.

AB  - Aloe claviflora, widely distributed across the arid regions of southern Africa, remains understudied. In 2016, a population on the Wolwekraal Nature Reserve (113 ha) in the Western Cape, Succulent Karoo Biome, was surveyed to examine size class distribution and floral visitors. The genet population (205) had an inverse-J shape distribution with most genets occurring in the small size class (<0.5-1 m) and fewer occurring in the large size classes. The ramet population (1354), exhibited a typical bell-shaped distribution, with 77% of ramets in 2016 occurring in the reproductive size class. In 2016 and 2021, 33% and 29% of the population produced flowers, respectively, which were visited by birds, reptiles, honeybees, solitary bees, and small mammals. Persistent drought (2015-2021) halted flowering in 2019 and 2020. Browsing by Cape Porcupine was first observed in 2018. Therefore, subsequent surveys conducted in 2019 and 2021 assessed the extent of damage. Since 2016, 62.9% of genets and 39.7% of ramets were destroyed. The data suggest that the animals frequently browsed on reproductive ramets. This study highlights the impact of drought-induced porcupine browsing on A. claviflora survival, underscoring significant changes in porcupine behavior and the resulting population decline of this long-lived, arid-adapted species.

AB  - The variability of food resources considerably affects the habitat preferences of animals. In mast years, the availability of highly nutritive food increases significantly. We tested whether changes in the distribution of the areas of wisents, Bison bonasus L. concentration, in the Bieszczady Mountains, Poland, were connected with the availability of beechnuts. In the two beech masting years of 2013 and 2022, we considered the months with the highest availability of beechnuts, namely September and October. The beechnut crop varied significantly between as little as 2.4 g dry matter/m2, recorded within the Baligr & oacute;d herd's home range in 2013, and up to 238.8 g dry matter/m2 within the Tworylne herd's range, also in 2013. The analysis of the spatial distribution of beech stands within various parts of the wisents' home range showed that within the 95% kernel area, their share was mostly high, varying between 25.7% and 42.8%. Meanwhile, within the 50% kernel area, it was generally much lower, except for the year 2022 in the case of the Baligr & oacute;d herd. The densities of wisents varied significantly between the kernel areas of 95% and 50%, ranging between 0.04 and 0.08 animals/ha and 0.17 and 0.48 animals/ha, respectively. However, there was no statistical difference between the figures for all plots tested within the home range of the wisent population and plots dominated by beech. Based on the data obtained in this study, habitat selection patterns of wisents in the Bieszczady Mountains cannot be explained by the availability of beech stands and the phenomenon of mast years.

AB  - Robust monitoring programs are essential for understanding changes in wildlife population dynamics and distribution over time, especially for species of conservation concern. In this study, we applied a rapid non-invasive sampling approach to the Critically Endangered African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), at nationwide scale in its principal remaining population strongholds in Gabon. We used a species-specific customized genetic panel and spatial capturerecapture (SCR) approach, which gave a snapshot of current abundance and density distribution of forest elephants across the country. We estimated mean forest elephant density at 0.38 (95% Confidence Interval 0.24-0.52) per km2 from 18 surveyed sites. We confirm that Gabon is the main forest elephant stronghold, both in terms of estimated population size: 95,110 (95% CI 58,872-131,349) and spatial distribution (250,782 km2). Predicted elephant densities were highest in relatively flat areas with a high proportion of suitable habitat not in proximity to the national border. Protected areas and human pressure were not strong predictors of elephant densities in this study. Our nationwide systematic survey of forest elephants of Gabon serves as a proof-of-concept of application of noninvasive genetic sampling for rigorous population monitoring at large spatial scales. To our knowledge, it is the first nationwide DNA-based assessment of a free-ranging large mammal in Africa. Our findings offer a useful national baseline and status update for forest elephants in Gabon. It will inform adaptive management and stewardship of elephants and forests in the most important national forest elephant stronghold in Africa.

AB  - Abundant gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum (Lesueur, 1818) are thought to contribute to phytoplankton blooms by translocating nutrients from sediments to the water column where they can be readily taken up by phytoplankton and by consuming herbivorous zooplankton that might control phytoplankton. To assess the influence of gizzard shad relative abundance on lentic ecosystems, we sampled 12 small impoundments located in the Great Plains, USA over 4 years. We used linear mixed models to test for associations with limnological characteristics, including total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), zooplankton densities, and phytoplankton abundances. Gizzard shad relative abundance was associated with elevated TN and TP and a general reduction in zooplankton densities. There was substantial within-lake temporal variation in gizzard shad abundance across sampling months, with a negative association between TP and gizzard shad abundance in June but a positive association in August. We did not provide evidence that gizzard shad relative abundance was associated with cyanobacterial abundance or total phytoplankton abundance. The lack of a relationship between these factors might have been obscured by the discontinuous polymictic mixing regimes of the study impoundments, the rapid turnover of phytoplankton, and other drivers, such as variable nutrient runoff across our study impoundments.

AB  - In a world increasingly affected by human presence and activities, achieving human-wildlife coexistence has become the goal of many wildlife conservation programs. Coexistence requires an understanding of factors that contribute to human tolerance and acceptance of problematic wildlife. In four communities in Nigeria, we used structured and semi-structured interviews to explore local people's acceptance of the river hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius) at a large reservoir with high human impact and where other conspicuous, damage-causing species are absent. We collected data two years apart to evaluate whether acceptance changed over time. Acceptance was low among respondents (21%). Logistic-regression results showed that attitudes, beliefs related to benefits and risks, behaviors toward hippos, study period, and income source significantly influenced acceptance of hippos. Results from Woolf tests showed that hippo-caused human fatalities most notably modified the observed decline in acceptance between study years. The potential significant impact of rare, yet severe events (in this case, human fatalities) on acceptance of wildlife and thus human-wildlife coexistence was supported in this study, one of few focused on hippo-human relations. For conservation and development interventions to be effective at this site, they should, at a minimum, improve human safety around hippos, emphasize current and potential benefits of hippos, create avenues for off-farm income, and reduce crop losses owing to hippos.

AB  - Dispersal is a key process that impacts population dynamics and structures biotic communities. Dispersal limitation influences the assembly of plant and microbial communities, including mycorrhizal fungi and their plant hosts. Mycorrhizal fungi play key ecological roles in forests by feeding nutrients to plants in exchange for sugars, so the dispersal of mycorrhizal fungi spores actively shapes plant communities. Although many fungi rely on wind for spore dispersal, some fungi have lost the ability to shoot their spores into the air and instead produce enclosed belowground fruiting bodies (truffles) that rely on animals for dispersal. The role of mammals in fungal spore dispersal is well documented, but the relevance of birds as dispersal agents of fungi has been understudied, despite the prominence of birds as seed dispersal vectors. Here, we use metagenomics and epifluorescence microscopy to demonstrate that two common, widespread, and endemic Patagonian birds, chucao tapaculos (Scelorchilus rubecula) and black-throated huet-huets (Pteroptochos tarnii), regularly consume mycorrhizal fungi and disperse viable spores via mycophagy. Our metagenomic analysis indicates that these birds routinely consume diverse mycorrhizal fungi, including many truffles, that are symbiotically associated with Nothofagaceae trees that dominate Patagonian forests. Epifluorescence microscopy of fecal samples confirmed that the birds dispersed copious viable spores from truffles and other mycorrhizal fungi. We show that fungi are a common food for both bird species and that this animal-fungi symbiosis is widespread and ecologically important in Patagonia. Our findings indicate that birds may also act as cryptic but critical fungal dispersal agents in other ecosystems.

AB  - Many protected areas worldwide have been established to protect the last natural refuges of flagship animal species. However, long-established protected areas do not always match the current distributions of target species under changing environmental conditions. Here we present a case study of the Asian elephant Elephas maximus in Xishuangbanna, south-west China, to evaluate whether the established protected areas match the species' current distribution and to identify key habitat patches for Asian elephant conservation. Our results show that currently only 24.5% of the predicted Asian elephant distribution in Xishuangbanna is located within Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve, which was established for elephant conservation. Based on the predicted Asian elephant distribution, we identified the most important habitat patches for elephant conservation in Xishuangbanna. The three most important patches were outside Xishuangbanna National Nature Reserve and together they contained 43.3% of the estimated food resources for Asian elephants in all patches in Xishuangbanna. Thus, we identified a spatial mismatch between immobile protected areas and mobile animals. We recommend the inclusion of the three identified key habitat patches in a new national park currently being planned by the Chinese authorities for the conservation of the Asian elephant.

AB  - To ensure successful introductions and translocations of giraffes, more scientific information is needed on their diet selections, especially concerning the availability of browsing material. To our knowledge, this 15-month study is one of the first to assess giraffe diet selection by fitting global positioning system collars on this species to monitor the spatial distribution and identify the most utilised vegetation and areas. The study population resided in the Khamab Kalahari Nature Reserve in the northwestern Kalahari region of South Africa. The results indicated the clear utilisation of specific plant species of specific areas during different seasons and between different vegetation types and species. This study provides innovative information to understand better how this giraffe population from the northwestern Kalahari region has adapted its diet selections, especially when compared to other giraffe populations from different regions.
   Diet selection concerning browse availability of giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) was studied over 15 months in an arid environment in South Africa. A global positioning system collar was fitted to a giraffe individual to assess the specific areas, consisting of different vegetation types, that the population utilised during different seasons. Results are provided on diet selection in relation to browse availability between seasons and vegetation types, including tree densities and the amount of the total evapotranspiration tree equivalents. Diet selections of the giraffe population changed in response to the availability of browse material from July to October. The availability of important resource areas had a significant (p < 0.05) effect on the spatial ecology, and an increase in home range size was noted. Information that is important for the well-being of giraffes was identified. This included nutritional stress and the limited variety of the most utilised tree species available for browsing, especially during critical dry periods. The results demonstrate the importance of assessment of giraffes' diet selection in relation to browse availability, especially before introduction to a new area, to limit the lack of population growth and underperformance. This study provides valuable information towards understanding the resources and habitats required for successful giraffe management.

AB  - Methods that supplement optical instruments with bait, such as baited remote underwater video (BRUV), are used worldwide to detect and quantify marine life. Optical instruments only detect targets within visible range, such that BRUVs may underestimate fishes in light-limited habitats, especially fishes that respond to the bait at ranges beyond visibility. Alternatively, light-independent instruments (e.g., imaging sonars) can detect and quantify fishes regardless of visibility. This study presents the first application of a baited imaging sonar (BISON), deployed to survey fishes around a small, shallow artificial habitat in a turbid embayment in southern Florida. To establish the influence of bait on fish detection, BISON trials were alternately conducted alongside deployments of an unbaited control, with a high-definition camera integrated to ascertain visibility and inform species composition. For fishes of two size classes, larger (> 30 cm) and smaller (10-30 cm), maximum density (MaxD) and range of detection were quantified. Although the densities of larger and smaller fishes quantified by the BISON and unbaited control did not differ, over 55% of larger fishes were detected at ranges beyond maximum visibility, with asymptotes in fish density on the BISON identified at 15-20 min and 5-10 min for larger and smaller fishes, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of BISONs as both a complementary and alternative method to BRUVs for quantifying fishes, especially in habitats of limited visibility. Future applications of BISONs in other habitats will further demonstrate its value as a tool to detect and enumerate aquatic assemblages.

AB  - Insecticide overuse in crop production systems often results in detrimental effects on predators and parasitoids, which regulate important insect pests. The natural enemies are also unable to survive in monocrop landscapes with the absence of shelter or food sources. Diversified vegetation, especially with flowering plants, can enhance natural enemy abundance and diversity, thus strengthening biological control, enabling farmers to reduce insecticides. In this study, we conserved bund vegetation and manipulated the existing rice landscapes with flowering plants to provide food and shelter for the biological control agents. Our study revealed significant positive relationships between predator densities and bund plant diversity. The abundance of predators significantly increased in the eco-engineered plots, especially at the flowering peaks compared to the insecticide-treated and control plots, while parasitoids were more diverse in both the eco-engineered and control plots. There were no significant differences in planthopper and leafhopper densities among the treatments during the rice early and maximum tillering stages, suggesting effective natural control of these herbivore pests in the eco-engineered plots at the early rice-growing season. However, at the heading stage relatively higher planthopper and leafhopper populations in the control and eco-engineered plots than in the insecticide-sprayed plots were recorded, suggesting perhaps the need for insecticide interventions if exceeding the threshold at this time. Our study indicates that manipulating the habitats surrounding the rice fields to enhance natural enemies is a sustainable practice in rice production as it can enhance the natural suppression of pests and thus reducing the need for insecticide.

AB  - Plants allocate resources to processes related to growth and enemy defence. Simultaneously, they interact with complex soil microbiomes that also affect plant performance. While the influence of individual microbial groups on single plants is increasingly studied, effects of microbial interactions on growth, defence and growth-defence relationships remain unknown, especially at the plant community level. We investigated how three microbial groups (bacteria, fungi, protists), alone and in full-factorial combinations, affect plant performance and potential growth-defence relationships by measuring phenolics composition in early- and mid-successional grass and forb communities in a glasshouse experiment. Microbial groups did not affect plant growth and only fungi increased defence compounds in early- and mid-successional forbs, while grasses were not affected. Shoot biomass-defence relationships were negatively correlated in most microbial treatments in early-successional forbs, but positively in several microbial treatments in mid-successional forbs. The growth-defence relationship was generally negative in early-successional but not in mid-successional grasses. The presence of different microbiomes commonly removed the observed growth-defence relationships. We conclude that soil microorganisms and their interactions can shift growth-defence relationships differentially for plant functional groups and the relationships vary between successional stages. Microbial interaction-induced growth-defence shifts might therefore underlie distinct plant strategies and fitness.

AB  - Resource specific competition between predators has typically been studied from their interactions at mesoherbivore carcasses, because such carcasses are abundant. Mega-carcasses like those of elephants are rare but unparalleled in the extent of carrion biomass they offer and the long durations they can persist. These rare resource bonanzas can thus provide unique opportunities to understand sympatric species interactions within likely relaxed competitive scenarios. Using remote cameras that were operational 24-h a day, we monitored two elephant carcasses in Tsavo, Kenya, from when they were discovered until they were completely consumed or became inaccessible. While we found high temporal overlaps in activity patterns between all predators, the terrestrial predator guild (lion/leopard/spotted hyena) was not observed to feed simultaneously, suggesting strong interference competition. Based on photo-analysis and video-evidence of exclusion from a carcass, interference competition within the terrestrial predator guild favored lions over hyenas, and hyenas over leopards. The carcass at the terrestrial-aquatic interface showed more simultaneous feeding bouts between predators (crocodile/spotted hyena), indicating either facilitation and/or higher coexistence between predators that typically occupy different niches. We also observed a hippopotamus scavenging from an elephant carcass, thereby documenting a rare instance of a megaherbivore feeding on a megaherbivore. Our results highlight the importance of monitoring such carcasses through remote cameras, which can significantly add to our existing understanding of food webs and carrion ecology.

AB  - The extent and abundance of Rytidosperma Steud. species in mixed woodland, forest and derived grassland was examined over a 15-year period following removal of long-term sheep grazing. Ground-layer vegetation in 73 permanent plots was surveyed five times between 2005 and 2020 in a 50-ha paddock on the southern tablelands of New South Wales. Sites were stratified over the slope positions and micro-habitats represented at the site. Of the 12 Rytidosperma species recorded, only R. pallidum was morphologically and ecologically distinct in the field. The remaining 11 species, termed `cryptic Rytidosperma', were assessed using a novel sampling method developed for this group. Rytidosperma pallida was the only species strongly associated with sclerophyll forest habitat. The 11 other species varied in their habitat preferences but, as a group, were most dominant and persistent on upper slopes. Over the 15 years, the relative abundance of R. pilosum, R. erianthum, R. monticola, R. carphoides and R. caespitosum declined as annual exotics, native sub-shrubs and low-palatability graminoids became more dominant. But only one species (R. pilosum) significantly declined in overall frequency of presence (constancy) in the plots. The changes observed suggest that when pastoral land is converted to conservation management, reduced grazing pressure could affect the abundance of Rytidosperma species important to other species, such as the threatened moth Synemon plana.

AB  - Conservationists recognize that protected areas (PAs) have limited prospects without the involvement and support of local people. People inherently express positive perceptions to nature and support for wildlife conservation. Yet, people in rural and urban communities may differ in their knowledge and perceptions of benefits and costs of nearby small-size PAs, which induce a vital impact on the effectiveness of PAs and conservation goal achievements. We investigated local people's knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes around rural PAs (Bomfobiri Wildlife Sanctuaries, Shai Hills Resource Reserve, and Ankasa Conservation Area) and urban PAs (Owabi Wildlife Sanctuaries) in Ghana. Based on a questionnaire survey (928 respondents) in communities surrounding the parks, the perception of benefits from PAs was mainly for ecological reasons and did not differ between PAs. However, the perception of costs incurred by PAs differed between urban and rural PAs. The locals of the urban PA perceived fewer costs (crop damage from wildlife) than those in rural areas. Although there were significant differences between the urban and rural PA respondents, most respondents had positive attitudes toward the PA. Fifty-five percent of the total respondents were satisfied with the active law enforcement carried out by PA staff to protect biodiversity. However, 41% and 33% of respondents expressed discontent with restrictions on the use of natural resources within PAs and lack of involvement in decision-making, respectively. Of the sociodemographic factors investigated in all parks, men were more satisfied with the policies and governance of PAs than women due to the greater participation of men in many outdoor activities. Positive attitudes toward PAs suggest that despite conflicts, there is a straightforward understanding by local people about healthy ecosystems, which creates a common ground between conservationists and local communities for successful conservation in PAs.

AB  - Temperature is a determinant cue for several behavioral, physiological, and metabolic processes in fish, which occur within a range set to optimize species fitness. Understanding how ocean warming will impact species, at individual and population levels, is, therefore, of utmost relevance for management and conservation purposes. This knowledge assumes particular relevance when it comes to species with unique life history traits that experience multiple threats, such as seahorses. This study aimed to assess the effects of warming on growth, feed intake, and behavioral patterns of the long-snouted seahorse, Hippocampus guttulatus. Fish were collected, before the breeding season, in the Sado estuary, Portugal, and subsequently exposed for an 8-week period to three different temperatures: 17 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 24 degrees C. Three times a week, behavioral observations were performed. Feed intake was measured every day and individuals were weighed once a week. Results indicate differences in behavioral responses of seahorses exposed to increasingly warming conditions. Under extreme temperature conditions (24 degrees C), fish were more active, and fed more, but this increment of energy through feeding did not translate into increased growth in weight. Altogether, these results indicate that Sado's population of H. guttulatus may become under thermal stress when exposed, for a long term, to warming conditions that are expected to occur by the end of the century.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflict, where interactions have negative impacts on both people and animals, is complex with underlying drivers and broad ecological and social impacts. From individual incidents and perceptions, to contemporary patterns and long-term trends, a range of information about human-wildlife conflict can help understand and manage challenges. However, many studies focus on a single data type or spatiotemporal scale. In the Western Okavango Panhandle in Botswana, people in rural farming communities share and compete for resources with a growing African savanna elephant population. Few previous studies have focused on human-wildlife interactions in this region. We assessed spatiotemporal trends in human-elephant conflict using reported conflict incidents (2008-2016), surveys of individual perceptions of conflict encompassing the late 1990s-2016, and detailed field raid assessments from 2016. We found complementary patterns among the data types at different geographic and spatial scales. We found that the number of annual HEC incidents have increased over time, although not evenly across space, with increases primarily in the northern region of the Panhandle. Crop raiding presents both chronic and acute challenges for farmers, with the amount of damage incurred per incident largely dependent on the size of elephant group involved rather than factors within the farmers' control such as guarding or types of crops grown. Our results provide a characterization of contemporary conflict incidents and long-term trends, despite scarce historical data. Combining the reporting and assessment data with surveyed local ecological knowledge offered a multidimensional understanding of human-wildlife conflict for a region where this information was lacking. It is an important precursor to effective and collaborative conflict management and mitigation. When possible, this mixed-methods approach may facilitate understanding for complex human-wildlife interactions and support the diverse communities and stakeholders involved with conflict-related challenges.

AB  - IntroductionAmerican black bears (Ursus americanus) have been documented to have top-down effects, both consumptive (through predation) and nonconsumptive (through fear effects). However, their behavioural and dietary adaptability has led to uncertainty about the conditions under which these may occur.ObjectivesWe aimed to (1) investigate when, where, and how often black bears influence lower trophic levels, and (2) critically assess the experimental design of such studies to determine trends and biases.MethodsWe conducted a systematic literature search and used linear mixed-effects models to assess the relationships among prey age class, the presence of other large carnivores, and the percentage of ungulate mortality due to black bears. We also summarised the measured effects of black bears on other carnivores and the results of any experimental studies.ResultsWe found a strong negative relationship between puma presence and the percentage of ungulate mortality due to black bears, but only in areas with at least one other large carnivore (e.g., wolves). Among 16 studies of black bears' impacts on other carnivores, most documented negative behavioural effects. While only 5% of studies had strong experimental design, bear removal consistently increased juvenile ungulate survival.Discussion and SynthesisOur findings highlight black bears' strong top-down effects, resembling or exceeding those of other large carnivores. These effects were greatest when no other large carnivores were present, but as highly effective kleptoparasites, black bears can alter the feeding habits of other large carnivores. Thus, we argue that 'apex' is a conditional state, not a species-wide status.

AB  - Heavy metals (HMs) constitute a group of persistent toxic pollutants, and the petroleum industry is one of the sources of these metals. This study aimed to evaluate the levels of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), and vanadium (V) in Plantago ovata and milk and tissues of domestic goats in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. Plant samples and blood, milk, muscle, liver, and kidney samples were collected from domestic goats and the levels of Pb, Cd, V, and Ni were determined. Liver and kidney tissue injury, oxidative stress, and expression of pro-inflammatory and apoptosis markers were evaluated. Pb, Cd, V, and Ni were increased in Plantago ovata as well as in milk, blood, muscle, liver, and kidney of goats collected from the polluted site. Aminotransferases, creatinine, and urea were increased in serum, and histopathological changes were observed in the liver and kidney of goats at the oil extraction site. Malondialdehyde and the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, Bax, and caspase-3 were increased, whereas cellular antioxidants and Bcl-2 were decreased in liver and kidney of goats at the polluted site. In conclusion, petroleum industry caused liver and kidney injury, oxidative stress, and upregulated pro-inflammatory and apoptosis markers in goats. These findings highlight the negative impact of petroleum industry on the environment and call attention to the assessment of its effect on the health of nearby communities.

TI  - Including dominance effects in the prediction model through locus-specific weights on heterozygous genotypes can greatly improve genomic predictive abilities
T2  - HEREDITY
LA  - English
KW  - VARIANCE
AB  - The dominance effect is considered to be a key factor affecting complex traits. However, previous studies have shown that the improvement of the model, including the dominance effect, is usually less than 1%. This study proposes a novel genomic prediction method called CADM, which combines additive and dominance genetic effects through locus-specific weights on heterozygous genotypes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of weighting dominance effects for genomic prediction. This method was applied to the analysis of chicken (511 birds) and pig (3534 animals) datasets. A 5-fold cross-validation method was used to evaluate the genomic predictive ability. The CADM model was compared with typical models considering additive and dominance genetic effects (ADM) and the model considering only additive genetic effects (AM). Based on the chicken data, using the CADM model, the genomic predictive abilities were improved for all three traits (body weight at 12th week, eviscerating percentage, and breast muscle percentage), and the average improvement in prediction accuracy was 27.1% compared with the AM model, while the ADM model was not better than the AM model. Based on the pig data, the CADM model increased the genomic predictive ability for all the three pig traits (trait names are masked, here designated as T1, T2, and T3), with an average increase of 26.3%, and the ADM model did not improve, or even slightly decreased, compared with the AM model. The results indicate that dominant genetic variation is one of the important sources of phenotypic variation, and the novel prediction model significantly improves the accuracy of genomic prediction.

AB  - Eco-evolutionary feedbacks among multiple species occur when one species affects another species' evolution via its effects on the abundance and traits of a shared partner species. What happens if those two species enact opposing effects on their shared partner's population growth? Furthermore, what if those two kinds of interactions involve separate traits? For example, many plants produce distinct suites of traits that attract pollinators (mutualists) and deter herbivores (antagonists). Here, we develop a model to explore how pollinators and herbivores may influence each other's interactions with a shared plant species via evolutionary effects on the plant's nectar and toxin traits. The model results predict that herbivores indirectly select for the evolution of increased nectar production by suppressing plant population growth. The model also predicts that pollinators indirectly select for the evolution of increased toxin production by plants and increased counterdefenses by herbivores via their positive effects on plant population growth. Unless toxins directly affect pollinator foraging, plants always evolve increases in attraction and defense traits when they interact with both kinds of foragers. This work highlights the value of incorporating ecological dynamics to understand the entangled evolution of mutualisms and antagonisms in natural communities.

AB  - Many large marine species are vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures, and substantial declines have been documented across a range of taxa. Many of these species are also longlived, have low individual resighting rates and high levels of individual heterogeneity in capture probability, which complicates assessments of their conservation status with capture-mark-recapture (CMR) models. Few studies have been able to apply CMR models to whale sharks Rhin-codon typus, the world's largest fish. One of their aggregation sites off Mafia Island in Tanzania is characterised by unusually high residency of this Endangered species, making it an ideal target for CMR methods. Three different CMR models were fitted to an 8 yr photo-identification data set to estimate abundance, population trend and demographic parameters. As anticipated, resighting rates were unusually high compared to other aggregations. Different CMR models produced broadly similar parameter estimates, showing a stable population trend with high survivorship and limited recruitment. Tagging and biopsy sampling for concurrent research did not negatively affect those sharks' apparent survival or capture probabilities. Scenario-based power analyses showed that only pronounced abundance trends (+/- 30%) would be detectable over our study period, at a 90% level of probability, even with the relatively high precision in yearly abundance estimates achieved here. Other, more transient whale shark aggregations, with reduced precision in abundance estimates, may only be able to confidently detect a similar trend with CMR models after 15-20 yr of observations. Precautionary management and long-term monitoring will be required to assist and document the recovery of this iconic species.

AB  - Plants have developed defense mechanisms against herbivory, including stinging trichomes. Unlike smaller trichomes, which deter insects, the larger, biomineralized, stinging trichomes in Urticaceae defend plants from mammals. The trichome tip breaks off, pierces the skin, and injects irritants, causing an immediate sensation of pain. The herbivore will cease consuming the plant. Some herbivores process and consume nettles. Volcanoes National Park (VNP) in Rwanda provides habitat for several large folivores, including the endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei). VNP mountain gorillas feed on stinging nettle species, including Laportea alatipes, Urtica massaica, and Girardinia bullosa. We investigated the link between the importance (proportion) of these stinging nettles in the diet of gorilla groups ranging in the southwest of VNP and their level of defense through assessing trichome density, length, and glandular base length from each plant organ of 15 specimens per nettle species, which were photographed with a scale ruler under a digital microscope. We also videotaped 12 mountain gorillas consuming L. alatipes to examine adapted feeding techniques to cope with stinging trichomes. We found that L. alatipes, which is consumed most frequently of the three study nettles, had a significantly higher stinging trichome density compared to U. massaica and G. bullosa. However, the length of stinging trichomes and glandular bases containing irritating secretions were significantly smaller in L. alatipes and U. massaica than in G. bullosa, from which gorillas almost exclusively avoid consuming aboveground organs covered with long trichomes. This suggests that larger stinging trichomes and secretory glandular bases offer a more effective defense against mountain gorillas than increased trichome density. The trichome density of L. alatipes tended to be higher on top leaves and stem sections, which are consumed by gorillas more frequently compared to lower parts. Plants have evolved in an intricate way to adapt to herbivores' attacks.

AB  - Ocean warming can affect plankton both directly, through altered metabolic activities, and indirectly, modifying the physical-chemical properties of the water column, with possible effects on ecosystem functioning. To evaluate the combined action of warming-related physiological responses and environmental changes on plankton functioning, we carried out a long-term analysis (from 1994 to 2019) of the Bermuda Atlantic Timeseries Study (BATS) dataset where ocean warming and stratification have driven a decrease in the net primary production over the last decade. Using the time series of plankton observations, we assembled 1000 replicates of a food web model for each year. We observed that the total flow of matter through the model remained constant over time, despite the increased oligotrophication, due to global warming, after 2014. In fact, the plankton food web remained robust through re-modulated trophic interactions with an increased detritivory to herbivory ratio of the food web over time. However, it was problematic to re-establish the trophic connections of the food web broken by ocean warming, as remarked by the increased relative internal ascendency. Thanks to trophic plasticity, the reduced zooplankton dependence on herbivory was compensated by a significant increase in the reliance on carnivory and detritivores, highlighting the crucial role of trophic interactions in buffering significant environmental short-term changes.

AB  - Simple Summary In this study; the Fengjing pig was taken as the research object to explore the degree of its genetic diversity and deeply explore its excellent traits. Analyzing the population's genetic structure and mining the important candidate functional genes provide a theoretical basis for the conservation and utilization of Fengjing pig germplasm resources.Abstract The Fengjing pig is one of the local pig breed resources in China and has many excellent germplasm characteristics. However, research on its genome is lacking. To explore the degree of genetic diversity of the Fengjing pig and to deeply explore its excellent traits, this study took Fengjing pigs as the research object and used the Beadchip Array Infinium iSelect-96|XT KPS_PorcineBreedingChipV2 for genotyping. We analyzed the genetic diversity, relatedness, inbreeding coefficient, and population structure within the Fengjing pig population. Our findings revealed that the proportion of polymorphic markers (PN) was 0.469, and the effective population size was 6.8. The observed and expected heterozygosity were 0.301 and 0.287, respectively. The G-matrix results indicated moderate relatedness within the population, with certain individuals exhibiting closer genetic relationships. The NJ evolutionary tree classified Fengjing boars into five family lines. The average inbreeding coefficient based on ROH was 0.318, indicating a high level of inbreeding. GWAS identified twenty SNPs significantly associated with growth traits (WW, 2W, and 4W) and reproductive traits (TNB and AWB). Notably, WNT8B, RAD21, and HAO1 emerged as candidate genes influencing 2W, 4W, and TNB, respectively. Genes such as WNT8B were verified by querying the PigBiobank database. In conclusion, this study provides a foundational reference for the conservation and utilization of Fengjing pig germplasm resources and offers insights for future molecular breeding efforts in Fengjing pigs.

AB  - Entomofauna associated with decaying cadavers may be useful in criminal investigation, either through the development of immature insects of interest or through entomological succession in corpses. These factors may vary if the insects are exposed to toxic substances that can modify the insect's developmental cycle, as well as its own occurrence, which would imply significant changes in the results of any investigation. However, there are few studies on how contamination by toxic compounds can affect the action of insects on carcasses and their consequence for forensic expertise. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that the normal visitation of flies and beetles is altered in insecticide-contaminated carcasses. The experiment was carried out in a sugarcane plantation, using pig carcasses contaminated with insecticide and the same number of carcasses without any type of contamination as a control. In all experiments, the contaminated carcasses reached the final phase of decomposition in a longer time than the uncontaminated carcasses of the control group. A total of 2.767 specimens were collected and identified, 2.103 individuals from the order Diptera and 664 from the order Coleoptera. There was a significant geometric regression adjustment during the decomposition phases only for the control group, different from the contaminated carcasses in which this pattern did not occur. Results show that contamination by insecticide alters decomposition time and phase, altering the action of flies and beetles, affecting the abundance, composition of species as well as their activities, which can alter the data used by experts in criminal experts.

AB  - Advances in spring phenology are among the clearest biological responses to climate warming. There has been much interest in how climate impacts on phenology because the timings of key events have implications for species interactions, nutrient cycling and ecosystem services. To date most work has focused on only one aspect of population phenology, the effects of temperature on the average timing. In comparison, effects of temperature on the abundance of individuals and their seasonal spread are understudied, despite their potential to have profound impacts on species interactions.Here we develop a new method that directly estimates the effect of spring temperatures on the timing, height and width of the phenological distribution and apply it to temperate forest caterpillars, a guild that has been the focus of much research on phenology and trophic mismatch.We find that warmer spring conditions advance the timing of the phenological distribution of abundance by -4.96 days degrees C-1 and increase its height by 34% degrees C-1 but have no significant effect on the duration of the distribution. An increase in the maximum density of arboreal caterpillars with rising temperatures has implications for understanding climate impacts on forest food chains, both in terms of herbivory pressure and the resources available to secondary consumers.The new method we have developed allows the thermal sensitivity in the full phenological distribution to be modelled directly from raw data, providing a flexible approach that has broad applicability within global change research.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - In order to reduce N2O emissions during composting, the effects of different nitrification inhibitors (NI), dicyandiamide (DCD) and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), on compost maturity, N2O, and NH3 emissions were studied under continuous incremental addition. This study used pig manure and corn straw as composting materials, based on the total nitrogen (TN) content of the initial mixture, two treatments were set: DCD (2.5% in the early phase and 5.0% in the maturation phase) and DMPP (0.25% in the early phase and 0.75% in the maturation phase) in a composting experiment. The results showed that adding DCD and DMPP did not affect the compost maturity, with the seed germination index (GI) of final compost reaching 80.76%-97.06%. Before the maturity period of compost, ammonia (NH3) emissions accounted for 98.5%-99.4% of total emissions. Compared with the control group (CK), the addition of DCD and DMPP in the early stage reduced NH3 emissions by 8.85% and 12.83%, respectively, by decreasing the ammonification rate. During the mature stage of composting, N2O emissions account for 95.6%-98.9% of the total emissions. The addition of DCD and DMPP delayed N2O emissions by 4 and 6 days, respectively, through nitrification inhibition. The DMPP amendment also reduced cumulative N2O emissions by 54.50% and increased the nitrogen content of the final compost. Correlation analysis showed that N2O was mainly originated from the denitrification of nitrification substrate (NO2--N and NO3--N). This study provides technical support for low-carbon management of agricultural waste.

However, the influence of combined utilization of pig manure and effective microbes (EM) on soil organic carbon (SOC) and Cd are not well understood. This study conducted a 23-year (1996-2019) long-term fertilization field trial to investigate the changes of different fractions of SOC and Cd under chemical fertilization (CF), pig manure (PM), and pig manure with effective microbes (PM + EM) treatments in an agricultural soil of Jiangxi Province, South China. The results showed that the pig manure addition significantly enhanced the contents of SOC and Cd in the soils compared with the CF treatments. Furthermore, with the increment of SOC, the PM + EM treatment significantly increased the contents of soil microbial biomass carbon, dissolved organic carbon and easily oxidizable carbon compared with the pig manure application alone. Meanwhile, compared with the CF treatments, the EM addition significantly enhanced the exchangeable and oxidizable fractions of Cd, thus the potential Cd environment risk due to pig manure application should be carefully assessed.

AB  - Pylaiella littoralis is a brown alga with a cosmopolitan distribution. A free-living form of the alga fouls the beaches of Nahant, Massachusetts (USA). The amphipod Gammarus tigrinus is found within the floating drifts of algae. Gut contents confirmed that G. tigrinus consumed P. littoralis. Significantly, culture studies revealed that ingested P. littoralis survives and grows from fecal pellets produced by G. tigrinus. Also, inefficient grazing produced vegetative fragments that grew and survived. delta C-13 values for the amphipods and P. littoralis averaged -17.4 parts per thousand and -17.7 parts per thousand, respectively, suggesting that G. tigrinus acquires most of its carbon from P. littoralis.

AB  - Simple Summary This article focuses on the season effect on testicular morphometry and meat quality from outdoor-reared Bisaro pigs. Bisaro, an autochthonous Portuguese breed, is raised for long periods in outdoor pens after puberty and slaughtered around one year old for high-quality meat products. A total of 20 Bisaro boars, aged 13 months at the time of slaughter, were distributed into two groups according to the season at slaughter: Wi (winter) with 9 participants and Su (summer) with 11 participants. Surprisingly, while testicular volume in the Su group suggested lower functionality, boar taint compound analysis showed no significant differences. However, the panelists detected a more pronounced aroma and flavor of boar taint in the summer group. The meat quality traits presented no marked differences, although the fatty acid profile was higher in Wi than in Su. This study suggests the existence of reproductive seasonality in male Bisaro pigs, hinting at a dynamic variation of boar taint compounds throughout the year.Abstract Traditional outdoor pig farming is renowned for its emphasis on animal welfare and the production of highly valued, quality meat. While seasonality is known to impact certain animals, particularly those raised outdoors, there is a lack of research on Bisaro boars, a native Portuguese breed. This research study was conducted on a total of 20 male entire Bisaro pigs, reared in outdoor pens from 4 to 13 months old, and subsequently slaughtered. The animals were divided into two groups: one slaughtered in winter (Wi, n = 9), and the other in summer (Su, n = 11). The objective was to evaluate testicular morphometry, boar taint compounds, and meat quality traits, including sensory analysis and fatty acid profile. Testicles from the Su group exhibited reduced volume, indicating diminished functionality during that season. While no significant differences were observed in the boar taint compound analysis, panelists could discern a more intense aroma and flavor of boar taint in the Su meat. Other meat quality traits showed no significant variations, but the fatty acid profile displayed higher values in the Wi group. This study reveals that Bisaro boars experience reproductive seasonality, leading to variations in boar taint compounds across the seasons. This information is crucial for farm planning.

AB  - As tick-borne disease incidence increases and pathogens expand into new areas, the need for effective tick management strategies is paramount. In this 5-yr study (2014-2018) conducted in south central Wisconsin, we assessed whether an integrated tick management approach, deployed during peak tick activity (MayAugust), was more effective at reducing black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say (Ixodida: Ixodidae)), than individual interventions. Using a factorial design, invasive vegetation removal (Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii Ruprecht (Dipsacales: Caprifoliaceae) and common buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica Linnaeus (Rosales: Rhamnaceae)) was coupled with deployments of permethrin-treated cotton nesting materials (tick tubes) that target the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque (Rodentia: Cricetidae)). Results show that the probability of encountering a larval tick by drag sampling was unaffected by treatments at the cumulative 5-yr level. However, vegetation removal significantly reduced larval encounters in 2014, 2015, and 2018, by 33%, 57%, and 61% respectively, and reduced the density of questing nymphal (DON) ticks by 45% in 2015 compared to controls. Despite the limited effect on DON, vegetation removal significantly reduced the cumulative 5-yr density of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto infected nymphs (DIN) (70%) compared to controls as a result of decreased nymphal infection prevalence. Sites treated with tick tubes had lower DIN (66%) and DON (54%) across the study and nymphs were reduced every year following the initial year of deployment compared to controls. Combining treatments did not further reduce DIN or DONs. We conclude that long-term integration of tick tubes with invasive vegetation removal does not provide additional benefit over individual treatments alone.

AB  - Intraspecific diversity plays a critical role in the resilience of Chinook salmon populations. California's Central Valley (CV) historically hosted one of the most diverse population complexes of Chinook salmon in the world. However, anthropogenic factors have dramatically decreased this diversity, with severe consequences for population resilience. Here we use next generation sequencing and an archive of thousands of tissue samples collected across two decades during the juvenile outmigration to evaluate phenotypic diversity between and within populations of CV Chinook salmon. To account for highly heterogeneous sample qualities in the archive dataset, we develop and test an approach for population and subpopulation assignments of CV Chinook salmon that allows inclusion of relatively low-quality samples while controlling error rates. We find significantly distinct outmigration timing and body size distributions for each population and subpopulation. Within the archive dataset, spring run individuals that assigned to the Mill and Deer Creeks subpopulation exhibited an earlier and broader outmigration distribution as well as larger body sizes than individuals that assigned to the Butte Creek subpopulation. Within the fall run population, individuals that assigned to the late-fall run subpopulation also exhibited an earlier and broader outmigration distribution and larger body sizes than other fall run fish in our dataset. These results highlight the importance of distinct subpopulations for maintaining remaining diversity in CV Chinook salmon, and demonstrates the power of genomics-based population assignments to aid the study and management of intraspecific diversity.

AB  - Many savanna-dependent species in Africa including large herbivores and apex predators are at increasing risk of extinction. Achieving effective management of protected areas (PAs) in Africa where lions live will cost an estimated US$ >1-2 billion/year in new funding. We explore the potential for fire-management-based carbon financing programs to fill this funding gap and benefit degrading savanna ecosystems. We demonstrate how introducing early dry season fire management programs could produce potential carbon revenues (PCRs) from either a single carbon financing method (avoided emissions) or from multiple sequestration methods ranging from US$ 59.6-655.9 million/year (at US$ 5/ton) or US$ 155.0 million/year to US$ 1.7 billion/year (at US$ 13/ton). We highlight variable but significant PCRs for savanna PAs from US$ 1.5-44.4 million/year per PA. We suggest investing in fire management programs to jump-start the United Nations Decade of Ecological Restoration to help restore degraded African savannas and conserve imperiled keystone herbivores and apex predators.

AB  - Purpose Fascioliasis is caused by Fasciola species transmitted by freshwater Lymnaeidae snails and infecting herbivorous mammals and humans worldwide. In southern Asia, fascioliasis is a problem in livestock from the Near East to Bangladesh, where recent human infection reports are worrying. In this region, Fasciola gigantica is transmitted by species of the Radix auricularia superspecies group. In the densely populated northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, livestock appears infected throughout. The economic importance of buffaloes highlights the need to control their very high infection rates. Methods In the Gorakhpur area, a molecular method based on the two specific primer sets of genomic DNA was applied to fasciolids from buffaloes slaughtered in local abattoirs and cercariae from R. acuminata snails from freshwater collections. Results PCR products and sequences demonstrated that the cercariae belonged to F. gigantica and that R. acuminata acts as vector for its transmission to buffaloes. The 72.0% rate found in one transmission focus appears to be the highest worldwide record of fasciolid infection in a lymnaeid population. Lymnaeid prevalences and burdens found close to human communities indicate a very high infection risk. Conclusion This method is simple, fast and cheap because there is no need for sequencing, it differentiates between fasciolid species and between fasciolids and other trematodes infecting R. acuminata, facilitates epidemiological surveys, and is useful for surveillance to evaluate the efficiency of control measures. Within climate change predictions, future increases of rain events and floods suggest the need for control and surveillance efforts in this endemic area.

AB  - The anaerobic digestion industry, which is still developing, generates biogas from organic waste products. A coproduct of this process, digestate, is increasingly produced and can be recycled on agricultural land as an alternative to mineral fertilizers. Biogas digestate is a recent product whose chemical composition differs from that of its source material, and additional data still need to be acquired on its effects on dissolved carbon fluxes. The objectives of this study were to assess (i) the effects of applying biogas digestate on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) fluxes with different winter crops, (ii) the dynamics of DOC and DIC concentrations during the drainage season, and (iii) the annual dynamics of DOC and DIC fluxes along the soil profile. The study examined effects of applying biogas digestate, pig slurry, or a mineral fertilizer to winter wheat and two catch crops (mustard and a multispecies crop) on DOC and DIC fluxes in the soil. Lysimeters at 40 cm (topsoil) and 90 cm (subsoil) depths were monitored from 2014 to 2023, from November to March (i.e., 9 winter drainage seasons). During the drainage season, the DOC concentration was highest with digestate, and its timing depended on development of the cover crop: from the beginning of the drainage season for mustard and the multispecies crop and around February for wheat. Applying digestate increased the topsoil DOC fluxes (mean of 35.7 f 13.7 kg.ha(- 1) with digestate vs. 21.0 f 6.7 kg.ha(- 1) with the other treatments), particularly under mustard. Topsoil DIC fluxes were highest with pig slurry due to higher mineralization than that with digestate (mean of 59.1 f 22.8 kg.ha(- 1) with pig slurry vs. 46.2 f 16.3 kg.ha(- 1) with the other treatments). In the subsoil, DOC fluxes were low (6.2 f 4.1 kg.ha(- 1)) and DIC fluxes were high (80.0 f 45.7 kg.ha(- 1)), with no difference among treatments.

AB  - Although pig farms are hotspots of antibiotic resistance due to intensive use of antibiotics, little is known about the abundance, diversity and transmission of airborne antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). This study reports that bioaerosol is an important spread route of ARGs in pig farms. ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and bacterial communities were investigated in both air and feces samples during winter and summer. The average concentration of airborne ARGs and MGEs during winter is higher than that during summer when using the ventilation system. The tetM is identified as the predominant airborne ARG with abundance of 6.3 +/- 1.2 log copies/m3. Clostridium and Streptococcus are two dominant bacteria and several opportunistic pathogens are detected in air samples. High temperature is favorable for more diverse bacterial communities, but relative humidity has negative effects. The wind speed promotes the spread of airborne ARGs. The network analysis results show the average fecal contribution to airborne bacteria is 19.9% and 59.4% during summer and winter, respectively. Horizontal gene transfer plays an important role in the dissemination of airborne ARGs during winter (77.8% possibility), while a lower possibility of 12.0% in summer.

AB  - Simple Summary Frozen-thawed boar semen has not been widely used due to the deleterious effects of freezing on sperm quality and fertility. Extensive attempts have been made to improve post-thaw sperm quality because the short lifespan of frozen and thawed boar sperm impedes its application in field. The present study aimed to find the best post-thaw storage method (storage time and temperature) to extend sperm survival time without affecting the quality. The results showed that post-thaw storage time and temperature influenced boar sperm survival. Storage of thawed boar semen at 17 degrees C preserved sperm quality better and maintained sperm quality for up to 6 h. This demonstrated an improvement in the preservation of frozen-thawed boar semen before their use for artificial insemination because it provided enough time to prepare the doses and the transport them from the laboratory to the farm. These findings will help to promote the application of frozen-thawed boar semen doses for artificial insemination in the swine industry.Abstract Cryopreservation deteriorates boar sperm quality and lifespan, which restricts the use of artificial insemination with frozen-thawed boar semen in field conditions. The objective of this study was to test the effects of post-thaw storage time and temperature on boar sperm survival. Semen ejaculates from five Landrace boars (one ejaculate per boar) were collected and frozen following a 0.5 mL-straw protocol. Straws from the five boars were thawed and diluted 1:1 (v:v) in BTS. The frozen-thawed semen samples were aliquoted into three parts and respectively stored at 5 degrees C, 17 degrees C, and 37 degrees C for up to 6 h. At 0.5, 2, and 6 h of storage, sperm motility, viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and apoptotic changes were measured. Antioxidant and oxidant levels were tested in boar sperm (SPZ) and their surrounding environment (SN) at each timepoint. The results showed significant effects of post-thaw storage time and temperature and an impact on boar sperm quality (total and progressive motility, VCL, viability, acrosome integrity), early and late sperm apoptotic changes, and changes in MDA levels in SPZ and SN. Compared to storage at 5 degrees C and 37 degrees C, frozen-thawed semen samples stored at 17 degrees C displayed better sperm quality, less apoptotic levels, and lower levels of SPZ MDA and SN MDA. Notably, post-thaw storage at 17 degrees C extended boar sperm lifespan up to 6 h without obvious reduction in sperm quality. In conclusion, storage of frozen-thawed boar semen at 17 degrees C preserves sperm quality for up to 6 h, which facilitates the use of cryopreserved boar semen for field artificial insemination.

AB  - The African golden cat Caracal aurata is one of Africa's least known felids, and little is understood about local people's knowledge and uses of this cat. Questionnaires were completed with 454 people from 15 villages near Mpem et Djim National Park and the Council Forest of Yoko to assess local knowledge, uses, and perceived conservation status of this felid. Only 35% of respondents recognized the species, and older people were more likely to do so. Locals stated that the golden cat population is currently low, that the species is considered a totemic animal, a sign of power and grandeur, and that their pelts are an ornamental asset. Hunting with guns and snares was stated to be the greatest threat to golden cats. Locals urged restricting hunting to protect the species, and both chicken and pig farming were suggested as alternatives to hunting. Our study is the first community-based evaluation of the golden cat in Cameroon.

AB  - Biosecurity is a major concern in the global pig production. The separation in time of semen collection, processing and insemination in the pig farm is a few days for chilled semen but it can be indefinite when using cryopreserved semen. Field fertility results of boar cryopreserved semen are close to chilled semen, which makes it a valuable resource for the establishment of semen genebanks, long-distance semen trade, and the implementation of other technologies such as the sex-sorted semen. But cryopreserved semen is far from being routine in pig farms. The most recent research efforts to facilitate its implementation include the use of additives before freezing, or in the thawing extender. Long-term preserved semen trade is a biosecurity challenge. To harmonize international trade of germplasm, the World Organization of Animal Health (WOAH) established a regulatory framework for all member countries. The present paper aims to review the latest advances of boar semen cryopreservation with special focus on the benefits of its inclusion as a routine tool in the pig industry. We also review recently reported field fertility results of cryopreserved semen, its international trade compared to chilled semen, and the regulatory framework involved. Boar cryopreserved semen is a valuable tool to control biosecurity risk, implement other technologies, and facilitate international trade. Research already demonstrated good field fertility results, but it still represents less than 0.1 % of the international trade. As boar cryopreserved semen gets closer to implementation, the correspondent authorities are reviewing the trade rules.

AB  - Boreal forests serve as the primary winter range for reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) in Sweden, where ground lichens constitute the main food source. Lichen-rich forests have declined drastically, and modern forest practices, along with other land uses, impact both the quantity and availability of lichen. The resulting reduction in lichen has serious consequences for reindeer and Sami reindeer husbandry. Consequently, robust methods for mapping and measuring lichen are highly sought after. We developed and implemented a multistep method for objectively estimating lichen cover and biomass. We collected data at three study sites in lichen-rich pine forests in northern Sweden during July-August 2021. First, we collected data on NDVI and tree cover using a drone. These data informed a spatially balanced sampling approach to provide a distribution of plots for a representative field sample. Following this, we collected field data on lichen cover and height in these plots. In addition, we compared methods for assessing lichen cover in the field and found that visual estimates resulted in lower values than a point-intercept method. We recommend the point-intercept method for its objectivity and consistency between observers. By combining data from a literature review and fitting a linear regression on lichen volume (dm3 m-2) and biomass (kg dry weight m-2) through the origin, we determined a slope of 0.0148 for estimating biomass from volume measures. Using this relationship with field data on lichen cover and height, we obtained statistically unbiased estimates of lichen cover and biomass. This approach reduces the time required compared to destructive methods involving lichen collection and weighing. While our method provides lichen cover and biomass estimates, we also demonstrate how these biomass estimates can be linked to the number of reindeer grazing days an area can sustain each year, enhancing the usefulness of the results. Our estimates will be valuable in planning and management of reindeer husbandry, as well as for quantifying the loss of the ground lichen resource in forestry, energy and mining industries.

AB  - The butyl xanthate (BX) in mining wastewater poses significant environmental challenges due to its toxicity and persistence. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Pseudomonas sp. immobilized on yak dung biochar (Ps.@YDBC600) for BX degradation, emphasizing the synergistic effects of biochar adsorption and microbial degradation. BX removal efficiency of free Pseudomonas sp. cells was assessed under various environmental conditions, with optimal degradation observed at 30 degrees C and an initial pH of 5.0. Yak dung biochar prepared at 600 degrees C (YDBC600) was selected due to its high surface area, porosity, and favorable adsorption properties, enhancing the immobilization and activity of Pseudomonas sp. The absorption of BX by biochar followed a twocompartment first-order kinetic model and primarily involved hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and pore filling. The primary crystalline mineral component of YDBC600 and Ps.@YDBC600 before and after the adsorption and degradation of BX was SiOC. The Ps.@YDBC600 was shown to significantly enhance BX removal efficiency compared to free Pseudomonas sp. cells or biochar alone. Molecular studies indicated that biochar facilitated BX degradation by providing a stable environment for Pseudomonas sp. and optimizing metabolic resource allocation. The primary by-products, including CSC, HS-, ROCOS-, ROCSSH and (ROCSS)C were effectively minimized (each by-product was reduced more than 80%), reducing secondary pollution. These findings demonstrated the potential of Pseudomonas sp. immobilized on biochar as an effective approach for treating BX-contaminated mining wastewater, offering a sustainable approach to environmental remediation and management.

AB  - <bold>Dubautia haupuensis </bold>is newly described from windswept ridgelines near the summit of H & amacr;upu, in an isolated range noted for floristic endemism on Kauai, in the Hawaiian Islands, where only two clusters of plants are currently known. Based on molecular phylogenetic data, this highly endangered shrub of the Hawaiian silversword alliance belongs to a recently resolved clade of endemic Kauai taxa, mostly from wet or bog habitats, including D. imbricata subsp. acronaea, D. imbricata subsp. imbricata, D. kalalauensis, D. kenwoodii, D. laevigata, D. syndetica, and D. waialealae. Unlike its close relatives and other members of Dubautia, D. haupuensis has the following unique combination of morphological characteristics: well-branched shrubs with leaves opposite, sessile, and glabrous, leaf venation +/- parallelodromous, with 5 to 9 basal nerves, capitulescences densely corymbiform to paniculiform, peduncles hirsute, peduncular bracts lance-linear to ovate, with faces glabrous and margins ciliate, heads 7- to 12-flowered, paleate throughout, the paleae each partially clasping a floret, with faces glabrous and distal margins ciliate, corolla tube/throat sessile-glandular, the throat dilated <= 2 x tube width, and pappus +/- equaling corolla, of 20 to 31 setiform to narrowly subulate, densely ciliate scales, the cilia < 0.5 mm long. It also is distinguished from all other taxa of the silversword alliance by diagnostic nuclear ribosomal DNA nucleotide states. Six of the seven taxa that constitute a clade with D. haupuensis have highly restricted distributions on Kauai and are of significant conservation concern, as reflected by listing of most of them as Endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Dubautia haupuensis is also exceedingly rare and in need of immediate conservation action to prevent its extinction. Invasive plants (especially melastomes), potential ungulate activity, lack of opportunity for outcrossing, and any mortality from stochastic events are major threats to the species, in addition to possible impacts of anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is one of the areas with relatively severe soil desertification in China. Previous studies have shown that the establishment of psammophilous shrubs can effectively alleviate the problem of soil desertification. Meanwhile, psammophilous shrubs can serve as raw materials for livestock feed and possess a certain economic value. Taking the artificial Salix psammophila forest in Hanggin Banner, Ordos City as the research object, this study selected post-harvest stands that had grown for 1 year (1a), 2 years (2a), and 3 years (3a) after stumping, as well as nonstumped stands, as the control (CK). By setting different treatments, the effects of different stump heights (0, 5, 10, 15 cm) were compared under the same stumping interval (1a) and ground-level stumping under different intervals (1a, 2a, 3a, CK) on the regenerability of S. psammophila. Meanwhile, it explored the monthly variations of branch/leaf nutrients during the growing season and dynamic changes in microclimate and soil wind erosion under different stumping intervals. The study aims to provide theoretical basis for rational and efficient utilization of S. psammophila resources. The main conclusions are as follows:(1) During the growing season, S. psammophila foliage nutrients (crude protein, fat, ash, acid/neutral detergent fiber, lignin, Ca, P, RFV) fluctuated. Crude fat and protein peaked in May, while acid/neutral detergent fiber and lignin reached the lowest levels in June. (2) Stumping mitigates growth decline and promotes height/basal diameter growth. 10 cm stumps showed optimal regeneration rate and shoot density, while 5 cm stumps showed the fastest basal diameter growth. No significant differences in regeneration rate were found across stumping intervals, but un-stumped stands showed the poorest shoot germination. (3) The wind speed under the forest shows the order of 3a < 2a < 1a < CK, while there is no obvious pattern in temperature and humidity. All the four sample plots are aeolian deposits, and the deposition amounts in the 3a and 2a plots are relatively low.

AB  - Rewilding aims to restore 'self-willed' ecosystems involving the creation of habitat subject to stochastic disturbance, connected by favorable corridors for dispersal of animals including insects. Herbivores such as the Eurasian beaver Castor fiber (Linnaeus, 1758) have been reintroduced in the UK to promote natural flood management as part of a rewilding strategy. At Spains Hall in Finchingfield (south-east England), beavers were released into two large enclosures (both c. 20 ha) in March 2023 which were concurrently reverting from arable farmland to riparian meadow. Monitoring of Orthoptera 15-18 months after release in June-September 2024 revealed statisti-cal evidence that the abundance of the two localised groundhoppers, Tetrix subulata (Linnaeus, 1758) and Tetrix undulata (Sowerby, 1806), and the lesser marsh grasshopper Chorthippus albomarginatus (De Geer, 1773), was higher in the beaver enclosure meadows than in the control plots. The Essex Red Data List species, the common green grasshopper Omocestus viridulus (Linnaeus, 1758), was also recorded within the beaver meadows. The damming of the watercourse in one enclosure led to the creation of new off-line lotic channels and wet ground which were important for these species, particularly bare mud margins which were used by groundhoppers (Tetrigidae). There was also evidence that meadows on the east side of the river had a greater abundance of long-winged conehead Conocephalus fuscus (Fabricius, 1793) and T. subulata than the west, perhaps due to the sheltered microclimate and wetland features on this side of the channel, particularly in the beaver enclosures. We conclude that in enclosures on former arable farmland Orthoptera may respond to damming which quickly creates beaver meadows in flooded areas within the first two years of release. However, only one enclosure had dams in this study so the effects of beavers may be dependent on variables such as habitat quality and watercourse characteristics.

AB  - Scavenging on carrion is critical and often fiercely competitive for a range of vertebrate species, from native apex predators to invasive species and even reptiles. Within Australia, a notable reptilian scavenger is the lace monitor (Varanus varius). In this study, we quantified lace monitor activity at carcasses and compared their use of the resource to common co-occurring predators that also scavenge; the invasive red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and a native apex predator, the dingo (Canis dingo). To do so, we deployed 80 macropod carcasses equally across seasons (summer and winter) and habitats (open and closed canopy) in a temperate bioregion and monitored vertebrate scavenging with camera traps. Lace monitor activity (visitation at carcass sites inclusive of both non-scavenging and scavenging events) was 1.67 times higher in summer than in winter, but it did not differ across closed and open habitats. Monitor activity occurred earlier after carcass deployment at sites deployed in summer than winter (1.47-fold earlier), and at carcasses in open than closed habitats (0.22-fold earlier). Lace monitors initially discovered carcass sites faster in summer than winter and before both red foxes and dingoes in summer. The species was active diurnally in both summer and winter, differing from the red fox, which was strictly a nocturnal scavenger and the dingo, which was significantly more active at night across both seasons. Finally, we found that lace monitor activity at carcass sites decreased slightly with higher rates of activity for dingoes (0.04-fold decrease as dingo activity increased), but not with red fox activity. Our results have implications for understanding lace monitor foraging and scavenging and highlight the value of monitoring carcasses to provide important insights into the behaviour of varanid lizards that scavenge.

AB  - Apex scavengers can perform an important ecosystem service by rapidly removing carrion, in turn regulating nutrient cycling linked to carcass decomposition. Yet, our understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that influence rates of apex scavenging and their behaviour around carrion remains limited, in part because of the absence of replicated studies across different bioregions, habitats and seasons. Here, we examine the use of carrion by one of Australia's apex scavengers, the wedge-tailed eagle Aquila audax, and uncover the extent and consequences of their social interactions at carrion. We applied a standardised design to monitor 120 kangaroo (Family: Macropodidae) carcasses using camera traps across contrasting bioregions (desert, forest and alpine), habitats (open and closed canopy) and seasons (warm and cool). We predicted that wedge-tailed eagles would discover carcasses quicker in open habitats, and that intrinsic carrion value (ICV), or the desirability of carrion, would be related to dietary stress as a function of productivity and season (i.e. we expected to see increased carcass use by eagles in the less productive desert bioregion and in cooler seasons). Across all bioregions, we found that wedge-tailed eagles discovered carcasses in open habitats 2.7 times faster than in closed habitats and 5.3 times faster in cool seasons compared with warm seasons. Scavenging was less likely to occur in open environments, was more frequent in cool seasons and in the desert bioregion. ICV largely governed social interactions; there were more aggressive encounters between wedge-tailed eagles during cool seasons and in the desert bioregion. Our results highlight how bioregional, habitat, and seasonal variation can drive scavenging rates and social interactions between conspecific apex scavengers. Further studies considering both carrion use and corresponding behavioural interactions will enhance our understanding of how carrion contributes to shaping interactions between and within species groups as well as scavenger communities more broadly.

AB  - Associating with plant hosts is thought to have elevated the diversification of insect herbivores, which comprise the majority of global species diversity. In particular, there is considerable interest in understanding the genetic changes that allow host-plant shifts to occur in pest insects and in determining what aspects of functional genomic diversity impact host-plant breadth. Insect chemoreceptors play a central role in mediating insect-plant interactions, as they directly influence plant detection and sensory stimuli during feeding. Although chemosensory genes evolve rapidly, it is unclear how they evolve in response to host shifts and host specialization. We investigate whether selection at chemosensory genes is linked to host-plant expansion from the buffalo burr, Solanum rostratum, to potato, Solanum tuberosum, in the super-pest Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). First, to refine our knowledge of CPB chemosensory genes, we developed novel gene expression data for the antennae and maxillary-labial palps. We then examine patterns of selection at these loci within CPB, as well as compare whether rates of selection vary with respect to 9 closely related, non-pest Leptinotarsa species that vary in diet breadth. We find that rates of positive selection on olfactory receptors are higher in host-plant generalists, and this signal is particularly strong in CPB. These results provide strong candidates for further research on the genetic basis of variation in insect chemosensory performance and novel targets for pest control of a notorious super-pest.

AB  - Soil extracellular enzyme stoichiometry (EES) and microbial metabolic limitation deeply reflect soil quality. However, knowledge about the impacts of different grazing intensities on microbial metabolic limitation has not been well-documented. Herein, the influences of four sheep grazing intensities (ungrazed, UG; lightly grazed, LG; moderately grazed, MG; and heavily grazed, HG) on microbial metabolic limitation were investigated in typical steppe (14-year grazing) and desert steppe (17-year grazing). The activities of an extracellular enzyme (EEAs) involved in soil C, N, and P transformation were determined by fluorimetric microplate assay. We found that different grazing intensities significantly affected extracellular enzyme activities and EES. Compared to the treatments of UG, LG, and MG, microbial relative C limitation in the HG treatment increased by 30.5-64.7% and 18.9-33.1%, respectively, in typical and desert steppes, indicating that heavily grazing aggravated soil microbial relative C limitation. Moreover, along with grazing intensity, vector angle decreased from 50.3 degrees to 27.6 degrees and from 71.5 degrees to 58.9 degrees in desert steppe and typical steppe. This indicated that the pattern of microbial metabolism limitation shifted from P limitation to N limitation in desert steppe, and heavily grazing significantly aggravated microbial N limitation in desert steppe. In addition, the desert steppe was more pronounced than the typical steppe to grazing intensity increasing. Therefore, heavily grazing aggravated microbial metabolism limitation, deteriorated grassland quality. The outcomes of this study highlight that lightly grazing can be an effective management practice to maintain grassland ecological services in semi-arid areas from the perspective of soil microbial metabolic limitation.

AB  - The forest community structure and dynamic structure provide basic data for in-depth study of the community maintenance mechanisms and succession processes of urban forest ecosystems. Moreover, the study on the dynamics of suburban forest communities can provide a reference for the succession process of forest communities under severe human disturbance. In this context, this study analyzes the species composition and community structure of a 6 ha subtropical secondary evergreen broad-leaved forest plot in Wuchaoshan National Forest Park, Hangzhou, Eastern China. There are 36,757 existing woody plants (with DBH >= 1 cm), belonging to 94 species (45 evergreen species, and 48 deciduous species) in 63 genera of 34 families, with a plant density of 6126 plants/ha. The overall size-class distribution shows an obvious inverted "J" shape. Species with the top-five important values in the sample are Schima superba, Camellia fraternal, Symplocos anomala, Cyclobalanopsis glauca, Eurya rubiginosa, accounting for 57.3% of all individuals within the sample. In addition, different species have different habitat preferences and different distribution areas. The Wuchaoshan forest is in the middle and late stages of the succession. Different interference histories in the community succession process are demonstrated through studies of secondary evergreen broad-leaved forests. Long-term community monitoring contributes to indicating the direction and potential of the secondary forest succession.

AB  - Fisheries management has historically focused conservation efforts on game or sport species. However, most species are nongame-those not traditionally captured for sport or harvest in countries where recreational fisheries predominate. Greater conservation of nongame species could help ensure that population declines do not go unnoticed. Unfortunately, fisheries managers already manage complex ecosystems with limited resources, and they frequently are directed to focus on game fishes. However, game fish populations can also be tightly coupled to nongame fishes, so nongame management can sometimes also benefit game species. We reviewed functional roles of freshwater nongame fishes and suggest categories that may be especially important for conservation. Of note, nongame fishes are more imperiled than game fishes and fill largely distinct functional roles. These roles include food-web impacts, ecosystem engineering, and mussel hosting. Management priorities could include nongame piscivores and species with high biomass, especially herbivores, nest builders, and imperiled mussel hosts. We provide practical options for including nongame fishes in current management, many of which require little additional funding. These include recognizing when sport fish funding and conservation can also benefit nongame species, whole-community sampling at some monitoring locations, collecting catch data for select species observed during game fish surveys, embracing environmental DNA sampling, and making presence-absence record keeping the default option.

AB  - Understanding genetic population structure and connectivity is essential for effective species-specific management and conservation strategies. The American elephantfish Callorhinchus callorynchus is targeted and retained as incidental catch in commercial and recreational fisheries in Chile and Argentina. Its wide-ranging distribution across southern South America may require transnational co-operation to ensure sustainable use, but its current population structure is not known. In this work, we analysed the levels of genetic diversity and differentiation within C. callorynchus in South America using two mitochondrial markers, the control region (CR) and the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (CO1). Moreover, we assessed levels of genetic diversity within, and divergence among, the three extant callorhinchids (genus Callorhinchus), a group that exhibits allopatric geographical distributions in the southern hemisphere. Overall, sequence analyses of the mitochondrial CR and the CO1 revealed extremely low levels of sequence variation both within and among Callorhinchus species. Genetic homogeneity was found throughout the range of C. callorynchus coupled to low-frequency haplotype sharing across spatially distant locations in Chile and Argentina, suggesting gene flow along the South American coast. Moreover, our analyses supported a scenario of recent population expansion of the species in South America. Given the absence of dispersive eggs or juvenile stages in chondrichthyans, gene flow is mainly mediated by actively swimming adults. Based on the available data, gene flow in callorhinchids appears to occur along continuous coastal regions, with deep oceanic waters serving as strong barriers. Findings here provide an important baseline for future research on dispersal and gene flow in holocephalans.

AB  - Although the horse chestnut is not a native element of the Polish dendroflora, it is frequently planted in cities (parks, avenues, yards), and forms many road-side avenues outside of cities. At present, most horse chestnut trees display the effects of infection by the horse chestnut leaf miner (HCLM) or by the fungus Guignardia aesculi. The present study is based on a group of horse chestnut trees forming an avenue in NW Poland, in the vicinity of Krzymow. The avenue was planted in the 2nd decade of the 20th century. The trees forming the avenue are growing in a mid- -field habitat (FIELD) and in a forest habitat (FOREST), which enables a comparison among trees growing in these habitats. Dendrometric analyses were performed on 100 trees, and den- drochronological analyses were performed for 32 trees, with equal number of trees sampled in each habitat. The FIELD chronology spans 103 years (1916-2018), the FOREST chronology spans 101 years (1918-2018). Our study aimed to compare the height and crown diameter of the horse chestnut trees growing in a forest and in a mid-field habitat, to examine the rate of radial growth, and to compare the growth-climate relationships in trees from each habitat. The horse chestnut trees growing in the forest habitat are higher than those from the mid-field habitat. The crown diameter is comparable in both habitats, and the breast-height diameter (1.3 m above ground, DBH) is higher in the trees growing in the mid-field habitat. The horse chestnut trees from the mid-field habitat are healthier, their leaves are infected to a lesser extent and fall off later. Also their annual increments are wider. Also the minimum, mean and maximum tree-ring widths, and the cumulative radial growth are higher for the mid-field habitat. We also found differences in the growth-climate relationships established for each site, especially for the year preceding growth (the analyzes were performed for temperature (T) over the period 1948-2018, for precip- itation (P) over the period 1951-2018 and for sunshine duration (SD) over the period 1965-2018). For the trees growing in the mid-field habitat, air temperature and sunshine duration for July and August of the previous year are highly significant (negative correlation). Precipitation (posi- tive correlation) and sunshine duration (negative correlation) in September of the year preceding growth are significant for the forest trees. These differences may result from the disparate features of the studied habitats, and the contrasting intensity of tree infestation by HCLM and by the fungus G. aesculi.

AB  - Quantifying the frequency of shifts to new host plants within diverse clades of specialist herbivorous insects is critically important to understand whether and how host shifts contribute to the origin of species. Oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae: Cynipini) comprise a tribe of similar to 1000 species of phytophagous insects that induce gall formation on various organs of trees in the family Fagacae-primarily the oaks (genus Quercus; similar to 435 sp.). The association of oak gall wasps with oaks is ancient (similar to 50 my), and most oak species are galled by one or more gall wasp species. Despite the diversity of both gall wasp species and their plant associations, previous phylogenetic work has not identified the strong signal of host plant shifting among oak gall wasps that has been found in other phytophagous insect systems. However, most emphasis has been on the Western Palearctic and not the Nearctic where both oaks and oak gall wasps are considerably more species rich. We collected 86 species of Nearctic oak gall wasps from most of the major clades of Nearctic oaks and sequenced >1000 Ultraconserved Elements (UCEs) and flanking sequences to infer wasp phylogenies. We assessed the relationships of Nearctic gall wasps to one another and, by leveraging previously published UCE data, to the Palearctic fauna. We then used phylogenies to infer historical patterns of shifts among host tree species and tree organs. Our results indicate that oak gall wasps have moved between the Palearctic and Nearctic at least four times, that some Palearctic wasp clades have their proximate origin in the Nearctic, and that gall wasps have shifted within and between oak tree sections, subsections, and organs considerably more often than previous data have suggested. Given that host shifts have been demonstrated to drive reproductive isolation between host-associated populations in other phytophagous insects, our analyses of Nearctic gall wasps suggest that host shifts are key drivers of speciation in this clade, especially in hotspots of oak diversity. Although formal assessment of this hypothesis requires further study, two putatively oligophagous gall wasp species in our dataset show signals of host-associated genetic differentiation unconfounded by geographic distance, suggestive of barriers to gene flow associated with the use of alternative host plants.

AB  - Industrial expansion and population growth have lowered water quality, polluting aquatic ecosystems worldwide. Metal pollution in the rivers across the United States are a major health concern. The level of metal contamination in fish from the Lower Mississippi River Basin and their threat to public health were last evaluated 20 years ago. The goals of this study were to measure metal contamination in various fish species from the Lower Mississippi River Basin, evaluate the human consumption risk, and estimate bioindicator potential of these species for monitoring toxic metals on a larger scale. Various fish species (n = 203) were analyzed for 15 metal contaminants (Al, As, Ba, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mg, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn). Species included: blue catfish ( Ictalurus furcatus), channel catfish ( Ictalurus punctatus), flathead catfish ( Pylodictis olivaris), bigmouth buffalo ( Ictiobus cyprinellus), smallmouth buffalo ( Ictiobus bubalus), alligator gar ( Atractosteus spatula), spotted gar ( Lep- isosteus oculatus), American gizzard shad ( Dorosoma cepedianum), freshwater drum, ( Aplodinotus grunniens), and white crappie ( Pomoxis annularis). Fish consumption safety revealed toxic metals (As, Cd, Cr, Hg, and Pb) are a major human health concern in the Lower Mississippi River. Non-cancerous health hazard assessments indicated blue catfish, flathead catfish, gar species, and freshwater drum as species of concern. Consumption of all species posed human cancer risks. Computational modeling, with an accuracy of 98.5 %, identified Hg, Pb, Zn, Cr, Co, As, and Cd as major drivers of fish consumption safety. Using bioaccumulation factor analysis, we estimated the bioindicator potential of toxic metals for each fish species, finding Hg and Cd to be greatly bioaccumulative in predatory gar species. Overall, our data indicated that gar can serve as select environmental sentinels useful for monitoring toxic metal pollutants of public health concerns providing valuable insight to research scientist and monitoring agencies throughout the Lower Mississippi River Basin.

AB  - Resource competition is a key factor in shaping community structure. In herbivorous insects, living space occupation is likely to lead to exclusion due to resource competition with coercion of consuming poor resources. Given that eggs are immobile, their placement is critical for larval survival and development, especially in terms of optimal resource consumption, making oviposition site selection a crucial factor for females. Therefore, competition for oviposition sites may lead to exclusion if resources are scarce. This study examined the competitive relationships among three leaf beetle species (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae): Aspidimorpha difformis (Motschulsky), Aspidimorpha transparipennis (Motschulsky) and Laccoptera nepalensis Boheman. Competitive dynamics were assessed using field surveys, experiments and simulations. Results revealed that habitats for both Aspidimorpha species were less than half the size of L. nepalensis habitats. Additionally, both Aspidimorpha species avoided oviposition on leaves with the oothecae of other species, with A. difformis showing a reduction of up to 70% in ootheca number. Simulation results indicated that only A. difformis, which experienced oviposition site reductions due to other species, faced certain extinction under conditions mimicking natural habitats. Our findings suggest that A. difformis experiences unilateral exclusion due to resource competition for oviposition sites, as observed in the field. Thus, based on our findings, even free-living herbivorous insects can be excluded due to interference competition during their immobile stage, such as eggs.

AB  - Trophy hunting can affect weapon size of wild animals through both demographic and evolutionary changes. In bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis Shaw, 1804), intense harvest of young males with fast-growing horns may have partly driven long-term decreases in horn size. These selective effects could be dampened if migrants from protected areas, not subject to artificial selection, survived and reproduced within hunted populations. Bighorn rams undertake long-distance breeding migrations in the weeks preceding the late-November rut. We analysed records of >7800 trophy bighorn rams shot from 1974 to 2019 in Alberta, Canada, to test the hypothesis that high harvest pressure during breeding migrations was correlated with a greater decrease in horn size. We compared areas with and without a pronounced harvest peak in late October, when male breeding migrations begin. Areas without a pronounced harvest peak in late October, which likely experienced a lower harvest rate, showed a similar temporal decline in horn size, but no increase in age at harvest suggesting a possibly weaker decline in horn growth. Our study suggests that unselected immigrants from protected areas could partly buffer the effects of intense trophy hunting only if harvest pressure was reduced when breeding migrations commence.

AB  - The conservation and spatial management of marine species with limited adult mobility, such as queen conch, is dictated by larval connectivity. Effectively placed reserves provide larval spillover to harvested areas while replenishing their own population. In past studies proximate to the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park (ECLSP), surveys and probabilistic larval transport modeling demonstrated a spillover effect from the ECLSP to surrounding fished areas, while suggesting that incoming larval sources are lacking. Previous work was expanded in both upstream and downstream directions, enabling the statistical examination of (1) how queen conch abundance was linked to predicted larval transport from breeding populations in the ECLSP and (2) how age and size changed throughout the island chain as divided by management and connectivity. Biophysical modeling predictions of larval transport from breeding within the ECLSP were significantly associated with the relative abundance of juvenile conch observed across a nearly 200-km span. Further, the abundance and shell lip thickness (relative age) of adults and the size of juveniles were significantly larger in ECLSP than unprotected areas. This empirical support for an effective, well-enforced marine reserve and for using biophysical larval transport modeling as a spatial planning tool should be strongly considered in conch conservation and management.
   Dive surveys of queen conch confirm an earlier prediction of imbalanced connectivity in a marine reserve system. New evidence further supports a downstream population subsidized by a marine reserve and the extrication of upstream breeding sources. Conservation action is urgently needed before the senescing reserve population disappears. image

AB  - Feather mites play an important role in bird communities, covering a wide spectrum of associations with their hosts, ranging from parasitic to mutualistic relations. As a result of long co-evolution with their warm-blooded hosts, this diverse group of arthropods can be found in a wide range of environments where their hosts occur, including the high Arctic. The feather mite fauna of Greenland is poorly known. Herein, we present new data on feather mites found on three species of passerine birds, which were captured on Disko Island (Qeqertarsuaq), West Greenland. The feather mite species Analges longispinosus was found on Snow Bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis); Proctophyllodes plectrophenax on Snow Bunting and Lapland Longspur (Calcarius lapponicus); and Proctophyllodes hipposideros on Northern Wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe). The two Proctophyllodes species represent new records for Greenland. Further studies are needed to reveal the diversity of feather mite species in this remote Arctic region.

AB  - 1. Plant nutrient-acquisition strategies (NAS) linking soil nutrients to plant growth are considered crucial to species replacement during primary succession. However, empirical evidence from field studies remains scarce. 2. We examined the replacement of Hippophae tibetana (Elaeagnaceae) by Populus purdomii (Salicaceae) during the first three stages (S1-S3) of succession along the Hailuogou postglacial chronosequence in southwest China. We investigated changes in the scavenging, mining and N-2-fixing strategies of the two species with varying soil nutrient levels and evaluated how these NAS influenced plant performance with succession. 3. Bioavailable nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations increased significantly from near detection limits at the S1 stage to 60 and 41 mg kg(-1) at the S3 stage, respectively. Despite this, H. tibetana maintained mining and N-2-fixing strategies, as indicated by rhizothamnia, cluster roots and lower pH, and higher carboxylate concentration and acid phosphatase activities in soil surrounding roots compared with those around P. purdomii at all sites. Conversely, P. purdomii relied on scavenging strategies, evidenced by higher ectomycorrhizal colonization and specific root length, smaller root diameter and more negative leaf delta C-13 than those of H. tibetana. Leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, along with the relative abundance of H. tibetana, were significantly higher than those of P. purdomii at S1, but this reversed at S3. Linear mixed models indicated that mining and N-2-fixing strategies were positively correlated with nutrient concentrations at low soil nutrient levels, while scavenging strategies can enhance leaf nutrients at relatively high soil nutrient levels. Linear regression models showed that leaf nitrogen and phosphorus accounted for 13% and 31% of variation in relative abundance, respectively. The residuals of these models were further reduced by 35% and 39% when accounting for the combined effects of mining and N-2-fixing strategies. Results from incubation experiments, functional gene abundance and enzymatic activities showed that microbial nitrogen mineralization and phosphorus solubilization were similar in the rhizosphere of both species. 4. Synthesis. Distinct investments and changing efficiency of plant nutrient-acquisition strategies (NAS) in response to soil nutrient availability are key drivers of species turnover during primary succession. These findings underscore the importance of belowground plant NAS mechanisms in shaping aboveground community dynamics during early pedogenesis.

AB  - Studies documenting insect succession throughout the decomposition of vertebrate remains have been performed in more than half of the provinces and one territory in Canada. However, some areas are not represented in the current published literature. Ontario is one province that does not have published records of local necrophagous insect succession. Therefore, three studies were performed in Oshawa, Ontario, to document the insect community and primary colonisers observed during the decomposition of domestic pig, Sus scrofa domestica (Artiodactyla: Suidae), remains. Adult and immature specimens located on the remains were collected, reared, and identified. Pitfall traps were installed to monitor insects present outside of visits. Pigs that decomposed in higher temperatures yielded fewer colonising dipteran species than those that decomposed in cooler temperatures. The most common primary colonisers were Phormia regina (Diptera: Calliphoridae), Lucilia illustris (Diptera: Calliphoridae), and Lucilia sericata (Diptera: Calliphoridae). In total, 11 Diptera families, six Coleoptera families, and families from the Hymenoptera and Hemiptera orders were observed. When comparing these results to published results from Qu & eacute;bec, Ontario's neighbour, major differences in primary colonisers can be noted. It is therefore important for researchers to study the succession, development, and colonisation patterns of the local fauna during vertebrate decomposition and to publish their findings.

AB  - Integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) technology with expandable collars will allow researchers to more accurately and efficiently investigate survival of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) fawns. We tested fit and function of 5 expandable GPS collar prototypes on white-tailed deer fawns and conducted behavioral observations during the first 12 weeks of life at the Whitehall Deer Research Facility, Athens, Georgia, USA, during 2018-2020. We fitted 46 fawns with 5 prototype collar designs and ear-tagged 15 control fawns without collars. Prototype collars differed in expandable band materials. Premature expansion and breakage of collar bands composed of cotton and rubber was a problem that resulted in freely moving collars and displacement to the waist of fawns. Fawns retained prototype collar designs with cotton and rubber band materials for a mean 101 (+/- 46 [SD]) and 70 (+/- 37) days, respectively. For 2 collar designs with expandable bands composed of nylon and rubber, fawns retained collars for a mean 246 (+/- 156) and 306 (+/- 99) days, respectively. Vectronic (v1.0 and v2.0; VECTRONIC Aerospace GmbH, Berlin, Germany) and Telonics v2.0 (Telonics Inc., Mesa, AZ, USA) collared fawns were 16-21% less likely to be observed standing compared to uncollared fawns. Bedded Vectronic (v1.0 and v2.0) and Telonics v2.0 collared fawns were 19-28% less likely to be observed with their head up compared to uncollared fawns. Bedded fawns with collars were 11-16% more likely to be observed with their head tilted compared to bedded fawns without collars. Vectronic (v1.0 and v2.0) and Telonics v2.0 collared fawns were 25-34% less likely to exhibit vigilance compared to uncollared fawns, and all collared fawns were 22-37% more likely to exhibit sleeping than uncollared fawns. We recommend that GPS collar designs we evaluated undergo additional modifications before deployment in the field, including improved stitching patterns and threads to facilitate more gradual collar expansion, smaller battery housings and improved weight distribution to mitigate behavioral concerns, and smaller band circumferences to improve collar fit across time.

AB  - According to the plant stress hypothesis, population peaks of herbivores such as moths are caused by plant stress factors that force plants to reallocate stored defensive proteins to transportable and easily digestive N-compounds. A suggested plant stress factor is ionization caused by cosmic ray muons, which are modulated by the 9.3-year lunar nodal phase cycle, solar activity, and atmospheric pressure. Vascular plants are more sensitive to ionization than are bryophytes, and woody plants are more sensitive than are herbaceous plants, but the difference may be less during dormancy in winter. We selected the 14 most common moth species from a 30-year light-trapping study in southern Norway to test whether the fluctuation patterns of species from three different feeding guilds were correlated with lunar/solar cycles, or with atmospheric pressure in winter, when muon fluxes are higher than in other seasons. The population indices of three species feeding on deciduous woody plants were positively correlated with the lunar nodal phase index, and there was a similar tendency for the remaining three species. No positive correlations with the lunar index were found for species feeding on herbs or mosses. For nine species, that is, from all three guilds, there was a significant negative correlation between the population index and winter atmospheric pressure in the previous year. The results are in accordance with predictions deduced from the cosmic ray hypothesis, but thorough investigations of the proposed physiological mechanisms are needed for the hypothesis to be widely accepted.

AB  - Simple Summary Yaks are important for the economy and livelihood of local herders in the Tibetan Plateau and are their primary source of income. Traditionally, the production performance of ruminants is generally improved by increasing the proportion of concentrate feed in the diet. To the best of our knowledge, the optimal proportion of concentrate feed is limited in actual production and research of yak. This study fed three diets with different dietary forage-to-concentrate ratios (50:50, 65:35, and 80:20) to 36 male yaks (Bos grunniens). The changes in the distribution of fecal microorganisms were studied by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that the dietary forage-to-concentrate ratio significantly impacted yak fecal microorganisms. As such, these studies help us understand the fecal microbiota of yaks, further provide more complete information on the requirements of yak diets in terms of concentrate-to-forage ratio and improve yak growth performance, and provide a theoretical basis for accurate housing of yaks. (1) Background: This study aimed to investigate the effects of different dietary concentrate to roughage ratios on growth performance and fecal microbiota composition of yaks by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. (2) Methods: In the present study, three diets with different dietary forage-to-concentrate ratios (50:50, 65:35, and 80:20) were fed to 36 housed male yaks. (3) Results: The result shows that Final BW, TWG, and ADG were higher in the C65 group than in the C50 and C80 groups, but the difference was not significant (p > 0.05). DMI in the C65 group was significantly higher than in the other two groups (p < 0.05). The DMI/ADG of the C65 group was lower than that of the other two groups, but the difference was insignificant (p > 0.05). At the phylum level, Firmicutes were the most abundant in the C65 group, and the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes was lower in the C65 group than in the other two groups. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Ruminococcaceae_UCG_005, Romboutsia, and Christensenellaceae_R-7 were higher in the C56 group than in the C50 and C80 groups. The relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20 and Rikenellaceaewas_RC9_gut is lower in the C65 group, but the difference was insignificant (p > 0.05). At KEGG level 2, the relative abundance of lipid metabolism and energy metabolism were lowest in the C50 group, and both showed higher relative abundance in the C65 group. (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, the structure of fecal microbiota was affected by different concentrate-to-forage ratios. We found that feeding diets with a concentrate-to-forage ratio of 65:35 improved yaks' growth and energy metabolism.

AB  - Melocactus Link & Otto is one of the most representative and endangered genera of Cactaceae in Sergipe. This study evaluates ex situ conservation under two integrative approaches: the rescue of adult plants to set a germplasm bank and the analysis of different substrates to establish a seedling bank of rescued species. We collected thirty individuals of each species and cultivated thorn in a greenhouse for twelve months. We evaluated the number of flowers, fruits, and seeds daily, as well as the mortality rate of adult plants. We evaluated five substrates to establish the seedling bank 1 - sand, 2 - sand + commercial soil (1:1), 3 - sand + goat manure (1:1), 4 - soil (100% volume) and 5 - soil + goat manure (1:1). We found mortality rates of 0%, 10% and 50% for M. zehntneri, M. violaceus subsp. margaritaceus and M. sergipensis, respectively. We found two phenological patterns for the species in the germplasm bank: a continuous production of flowers, fruits and seeds throughout the year and another pattern, with periods of greater production of flowers, fruits, and seeds. We also found positive correlations between the environmental factors and the phenological stages of the species. We conclude that substrates 'sand' and 'sand + soil' are the most suitable to produce seedlings of the three species of Melocactus.

KW  - Net Zero Emission (NZE)
AB  - Indonesia targets the net zero emission (NZE) achievement in 2045 through the forest and other land uses (FOLU) approach. In the NZE target evaluation, it is necessary to compare the carbon emissions and sequestration at the regional level. This study aims to evaluate the NZE achievement in Central Java for further clustering according to the results. Carbon sequestration data is obtained from the land use of Rupa Bumi Indonesia (RBI), while carbon emission data is obtained through an individual carbon footprint approach. In 2022, Central Java achieved the NZE, with a difference between carbon sequestration and emissions of 9,025,367.00 tons of CO2 eq. However, there are almost half, or 15 districts/cities (42.86%), that have not achieved NZE, namely Semarang City, Klaten, Demak, Sukoharjo, Kudus, Tegal, Surakarta, Sragen, Pekalongan City, Karanganyar, Tegal City, Salatiga, Magelang, Magelang City, and Pati. It consists of at least 3 categories of regions, namely, 1) Districts/cities that have reached NZE; 2) Districts/cities that have not reached NZE but are still able to be supported by surrounding districts/cities; 3) Districts/cities that have not reached NZE and cannot be supported by surroundings. There are efforts that are still needed to achieve NZE. Achieving NZE can be done by planting vegetation and reducing carbon emissions, especially from the energy, transport sectors, and waste, considering the availability of the area and its sequestration capability in surrounding districts/ cities.

AB  - Simple Summary Long-term monitoring of wild boar reproduction in Lower Saxony, Germany, facilitated the description of body weight development in two different habitat types over an 18-year period. Here, not only the sampling year but also habitat and climate factors proved to be of considerable importance for the development of Sus scrofa body weight. Additionally, of particular interest were differences in the timing of puberty achievement among habitats. As one of the most abundant game species in Europe, European wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations prove highly adaptable to cultivated landscapes. The ongoing process of climate change and the high agricultural yields seem to further optimize the living conditions for this species. In long-term reproduction monitoring, we collected data on the body weight of wild boar females. Over an 18-year period, the body weight of wild boar females increased continuously, then stopped and decreased. It was possible to detect differences between the body weights of animals from forest and agricultural areas. For these areas, differences in body weight development also led to a significant distinction in the onset of puberty. We conclude that, even in a highly cultivated landscape, forested areas provide habitat characteristics that may strongly influence reproduction. Second, with dominant agricultural areas in Germany, wild boar reproduction has been favored in recent decades.

AB  - Monitoring of 38 (12 male and 26 female) red deer translocated from Ivo Wildlife Park (Romania) to hunting ground "Bosutske Forest" (Vojvodina, Serbia) was conducted from 2017 to 2021. The red deer were translocated in lieu of the managing authority's efforts to counteract the effects of red deer losses due to catastrophic flooding in the region. All animals were ear-tagged, while 7 males and 10 females were fitted with GPS collars. A total of 2,288 valid signals were analyzed (565 from males and 1,723 from females). In addition, 1,333 sighting records were collected from eight observation posts (480 in 2019, 670 in 2020 and 183 in 2021). We determined the movements and spatial distribution of translocated animals in the new habitat and estimated their home range sizes. Home range was calculated using the minimum convex polygon method, while the core area was calculated using the kernel density estimator method. The greatest straight-line distance from the acclimatisation enclosure was essentially the same for both sexes (average 6.0 km for males and 6.4 km for females). A non-significant relationship existed between the number of days in captivity and the greatest straight-line distance, as well as between days in captivity and the core area of the home range. The estimated home range of males was 12.8 km2 (range 0.2-36.1), smaller than that of females (20.6 km2, range 0.4-68.7), but this difference was not statistically significant. Observations made independently showed mostly herds of 4 to 6 individuals (52.3%), while large herds (>= 10 individuals) were rare. Participation of translocated and resident animals in mixed herds was common during the monitoring period (62.3%). Our results showed that a high level of acceptance of the new habitat and social cohesion between translocated and resident animals was achieved. We believe that this is due to two main reasons: firstly, the long-term stay in a large acclimatisation enclosure prior to release and secondly, year-round supplemental feeding coupled with an abundant natural food supply in this unique forest area also contributed to successful acclimatisation.

AB  - Nonrandom foraging can cause animals to aggregate in resource dense areas, increasing host density, contact rates and pathogen transmission, but when should nonrandom foraging and resource distributions also have density-independent effects? Here, we used a factorial experiment with constant resource and host densities to quantify host contact rates across seven resource distributions. We also used an agent-based model to compare pathogen transmission when host movement was based on random foraging, optimal foraging or something between those states. Nonrandom foraging strongly depressed contact rates and transmission relative to the classic random movement assumptions used in most epidemiological models. Given nonrandom foraging in the agent-based model and experiment, contact rates and transmission increased with resource aggregation and average distance to resource patches due to increased host movement in search of resources. Overall, we describe three density-independent mechanisms by which host behaviour and resource distributions alter contact rate functions and pathogen transmission.
   To investigate how host density, host behaviour and resource distributions influence host contact rates, and thus, disease dynamics, we combined empirical and theoretical approaches. We found that even simple optimal foraging behaviour greatly reduced host contact rates and parasite transmission relative to random movement assumptions. Furthermore, while other studies have shown that resource density can influence host density and contact rates, we here show that even when global resource density is held constant, resource distributions can impact disease dynamics.image

AB  - Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba; krill) and the pelagic tunicate (Salpa thompsoni; salps) are crucial to the Southern Ocean ecosystem, and krill supports the largest fishery in the Southern Ocean in term of catch. Given recent climatic changes in the northern Antarctic Peninsula (NAP), the distribution of krill and salps are shifting poleward. Unlike krill, salps thrive in warmer water temperatures and can form large blooms under favorable conditions, potentially outcompeting krill for resources. However, krill are ecologically more important, serving as a primary food source for higher trophic levels. The interspecific interactions, including hotspots and ecological niches, of krill and salps in the NAP were therefore investigated using historical datasets and species distribution models. We found that both spatial separation and overlap occurred between krill and salps hotspots, with the primary overlap occurring around Elephant Island. Furthermore, there was a significant overlap in their ecological niches, suggesting that they may have similar ecological requirements. This study emphasized the importance of krill and salps interactions in the Southern Ocean ecosystem. The krill habitat and therefore food web of the Southern Ocean could be influenced significantly if salps continue to shift poleward in the future. The information provided in this study aids in the conservation and management of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

AB  - Government agencies and landowners use a variety of lethal methods to reduce invasive wild pig populations and resulting agricultural damages. To provide decision-makers with information regarding Alabama farmers' experiences with wild pigs and their preferences for management actions, we surveyed Alabama Farmers Federation members in 2020. We found that wild pigs were commonly present on livestock, timber, and crop production acreage, but wild pig damages and costs were much more common among crop producers. Respondents' wildlife acceptance capacity for wild pigs was low and all lethal control methods were considered acceptable by most respondents, particularly those performed by landowners. While there is likely a consensus among Alabama farmers that wild pig numbers need to be reduced within the state, managers should continue to build support by working closely with crop producers and by addressing potential concerns regarding the implementation of methods by government agencies in future initiatives and outreach.

AB  - The rapid increase in pig production has become a major contributor to environmental issues due to the mismanagement of organic waste. The sustainable and effective transformation of this waste into a fertilization resource has become an urgent topic for environmental protection, and new regulations have been imposed. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of different ratios of swine manure liquid (SML) and chemical fertilizers on soil phosphorus forms and microbial communities through field experiments cultivating spring wheat (cultivar "Jinqiang 10") in Hebei, China. The results indicated that the application of SML in portions with traditional fertilizer can enhance soil pH and electrical conductivity (EC), as well as available phosphorus, particularly when the proportion of SML is high (SML >= 75%). Compared with CK, the available phosphorus content of group C3 increased by 22.3%. SML facilitated the transformation of stable phosphorus to unstable phosphorus, as well as the conversion of organic phosphorus to inorganic phosphorus. Additionally, SML increased the soil content of H2O-P, NaHCO3-Pi, and NaHCO3-Po, and promoted the conversion of NaOH-Po to NaHCO3-Po. Studies on bacterial diversity indicated that different fertilization treatments have no significant impact on the bacterial diversity in the 0-20 cm soil layer, whereas the dominant bacterial and fungal genera were positively correlated with the available phosphorus. The present study may facilitate the combined application of SML and chemical fertilizers for soil improvement and improve phosphorus availability.

However, it remains unclear how far back this diversity goes, with formal documentation only dating back a few centuries. North European short-tailed (NEST) breeds are often assumed to be among the oldest domestic sheep populations, even thought to represent relicts of the earliest sheep expansions during the Neolithic period reaching Scandinavia <6,000 years ago. This study sequenced the genomes (up to 11.6X) of five sheep remains from the Baltic islands of Gotland and & Aring;land, dating from the Late Neolithic (similar to 4,100 cal BP) to historical times (similar to 1,600 CE). Our findings indicate that these ancient sheep largely possessed the genetic characteristics of modern NEST breeds, suggesting a substantial degree of long-term continuity of this sheep type in the Baltic Sea region. Despite the wide temporal spread, population genetic analyses show high levels of affinity between the ancient genomes and they also exhibit relatively high genetic diversity when compared to modern NEST breeds, implying a loss of diversity in most breeds during the last centuries associated with breed formation and recent bottlenecks. Our results shed light on the development of breeds in Northern Europe specifically as well as the development of genetic diversity in sheep breeds, and their expansion from the domestication center in general.

AB  - Natural or anthropogenic movement of plant species outside their historical ranges may result in exposure to new environmental conditions and a lack of natural enemies, thus promoting their establishment and spread into new areas. A biogeographical comparison of native and invasive populations can provide insight into the mechanisms of successful invasions and guide effective management strategies, such as biological control, by targeting plant traits that promote invasiveness. We studied the Eurasian aquatic plant, Nymphoides peltata, in situ in the native (China, Korea) and invaded (USA) ranges to determine whether there were differences in natural enemy attack rates (percent leaf damage, frequency of leaf herbivory or disease), productivity (plant cover, reproduction), and leaf traits (leaf elemental content, leaf toughness, dry matter content, specific leaf area) between areas. We also investigated whether there was evidence of a tradeoff between natural enemy attack and growth or reproduction, as would be predicted by invasion theory. Plant cover (23-29 % higher) and reproductive output (eight times more seeds / m2) were consistently higher in the invaded range. Leaf traits consistently differed between ranges, which we would expect if plants in the invaded range had fewer herbivores or other pests. The amount of leaf damage present was similar between ranges, but the frequency of herbivory was 50 % greater, on average, in the native than invaded range. Although we did not quantify suppression of N. peltata by natural enemies, we found evidence of more frequent herbivory in Asia and reduced reproduction and plant cover compared to the USA, which supports further investigation into viability of biological controls.

AB  - Emissions of airborne pollutants from livestock buildings affect indoor air quality, the health and well-being of farmers, animals and the environment. This study aimed to evaluate the microbial count within pig sheds and its relationship with meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity and air velocity) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and microbial diversity. Sampling was conducted both inside and outside of two pig sheds over three seasons (summer, rainy and winter), with regular monitoring at fortnightly intervals. Results showed that the bacterial and fungal counts ranged from 0.07 to 3.98 x 103 cfu/m3 inside the sheds and 0.01 to 1.82 x 103 cfu/m3 outside. Seasonal variations were observed, with higher concentrations of particulate matter detected during the winter season, followed by summer. Climatic variables such as temperature, air velocity and relative humidity demonstrated significant impacts on the abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and fungi, while air velocity specifically influenced the presence of mesophilic bacteria and staphylococci. Importantly, no significant disparities were found between microbial counts and particulate matter levels. Staphylococcaceae emerged as the predominant bacterial family, while Aspergillus and Cladosporium spp. were the dominant fungal species within the pig sheds. The average levels of airborne bacteria and fungi in pig sheds were found to be within the recommended range, which can be attributed to the loose housing design and lower animal population on the farms.

AB  - For the first time data on parasite diversity of Syngnathidae fishes inhabiting the Black and the Sea of Azov, the rivers flowing into these seas and their estuaries accumulated in more than 30 articles and books during almost one century of investigations were summarized. A high level of parasitic organisms' richness is registered to date: 64 species from 45 genera, 35 families, 14 classes, 10 phyla have been recorded here from eighth species of Syngnathidae fish hosts: Syngnathus abaster Risso, 1827; S. acus L., 1758; S. schmidti Popov, 1927; S. tenuirostis Rathke, 1837; S. typhle L., 1758; S. variegatus Pallas, 1814; Nerophis ophidion (L., 1758); Hippocampus hippocampus (L., 1758). Host-parasite and parasite-host lists are provided, the results for Kinetoplastida, Sporozoa, Microsporidia, Myxozoa, Ciliophora, Platyhelminthes (Monogenea, Trematoda, Cestoda), Nematoda, Acanthocephala, Annelida, and parasitic Arthropoda are presented. Platyhelminthes and Ciliophora (19 and 18 species, respectively) turned out to be the most species-rich taxa of Syngnathidae parasites, while Trematoda was the richest (15 species) class among flatworms. The largest number of parasite species is known from three fish hosts: S. abaster parasite fauna comprises 54 species of 10 phyla (84% of total parasite fauna of this fish family in the region), S. typhle-27 parasite species belonging to six phyla (38%, respectively) and relatively pure parasites fauna in H. guttulatus, 14 species of six phyla (22%).

AB  - Morphological development in laboratory-hatched larval and juvenile Rhinogobius flumineus is described. Body lengths (BL) were 5.7 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SD) mm just after hatching, reaching 8.9 +/- 0.1 mm by day 11, 11.9 +/- 0.1 mm by day 24 and 14.7 +/- 0.4 mm by day 42. Notochord flexion began before hatching and its flexion was completed on day 1 after hatching (ca. 6.4 mm BL), and yolk completely absorbed by day 9. Body proportions tended to become mostly constant in juvenile stage. Fin-rays of the 2(nd) dorsal and caudal fins were present at hatching, and those of other fins appeared almost simultaneously, rapidly increased and attained full complements by 6.8-6.9 mm BL on day 9. Melanophores were few on the body during days 0-3 but increased with growth and covered the entire body surface in juveniles larger than ca. 9.0 mm BL at 11 days after hatching. These features are considered to reflect the ecological differences between R. flumineus as a fluvial species and amphidromous/lentic congeners across the genus.

AB  - Trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) is arguably the most important deciduous tree species in the Intermountain West of North America. There, as elsewhere in its range, aspen exhibits remarkable genetic variation in observable traits such as morphology and phenology. In contrast to Great Lakes populations, however, relatively little is known about phytochemical variation in western aspen. This survey of phytochemistry in western aspen was undertaken to assess how chemical expression varies among genotypes, cytotypes (diploid vs. triploid), and populations, and in response to development and mammalian browsing. We measured levels of foliar nitrogen, salicinoid phenolic glycosides (SPGs) and condensed tannins (CTs), as those constituents influence organismal interactions and ecosystem processes. Results revealed striking genotypic variation and considerable population variation, but minimal cytotype variation, in phytochemistry of western aspen. Levels of SPGs and nitrogen declined, whereas levels of CTs increased, with tree age. Browsed ramets had much higher levels of SPGs, and lower levels of CTs, than unbrowsed ramets of the same genotype. We then evaluated how composite chemical profiles of western aspen differ from those of Great Lakes aspen (assessed in earlier research). Interestingly, mature western aspen trees maintain much higher levels of SPGs, and lower levels of CTs, than Great Lakes aspen. Phenotypic variation in chemical composition of aspen - a foundation species - in the Intermountain West likely has important consequences for organismal interactions and forest ecosystem dynamics. Moreover, those consequences likely play out over spatial and temporal scales somewhat differently than have been documented for Great Lakes aspen.

AB  - Simple Summary The yak (Bos grunniens) is a unique breed in the pastoral areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It has the ability to adapt to the extremely low oxygen environment in the plateau and is one of the important livestock breeds in the plateau. Yaks can live in an extremely low-oxygen environment for a long time and avoid pulmonary hypertension caused by hypoxia. However, little is known about the molecular regulatory mechanisms of how yaks avoid pulmonary hypertension. In this study, the dynamic regulation of the TGF-beta/BMP signal in yak pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells has positive significance in maintaining homeostasis and adapting to hypoxic environments.Abstract To survive in low-oxygen environments, yaks effectively avoid hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension through vascular remodeling. The TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathway plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). However, little is known about the molecular regulatory mechanisms by which the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathway contributes to the proliferation of yak PASMCs. In this study, yak PASMCs were cultured in vitro, and a hypoxia model was constructed to investigate the effect of TGF beta/BMP signaling on yak PASMC proliferation. Hypoxia treatment increased the proliferation of yak PASMCs significantly. As the duration of hypoxia increased, the expression levels of TGF-beta 1 and the phosphorylation levels of Smad2/3 were upregulated significantly. The BMP signaling pathway was transiently activated by hypoxia, with increases in BMPR2 expression and Smad1/5 phosphorylation, and these changes were gradually reversed with prolonged hypoxia exposure. In addition, exogenous TGF-beta 1 activated the TGF-beta signaling pathway, increased the phosphorylation levels of the downstream proteins Smad2 and Smad3, and increased the proliferation and migration rates of yak PASMCs significantly. Finally, treatment with noggin (an inhibitor of BMP signaling) significantly reduced BMPR2 protein expression levels and Smad1/5 phosphorylation levels and increased yak PASMC proliferation and migration rates. In summary, these results revealed that under hypoxic conditions, the dynamic regulation of the TGF-beta/BMP signaling pathway promotes the proliferation of yak PASMCs.

AB  - Mammalian herbivores play a pivotal role in Earth System processes by affecting biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning, potentially leading to significant repercussions on atmosphere-biosphere feedbacks. Global dynamic models of mammalian populations can improve our understanding of their ecological role at large scales and the consequences of their extinctions. However, such models are still lacking and mammals are poorly integrated in Earth System Science. We developed a mechanistic global model of terrestrial herbivore populations simulated with 37 functional groups defined through the analysis of eco-physiological traits across all extant herbivores (2599 species). We coupled this model with a global vegetation model to predict herbivores' maximum potential biomass in pre-industrial and at present-day and to study the environmental drivers explaining the distribution of herbivore biomass. Present-day biomass was estimated by accounting for anthropogenic activity causing habitat and range losses. We show that natural ecosystems could have sustained a potential wild herbivore wet biomass of 330 Mt (95% CI: 245-417), comprised of 193 Mt (95% CI: 177-208) by large species (body mass >1-10 kg, depending on functional group) and 138 Mt (95% CI: 68-209) by small species. We estimate that the remaining present-day large herbivores biomass is 82 Mt (95% CI: 32-133), reduced by 57% due to anthropogenic activity; consequently, small herbivores currently dominate global herbivore biomass with 98 Mt (95% CI: 91-106, -29%). Losses vary greatly across climatic zones and functional groups, suggesting that size is not the only discriminant feature of biomass decline. Actual evapotranspiration is the most important driver of total, large and small herbivore biomass and explains 64%, 59% and 49% of its variation, respectively. Distribution of modelled and observed large herbivores' biomass suggested a high dependency on energy and water with more biomass in hot and wet areas. These results challenge the notion that large herbivore biomass peaks primarily in ecosystems with intermediate precipitation levels such as savannas. Outside Africa and the Tropics, pre-industrial biomass hotspots occur in areas today dominated by humans; this could undermine the recovery of larger species biomass in certain areas. Our herbivore biomass estimates provide a quantitative benchmark for setting conservation and rewilding goals at large spatial scales. The herbivore model and functional classification create new opportunities to integrate mammals into Earth System Science and models.

AB  - Urban flooding is the most frequent and damaging of all natural hazards, including those caused by dam breaks. One flood mitigation and control method is using flood risk maps to provide helpful information. This study aims to map the three parameters of urban flooding: exposure, vulnerability, and flood risk following a hypothetical failure of the Gazelles fountain dam (Manbaa Al-Ghozlan) in the city of Biskra (40 km downstream of the dam) through a multi-criteria decision-making process (MCDM). Six influencing factors were used for the vulnerability assessment: land use, distance from significant watercourses (Oued), distance from drainage accumulation, elevation, population density and distance from main roads. The influence of each factor was examined by attributing weights to each criterion according to its impact on urban flood vulnerability. A flood risk map that can evaluate the extent of damage and its economic implications is made based on hazard and vulnerability maps. Based on pixel values, the flood risk map has been divided into four classes: very high, high, moderate and low. The results indicate that more than 63% of the area is at high risk. The water depth in these areas may exceed 10 m in the case of dam failure. The constructed flood risk map is an informative tool to assess critical damage for decision-makers in arid and semi-arid areas.

AB  - The fairy circles of Namibia form a remarkable gap pattern in arid grassland along the Namib Desert. The origin of the fairy circles is subject to an ongoing debate. Solving the mystery of the fairy circles (FCs) requires the right timing in fieldwork after rainfall, as the newly appearing grasses complete their life cycle within only a few weeks. Here we followed the rains along the Namib between 2020 and 2022 and assessed the cause of the grass death within FCs at different time intervals after grass-triggering rainfall. To assess whether termite herbivory was the cause, we used grass excavations and observations on the roots and shoots. To test if edaphic differences may explain the grass death in FCs, we undertook infiltration measurements in 10 FC-hotspot regions. Finally, we used continuous soil-moisture measurements from the dry into the rainy seasons to examine how the newly emerging grasses affect the soil-water content in space and time. Generally, in study plots that received grass -triggering rainfall most recently, the roots of the dead grasses in FCs were in 100 % of the cases undamaged, root-shoot ratios were significantly greater, and the roots were as long or even longer as those of the surrounding matrix grasses outside of the FCs. This indicates that drought stress caused grasses in the FCs to invest resources into roots to reach the percolating water. The results also show that the cause of the grass death in fairy circles was not induced by termite herbivory. Also, we found no systematic differences in the rate of water infiltration between FCs and the matrix, hence the plant wilting cannot result from quicker percolation within FCs. However, the soil-moisture measurements indicate that the matrix grasses strongly depleted the upper soil water of the FCs after rainfall, which explains why most grasses cannot establish and quickly die in the FCs. The research shows that grass death in fairy circles occurs immediately after rainfall due to plant water stress but not due to termite activity. Our results conform with previous fieldwork, pattern analysis and theoretical modeling, suggesting that Namibia's fairy circles are a self-organized vegetation phenomenon induced by ecohydrological feedbacks.

AB  - In the last decade, small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones) have become increasingly popular in the airborne observation of large areas for many purposes, such as the monitoring of agricultural areas, the tracking of wild animals in their natural habitats, and the counting of livestock. Coupled with deep learning, they allow for automatic image processing and recognition. The aim of this work was to detect and count the deer population in northwestern Serbia from such images using deep neural networks, a tedious process that otherwise requires a lot of time and effort. In this paper, we present and compare the performance of several state-of-the-art network architectures, trained on a manually annotated set of images, and use it to predict the presence of objects in the rest of the dataset. We implemented three versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture and a Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) to detect deer in a dense forest environment and measured their performance based on mean average precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1 score. Moreover, we also evaluated the models based on their real-time performance. The results showed that the selected models were able to detect deer with a mean average precision of up to 70.45% and a confidence score of up to a 99%. The highest precision was achieved by the fourth version of YOLO with 86%, as well as the highest recall value of 75%. Its compressed version achieved slightly lower results, with 83% mAP in its best case, but it demonstrated four times better real-time performance. The counting function was applied on the best-performing models, providing us with the exact distribution of deer over all images. Yolov4 obtained an error of 8.3% in counting, while Yolov4-tiny mistook 12 deer, which accounted for an error of 7.1%.

AB  - Open-pit mining operations are hailed for safe working conditions for miners as well as economically and logistically favourable outcomes for mining companies. However, ecological impacts of these operations may persist for decades. Expansions of open-pit coal mining in British Columbia of Western Canada are planned. Governmental regulation of background contaminants leached from these mines into nearby water systems were established to mitigate environmental impacts associated with these operations. We analyzed water, periphyton, invertebrate, and American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) blood, egg, and feather samples for selenium and mercury exposure related to mining operations in the Elk Valley. We also quantified effects associated with exposure on clutch size and hatching success. Selenium concentrations in water, periphyton, and invertebrates were significantly higher downstream of mines compared to reference sites within and outside of the Elk River watershed. Selenium concentrations in water from exposed sites exceeded current regulatory levels established to protect wildlife by up to 20 times. Mercury concentrations were below toxic levels for birds in all media and did not factor into determination of selenium exposure or effects. Egg selenium concentrations were on average 0.9 times the regulatory threshold. Our stable isotope analyses showed that diets of nesting females included a negligible proportion of higher order consumers. We did not detect a significant effect of selenium on the rate of hatching success or clutch size of dippers nesting in exposed sites. We conclude that at the time of the investigation, selenium exposure was not impairing hatching of American dippers at the sampled locations.

AB  - Domesticated yaks endure as iconic symbols of high-altitude frozen landscapes, where herding communities depend on their high-fat milk, transport, dung, and natural fibers. While there is established proteomic evidence for ancient consumption of ruminant and horse milk in the mountains and steppes of northern Eurasia, yak dairy products have yet to be detected. Yak domestication and the species' dispersal from Tibet into the mountainous zones to the north are also poorly resolved due to a paucity of zooarchaeological data. To examine the potential of paleoproteomics to shed light on domesticated yak in Mongolia, we analyzed human dental calculus from Mongol era elite individuals recovered from permafrost burials in Khovsgol province, where people continue to herd yak to this day. We report the first evidence for yak dairy consumption, linked to local resource control. In addition, we confirm a large diversity of recovered whey, curd, tissue, and blood proteins, likely reflecting the excellent preservation conditions found at permafrost sites.
   Proteomic evidence from permafrost human dental calculus indicates consumption of yak milk in Mongolia as early as 1270 CE.

AB  - Ecological fire prevention forest belts can effectively alleviate the spread of forest fires and reduce the harm caused by forest fires. Exploring the distribution and changes in suitable growth areas for fire-resistant forest species under the effects of climate change can provide effective references for the introduction of ecological fire prevention and tree species preservation in the region. This study is based on the distribution data of six typical ecological fire prevention forest species in the subtropical regions of China. The maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), optimized by the ENMeval data package, was used to analyze the potential relationship between the ecological environment variables and fire prevention forest species. The potential distribution of certain tree species in the historical period and in future periods is simulated. In addition, the area changes, migration trends, and stable areas of tree species under climate change are also discussed. The research results indicated the following: (1) The AUC values of the optimized model are all higher than 0.9, indicating the optimal prediction results. (2) The climate variables that have the greatest impact on the suitable habitat of Schima superba were the annual mean temperature, precipitation of the driest month, and mean diurnal range. Quercus glauca was mainly influenced by the minimum temperature of the coldest month and the precipitation of the warmest quarter. Castanopsis eyrei was mainly influenced by the precipitation of the driest month and the annual precipitation. The distribution of suitable growth areas for Symplocos sumuntia is mainly influenced by the precipitation of the driest month. The distribution of Camellia oleifera was influenced by the minimum temperature of the coldest month. The potential habitat distribution of Photinia serratifolia was greatly influenced by annual precipitation. (3) Until 2090, the expansion degree of the suitable growth area will be Symplocos sumuntia (51.05%) > Schima superba (19.41%) > Camellia oleifera (10.14%) > Quercus glauca (6.80%) > Castanopsis eyrei (2.34%) > Photinia serratifolia (-6.97%). (4) The centroid of Schima superba will migrate northward. Quercus glauca will migrate northeast. The suitable areas for the migration of Symplocos sumuntia and Castanopsis eyrei will move in a northwest direction, with repeated changes in alum migration, as well as with the largest migration span for Castanopsis eyrei. In addition, Camellia oleifera will move southwest. The centroid of Photinia serratifolia will migrate to the southeast. (5) The six fire-resistant tree species in this study were noted to have excellent stability in Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. This conclusion can provide an effective reference for the introduction of ecological fire prevention tree species and the protection of tree species under climate change in subtropical forest-fire-prone areas in China.

AB  - Gelatinous filter feeders (e.g., salps, doliolids, and pyrosomes) have high filtration rates and can feed at predator:prey size ratios exceeding 10,000:1, yet are seldom included in ecosystem or climate models. We investigated foodweb and trophic dynamics in the presence and absence of salp blooms using traditional productivity and grazing measurements combined with compound-specific isotopic analysis of amino acids estimation of trophic position during Lagrangian framework experiments in the Southern Ocean. Trophic positions of salps ranging 10-132 mm in size were 2.2 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- std) compared to 2.6 +/- 0.4 for smaller (mostly crustacean) mesozooplankton. The mostly herbivorous salp trophic position was maintained despite biomass dominance of similar to 10-mu m-sized primary producers. We show that potential energy flux to >10-cm organisms increases by approximately an order of magnitude when salps are abundant, even without substantial alteration to primary production. Comparison to a wider dataset from other marine regions shows that alterations to herbivore communities are a better predictor of ecosystem transfer efficiency than primary-producer dynamics. These results suggest that diverse consumer communities and intraguild predation complicate climate change predictions (e.g., trophic amplification) based on linear food chains. These compensatory foodweb dynamics should be included in models that forecast marine ecosystem responses to warming and reduced nutrient supply.

AB  - Simple Summary In the fall and winter, nutrient supplies of forage cannot meet the needs of pregnant cashmere goats, and there lacks clear precise supplemental feeding for them under grazing. This study first applied "Nutrient Requirements of Cashmere Goats" to supplementary feeding for pregnant Inner Mongolian cashmere goats under grazing. Supplementation increased pregnant goat cashmere length, cashmere yield, body weight after shearing, single born kid weight, twin-birth kid weight and kids' mature secondary hair follicle density. The results demonstrated that the supplementary feeding based on the standard could enhance pregnant goats' production performance. This study aimed to conduct precise supplementation for pregnant cashmere goats under grazing based on the feeding standard. Eight Inner Mongolian pregnant cashmere goats of near-average body weight were selected at early gestation (44.41 +/- 4.03 kg) and late gestation (46.54 +/- 4.02 kg) to measure their nutrient intake. Then, two pregnant cashmere goat flocks, No. 10 (control group, on-farm supplement) and No. 11 (supplemented group, supplement based on standard), with the same goat herd structure and grassland type, were chosen to conduct the supplemental feeding experiment. The results showed that pregnant cashmere goats lacked daily the intake of dry matter, digestive energy, crude protein and most essential mineral elements under grazing. After supplemental feeding, the supplementation based on the feeding standard increased the cashmere length and cashmere length growth volume and decreased the cashmere fineness, with no statistical significance. The goat cashmere yield, goat weight after shearing, single and twin-birth kid weight and kids' mature secondary hair follicle density were significantly higher in the supplemented group (p < 0.05). In conclusion, supplementation in accordance with "Nutrient Requirements of Cashmere Goats" can enhance pregnant cashmere goats' fiber production, growth performance, fertility and kids' secondary hair follicles development, which is of great importance for the healthy and precise nutrition and management of cashmere goats.

AB  - Density estimates for animal populations often inform conservation and management decisions. Many methods to estimate animal density exist but deciding between competing alternatives traditionally has depended upon assessing multiple factors (e.g., precision, total cost, area sampled) independently and often in an ad hoc manner. Cost-effectiveness analysis is a tool that economists use to decide objectively between competing alternatives. We extend cost-effectiveness analysis to simultaneously integrate precision and per-area cost of sampling when selecting between competing techniques used to estimate animal density both after a single application of a method and across several applications of capital equipment. Our extension allows for weighting of factors that may vary with the objectives and constraints of decision makers. We apply our extension of cost-effectiveness analysis to a case study in which population density of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was estimated in 3 large management units in Indiana, USA, using 3 competing distance-sampling methods: fecal-pellet, camera-trap, and aerial sampling. The unweighted cost effectiveness of aerial sampling with color and infrared sensors was usually superior after a single application of each method and was always superior across several applications in differing landscapes. Pellet sampling was the most cost effective after a single application of each method in an agriculturally-dominated management unit. Although camera sampling has increased in popularity, the cost effectiveness of camera sampling was poorer than the other 2 methods, even when allowing for potential future innovations to streamline data processing. Cost-effectiveness analysis can be useful when selecting among competing methods for monitoring animal populations of conservation and management importance. The same principles used in our cost-effectiveness analysis can be used to decide between competing alternatives related to any ecological monitoring in addition to density estimation.

AB  - The site of Kortiktepe in southeastern Turkey is one of few sites in the Upper Mesopotamia basin that attests continuous, permanent occupation across the boundary from end of the colder, drier Younger Dryas (YD) into the comparatively wetter and warmer Early Holocene (EH). This allows for the study of the degree of environmental change experienced on a local level over this boundary as well as for the study of the adaptations that the occupants of the site undertook in response to these changes. The mammal assemblage of Kortiktepe remains relatively stable across the YD - EH transition with the main contributors to diet being mouflon (Ovis orientalis) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) in approximately the same quantities, although the contribution of aurochs (Bos primigenius) increases in the EH. The most significant changes can be seen in the shift in avifauna remains, with a sharp increase of waterbirds during the EH. It is proposed that these shifts reflect changes in the local environment with an increase in woodland cover as well as expansion of local waterways, which is generally consistent with previously published archaeobotanical studies. In terms of species exploited, mortality profiles as well as size distribution of mammals, a great deal of continuity is observed. This suggests that over this particular period the local impact of the beginning of the Early Holocene was not overly dramatic, allowing for cultural continuity of previously established subsistence strategies.

AB  - Induced anti-herbivore defences in plants can shape ecosystem structure and functions. Since these are known to be highly variable, quantifying their sources of variation remains important to understand their eco-evolutionary roles. We conducted meta-analysis of 647 experiments (paired control and treatment) from 192 studies to address sources of variation in induced anti-herbivore defensive traits. This covered different agents of herbivory (insect, mammal and clipping), studies in greenhouse and in field settings, and covered 24 types of defence traits in 163 species from 50 families across 24 angiosperm orders. We used meta-regression models-multi-level random-effects (MLREs) and robust variance estimators (RVEs)-to quantify variation due to study setting, herbivore type, chemical identity, angiosperm order, volatility, fertilization, and publication year as moderator variables. There were strong indications for publication bias in favour of large effect sizes, and studies with adequate sample size and precision were rare. Strength of induction was distributed uniformly over the phylogeny of 24 angiosperm orders. Stronger effects were reported from greenhouses than in field conditions, and induction was uninfluenced by herbivore type. Volatiles showed stronger response than non-volatiles in greenhouses for insects. Biosynthetic precursors (e.g. jasmonates) and many defensive chemicals were induced in the greenhouse, but when measured in field conditions, they were unresponsive to herbivory and appear to be constitutive. Similar to constitutive response, induced responses were also unaffected by fertilization. Direction and magnitude of induction differ greatly from previous assessments as these have also changed over time, representing natural epistemological growth. A third of the variability was explained by moderators (marginal R-2: chemical identity, angiosperm order, study setting, herbivore type and publication year); another third (conditional R-2) was attributed to the identity of individual studies and observations. Synthesis. Manipulative experiments reveal many intrinsic differences among defensive chemicals and traits. They suggest plants in greenhouses may respond very differently to herbivores from those in field conditions. Although biosynthetic pathways of chemical responses, their modes of action and their effects on herbivores are well-understood, studies with greater statistical power under ecologically relevant settings are needed to discern induced and constitutive defences in how plants respond to their natural enemies

AB  - The three members of the lecanicephalidean tapeworm family Eniochobothriidae are unusual among tapeworms in that they lack a vagina and possess a series of expanded proglottids forming a trough at the anterior end of their body. They exclusively parasitise cownose rays of the genus Rhinoptera (Myliobatiformes: Rhinopteridae). New collections from six of the nine known species of cownose rays from the waters off Australia, Mexico, Mozambique, Senegal, Taiwan and the United States (off Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina) yielded eight new species and a new genus of eniochobothriids. Here we erect Amiculucestus, gen. nov. and describe six of the eight new species - four in the new genus and two in Eniochobothrium - expanding the number of genera in the family to two and the number of described species in the family to nine. Morphological work was based on light and scanning electron microscopy. The tree resulting from a maximum likelihood analysis of sequence data for the D1-D3 region of the 28S rDNA gene for 11 species of eniochobothriids supports the reciprocal monophyly of both genera. The mode of attachment to the mucosal surface of the spiral intestine of the host was investigated using histological sections of worms in situ. These cestodes appear to use the anterior trough-like portion of their body, which consists of an unusual series of barren proglottids, rather than their scolex, to attach to the mucosal surface. Based on our new collections, we estimate that the total number of eniochobothriids across the globe does not exceed 27 species.

AB  - Leaf traits can directly reflect the adaptation strategies of plants to the environment. However, there is limited knowledge on the adaptation strategies of heteromorphic leaves of male and female Populus euphratica Oliv. in response to individual developmental stages (i.e., diameter class) and canopy height changes. In this study, morphological and physiological properties of heteromorphic leaves of male and female P. euphratica were investigated. Results showed that both male and female P. euphratica exhibited increased leaf area (LA), leaf dry weight (LDW), leaf thickness (LT), net photosynthetic rate (P-n), transpiration rate (T-r), stomatal conductance (g(s)), proline (Pro), and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, decreased leaf shape index (LI) and specific leaf area (SLA) with increasing diameter and canopy height. Leaf water potential (LWP) increased with increasing diameter, LWP decreased significantly with increasing canopy height in both sexes, and carbon isotope fraction (delta C-13) increased significantly with canopy height in both sexes, all of which showed obvious resistance characteristics. However, males showed greater LA, LT, P-n, T-r, and Pro than females at the same canopy height, and males showed significantly higher LA, SLA, LT, P-n, T-r, g(s), and MDA, but lower LWP and delta C-13 than females at the same canopy height, suggesting that male P. euphratica have stronger photosynthetic and osmoregulatory abilities, and are sensitive to water deficiency. Moreover, difference between male and female P. euphratica is closely related to the increase in individual diameter class and canopy height. In summary, male plants showed higher stress tolerance than female plants, and differences in P-n, g(s), T-r, Pro, MDA, delta C-13, and LWP between females and males were related to changes in leaf morphology, diameter class, and canopy height. The results of this study provide a theory for the differences in growth adaptation strategies during individual development of P. euphratica.

AB  - Simple Summary: Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas besides CO2; other than being a greenhouse gas, the production of methane from the rumen also causes a considerable loss of metabolizable energy. Yaks are the main livestock on the Tibetan Plateau and are well adapted to the extreme environment of the plateau. In a traditional production system, yaks graze on natural pastures throughout the year, but in recent years, with the increasing pressure on pastures, herders have also adopted the feeding method of grazing with supplemental concentrates for improving production. This study aimed to investigate the effects of supplemental feeding on methane emissions from grazing yaks during three different phenological periods in the warm season. The methane emission was evaluated using SF6 tracer technology. The results showed that during the warm season, the supplementation of a concentrate with alpine grasslands markedly lowered enteric methane emissions while enhancing dietary energy efficiency in grazing yaks. The yak industry constitutes a pivotal segment of livestock development across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and adjacent pastoral regions. Existing studies have shown that supplemental feeding for grazing yaks significantly improves meat quality and growth performance, but its effect on enteric methane (CH4) emission from yaks has never been reported, so the present experiment aimed to investigate the effect of supplemental feeding of grazing yaks on CH4 emissions in three different periods of the warm season. Thirty male yaks were randomly assigned to two groups, with 15 yaks per group, The groups were designated as the grazing group (GR), with traditional grazing methods and with an initial body weight of 94.56 +/- 3.9 kg, and the supplemental feeding group (GRS) with an initial body weight of 95.01 +/- 4.1 kg, which received 1500 g/d of supplemental feed for 120 days. The methane emissions of the two groups were measured at the late regreening period (LRP), the greening-grass period (GGP), and the browning period (BRP) using the SF6 tracer method. The results showed that GRS increased (p < 0.01) the total DMI during warm season but decreased (p < 0.01) the forage intake at the LRP and GGP, resulting in a significantly reduced methane yield per kg of BW gain and per kg of DMD in warm-season grazing yaks (p < 0.01), a significantly reduced methane production per kg of DMI and methane energy to gross energy ratio in grazing yaks during the GGP (p < 0.05), and a similarly significantly decrease in methane production per kg of DMI and methane energy to gross energy ratio in grazing yaks during the BRP (p < 0.01). In conclusion, supplemental nutrition for grazing yaks during the warm season in alpine grasslands significantly enhances growth performance, reduces methane emissions, and improves dietary energy utilization efficiency.

AB  - Classical food web theory predicts that species at the base of food webs will be more abundant than those at the top. Likewise, it's hypothesized that feeding at lower trophic positions (e.g., deriving more nitrogen from plant-based resources such as nectar or honeydew) plays an important role in the establishment, spread, and ecological dominance of invasive social insects. We tested the relationship between diet, abundance, and resource dominance using the invasive tawny crazy ant (Nylanderia fulva). We used stable isotope analysis, pitfall sampling, and attraction of ants to baits to investigate tawny crazy ant trophic position, abundance, foraging intensity, and competition with other ant species at sites across Texas, USA. Tawny crazy ant abundance varied from zero to[ 1000 ants per pitfall trap depending on site and month. Counter to our predictions, however, there was no significant relationship between tawny crazy ant abundance and trophic position. Moreover, tawny crazy ant foraging activity and numerical dominance at baits were significantly higher when ants occupied a higher trophic position. Tawny crazy ants were much more predaceous than expected, as worker delta(15) N values were often statistically indistinguishable from known arthropod predators (14/22 total observations). A review of the literature indicates that our results add to a growing body of evidence (15/24 studies) suggesting that ant abundance does not always correspond with a more herbivorous diet. Rather, other factors such as dietary flexibility and abiotic features may play a more important role in invasive ant abundance, particularly in the case of tawny crazy ants.

AB  - The body density of 16 species of flatfish was measured. Their density varied, ranging from 1.011 to 1.074 g cm-3, with benthic feeders tending to have the highest values, followed by mixed feeders and then pelagic feeders. Greenland halibut, Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, had the lowest value (1.022 +/- 0.0052 g cm-3), below the density of seawater (1.026 g cm-3), indicating that this species can swim away from the sea floor with low-energy costs. In this manner, low body density may contribute to pelagic feeding. Further study of lipid content and other body characteristics of each flatfish is expected to elucidate their evolutionary traits more clearly.

AB  - The 1 m(2) quadrat is a standard field survey tool in ecology. Traditionally, a researcher places a square frame on the ground and manually records data about organisms (typically plants) within that quadrat. Collecting data through this method can require a great deal of time on-site. For some studies, it would be more efficient to collect data as images in the field, and then extract desired data from the images later. Equipment currently available for precise aerial imaging of plants is most applicable to large-scale settings (e.g. entire fields) or controlled environments (e.g. greenhouses or growth chambers). There is a lack of technology suited to 1 x 1 m quadrat surveys of natural communities. To satisfy this need, we developed a portable, low-cost platform ('Robotany') that automatically takes a set of data samples to precisely cover a 1 m(2) field plot. The current design is optimized for taking aerial photographs of short herbaceous plants in mowed or grazed habitats, at a spatial resolution of 24 non-overlapping photographs per 1 m(2), using a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera with the lens 55 cm above the ground. Novel attachment and actuation methods allow for fast, convenient assembly and disassembly, and the waterproof frame can be disinfected with ethanol. The device was reliable and precise in its initial two summers of field testing (ca. 200 plots imaged). These images were of sufficient resolution to identify common plant taxa, and to collect information on plant size, flowering status, and damage by foliar pathogens and herbivores. The apparatus was robust to frequent disassembly, transport and reassembly. The on-site time and labour of quadrat-based field surveys can be greatly reduced with this device. For some applications, images may replace on-site (manual) data collection from quadrats. For other applications, the images may complement on-site data collection, as a digital back-up and source of additional data (e.g. high-resolution spatial mapping of plant species or traits, or types of ground cover). The Robotany is modular and can be adapted to different research needs, including replacement of the camera with a different type of sampler.

AB  - The European earwig F. auricularia L. is an omnivore that has only recently been identified as a direct, fruit-feeding pest of citrus. Here, we start to build the basic tools needed for integrated pest management for this species. We introduce a time-efficient sampling method based on small wooden boards placed on the ground, and we use them in a 2-yr survey of 93 commercial citrus blocks in California's San Joaquin Valley. Insecticides were not applied targeting F. auricularia in any of these citrus blocks. We find that F. auricularia populations are very low or undetectable in most blocks, with higher densities occurring only sporadically. To know when control measures should be implemented, we used video-monitoring of citrus tree trunks to characterize the timing of F. auricularia movement from their soil nests into the tree canopy. Movement of earwigs along the tree trunks was observed throughout our sampling period (22 March to 18 June), suggesting that control measures (sticky bands placed on trunks, or insecticides applied to trunks and surrounding soil surface) should be applied early, well before petal fall when fruit are susceptible to F. auricularia herbivory. Sticky barriers effectively reduced the vertical movement of 2 crawling arthropods, F. auricularia and the Fuller rose beetle Napactus godmanni, along citrus trunks. We failed to find any relationship between estimated F. auricularia densities and damage to maturing or harvested fruit. This highlights a set of important and still unresolved questions about the biology of this species, underscoring the need for additional research.

AB  - Invasive conservation actions that require the capture and handling of individual animals are common, but the implications for both survival and reproduction are often not studied. Across North America, most populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) are Threatened or Endangered. Maternity penning, where pregnant females are held in an enclosure until the calf is less vulnerable to predation, is one conservation action that is designed to increase population growth. Few studies have reported the influence of maternity penning on the occurrence or timing of parturition and the implications for reproduction. We quantified parturition success and dates of penned and free-ranging caribou within the Klinse-Za population of caribou found across east-central British Columbia, Canada. Parturition dates were identified using daily observations for penned caribou (n = 41) and estimated dates for free-ranging caribou (n = 27) generated using statistical modelling of GPS collar data. We related parturition outcomes to a range of ecological and environmental variables. We found that the occurrence and date of parturition did not differ between penned and free-ranging caribou. For all monitored animals there was an earlier calving date during years of higher snowfall and warmer winter weather. Our results suggested that maternity penning, a potentially invasive conservation action, did not increase or decrease the probability or date of parturition for this study population.

AB  - The endangered Greater Caribbean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus), one of the largest aquatic herbivores in the Caribbean, plays a crucial role in nutrient recycling within the ecosystem, and the study of its feeding ecology is important for its conservation. Despite several studies determining the items consumed by manatees, there remains limited understanding of their nutritional significance for the species in the Western Caribbean. This study, aimed to analyze the bromatological composition of the food components in the manatee's diet in the Mexican Caribbean across three distinct environments. We manually collected aquatic and semi-aquatic primary producers potentially part of the manatee diet in marine, brackish and riverine areas of the southern region of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Then, we analyzed them for moisture, crude protein, crude fiber, ash, ether extract, digestible nutrients, and digestible energy. We present the initial data on nutrient values in the manatee diet in the Caribbean, establishing a foundation for exploring the factors that influence spatial, temporal, and species-specific variations in nutrient content at a regional level. Our bromatological analysis demonstrated that the most nutritionally important plants for manatees, based mainly on protein content and freshwater contribution, include the seagrasses Halodule wrightii, Syringodium filiforme, Thalassia testudinum, the water lily Pontederia crassipes, and Vallisneria sp. Effective habitat management for manatees is crucial for their survival, ensuring that feeding resources are maintained in both enough quantity and high quality. Given its nutritional significance for manatees, we recommend that seagrasses in the region should be prioritized as conservation targets.

AB  - BackgroundNumerous genetic loci interact intricately to control reproduction in mammals. The oxytocin gene (OXT) is a promising candidate for reproductive traits in mammals. Previously, sheep and goats have been studied for the presence of the OXT polymorphism. As of yet, no polymorphisms have been identified in the OXT gene of Awassi sheep. Thus, this study was conducted to determine the effects of OXT polymorphism and litter size on reproductive hormones in pregnant and lactating Awassi ewes.Methods and resultsThis study evaluated 232 ewes aged 3 and 4 years (123 single-progeny ewes and 109 twin-producing ewes). Serum was collected to measure reproductive hormones using ELISA kits manufactured by ELK Biotechnology. DNA was extracted from sheep blood for genotyping and sequencing to identify variations in OXT gene (exon 2, 266 bp). Genotyping analysis revealed three genotypes within 266 bp: CC, CA, and AA. Sequence analysis revealed a novel mutation in exon 2: 188 C > A. Statistical analysis showed significant associations between the 188 C > A SNP and phenotypic traits. Twin-pregnant ewes carrying CC genotypes had higher estrogen, progesterone, and follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone levels (65.86 & PLUSMN; 3.87) (pg/mL), (6.51 & PLUSMN; 0.39) (ng/mL), and (20.22 & PLUSMN; 1.27) (ng/mL)/( 23.37 & PLUSMN; 2.14) (ng/mL) respectively, compared to CA and AA genotypes in the fourth month of twin-pregnant ewes compared to single-pregnant ewes.ConclusionsThis study found that the 188 C > A SNP negatively affected reproductive hormone levels in Awassi sheep. These findings provide breeders with a new insight into the sheep OXT gene, useful for future breeding.

AB  - Herbivore dung is a favorable substrate for growing Mucorales (Mucoromycota) fungi. However, the Mucorales community of many animals dungs is unknown, especially of animals from the Caatinga area. Furthermore, it is not known whether the gut type of these animals influences the structure of the dung -inhabiting Mucorales community. Thus, this study aimed to assess the community mucoralean fungi on herbivores dung from Caatinga and analyze whether the digestive system (ruminant and monogastric) modulate the mucoralean community on dung of animals. We found eighteen species (10 genera). Pilobolus and Mucor were the most representative genera and Thamnostylum piriforme was the most frequent species. The species richness, diversity, and evenness of fungal communities did not differ significantly between the dungs of ruminant and monogastric herbivores. The Mucorales communities on horse and donkey dung were more similar. An identification key to all coprophilous Mucorales from Caatinga is presented. This study confirms knowledge about the ecological aspects of coprophilous fungi and raises new ecological perspectives about these Caatinga microorganisms.

AB  - Subacute rumen acidosis (SARA) is characterized by decreased rumen fluid pH and impaired rumen epithelial function. In this study, the underlying molecular mechanisms of (3-glucan can alleviate SARA induced damage to yak rumen epithelial cells (YRECs), and its potential protective effects were investigated. The results demonstrated that (3-glucan alleviated the decrease in cell viability and LDH release induced by SARA. Furthermore, SARA led to mitochondrial dysfunction, including disrupted mitochondrial morphology observed through fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, increased intracellular Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species levels, reduced activity of glutathione metabolism-related enzymes in the antioxidant system, and inhibited expression of oxidative phosphorylationrelated genes and proteins. Additionally, SARA disrupted the expression of cell cytoskeleton and cell junction genes and proteins. Meanwhile, SARA induced a cellular inflammatory response, inhibited ion channel transport, activated acid-sensitive receptors, and disrupted intracellular acid-base balance. The cells were pre-treatment with (3-glucan significantly mitigated these adverse effects, maintaining normal cellular functions. The specific inhibitors Dactolisib and rapamycin, which target and inhibit the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, reversed the effects of (3-glucan in regulating the impact of SARA on the signaling pathway. The downstream mTOR signaling pathway inhibitor rapamycin reversed the effects of (3-glucan in mitigating SARA-induced disruptions in mitochondrial and cell cytoskeleton functions. In conclusion, in vitro findings suggest that yeast (3-glucan potentially regulates SARA-induced effects on mitochondrial function, cell cytoskeleton, and cell junctions by inhibiting acid-sensitive receptors and activating TLR2/PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway.

AB  - The present study aims to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics in habitat ecology and fish assemblage and determine the relationship of habitat transition and fish distribution in a large riverine-reservoir cascade system (Sardar Sarovar Reservoir part in Madhya Pradesh). This study was carried out along a 125-km riverine-reservoir interface (RRI) during 2018-2020. The study showed presence of a total of 110 fish species (104 spp. in upstream main Narmada River stretch excluding reservoirs, 56 in RRI, and 39 in Sardar Sarovar reservoir). We recorded 50 species common in upstream riverine stretch of Narmada and the RRI while RRI uniquely harbored 3 native species (Chitala chitala, Labeo boga, Salmostoma phulo) not previously reported from Narmada River stretch upstream. The similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis showed presence of S. phulo causing 27.91%, Schistura dayi (3.71%), and Rita pavimentata (3.41%) of dissimilarity among Maheshwar (S1), Rajghat (S2), Koteshwar (S3) non-confluence zone, and Kakrana (S4)-confluence zone. The analysis of data indicated disappearance of some species like deccan peninsular carp Labeo fimbriatus, Mahseer Tor khudree which was earlier reported but was absent in recent years. The statistical correlation of environmental variables with observed abundances of fish feeding guilds showed significant positive correlation with specific conductivity and total dissolved solid content of the water. The canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) indicated association among omnivorous fishes of the reservoir with water temperature; total dissolved solids; specific conductivity; total alkalinity; chlorophyll; and NO3-N. The herbivore fishes were found to be more associated with magnesium, dissolved oxygen, and phosphorus content of the water while insectivorous fishes were more associated with the silicate and transparency of the water. The abundance of omnivores species indicated dominance of generalist fish species rather than specialists in the interface region of reservoir showing conservation and ecological importance of the ecosystem. The baseline information generated on fish assemblage and ecological perspectives of the river reservoir interface and science-based management recommendations formulated in the study are critical for sustaining fish diversity, promoting fisheries enhancement, and management planning of tropical large reservoirs.

AB  - Hydrological regimes can combine with climatic factors to affect plant phenology; however, few studies have attempted to quantify their complex influences on plant phenology in floodplain wetlands. We obtained phenological information on Carex vegetation through MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data during 2001-2020, and monthly field investigation during 2011-2020. We then explored how these data were correlated with climatic factors and flood regimes in a Yangtze River-connected floodplain wetland (Dongting Lake, China). Our results showed that warmer temperature tended to advance the start of the pre-flooding growing season (SOS1), with a relative contribution of 76.1 %. Flood rising time strongly contributed to controlling the end of the pre-flooding growing season. Flood recession time and inundation duration were dominant factors determining the start of the post-flooding growing season (SOS2). Earlier flood recession time and shortened inundation duration tended to advance the SOS2. Shortened inundation duration, earlier flood recession time, and lower solar radiation tended to advance the end of the post-flooding growing season. The phenology of Carex distributed at highelevation areas was more affected by hydrology than that of Carex distributed at low-elevation areas. Thus, climatic factors strongly affect the phenology of Carex during the pre-flooding growing season, whereas flood regimes play a dominant role in determining the phenology in the post-flooding growing season. The different responses of Carex phenology to climatic and flooding factors may provide insights for the conservation and management of floodplain wetlands in Yangtze River because Carex are primary food source and habitat for herbivorous waterfowls.

AB  - Karst cave investigations in the south of Haida Gwaii have opened a small window on human and paleontological components of the early post-glacial landscape. At three cave locations (K1, Gaadu Din 1 and Gaadu Din 2) our investigations recovered a paleontological record extending from ca. 13,400 to 11,000 years ago and a small number of human artifacts dating from ca. 12,600 to 11,000 years ago. The animal bones recovered are dominated by black and brown bear remains, revealing that these caves were being used for winter dens. Other species present include deer, caribou, and salmon. Domestic dog remains with a direct radiocarbon age of 13,100 years ago are the earliest indicator of human presence from the cave assemblages, and are also the earliest known domestic dog remains reported on in the Americas. Brown bear and deer disappear from the paleontological record at the end of the Pleistocene, but other species persist into the Holocene, most of which continue to thrive on the islands to this day, with the exception of caribou which were extirpated in the early 20th Century. The stone tools that we found are predominately spearpoints and fragments thereof, which were used to hunt denning bears. Additional stone tool types from the Gaadu Din Caves reveal that they were occasionally used by humans as temporary shelters. As sea level was lower than today between 13,400 and 11,000 years ago, the caves provide an alternative target for late Pleistocene archaeological prospection that does not involve subtidal work. Our research demonstrates that karst caves on Haida Gwaii provided ecological and cultural focal points during the early post-glacial period. These caves remained sufficiently stable to preserve the residues of activities including bear denning and bear hunting. With the commencement of the Holocene, the record of animal and human use of the three caves diminishes. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the crucial role of herbivory in shaping community assembly, our understanding on biogeographical patterns of herbivory on seagrasses is limited compared to that on terrestrial plants. In particular, the drivers of such patterns remain largely unexplored. Here, we used a comparative-experimental approach in Cymodocea nodosa meadows, across all possible climate types within the seagrass distribution, 2000 km and 13 degrees of latitude in two ocean basins, to investigate biogeographical variation in seagrass herbivory intensity and their drivers during July 2014. Particularly, the density and richness of herbivores and their food resources, seagrass size, carbon and nitrogen content, as well as latitude, sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and sediment grain size, were tested as potential drivers. We found that shallow meadows can be subjected to intense herbivory, with variation in herbivory largely explained by fish density, seagrass size, and annual sea temperature range. The herbivorous fish density was the most important determinant of such variation, with the dominant seagrass consumer, the fish Sarpa salpa, absent atmeadows from regionswith lowherbivory. In temperate regionswhere herbivorous fish are present, annual temperature ranges drive an intense summer herbivory, which is likely mediated not only by increased herbivore metabolic demands at higher temperatures, but also by higher fish densities. Invertebrate grazing (mainly by sea urchins, isopods, amphipods, and/or gastropods) was the dominant leaf herbivory in some temperate meadows, with grazing variation mainly influenced by seagrass shoot size. At the subtropical region (under reduced annual temperature range), lower shoot densities and seagrass nitrogen contents contributed to explain the almost null herbivory. We evidenced the combined influence of drivers acting at geographic (region) and local (meadow) scales, the understanding of which is critical for a clear prediction of variation in seagrass herbivory intensity across biogeographical regions.

AB  - Reconstructing the historical interplay of wildlife and pastoralists in the African savannas is clouded in contemporary studies by the transformation of subsistence societies and land use changes. We draw on five decades of monitoring by the Amboseli Conservation Program to illustrate the rainfall-plant-herbivore linkages in a free-ranging wildlife-livestock system transitioning to contemporary savanna landscapes. In half a century, the coupled interactions of wildlife and livestock in the Amboseli ecosystem driven by rainfall and water sources have been severed and reshaped by farming, land subdivision, sedentism, poaching, and intensified herbivory. Livestock ranges have expanded, wildlife ranges have contracted, and overlapping spatial use has fluctuated with population sizes. In contrast, wildlife and livestock herds have been sustained where the rangelands remain open. A decrease in the mean body size reflecting a shift to small stock among pastoralists has increased species dominance, decreased diversity, and elevated biomass turnover and the probability of extreme shortfalls. In recent droughts, pastoralists have been importing food supplements to reduce drought risk and purchased livestock to restock herds, further uncoupling the rainfall-herbivore link. Our study reinforces the view that biomes worldwide are shaped at an accelerating pace by human agencies rather than endogenous environmental factors. Disputes over models of rangeland systems echo the wider debate over using natural ecosystems as benchmarks for conservation verses "gardening" nature. We argue that models of natural ecosystems fail to account for the dominant role of humans in contemporary ecosystem yet that it is possible to monitor the complex interplay of human and natural systems and interpret the changes in terms of ecological function using macroecological analysis. The key finding for conservation is the importance of space, landscape heterogeneity, social networks, and mobility in sustaining the large herbivore populations.

AB  - Juvenile survival, a fundamental parameter in the population dynamics of long-lived species, is often tightly linked to early-life body growth. Here, based on repeated mass measurements on 555 harbour seal Phoca vitulina pups marked between 1998 and 2023 in the St. Lawrence Estuary, we first characterized the shape of neonatal growth patterns of the pups using Bayesian hierarchical nonlinear models. Second, we evaluated the effect of sex on neonatal growth to better understand the development of sexual dimorphism in this species and tested for compensatory growth. Finally, we assessed the influence of local variables (wind speed, sea surface temperature, pup abundance and breeding site) during the neonatal stage on pup weaning mass. Our results showed that neonatal growth follows a Gompertz curve, characterized by minimal growth the first few days after birth, followed by a significant increase in mass until a stabilization near weaning (similar to 30 d of age). We found no sex difference in the growth pattern, but males were slightly heavier at birth than females. Larger pups accumulated more mass than smaller pups, suggesting increasing returns for greater body mass at birth but no compensatory growth. Finally, wind speed, sea surface temperature, pup abundance and breeding site did not affect weaning mass. This study provides insight into the characterization of nonlinear growth in harbour seal pups. Monitoring neonatal growth provides a tool to assess potential patterns of juvenile survival, which are important in studies of population dynamics.

AB  - The alpine meadow of Zoige Plateau plays a key role in local livestock production of cattle and sheep. However, it remains unclear how animal grazing or its intensity affect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, and the main driving factors. A grazing experiment including four grazing intensities (G0, G0.7, G1.2, G1.6 yak ha(-1)) was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014 to evaluate the soil nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes under different grazing intensities in an alpine meadow on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China. The N2O fluxes were examined with gas collected by the static chamber method and by chromatographic concentration analysis. N2O emissions in the growing seasons (from May to September) were lower than that in non-growing seasons (from October to April) in 2013, 1.94 +/- 0.30 to 3.37 +/- 0.56 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1). Annual mean N2O emission rates were calculated as 1.17 +/- 0.50 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) in non-grazing land (G0) and 1.94 +/- 0.23 kg N2O ha(-1) yr(-1) in the grazing land (G0.7, G1.2, and G1.6). The annual mean N2O flux showed no significant differences between grazing treatments in 2013. However, there were significantly greater fluxes from the G0.7 treatment than from the G1.6 treatment in 2014, especially in the growing season. Over the two years, the soil N2O emission rate was significantly negatively correlated with soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content as well as positively correlated with soil available phosphorus (P). No relationship was observed between soil N2O emission rate and temperature or rainfall. Our results showed that the meadow soils acted as a source of N2O for most periods and turned into a weak sink of N2O later during the sampling period. Our results highlight the importance of proper grazing intensity in reducing N2O emissions from alpine meadow. The interaction between grazing intensity and N2O emissions should be of more concern during future management of pastures in Zoige Plateau.

AB  - Soil heavy metals harm ecological biodiversity and human health, and quantifying the risks more accurately is still obscure. In this study, a network environ analysis was applied to quantify risks between ecological communities based on control allocation and human health risk models to calculate human health exposure risks from soil heavy metals around Greenside coal mining in South Africa. Ecological and human health risks were apportioned using PMF model. Results showed assessed heavy metals (mean) exceeded local background content with a cumulative of moderately polluted using pollution load index (PLI). Total initial risk (R-i), the risk to biological organisms from direct soil exposure, was 0.656 to vegetation and 1.093 to soil microorganisms. Risk enters the food web via vegetation and harms the whole system. Integrated risks (initial, direct, and indirect) to vegetation, herbivores, soil microorganisms, and carnivores were 0.656, 0.125, 1.750, and 0.081, respectively, revealing that soil microorganisms are the most risk receptors. Total Hazard Index (HIT) was <1 for adults (0.574) whereas >1 for children (4.690), signifying severe non-cancer effects to children. Total cancer risk (TCR) to children and adults surpassed the unacceptable limit (1.00E-04). Comparatively, Cr is a high-risk metal accounted for 63.24% (adults) and 65.88% (children) of the HIT and 92.98% (adults) and 91.31% (children) of the TCR. Four sources were apportioned. Contributions to Ri (soil microorganisms and vegetation) from F3 (industrial), F4 (atmospheric), F2 (coal mining), and F1 (natural) were 42.20%, 24.56%, 23.55%, and 9.68%, respectively. The non-cancer risk from F3 (37.67% to adults and 38.40% to children) was dominant, and TCR to children from the sources except F1 surpassed the unacceptable limit. An integrated approach of risk quantification is helpful in managing risks and reducing high-risk pollution sources to better protect the environment and human health.

AB  - Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the U.S., and acaricidal feeds administered to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have potential to disrupt blood feeding by the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. Two studies were conducted with the aim of determining an ideal formulation to deliver oral acaricides to white-tailed deer and finding the lowest fipronil dose level to effectively control I. scapularis. During formulation screening, various commercial attractants (baits) were presented to deer in large paddocks under semi-field conditions and motion-sensitive cameras were used to monitor consumption by deer and non-target species. During dose range-finding, deer were housed individually and presented a fipronil feed at one of five dose levels for 48 h (two deer untreated). At 24 h post-exposure, the deer were anesthetized, blood was drawn, and deer were manually infested with 20 I. scapularis mating pairs in feeding capsules. Tick mortality was monitored up to nine days post-attachment. Results of formulation screening indicated that loose/granular formulations were substantially more palatable to deer, relative to block formulations, and would be more effective under field conditions. Dose range-finding concluded fipronil feeds with doses of 25 ppm and higher would eliminate 100% of I. scapularis parasitizing deer. Additionally, 10 ppm fipronil feed controlled a considerable proportion of ticks, and results suggested 100% ticks could be eliminated if fipronil sulfone was present in plasma at >= 25.1 ppb. These results were paramount in developing a low dose fipronil deer feed for tick control and should provide valuable insights prior to execution of future field trials.

AB  - The mesopredator release hypothesis proposes that when top-down suppression by a larger predator (e.g. dingoes, Canis familiaris) is removed, smallermesopredators (e.g. feral cats, Felis catus) increase in abundance. Lethal control of dingoes could therefore potentially exacerbate predation pressure by feral cats on smaller prey species. We monitored the activity of dingoes and feral cats (in the absence of red foxes) in two dingo-baited areas over 16 months using 182 camera traps. First, we estimated population densities across each property and found that dingo and feral cat density were unrelated. Second, we compared daily capture rate of dingo and feral cats and found that both predators' capture rates were weakly related to environmental factors and the baiting program. Third, we analysed temporal overlap in activity of these two predators. Although both predators were nocturnal and showed 78.7% overlap in temporal activity patterns, there was a significant difference in activity peaks. Finally, while both predators were distributed across the whole study site, there was strong temporal separation within 1, 12 and 24 h periods at each individual camera. In conclusion, there was no indication of suppression of feral cat population by dingoes. The large and growing body of similar evidence suggests that calls to restrict dingo control on grounds that it will cause mesopredator releases are unsupported and highly unlikely to yield the biodiversity benefits often hoped for by proponents.

AB  - Optimal foraging theory predicts that animals maximise energy intake by consuming the most valuable foods available. When resources are limited, they may include lower-quality fallback foods in their diets. As seasonal herbivore diet switching is understudied, we evaluate its extent and effects across three Kenyan reserves each for Critically Endangered eastern black rhino (Diceros bicornis michaeli) and Grevy's zebra (Equus grevyi), and its associations with habitat quality, microbiome variation, and reproductive performance. Black rhino diet breadth increases with vegetation productivity (NDVI), whereas zebra diet breadth peaks at intermediate NDVI. Black rhino diets associated with higher vegetation productivity have less acacia (Fabaceae: Vachellia and Senegalia spp.) and more grass suggesting that acacia are fallback foods, upending conventional assumptions. Larger dietary shifts are associated with longer calving intervals. Grevy's zebra diets in high rainfall areas are consistently grass-dominated, whereas in arid areas they primarily consume legumes during low vegetation productivity periods. Whilst microbiome composition between individuals is affected by the environment, and diet composition in black rhino, seasonal dietary shifts do not drive commensurate microbiome shifts. Documenting diet shifts across ecological gradients can increase the effectiveness of conservation by informing habitat suitability models and improving understanding of responses to resource limitation.
   Using metabarcoding, we found that seasonal dietary shifts were associated with slower breeding and acacia are fallback foods for black rhino. Grass was the highest value food for Grevy's zebra. Seasonal diet shifts did not drive microbiome shifts.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare the succession of fungal community and their interaction with bacterial community during pig manure composting with different phosphate additives and further to identify microbial roles on the transformation of carbon and nitrogen (C&N) components and compost maturity. The results showed that the composition of fungal community was significantly affected by pH in composting and acidic phosphate might postpone the C&N degradation process. Network analysis showed that phosphate additives, especially acidic additives, could increase the interaction of microbial community but acidic phosphate decreased the core fungi:bacteria ratio. Redundancy analysis indicated that the interactions between bacterial and fungal communities played more roles than individual contribution of bacteria or fungi for C&N conversion of composting. Structural equation modeling suggested that bacterial community was positively directly correlated to C&N loss and the participation of fungal community significantly benefited the maturity of composting. pH exhibited a great intermediated role for driving C&N conversion, maturity, and safety of composts by regulating bacterial and fungal community in composting with phosphate addition, which suggested a fast-composting way based on pH regulation by additives.

AB  - Many species of tilapia (a collection of fish species from the cichlidae family) have biological traits that make them successful invaders. Widespread herbivory has been observed across tilapia species, however knowledge on habitat preferences and tilapia interactions with native fish food webs is limited. This study was conducted three years after spotted (Pelmatolapia mariae) and Mozambique (Oreochromis mossambicus) tilapia were detected in the Mitchell River catchment, northern Australia. Tilapia diet and habitat preferences and their trophic position in native fish food webs was determined using a combination of stomach content, stable isotope, and habitat assessment analyses. Plant material was the most abundant item in tilapia stomachs, and some stomachs also contained other items in small quantities, such as fish eggs, small shrimp, and bivalves. Some niche overlap occurred between P. mariae and native omnivore or herbivore fish species. Macrohabitat type (in-channel (no tilapia), floodplain (no tilapia), weir (tilapia present)) was related to native fish food web structure, with weir food webs showing similarities to floodplain food webs. Floodplain habitats including creeks and wetlands were also most similar to weir habitats and may therefore be most at risk of colonization as tilapia spread throughout the catchment. This study clearly demonstrated that the successful rapid invasion of these two tilapia species is linked to suitable habitat with abundant food that fuels growth and reproduction. These findings increase understanding of diet related habitat use during new tilapia invasions and trophic interactions with native species.

AB  - The attitudes of community members living around protected areas are an important and often overlooked consideration for effective conservation strategies. Around Kibale National Park (KNP) in western Uganda, communities regularly face the threat of crop destruction from wildlife, including from a variety of endangered species, such as African elephants (Loxodonta africana), common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and red colobus monkeys (Piliocolobus tephrosceles), as well as other nonhuman primates, including olive baboons (Papio anubis). These frequent negative interactions with wildlife lead many community members to resent the park and the animals that live within it. To mitigate these issues, community members around KNP partnered with researchers to start a participatory action research project to reduce human-wildlife interactions. The project tested four sustainable human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies: digging and maintaining trenches around the park border, installing beehive fences in swampy areas where trenches could not be dug, planting tea as a buffer, and growing garlic as a cash crop. These physical exclusion methods and agriculture-based deterrents aimed to reduce crop destruction by wild animals and improve conditions for humans and wildlife alike. We conducted oral surveys with members of participating communities and a nonparticipating community that border KNP to determine the impact of these sustainable human-wildlife conflict mitigation strategies on attitudes toward KNP, wildlife officials, and animal species in and around KNP. We found that there is a positive correlation between participation in the project and perceived benefits of living near KNP. We also found that respondents who participated in the project reported more positive feelings about the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the organization that oversees KNP. This research will help inform future conservation initiatives around KNP and other areas where humans and animals face conflict through crop damage.

AB  - Despite its important position close to the Isthmus of Panama, and abundance of fossil localities, the palaeoenvironment of the Falco<acute accent>n Basin in northwestern Venezuela has been understudied. The basin includes a sequence containing 6 terrestrial fossil assemblages, of which 5 are well-sampled enough for palaeoenvironmental reconstruction. Here we use these assemblages as a test case for taxon-free approaches in the Neotropics, that have been used in studies elsewhere, including dental functional traits, body mass and mesowear. Mesowear reveals browsing and grazing diets from the Late Miocene to the Late Pleistocene, and though the toxodontids (the most abundant mammalian herbivores) show a consistent browsing signal, other approaches support an environment which was largely more open than previously suggested. We find limited evidence for any dramatic climatic shift, instead finding more gradual changes in precipitation and tree cover. Ultimately, we find enough consistency in our results with those of other proxies to suggest that the methods employed here could potentially be applied to other localities in South America.

AB  - Background and AimsForage legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen through a mutualistic relationship with soil rhizobia bacteria. However, frequent defoliation stress from grazing and mowing can alter the source-sink relationship between above-ground and below-ground tissues, potentially impacting their nitrogen-fixing ability.MethodsIn this study, we evaluated the effects of defoliation intensities on nodulation, root phenotypic traits, plant biomass, symbiotic nitrogen fixation, soil available nitrogen, soil enzyme activities, and soil microbial community structure of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.). Two defoliation intensities were applied at flowering: mild (removing half of above-ground biomass) and severe (leaving only 2 cm stubble), along with non-defoliated controls.ResultsMild defoliation positively affected final shoot biomass in both legumes but had negative effects on nodulation and non-symbiotic root traits, including root biomass. The symbiotic nitrogen fixation capacity was reduced in red clover under severe defoliation stress, whereas it was unaffected in alfalfa. Soil available nitrogen content was greater following severe defoliation in red clover compared to the mild and non-defoliation, but no changes were observed in alfalfa following defoliation. Severe defoliation significantly increased soil enzyme activities of beta-1, 4-glucosidase, beta-D-cellobiosidase, and phosphatase enzymes in both legumes. Defoliation had no significant effect on shifting soil bacterial diversity or taxonomic composition.ConclusionOverall results suggest that defoliation intensity had a deleterious effect on root traits, a positive influence on C and P extracellular enzyme activities, but varied influence on the shoot growth, symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and soil available nitrogen based on the forage legume.

AB  - Seed predation by rodents relies on the abundance of available seeds and seed traits like sizes and tannin-content. Here, by tracking the fates of 2400 tagged seeds of two sympatric tree species Quercus wutaishanica and Corylus heterophylla with varying size and tannin content, we assessed rodents' preference for specific seed traits. Meanwhile, we set the ratio of large to small seeds within species as 9:1, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, and 1:9, respectively, to examine rodent behavior in response to seed relative frequencies. We found that: 1) rodents preferentially hoarded C. heterophylla seeds with lower-tannins after dispersal while Q. wutaishanica seeds with higher-tannins are more often eaten in situ or after dispersal. Peeling seed coat is an adaptive strategy for rodents to avoid high tannins, particularly for Q. wutaishanica. 2) Rodents prioritize small seeds over large ones for Q. wutaishanica whereas significant differences were not observed for C. heterophylla. Rodents commonly eat small seeds after successful dispersal and prefer to hoard larger ones over long distances. 3) Positive frequency-dependent selection was observed for both seed types. Our results suggest that the selection of seeds by rodents is determined by seed tannins and sizes, and changes in seed size frequencies could alter the interaction between trees and rodents from predation towards mutualism.

AB  - Marine megafauna occurrence was recorded in the deep-sea region bordering the abyssal plain similar to 400 km north-west of Luanda, Angola. The survey took place during an Environmental Baseline Study (EBS), prior to drilling exploration activities, with the goal of characterizing the habitat and biodiversity of the region. Offshore shipboard surveys were conducted during September 2018 in water depths ranging from 2350-3850 m. We recorded daytime sightings of marine mammals and sea turtles and at night made audio recordings using passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) methods focused on capturing the sounds of vocalizing marine mammals. A variety of species were visually detected, including the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), common dolphin (Delphinus spp.), striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba), Atlantic spotted dolphin (S. frontalis), and olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea). Acoustic click bouts similar to those made by several odontocete species, possibly including beaked whales, were recorded within the 25-48 kHz range. The humpback whale was the most frequently sighted species, accounting for 56% of mammal sightings, indicating a potential far offshore migratory habitat in this region. Most notably, right whales (probable Eubalaena australis) were visually observed. This is the first confirmed record of right whales in Angolan waters since the early 1900s. As development expands in this offshore region, these data can usefully inform future monitoring and mitigation strategies focused on minimizing impacts to wildlife.

AB  - Background Interspecific interactions among insect herbivores are common and important. Because they are surrounded by plant tissue (endophagy), the interactions between gall-formers and other herbivores are primarily plant-mediated. Gall-forming insects manipulate their host to gain a better nutrient supply, as well as physical and chemical protection form natural enemies and abiotic factors. Although often recognized, the protective role of the galls has rarely been tested. Results Using an experimental approach, we found that the aphid, Smynthurodes betae, that forms galls on Pistacia atlantica leaves, is fully protected from destruction by the folivorous processionary moth, Thaumetopoea solitaria. The moth can skeletonize entire leaves on the tree except for a narrow margin around the galls that remains intact ("trimmed galls"). The fitness of the aphids in trimmed galls is unharmed. Feeding trials revealed that the galls are unpalatable to the moth and reduce its growth. Surprisingly, S. betae benefits from the moth. The compensatory secondary leaf flush following moth defoliation provides new, young leaves suitable for further gall induction that increase overall gall density and reproduction of the aphid. Conclusions We provide experimental support for the gall defense hypothesis. The aphids in the galls are protracted by plant-mediated mechanisms that shape the interactions between insect herbivores which feed simultaneously on the same host. The moth increase gall demsity on re-growing defoliated shoots.

AB  - Plant-plant interactions via volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have received much attention, but how abiotic stresses affect these interactions is poorly understood. We tested the effect of VOCs exposure from damaged conspecifics on the production of extra-floral nectar (EFN) in wild cotton plants (Gossypium hirsutum), a coastal species in northern Yucatan (Mexico), and whether soil salinization affected these responses. We placed plants in mesh cages, and within each cage assigned plants as emitters or receivers. We exposed emitters to either ambient or augmented soil salinity to simulate a salinity shock, and within each group subjected half of the emitters to no damage or artificial leaf damage with caterpillar regurgitant. Damage increased the emission of sesquiterpenes and aromatic compounds under ambient but not under augmented salinity. Correspondingly, exposure to VOCs from damaged emitters had effect on receiver EFN induction, but this effect was contingent on salinization. Receivers produced more EFN in response to damage after being exposed to VOCs from damaged emitters when the latter were grown under ambient salinity, but not when they were subjected to salinization. These results suggest complex effects of abiotic factors on VOC-mediated plant interactions.

The present systematic review and meta-analysis shed light on the frequency and distribution of the infection in a nationwide perspective.MethodsThe review used 34 animal level datasets retrieved from 26 published articles and the pooled estimates were calculated using a random-effects model analysis.ResultsAltogether, 9690 small ruminants were examined post-mortem or by coproscopy, among which 4193 animals were infected with GINs, showing a weighted prevalence of 55% (95% CI 44-66%). Reports were documented in 12 provinces with the highest frequency in Eastern Azerbaijan (77%), Kermanshah (76.04%), and Guilan (71.62%). Moreover, the highest prevalences were estimated among goats [61% (95% CI 48-74%)] and in coproscopy [67% (95% CI 57-78%)]. The reported GINs represented 15 genera, including Haemonchus contortus, Marshallagia marshalli, Trichuris spp., Trichostrongylus spp., Ostertaginae species, Gongylonema pulchrum, Nematodirus spp., Parabronema skrjabini, Skrjabinema ovis, Chabertia ovina, Cooperia punctata, Camelostrongylus mentulatus, Bunostomum trigonocephalum, and Oesophagostomum venulosum. The most isolated nematode species in sheep and goats belonged to H. contortus [7.44% (95% CI 6.78-8.13%] and Trichuris spp. [18.42% (95% CI 16.54-20.41%)].ConclusionA considerable parasitic prevalence was calculated in small ruminants in Iran, demanding strategic interventions for better control the GIN infections and decrease the worms burden and their consequences in sheep and goat population in Iran.

AB  - Genetic diversity of organisms is an indicator of their long-term survival and can potentially be shaped by the extent of geneflow between populations. Geographical features and anthropogenic interferences can both obstruct and also facilitate animal movement, directly or indirectly. Such patterns have not been extensively studied across grasslands in the Indian subcontinent which is a mosaic of both natural and man-made topography. This study looks at genetic variation in an endemic ungulate, the Antilope cervicapra or blackbuck, throughout its distribution range. Using mitochondrial and nuclear (microsatellite) information, we find that different markers shed light on different aspects of their evolutionary history. Absence of robust geographical clustering in mitochondrial DNA indicate recent isolation in these populations, while lack of shared haplotypes between sampling locations suggests female philopatry. Nuclear data shows the presence of three genetic clusters in this species, pertaining to the Northern, Southern and Eastern regions of India. Our study also shows that an ancestral stock separated into two groups that gave rise to the North and South clusters and the East population was derived from the South at a later time period. Both microsatellite and mitochondrial data indicate that the population from the Eastern part of India is genetically distinct and the species as a whole shows signatures of having undergone recent genetic expansion. In spite of immense losses in grassland habitats across India, blackbucks seem to have well-adapted to human altered landscapes and their numbers are beginning to show an upward trend.

AB  - Parasitism is a key factor in the population dynamics of many herbivorous insects, although its impact on host populations varies widely, for instance, along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. Understanding the sources of geographical variation in host-parasitoid interactions is crucial for reliably predicting the future success of the interacting species under a context of global change. Here, we examine larval parasitism in the butterfly Aglais urticae in south-west Europe, where it is a mountain specialist. Larval nests were sampled over 2 years along altitudinal gradients in three Iberian mountain ranges, including the Sierra Nevada, home to its southernmost European population. Additional data on nettle condition and adult butterflies were obtained in the study areas. These data sources were used to investigate whether or not differences in parasitism rates are related to the geographical position and phenology of the host, and to the availability of the host plants. Phenological differences in the host populations between regions were related to the severity of summer drought and the corresponding differences in host plant availability. At the trailing-edge of its distribution, the butterfly's breeding season was restricted to the end of winter and spring, while in its northern Iberian range the season was prolonged until mid-summer. Although parasitism was an important source of mortality in all regions, parasitism rates and parasitoid richness were highest in the north and lowest in the south. Moreover, within a region, there was a notable increase in parasitism rates over time, which probably led to selection against an additional late summer host generation in northern regions. Conversely, the shorter breeding season in Sierra Nevada resulted in a loss of synchrony between the host and one important late season parasitoid, Sturmia bella, which may partly explain the high density of this butterfly species at the trailing-edge of its range. Our results support the key role of host phenology in accounting for differences in parasitism rates between populations. They also provide insights into how climate through host plant availability affects host phenology and, ultimately, the impact of parasitism on host populations.

AB  - Catechins are a group of secondary metabolites ubiquitously found in tea plants. Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate (EGCG) is the major kind of catechin synthesized through the specific branches of the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. Catechin synthesis is sensitive to environmental perturbations such as shading, high temperature, cold, drought, salinity, heavy metal stress and biotic attacks, and there has been a close relationship between catechin accumulation and plant stress tolerance. Moreover, exogenous catechin application promotes photosynthesis, plant growth, leaf development, antioxidant defense, reactive oxygen species signaling, redox homeostasis and hormone metabolism under perturbed environmental conditions. Although low concentrations of catechins exert hormetic effects, growth promotion response and stress tolerance, high concentrations of catechins induce phytotoxicity. In this article, we review the biological functions of catechins, especially EGCG from the plant perspective. We describe the effects of various stresses on catechin metabolism in plants, mainly in tea plants, and the possible biological roles that they play in plant adaptation to variable environments. We also discuss the effects of exogenous catechins on plants other than the tea plant with respect to plant growth response and adaptation to variable environments. We conclude that despite discrepancies in research findings, it is evident that catechins play a critical role in plant environmental adaptability and immune response. Thus we propose that the hormetic growth response, stress modulatory effect and immune priming properties of catechins can be exploited for enhancing crop production in an environmentally friendly manner.

AB  - Thousands of seahorses are traded every year as marine ornamental species. Although packing methods for live adult seahorses have already been addressed, there is no information on the transportation of juvenile seahorses. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the possibility of packing and transportation for newly-birthed seahorses. Three batches of newborn long-snout seahorses Hippocampus reidi were transported in three independent events from Ubatuba, north coast of Sao Paulo, to the city of Sao Paulo, covering 248 km in each trip, with an average duration of 3.5 h. A mean of 350 offspring of one day old was distributed in 1 L containers with round borders at equal densities, provided with constant aeration by portable pumps. Aeration was kept so that large bubbles would create an ascending flow keeping juveniles in suspension throughout transportation. Values of survival achieved in this study, even after 10 days post-transportation, were surprisingly high, reaching over 70%. No significant shift in water temperature, pH, or salinity was observed for any transportation events. For oxygen levels, although portable pumps were used, a drop of around 15% in DO level was recorded. In view of the trending ornamental fish market, considering the limited swimming capacity of newly born seahorses and that a great number of marine fish undergo a planktonic phase, this study provides important directions to a better understanding on seahorse transportation and yet, directions for the design of new transport methodology for an efficient shipping protocol for other species.

AB  - Herbivore grazing affects plant growth and community structure in grasslands. This effect could be directly through foraging and dung/urine return or indirectly through plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs). Addressing the grazing effect on the feedback of plants can explicate the causes of community changes in the grazing system. However, how grazing and PSF interact to affect plant growth remains unclear. Here, we conducted a classic PSF experiment. In the conditioning stage, two native plant species (a grass Bromus inermis and a legume Medicago sativa) were planted in the field with four simulated grazing treatments (ambient, mowing, dung/urine addition, and mowing + dung/urine addition) in a meadow grassland of northern China. In the feedback stage, B. inermis and M. sativa were planted in the soils (both unsterilized and sterilized) from each treatment in the field experiment. Plant biomass of M. sativa showed positive feedback while B. inermis showed negative feedback across all the simulated grazing treatments. Simulated grazing (mowing and dung/urine addition) increased the positive feedback of M. sativa, while decreasing the negative feedback of B. inermis. The addition of dung/urine to the soil was found to have a significantly stronger impact on plant growth feedback compared to the effect of mowing. Dung/urine addition enriches the soil with higher levels of available nitrogen and phosphorus. Our results suggested that legume plants should have positive PSFs while grass should have negative feedback, which might be amplified by grazing because of the dung/urine fertilization effect. Our study improves the understanding of PSF effects on plant growth and community change in grazed grassland.

AB  - One third of missing mammal species thought to be extinct have been rediscovered. Determining extinction correctly, without misinterpreting negative evidence, is difficult and takes significant effort, especially for small, cryptic species. The Morro Bay kangaroo rat (MBKR), Dipodomys heermanni morroensis, is a small nocturnal rodent suspected of being extinct. This is because it has not been seen since 1986 despite three range-wide surveys conducted between 1995 and 2012, a recent scent-detecting dog survey, and over a dozen localized surveys. Causes of decline have been reported and the primary causes are thought to be development-driven habitat loss and ecological succession. Given this, we suspect that if the MBKR is extant, then it occurs in the periphery of its historical range. We summarize a survey of the Morro Bay sandspit, an area not previously considered part of MBKR's range but that has the potential to be occupied. Inferences from the subspecies' closest relative, Dipodomys heermanni arenae, were used to inform surveys and detection probability estimates for MBKR. Visual surveys of the sandspit in areas with the greatest probability of displaying signs yielded few occurrences of possible signs. Camera traps were deployed in winter and summer at locations with possible signs, but, despite occupancy model detection probabilities of 0.88 in winter and 0.97 in summer, there were no detections of MBKR. Given detection probability estimates inferred from Dipodomys heermanni arenae, the conditional occupancy estimate that MBKR are present on the sandspit but were missed by all cameras on all nights of surveying is extremely low (5 x 10(-6)). We conclude that the MBKR is not present on the Morro Bay sandspit, at least not in the habitat where its presence was most likely to be detected. Future surveys for this small, cryptic species will need to adapt to a combination of low expected occupancy and high expected detection probability.

AB  - Simple Summary Toxoplasmosis is a significant public health issue worldwide, caused by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. It has a heteroxenous life cycle in which felines act as definitive reservoirs and a wide range of warm-blooded animals, including humans, act as intermediate hosts. Due to the complex life cycle, monitoring, prevention and control of this parasite are very difficult. A thorough analysis of the epidemiology of T. gondii in humans, animals and food as well as the risk factors associated with the infection are needed to plan adequate control strategies in a given geographical area. Based on this, an integrated approach for monitoring toxoplasmosis was developed and conducted in an endemic area of southern Italy. The main tasks of this approach were based on the following strategies: parasitological and risk factor analysis for T. gondii in livestock farms, serological and molecular monitoring in meat-producing livestock at slaughterhouses, hospital discharge records (HDRs) analysis and outreach activities. The findings of this study confirmed the spread of T. gondii infection in southern Italy with high prevalence values in ruminants and the need of valid control strategies based on comprehensive and transdisciplinary actions according to the One Health approach. Toxoplasmosis is a widespread worldwide zoonotic infection caused by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. This protozoan infection is considered one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses globally. Beyond its impact on public health, toxoplasmosis has also important veterinary implications, because it causes miscarriage or congenital malformations in livestock with negative economic impacts. An integrated monitoring programme aimed to deepen the epidemiological data on toxoplasmosis and to identify the risk factors that may favour T. gondii infections in animals and humans was conducted in an endemic area of southern Italy. The monitoring activities were based on the following tasks: (i) parasitological analysis and risk factors for T. gondii in livestock (sheep, goat, cattle and water buffalo) farms; (ii) serological and molecular monitoring at slaughterhouse in meat-producing livestock; (iii) analysis of hospital discharge records (HDRs); (iv) outreach activities (information, dissemination and health education) to farmers, vet practitioners and school-age children. The present study confirmed a very high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in livestock farms (e.g., up to 93.1% in sheep farms) in southern Italy and highlighted the potentially significant public health risk in this area.

AB  - Neighbouring plants can alter the susceptibility of high-quality focal plants to herbivores by affecting herbivore patch choice. Herbivores can use plant odour to make patch-scale foraging decisions from afar, but the actual information they rely on within complex plant odours is rarely defined. Revealing the information enabling patch choice by herbivores will provide the mechanistic link underpinning associational effects of plant neighbours arising from these foraging decisions. Here, our first aim was to test whether odour cues alone enable a mammalian herbivore to make patch choice decisions leading to predictable associational effects of neighbours on high-quality focal plants. Our second aim was then to test whether artificial odour, designed to mimic the informative odour component within the whole odour profile of low-quality neighbours, is as effective as real plants in influencing patch choice and associational refuge. We tested patch choice by African elephants, Loxodonta africana using a giant Y-maze and real or artificial plant odours as the only cues for the neighbours of a high-quality focal plant. We quantified the probability of various odour treatments being chosen in comparison with the odour of a focal plant alone. Compared with focal plants alone, we found that elephants were more likely to choose patches with the focal plant plus high-quality neighbours of the same or different species, but less likely to choose patches with the focal plant plus low-quality neighbours. We also demonstrated that an artificial subset of odours, designed to be informative, were as effective as real low-quality neighbours in influencing patch choice and hence associational refuge to the focal plant. Our results demonstrate a key role of plant odour-and specifically informative components within complex odour profiles-in patch choice decisions by a mammalian herbivore, leading to plant associational effects on high-quality focal plants. Understanding what olfactory information herbivores use when deciding which patches to visit or avoid, and how it affects focal plant susceptibility is important ecologically. Non-random patch choice will not only affect individual fitness of herbivores, but also shape plant community dynamics through impacting plant survival and recruitment. Furthermore, artificially re-creating odour information could offer a new tool to influence herbivore foraging decisions, with implications for wildlife management and conservation, including plant protection.Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions include wild animals foraging on agricultural crops, often called crop raiding. Crop raiding can result in disease transmission, poor nutrition, stress, and loss of income. Crop raiding also affects conservation because retaliatory events can result in wildlife being harmed. Around Kibale National Park, Uganda, a community action project implemented mitigation strategies that reduced crop raiding. We surveyed 95 of 106 (90%) project participant households to determine if participants perceived their health to have changed due to the project. We conducted open-ended, oral surveys during July and August 2018. Most participants said their overall health had improved (80%) and that their diet (83%), stress (82%), sleep (82%), and exposure to zoonotic diseases (64%) improved. Other benefits included income to pay medical bills and school fees. No participant reported negative effects. We found evidence that reducing crop raiding had positive implications for people's health and income stability.

AB  - Wildfires in Indonesia 2015 burnt forests in many protected areas, including remaining forests in Tesso Nilo National Park. We investigated the extent to which 2015's wildfires affect the remaining habitat and the spatial distribution of ungulates in the park by using satellite images to identify burnt and unburnt forest patches. Habitat conditions and the presence of ungulates indicated by the number of ungulate signs were compared between burnt and unburnt areas. The devastated trees at different rates depending on tree lifeform stages. Wefound that younger trees were more vulnerable to fire. The abundance of ungulates did not differ significantly between burnt and unburnt areas, but all vegetation characteristics were significantly different (Mann-Whitney U-test p-value < 0.05). We surmise that food such as new shoots or leaves, particularly at the edge of burnt areas, attracted ungulates out of unburnt areas. The remaining forest is relatively small, and the park is under continued pressure from illegal conversion, so any further loss of remaining forest as refugia will likely harm the ungulate population. We recommend that management should prioritize the preservation of remaining pristine habitat and the reduction of fire suppression, especially during the dry season.

AB  - Background and aimSoil nutrient availability, acidification associated with plant phosphorus-mining strategies, and fine root foraging all influence nutrient cycling. However, their relative impacts on microbial nutrient cycling during primary succession remain unclear.MethodsWe studied a 130-year primary succession along the Hailuogou post-glacial chronosequence in southwest China. Early-successional stages (1-3) are dominated by Hippophae tibetana, which is gradually replaced by Populus purdomii. In the climax community (stage 4), Abies fabri replaces P. purdomii. We collected rhizosphere soil, roots, and leaves from the dominant species, analyzing how phosphorus-acquisition strategies (proxied by soil pH, leaf manganese concentration and fine-root morphology) influenced bacterial nutrient-cycling gene abundance, based on 16S rRNA sequencing.ResultsRhizosphere pH and the abundance of genes encoding enzymes involved in ammonium and nitrate assimilation, denitrification and phosphorus mobilization were significantly lower for H. tibetana and A. fabri than for P. purdomii. In contrast, P. purdomii exhibited a significantly higher specific root length. Linear mixed models reveal that leaf manganese concentration was positively correlated with soil acidification. Multiple regression models show that nutrient-cycling potential was more significantly linked to soil pH than to fine-root morphology or soil nutrient availability. Structural equation models indicate that the reduced nutrient-cycling potential was indirectly associated with soil acidification through bacterial co-occurrence networks rather than bacterial richness.ConclusionSoil acidification, associated with phosphorus-mining strategies of H. tibetana and A. fabri, may inhibit microbial nutrient-cycling potential during primary succession. This highlights the interactions between plant nutrient-acquisition strategies and microbial processes in shaping terrestrial nutrient cycling.

   The burial of corpses may interfere with the succession of sarcosaprophagous fauna and forensic evaluation of post-mortem interval. For the first time in Italy, an experimental study was conducted on arthropods associated with buried pig carcasses in a rural area near Cosenza (Southern Italy). One carcass was left above the ground and five were buried: one of the buried ones was periodically exhumed to evaluate the effects of disturbance on decay processes and on arthropod fauna, and the other four were exhumed only once at given time intervals. The results revealed differences in taxa and colonization of arthropod fauna in the above ground and periodically exhumed carcasses. No arthropod colonization was detected in the carcasses exhumed only once, showing that a burial at about 25 cm depth could be sufficient to prevent colonization by sarcosaprophagous taxa.
   Burial could be used by criminals to conceal the bodies of victims, interfering with the succession of sarcosaprophagous fauna and with the evaluation of post-mortem interval. In Italy, no experimental investigation on arthropods associated with buried remains has been conducted to date. A first experimental study on arthropods associated with buried carcasses was carried out in a rural area of Arcavacata di Rende (Cosenza), Southern Italy, from November 2017 to May 2018. Six pig carcasses (Sus scrofa Linnaeus) were used, five of which were buried in 60-cm deep pits, leaving about 25-cm of soil above each carcass, and one was left above ground. One of the buried carcasses was periodically exhumed to evaluate the effects of disturbance on decay processes and on arthropod fauna. The other four carcasses were exhumed only once, respectively after 43, 82, 133, and 171 days. As expected, the decay rate was different among carcasses. Differences in taxa and colonization of arthropod fauna were also detected in the above ground and periodically exhumed carcasses. In carcasses exhumed only once, no arthropod colonization was detected. The results showed that a burial at about 25 cm depth could be sufficient to prevent colonization by sarcosaprophagous taxa and these data could be relevant in forensic cases involving buried corpses.
